<TITLE>Health Insurance</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Senate assembled in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate that the Government is about to introduce into the Senate, legislation changing health insurance. These changes will increase the cost of health insurance to members of employee based funds and will do nothing to help the elderly, as is being claimed. Big public funds will increase their surpluses by taking money from more efficient funds. People will be forced back onto Medicare, which will not help to maintain private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray that the Senate reject this legislation</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>Health Care for the Elderly</TITLE>
<PARA>Honourable the President and members of the Senate assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that,</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's population is ageing and most people require more health services as they grow older.</PARA>
<PARA> If open not-for-profit Health Funds are to be able to meet the costs of providing benefits to their older members at affordable rates, those costs need to be shared equitably.</PARA>
<PARA> Some Health Insurance organisations are being allowed to avoid meeting the health costs of sick and elderly people.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled, urge the Government to,</PARA>
<PARA> Take the necessary action to reverse rising cost trends and provide positive incentives to encourage all Health Funds to share the cost of health care for sick and elderly Australians.</PARA>

<TITLE>Home Ownership</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families</PARA>
<PARA> Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.</PARA>
<PARA> Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled require the Hawke-Keating government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many Australians out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families.</PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The main purpose of the Portfolio Bill is to amend the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) Act 1970. The amendments to the AIDC Act represent another step in the Government's on-going reform of the AIDC by further freeing the Corporation from the burden of unnecessary bureaucratic procedures while maintaining appropriate strategic controls. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this Government the AIDC has already been the subject of a number of reform measures which have allowed the Corporation to expand its role. These reforms have let AIDC provide finance for the restructuring of Australian industry and included relieving the restrictions on the use of its capital and removing Loan Council's controls on its borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA> AIDC responded well to these initiatives: the focus of its investment activities altered dramatically and AIDC has made a significant contribution towards the Government's industry policy objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1983 AIDC has experienced very strong growth. As at 30 June 1988, AIDC total assets stood at $2488 million compared with $963 million at 30 June 1983, an increase of over 250 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> However, during 1987 a restricted capital base emerged as a factor that could have jeopardised AIDC's future contribution to industry development especially in regard to its equity investment program. </PARA>
<PARA> Confronted with the capital problem, the Government examined a number of options before deciding to allow AIDC to raise equity capital from the private sector. AIDC is now in the process of establishing a listed subsidiary company that will conduct most of the loan and investment business of AIDC with up to 30 per cent of the equity being offered to the public. The necessary amendments to the AIDC Act clearing the way for the establishment of the listed subsidiary passed through Parliament in the Budget sitting last year. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the changes implemented since 1983, AIDC already conforms to a significant degree with the Policy Guidelines for Commonwealth Statutory Authorities and Government Business Enterprises (GBE). However, many of the reforms were introduced prior to the issuing of the Guidelines. Consequently, some modifications are required and in some cases the Guidelines are inappropriate given AIDC's unique role. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government has taken the view that AIDC should, to the maximum extent possible comply with the GBE Guidelines. To this end a number of reforms such as the remuneration of the Chief executive and dividend payments which bring AIDC in line with other GBEs were contained in the legislation establishing the subsidiary. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the listed subsidiary company, a balance has to be struck between allowing the subsidiary to operate as a commercial entity in the same environment as any other publicly listed company while having sufficient accountability befitting the Government's majority shareholding. </PARA>
<PARA> The intention of the GBE reforms is to to improve the efficiency of GBEs by placing them on, or at least approximating, a commercial footing. The listed subsidiary will be a fully commercial operation directed towards AIDC's statutory charter, especially AIDC's important role in developing a more internationally competitive industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be totally inappropriate for the Government to unilaterally impose, as part of a reform package, financial or strategic controls on the subsidiary. This would undermine the commercial nature of the company, jeopardise success of the company's public flotation, lower the price of the company's shares and run the real risk of negating the purpose of allowing AIDC to establish a listed subsidiary company. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes the Board of the subsidiary is the appropriate body to determine the company's corporate plan, set financial targets and declare any dividends after paying due regard to market conditions and the wishes of shareholders of which the Government is the largest. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 2 of the Bill therefore concentrates on the reform measures for AIDC itself and not on the soon to be established subsidiary. </PARA>
<PARA> To remove an unnecessary administrative burden and promote efficiency, Board members of AIDC are now to be appointed and subject to dismissal by the portfolio Minister. The grounds for dismissal have been expanded to include on-going under performance. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the GBE policy guidelines AIDC must now provide the portfolio Minister with a three-yearly corporate plan commencing 1 July 1989. Each plan will set out the objectives of the Corporation and address the overall strategies and policies that are to be followed in order to achieve the objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Each corporate plan is to contain a financial target which will outline overall financial strategies and include a forecast of revenue and expenditure. The target is to be agreed to in advance by the portfolio Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains the scope for variations to both the overall corporate plan and financial target should circumstances warrant any changes. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision of a corporate plan and financial target replaces the annual general policy statement the Corporation currently supplies to the portfolio Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with the Government's May 1988 Economic Statement on Reform of Taxation of GBEs, this Bill removes AIDC's exemption from State and Territory stamp duty effective from 1 July 1989. However, this only applies to a transaction entered into, or a document executed, on or after 1 July 1989. An advance made on or after 1 July 1989 under a document executed before that date will continue to be exempt from stamp duty. </PARA>
<PARA> AIDC operates on commercial principles. To put AIDC on the same footing as its competitors the Bill will allow the Board to recommend to the portfolio Minister an auditor of its own choice. This will have effect from 1 July 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> With AIDC having to work to a corporate plan and a financial target this Bill formalises AIDC's annual reporting requirements which will now include performance indicators against established targets. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also corrects a definitional problem that occurred in last year's amendments to the AIDC Act which cleared the way for establishment of the subsidiary company. The problem involved defining the value of assets being transferred to the subsidiary for the purposes of calculating any capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 3 of this Bill amends the Australian Trade Commission Act 1985. The proposed amendment to increase the number of Government members from one to two on the Board of the Australian Trade Commission recognises that a single government member cannot adequately represent cross-portfolio interests and concerns impacting on the Commission. In particular, the amendment will provide the opportunity to balance Government representation between domestic industry and foreign policy and trade orientations. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 4 of the Bill involves a minor amendment to the National Measurement Act 1960 which is being made to include a definition of `measuring instrument'. This is necessary because the Uniform Trade Measurement legislation is to be enacted in the States and Territories and it refers to this definition. </PARA>
<PARA> The present definition of `instrument' is inadequate. It has been redefined to cover all measuring instruments. Consequent to this, it has been necessary to define the word `component' wider than its natural meaning. </PARA>
<PARA> So that there is consistency between the National Measurement Act and the Uniform Trade Measurement, the definition of `use for trade' had to be amended in the former. </PARA>
<PARA> This opportunity has also been taken to insert the definition for a `standard of measurement' which in turn requires the definition of `material measure'. This is needed to remove the possible confusion between written standards and standards of measurement. </PARA>
<PARA> The penalties imposed under the National Measurement Act are being increased to keep pace with inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> The main purpose of the amendments of the Patents, Trade Marks and Designs Acts made by part 5 of the Bill is to enable the Commissioner of Patents and Registrars of Trade Marks and Designs to delegate statutory powers and functions to the appropriate levels of responsibility within the Patent, Trade Marks and Designs Offices. The amendments will also bring the three Acts into conformity in this regard and provide simpler and more flexible administration of various statutory functions of the Offices. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 6 of the Bill will repeal a number of unproclaimed amendments of the Patents Act which provide for the lodgment and preparation of abstracts of patent specifications. </PARA>
<PARA> While there is merit in applicants for patents being required to provide abstracts in plain English of their patent specifications, the Government's main priority for use of Patent Office resources has been focused, since 1986, on reducing the Office's backlog of unexamined patent applications. New provisions will be introduced when appropriate. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech reads as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill contains social security and veterans' affairs legislation amendments to refine programs introduced by the Government in 1988 and to correct minor drafting defects. </PARA>
<PARA> In the budget sittings last year a far-reaching housing assistance package was introduced primarily to help social security recipients renting privately. The measures included rent assistance rate increases, a rise in the rent threshold to address the greater need of people paying higher rents, restriction of rent assistance eligibility to non-home owners and rationalisation of the assessment process for board and lodging rent assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Several refinements are being made by this Bill to improve that comprehensive package. </PARA>
<PARA> The measures introduced last year are split between two different commencement dates. In the interests of efficient delivery of these important initiatives, this Bill is aligning the take-up dates. All will now begin on 13 June 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> In making changes last year to the rent assistance provisions for people in board and lodging accommodation so that only two-thirds of their costs were treated as `rent', special saving provisions enabled existing boarders and lodgers to be phased into the new arrangements. Provision was made for them to continue to receive the same amount of rent assistance they would have received before June 1989 had the higher threshold applied, until they either stop boarding and lodging or become eligible for a higher payment under the new rules. This Bill clarifies certain aspects of those saving provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The notion of `existing boarders and lodgers' is being extended to ensure that not only people already receiving rent assistance but also any who advise the Department of Social Security of their eligibility before the commencement of the new rules will be covered by the saving provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The rent assistance provisions relating to residents of retirement villages will be expanded to ensure that all married persons living apart owing to ill health will be more beneficially assessed as individuals in determining their eligibility. At present, these provisions exclude cases where a married couple is living apart for reasons of ill health but where only one of the couple is a pensioner. </PARA>
<PARA> An amendment is being made to one of the rent assistance definitions. Currently, the legislation defines `rent' for rent assistance purposes as `amounts payable every three months or more frequently'. An amendment would provide for the inclusion in the definition of regular payments in the nature of rent. This will have the effect of extending eligibility for rent assistance to people who pay amounts on a regular basis which are clearly rent although they may be paid less frequently than three monthly-for example, annual rents for caravan sites, boat moorings or some retirement villages. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also makes further improvement in the equity and effectiveness of payments to Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1988 May Economic Statement announced the integration of all family payments. This was largely achieved by the Social Security Legislation Amendment Act 1988. To consolidate the integrated payment cycle, the Government proposes minor and consequential amendments in the areas of payment of arrears and cessation of payment. </PARA>
<PARA> One of these amendments is to bring the family allowance supplement (FAS) provisions into line with those for family allowance in allowing up to four weeks' arrears to be paid for a newborn baby, provided the claim is lodged within four weeks of the baby's birth. </PARA>
<PARA> The FAS provisions are also to be brought into line with those applying to other family payments for the purpose of cessation of payment of pension, benefit or allowance. This will be done by concentrating all the cessation provisions in one reference in the Act. The operation of the formula which applies to the reassessment of the FAS rate following a substantial increase in income will be clarified. This will be achieved by deleting a reference to `125% of' the income threshold as the basis for the recalculation-the intention is that the flat income threshold be used. </PARA>
<PARA> The first of two minor amendments to the child disability allowance (CDA) provisions is to make it clear, by reinstating a reference to the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act, that CDA is not payable where a child in an institution attracts certain payments, including handicapped child's benefit, under that Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, it is being made clear that qualification for CDA is preserved even where family allowance, which is usually a prerequisite for CDA, is no longer paid because the child has been admitted to an institution for a period. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year an income test for maintenance income was introduced. It applies in addition to the long-standing test on general income for all means tested pensions and benefits. A small technical amendment to the maintenance free area component of the new income test is required to remove an anomaly in the splitting of the free area between married clients. </PARA>
<PARA> As announced in the Treasurer's April Statement, an additional waiting period is to be inserted for unemployment or sickness benefit for people who receive payments for annual leave on termination of employment. This will be over and above the usual seven day waiting period. </PARA>
<PARA> The new waiting period will be the same as the period of annual leave for which the payment is due, up to a maximum of four weeks. This extended waiting period is a more accurate reflection of a person's need for support in such circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Two minor corrections are also to be made to the existing waiting period provisions as they apply to unemployment benefit. An existing reference to a period of three months will be revised to read 13 weeks. This reference covers a particular circumstance in which the waiting period may be waived. The amendment provides equal treatment regardless of the number of days in a month and is consistent with adjacent references. Special benefit is to be included in the list of benefits which entitle a former long-term beneficiary to a waiver of the waiting period on reclaiming within the requisite period. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also has provisions to promote a fair and efficient system for dealing with certain debts due to the Commonwealth arising from prosecution action. </PARA>
<PARA> Where a person is convicted of an offence under the Social Security Act, a Court may, as well as imposing a penalty for the offence, order him or her to pay back any incorrectly paid entitlement resulting from the act, failure or omission for which the conviction was made. This is known as a reparation order. </PARA>
<PARA> The only mechanism available to enforce such a debt is through picking up the relevant State or Territory laws on the enforcement of fines. Differences between these laws have resulted in disparities in the treatment of Federal offenders wo have been ordered to pay reparation. Where they are not treated as civil debtors, these people may become embroiled in criminal recovery procedures with the possible consequence of imprisonment in default. Such results should be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> By inserting a ruling that reparation orders are to be enforced as civil judgments, this Bill, along with complimentary amendments being made to the Crimes Act, makes sure that any order will be dealt with as compensation for loss rather than as a punishment. The risk of imprisonment for default will be eliminated and all Federal offenders will be treated consistently. Furthermore, enforcement will be at the discretion of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The remainder of the Bill deals with a series of technical amendments and name changes. </PARA>
<PARA> These include amendments to various references in the legislation to certain prescribed educational schemes for Aborigines to reflect the decision to change their names as from 1 January this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The former Aboriginal Secondary Assistance Scheme and Aboriginal Study Assistance Scheme have been replaced by one comprehensive program, known as ABSTUDY, which encompasses both secondary and tertiary elements, known respectively as ABSTUDY Schooling and ABSTUDY Tertiary. </PARA>
<PARA> Another amendment is to state correctly the name of the Air Force Emergency Force as it appears in the provision which exempts participants from the work test requirements for unemployment benefit. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Air Navigation Act 1920. As the legislation currently stands, under section 13 of the Act, if the Minister wishes to take action against the licence of an international airline, then the only action he or she can take is to suspend or cancel the licence. This means suspending or cancelling all services operated on all routes that the airline has under its licence. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendment will give the Minister the power to vary the licence which will mean the Minister has available a number of options which are much less severe than cancelling or suspending the licence. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, these options will allow the Minister to selectively vary the number of flights, the type of aircraft and the routes the foreign airline operates to and from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for this power has arisen because of instances where another country has taken detrimental action against Qantas or where Qantas has been affected by anti-competitive practices by other countries and their airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> In such cases, the existing powers of cancelling or suspending a licence would be too severe and could well result in a negative effect on broader bilateral relationships, as well as significantly impacting on the flow of tourism to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore necessary in such situations for the Government to have a more moderate, graduated and realistic means of bringing countervailing pressure to bear. This is exactly what the amendment seeks to provide in the form of legislative and regulatory powers which match those of Australia's bilateral aviation partners. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, most of our major bilateral aviation partners have powers, in addition to suspension and cancellation, to alter, modify, amend, vary or limit the airline licences they issue to carriers flying to and from their territories. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment to the Act is also necessary to support changes to the Air Navigation Regulations (regulations 106b and 106c) which came into operation on 21 December 1988, giving the Secretary to the Department of Transport and Communications the power in certain circumstances to vary, cancel or suspend an approved timetable of an international airline of a foreign country. An international airline licence is issued in accordance with such timetables as are approved from time to time by the Secretary to the Department of Transport and Communications. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to compliance, I do not believe there will be any difficulties in this regard. Under our bilateral air services agreements, the airlines are required to comply with Australian domestic laws and regulations while operating in Australian territory. Conversely, of course, Qantas is obliged to comply with the respective domestic laws and regulations of overseas countries while operating in their territories. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the powers sought under this amendment to the Act are, as I have said, designed to match the powers overseas countries already have. In this regard what we are seeking is even-handed and will not lead to action on our part which would compromise or weaken the ability of our carrier, or the ability of foreign carriers flying to Australia, to compete on a fair and equal opportunity basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>CUSTOMS AND EXCISE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 1989</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is an omnibus measure, proposing amendments to the Customs Act 1901, the Excise Act 1901 and the Customs Administration Act 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal amendments in the Bill relate to the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme, and implement changes to that scheme to improve its administration and correct some anomalies in the coverage of activities eligible for rebate announced by the Government on 3 March 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme provides a rebate of either customs or excise duties, at varying rates, for diesel fuel purchased for specified categories of off-road uses, namely in mining, in primary production, in residential premises and in medical institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Clauses 7 and 17 of the Bill amend the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme Legislation to give the Comptroller-General of Customs authority to waive recovery of overpayment of rebated duty in certain circumstances. These are where the Australian Customs Service has initially allowed the payment of a rebate in respect of a particular type of off-road activity but, as a result of a subsequent court or Administrative Appeals Tribunal decision, or legal advice provided to Australian Customs Service, it is apparent that rebate should not have been paid. Currently, the Australian Customs Service is obliged to recover the full amount of rebate in such circumstances. In most of these cases, the claimants have acted in good faith and recovery action would cause financial hardship. In such circumstances, the Government considers it unreasonable to seek recovery of the rebates paid, other than in cases of fraud or where the rebate was not payable but was nevertheless knowingly or recklessly obtained. The amendments proposed will provide this sensible flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme Legislation are also proposed to allow the payment of rebate where duty is paid subsequent to the purchase of the fuel. Under the present legislation, to obtain a rebate, duty must have been paid prior to the purchase of diesel fuel. Anomalies have arisen where otherwise eligible users have been denied a rebate because fuel they had purchased for duty-free use (e.g. to power a fishing vessel on an international voyage) is later directed to a dutiable use (e.g. where the fishing vessel is used in domestic waters) and duty is paid subsequent to purchase. </PARA>
<PARA> At the request of a large number of claimants, Clauses 8 and 18 propose to amend the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme Legislation to allow claimants to offset a rebate entitlement against any liability arising in relation to the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the Government has also decided to remove some anomalies in the coverage of certain off-road activities eligible for rebate. For all diesel fuel used after 3 March 1989:</PARA>
<PARA> operations connected with the dressing or beneficiation of minerals (or ores bearing minerals) that are carried out in, or at a place adjacent to, the area in which the dressing or beneficiation occurs as an integral part of operations for the recovery of minerals or ores bearing minerals (e.g. such as the construction of beneficiation plants, leech dams, etc.) will now become eligible for rebate. </PARA>
<PARA> For fishing operations, the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme will be amended to make eligible for rebate operations such as outward voyages by dedicated mother ships, gear trials, voyages to and from a port for refit and fish farming. The Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme will also be amended to clarify that rebate is not available for recreational, sporting or tourist fishing operations. </PARA>
<PARA> For forestry operations, the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme will be amended to make eligible for rebate certain road making and maintenance operations in a forest or plantation which are integral to eligible forestry activities. In addition, the milling of timber at a chipmill that is not situated in a forest or plantation, and the transporting of timber from the forest or plantation to that chipmill are now eligible activities. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, these amendments to the scheme will apply to all diesel fuel used after 3 March 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that these amendments to the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme will add to its efficiency and equity. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The removal of certain anomalies in the coverage of activities eligible for diesel fuel rebate under the scheme, effected by Clause 5 of the Bill, is expected to result in additional outlays per annum of $20 million, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> the additional fishing operations now eligible under the scheme will cost $5 million,</PARA>
<PARA> the additional forestry operations now eligible under the scheme will cost $3 million,</PARA>
<PARA> the additional mining operations now eligible under the scheme will cost $12 million. </PARA>
<PARA> The remaining provisions of the Bill have no direct financial impact. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate and table its accompanying explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, which is now before the Senate, contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, clause 3 of the Bill amends section 26 of the Act to complement:</PARA>
<PARA> Changes made to the beer provisions of the Excise Tariff Act; and</PARA>
<PARA> Changes set out in Schedules 5 and 7 to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Schedule one, operative on and from the 1st of January 1988 contains the following amendments:</PARA>
<PARA> A change to reduce the rate of duty on embroidery kits from 25 per cent to 15 per cent as part of the new textiles, clothing and footwear arrangements;</PARA>
<PARA> Minor technical changes to rules 5 and 6 of the general rules for the interpretation of the harmonized system; and</PARA>
<PARA> A change to item 42A in Schedule 4 to accord with the tariff classifications set out in Schedule 3 to the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Schedule two, operates on and from the 1st of July 1988, and contains:</PARA>
<PARA> An amendment to remove the 2 per cent revenue duty applying to chemically pure fructose; and amendments to the rates of duty applying to certain wallpaper and similar wall coverings, yarn of jute and certain textile hosepiping and similar textile tubing. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments reflect the Government's decisions on the chemicals and plastics industries, the post-1988 TCF arrangements and the 1988 May economic statement. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedule 3 restores assistance arrangements to local production of certain spray heads. The new rate results from an Industries Assistance Commission recommendation on these goods and came into operation on 14 October 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedule 4 operates on and from 25 January 1989 and implements the IAC's recommended rate of free for transport containers. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedule 5 clarifies the Government's policy that topped crude oil for use other than as a refinery feedstock is subject to duty at a rate equivalent to that applying to fuel oil. Topped crude oil used as a feedstock remains duty free. </PARA>
<PARA> This clarification is necessary following a recent decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and operates from 16 February 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedule 6, operative on and from 1 March 1989, contains minor adjustments to the assistance arrangements for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. These have been made following consultation with the industries and:</PARA>
<PARA> Allow concessional entry to certain carpets and floor coverings made by non-powered tufting machines held in the hand; and</PARA>
<PARA> Facilitate the importation of non-certified industrial crafts imported before the 1st of September 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>the Schedule also reduces the rate of duty applying to industrial overalls of New Zealand origin from 20 per cent to 10 per cent. This latter action is necessary to comply with the Australia New Zealand closer economic relations-trade agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, Schedule 7 which operates on and from 1 July 1989, contains amendments to:</PARA>
<PARA> Provide a free rate of duty for gaseous hydrocarbons of heading 2711. This amendment arises out of the IAC's report on certain petroleum products-taxation measures;</PARA>
<PARA> Restore the rate of duty of 15 per cent to coated Kraft paper and paperboard of subheading 4810.3 in accordance with the Government's decision on the pulp, paper, paper products and printing industries;</PARA>
<PARA> Implement the Government's decision on the tobacco growing and manufacturing industries, announced in November 1988; and</PARA>
<PARA> Provide a new concession for certain imported goods used in the production of excisable goods. This change complements amendments to the Excise Tariff Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Anticipated revenue losses from the changes affecting transport containers are minor</PARA>
<PARA> Approximately $300,000 in a full year</PARA>
<PARA> Approximately $165,000 for the balance of 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> However, this will be more than offset by the substantial reductions in costs to the shipping industry. Savings are estimated to be in the order of $9 million for a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> The measures relating to topped crude oil clarify existing Government policy and as such should not increase or decrease revenue. Without the proposed amendment potential exists for revenue erosion exceeding $14 million per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> The remaining measures in the Bill are expected to have minimal financial impact. </PARA>
<PARA> Details of the amendments contained in this Bill have been included in an explanatory memorandum which has been circulated for the information of honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to incorporate into the Act previously notified excise tariff alterations which: decrease excise duty rates on low-alcohol beer; alter the excise duty on naturally occurring liquefied petroleum gas (LPG); and impose excise duty on topped crude petroleum oil, where that petroleum oil is for use otherwise than as refinery feedstock. </PARA>
<PARA>Reduction of Excise Duty on Low-Alcohol Beer</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 4 of the Bill decreases the excise duty on low-alcohol beer, following the Government's announcement during the August 1988 Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The reduction is effected by providing that the excise is to be calculated on the alcohol content by which the volume of alcohol of the beer exceeds 1.15 per cent. Thus, the greater the amount of alcohol in the beer, the more excise duty is payable on it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the Government's hope that, by calculating the excise duty proportionately in relation to its alcohol content, some progress will be made in discouraging excessive alcohol consumption. Alternatively, it will recoup in an equitable manner the social costs of such excessive consumption. </PARA>
<PARA> The threshold of 1.15 per cent is to ensure that beers with alcohol contents of 1.15 per cent or less (i.e. ultra-light beers), which were free from excise prior to the Government's announcement in the 1988 budget, remain free from excise. </PARA>
<PARA>Liquefied Petroleum Gas</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to clause 5, which decreases the excise duty for liquefied petroleum gas. The excise duty for naturally-occurring LPG is adjusted six-monthly on 1 April and 1 October each year in accordance with the Government's LPG excise policy announced in April 1980. The excise rate is calculated as 60 per cent of the amount by which the realised price for naturally occurring LPG exceeds $147 a tonne. The realised price is based on the weighted average of the prices received from exports and local sales of LPG during the immediately preceding 6 months. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the petroleum excise arrangements introduced from 1 July 1987, LPG produced from onshore fields is exempt from excise, so the excise now only applies to offshore fields-that is, Bass Strait. No excise is payable on refinery-produced LPG. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 5 of the Bill will amend the excise rate with effect from 1 October 1988, from $15.39 to $6.25 a kilolitre, a decrease of $9.14 from the previous rate set on 1 April 1988. The decrease reflects the lower export prices obtained for LPG over the six months to September 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>Topped Crude Petroleum Oil</PARA>
<PARA> The amendment proposed in clause 6 alters the excise duty on topped crude petroleum oil, by reference to the intended purpose for which that oil is entered for home consumption. With effect from 15 February 1989 topped crude petroleum oil intended for use other than as a petroleum refinery feedstock will attract an excise duty rate of $0.04644 per litre. </PARA>
<PARA> Traditionally, topped crude petroleum oil has been used exclusively as refinery feedstock, and the rationale for the free rate of duty hitherto applicable to that petroleum oil has been that such a rate keeps production costs at a minimum in what is after all a process in the production of another product on which excise duty is collected. </PARA>
<PARA> However, topped crude petroleum oil can be identical in specifications to certain grades of fuel oil which are subject to both customs and excise duty. Recently, cases have come to light where topped crude oil has been imported for use, not as refinery feedstock, but rather as a substitute for fuel oil, resulting in a loss of revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the Government is acting to stop the revenue leakage caused by this substitution practice, by confining the duty-free entry of topped crude petroleum to that oil which is intended for use as refinery feedstock only. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, clause 3 proposes a technical change to the Act, by repealing section 6g of the Act, to change the point in time (but not the rate) at which the industry protection element of customs duty is payable on goods imported for the purpose of the manufacture of excisable products. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA>(A) Decrease in excise duty rates on low-alcohol beer</PARA>
<PARA> This is a budget measure announced as part of the August 1988 budget, and is estimated to produce a decrease in revenue of $400 million in 1988-89 (comprising decreased excise duty of $730 million and increased sales tax of $330 million);</PARA>
<PARA>(B) Decrease in excise duty rates on LPG</PARA>
<PARA> The 1 October 1988 decrease in the excise rate for naturally occurring LPG is estimated to result in a decrease of $10.7 million in excise receipts in 1988-89;</PARA>
<PARA>(C) Amendments relating to topped crude petroleum oil</PARA>
<PARA> The amendments relating to topped crude petroleum oil are estimated to produce a savings to revenue of $14 million in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1989</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill amends the taxation laws in a number of respects and in addition will remove some 180 pages of redundant provisions of the income tax law. </PARA>
<PARA> Three outdated tax-related Acts will also be removed from the statute books. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains measures to apply after today to specifically tax gains and allow a deduction for losses on the disposal of traditional securities. </PARA>
<PARA> As announced on 22 November 1988, the exemption from capital gains tax for a taxpayer's sole or principal residence is to be extended to make sure that it covers those residing in retirement villages and the like. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill extends the exemption from income tax of maintenance payments received by a wife or former wife to maintenance payments received by a spouse, former spouse, de facto spouse, former de facto spouse or by or on behalf of a child. </PARA>
<PARA> Other amendments in the Bill ensure that a minor who is in receipt of a child disability allowance or is a disabled child will not be subject to the special anti-avoidance measures that deal with the unearned income of unmarried minors. </PARA>
<PARA> The level of beneficiary rebate for 1988-89 will be increased from $260 of $262. </PARA>
<PARA> Gifts to funds for the relief of persons affected by the earthquakes in Armenia and to the Australian Ireland Fund are to be allowable income tax deductions. </PARA>
<PARA> The taxation secrecy provisions are to be amended to allow the Commissioner of Taxation to disclose tax information to specified law enforcement agencies in certain circumstances, and to the Australian Customs Service. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill makes some minor technical amendments to the tax laws. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to a more detailed discussion of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Redundant Provisions</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is conscious of concerns expressed over the volume and complexity of tax legislation with which taxpayers, tax administrators and other users must cope. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of this legislation has been directed at curbing the excesses of the tax avoidance era that we inherited in 1983, and at creating a fairer taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of this overall process, the Government is committed to improving the tax laws and to responding to constructive criticism of these laws. </PARA>
<PARA> In that vein, this Bill will slash some 180 pages of redundant provisions from the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. </PARA>
<PARA> Further changes of this kind will follow. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable Senators will also continue to see the adoption of a simpler drafting style in new tax laws, and the gradual revision of their provisions that could be expressed more clearly. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be remembered, however, that all developed countries have complex laws-including tax laws-which necessarily reflect the complexity of commercial affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, some laws must be complex, if only because those out to exploit them do not shy from complexity in what they do. </PARA>
<PARA> This ongoing process of law improvement, which will involve consultation with practitioners and industry groups, will ensure continuing progress in a key element of our tax reform program. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole Australian community can only benefit from this initiative. </PARA>
<PARA>Taxation of Traditional Securities</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill introduces new rules to apply after today for the taxation of traditional financial securities not being securities issued at a discount to which the accruals provisions of Division 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 apply. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the existing law certain gains and losses on the disposal or redemption of traditional securities are dealt with under the capital gains and capital losses provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill excludes from the operation of those provisions gains or losses on the disposal or redemption of traditional securities acquired after today. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead, under specific measures included by this Bill, the future tax treatment of gains and losses on the disposal or redemption of traditional securities will be dealt with under the general income tax law. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments will result in a small but unquantifiable gain to revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>Capital Gains Principal Residence Exemption</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will give effect to the proposal announced on 22 November 1988 to extend to units in retirement villages and similar accommodation the exemption from the tax on capital gains for a taxpayer's sole or principal residence. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment will apply from 20 September 1985, the date of first effect of capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Maintenance Payments</PARA>
<PARA> The income tax exemption available for periodical payments of maintenance received from a husband or former husband will be extended to include payments received, on or after 1 July 1988, from a wife or former wife, or by a person from a de facto spouse or former de facto spouse. </PARA>
<PARA> Periodical payments of child maintenance received by or on behalf of a child will also be exempt from tax. </PARA>
<PARA> A related measure will ensure that an income tax deduction is not available for expenditure or payments in respect of maintenance of a spouse, de facto spouse, or a family member under 16 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA> The annual cost to revenue of these amendments is estimated to be $100,000. </PARA>
<PARA>Taxation of Unmarried Minors</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will amend the special provisions dealing with the unearned income of unmarried minors which is taxed at the top rate of personal tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes take account of an amendment of the Social Security Act 1947 which replaced the handicapped child's allowance with the child disability allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments made by this Bill will ensure that a minor in receipt of a child disability allowance or who is certified by a medical practitioner as being a disabled child will not be subject to the special provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments cover all payments of the new allowance, which began on 15 November 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>Beneficiary Rebate</PARA>
<PARA> A small adjustment, from $260 to $262, is being made to the level of the beneficiary rebate available for certain single taxpayers in 1988-89, so that no tax will be payable on taxable incomes up to $6,192. </PARA>
<PARA> The rebate will shade-out where taxable incomes exceed the $6,192 threshold and will shade-out completely where a person's taxable income is $8,288 or more. </PARA>
<PARA> This adjustment, which ensures that persons wholly dependent on specified Commonwealth benefits or allowances do not pay income tax, is estimated to cost $200,000 in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA>Gifts</PARA>
<PARA> As announced on 16 December 1988, gifts to a public fund for the relief of persons affected by the earthquakes in Armenia made on or after 8 December 1988 and before 1 July 1989 will qualify for tax deduction. </PARA>
<PARA> The revenue cost of this proposal is estimated at $500,000 in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> Gifts to the Australian Ireland Fund will qualify for tax deductability from today at a cost of $50,000 in a full financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>Access to Taxation Information</PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to the taxation secrecy provisions contained in this Bill will permit the Commissioner of Taxation to provide taxation information to certain law enforcement agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> The authorised law enforcement agencies are the Australian Federal Police, State and Northern Territory police forces, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the National Crime Authority and State and Territory Corporate Affairs Commissions. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation contains tight controls on the use that may be made of any information provided by the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments will allow the Commissioner to disclose taxation information to authorised law enforcement agency officers only where he considers that the information is relevant to establishing whether a serious offence-that is, an indictable offence-has been committed. </PARA>
<PARA> The information may only be used for intelligence purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments also allow the Commissioner of Taxation to release taxation information relating to a person convicted of a serious offence for evidence purposes for a post conviction proceeds of crime proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner will be required to disclose in his Annual Report to this Parliament, in respect of each broad category of offence, the number of requests for information by each law enforcement agency and the number of occasions on which information has been provided to each agency. </PARA>
<PARA> The taxation secrecy provisions are being further amended to permit the Commissioner to provide taxation information to the Comptroller-General of Customs. </PARA>
<PARA> The requirements of secrecy applying to taxation officers and other persons privy to confidential taxation information will, of course, extend to persons to whom taxation information can be communicated under these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the Explanatory Memorandum, which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>INCOME TAX (INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS) AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased to introduce this Bill, which will provide legislative authority for the entry into force of a comprehensive double taxation agreement with the People's Republic of China. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will insert the text of the agreement into the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act 1953 as a schedule to that Act. </PARA>
<PARA> This agreement substantially accords with the other comprehensive taxation agreements concluded by Australia in recent years. The Government believes it will contribute positively to the strengthening of trade, investment, and wider relationships between Australia and China. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreement was signed on 17 November 1988, at which time details were announced and copies of the agreement were made publicly available. </PARA>
<PARA> It deals with all substantial forms of income flowing between both countries, apart from profits on international air transport operations covered by the existing Chinese Airline Profits Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> A particular feature of the agreement is that it provides for ``tax sparing'' credit relief to be extended by Australia for tax forgone by China under specified development incentives for the encouragement of foreign investment. </PARA>
<PARA> Where income derived by an Australian resident taxpayer has benefited from one of the nominated development incentives, the agreement calls for a tax credit to be allowed as if the Chinese tax forgone had been paid. </PARA>
<PARA> By this means, the Chinese development incentives will retain their attractions for Australian investors as they will not be effectively negated by the imposition of Australian tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I note here that the agreement was negotiated on the basis of the existing income tax laws of the respective countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises that aspects of proposed changes to Australia's general foreign tax credit system, which have been foreshadowed as applying from the beginning of the 1990-91 income year, could affect the practical operation of the tax credit provisions of the agreement, including the tax sparing mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, proposed income tax exemptions under our domestic law for certain dividend payments and branch profits derived by Australian companies from comparable tax countries are likely to provide at least as great relief from Australian tax, and would operate in relation to such income from China. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreement will enter into force when all necessary constitutional processes are completed both by Australia and China. This Bill, when assented to, will complete the processes required of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreement is not expected to have any significant effect on the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> I table the explanatory memorandum on the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> May I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will amend the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act to give effect to the Treasurer's announcement of 13 February 1989 that only bottles that are for repeated use in marketing alcoholic beverages qualify for exemption from tax on their initial acquisition by a brewer or wholesaler of such beverages. </PARA>
<PARA> To achieve this, the Bill will remove containers used for marketing alcoholic beverages from the scope of items 94 and 94a of the First Schedule of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, these provisions exempt from sales tax bottles and jars that bear a moulded notification that they remain the property of their supplier. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also modify exemption item 95 which applies to bottles for repeated use in marketing non-alcoholic drinks. </PARA>
<PARA> That item will now also operate to exempt, at the time they are first acquired by a manufacturer or a wholesaler, bottles for repeated use in marketing alcoholic beverages. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of such bottles, together with costs associated with their recovery and preparation for reuse, will be included in the sale value of the beverage on which sales tax is payable. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill will extend parallel treatment to beer kegs. </PARA>
<PARA> This will remedy a situation under which beer kegs became exposed to potential double taxation since beer first attracted sales tax on 24 August 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment will apply from that date so that affected taxpayers may obtain refunds of overpaid tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the Explanatory Memorandum, which contains a more detailed explanation of the provisions of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>INCOMES TAX (ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE STATES) REPEAL BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will give effect to the Treasurer's announcement of 12 March this year that the Government would repeal the Income Tax (Arrangements with the States) Act 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> It will also make a number of consequential amendments to the income tax law to dismantle the mechanisms that authorise the Commissioner of Taxation to administer State income tax laws. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the legislation we are acting to repeal today constitutes the last relic of the Fraser Government's ill-fated `New Federalism'. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation enabled each State, if it so chose, to legislate to increase personal income taxes or to give-at a cost to that State-a rebate on personal income tax to its own residents. </PARA>
<PARA> No one would be surprised to learn that no State has taken up the option of imposing its own separate income tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality has been that none has been prepared to risk the political odium of doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> To all intents and purposes `New Federalism' was dead long ago. </PARA>
<PARA> However, recently the Federal Opposition has taken steps to revive it. </PARA>
<PARA> Two months ago the then Shadow Finance Minister-in remarks consistent with the policy outlined in the Opposition's Future Directions Manifesto-foreshadowed his intention of encouraging the States to impose their own income taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> In the event, he was over-ruled by the former Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> However, given recent changes in the Opposition's leadership, the Government's determination to repeal this law has re-doubled. </PARA>
<PARA> Already the new Opposition leader has appointed the former Finance Spokesman as acting shadow Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> From such a position it is reasonable to conclude he will return to his agenda of double income taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> Our concern has also been heightened by the Opposition Leader's unambiguous endorsement of the Future Directions document at his Tuesday Press Conference following his election. </PARA>
<PARA> That endorsement leaves up in the air the former Opposition Leader's repudiation of the double taxing proposal incorporated in that document. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Government is determined to remove this legislation from the statute books to ensure that no backdoor method be left which would enable a future administration to impose a second layer of personal income tax upon the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> If any future Government wishes to pursue this course it will now have to do it out in the open-not by reactivating a relic of the Fraser years. </PARA>
<PARA> We are strongly of the view that far from being a step towards more responsible Government, States' income tax powers would instead threaten the entire thrust of macroeconomic reform in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has already made enormous progress in cutting back Government spending and reducing the size of the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth outlays as a proportion of GDP have been reduced from more than 30 per cent of GDP in 1984-85 to about 25 per cent this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> Further reductions in the outlays ratio are already cemented into place for future years. </PARA>
<PARA> The forward estimates show that by 1991-92 Commonwealth outlays will have fallen to 23 1/2 per cent of GDP-or in terms comparable with the period before basic health cover was switched from the private to the public sectors-a ratio of 22 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This represents a significant turnaround from the trend of the 1970s and early 1980s when the Government sector claimed an ever increasing share of national income. </PARA>
<PARA> What-is-more, this declining share of Government outlays has paved the way for the real tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable Senators will be aware that this is the first Australian Government ever to have paid tax cuts from a Budget surplus. </PARA>
<PARA> All our predecessors have paid tax cuts by borrowing more money. </PARA>
<PARA> We have paid for them by cutting outlays in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Compare that to the Coalition Government which in 1982 ran up a $9.6 billion Budget deficit after paying irresponsible, unfunded tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast this Government in 1989 has found room for responsible tax cuts of $4.9 billion while retaining a Budget surplus of at least $5.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> We have paid for tax cuts by cutting and better targeting Government spending and delivering the proceeds back to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> In the years ahead-as the ratio of Commonwealth spending to the size of the economy continues to fall-likewise the amount of revenue needed to finance that spending will also fall. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, as economic conditions allow, there will be continued scope for further affordable personal income tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a simple equation, never understood by the Liberals. </PARA>
<PARA> Lower Government spending equals lower Government taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> Far from being a step towards smaller Government, the Opposition's proposal to give the States greater taxing powers would put all that achievement at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> Handing the States taxing powers would merely provide them with the wherewithal to fund increased expenditures, claiming back to the public sector the area vacated by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia just cannot risk leaving this act on the books. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the double taxing legislation we are repealing was in fact the second part of the Fraser Government's `New Federalism' policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The first part was equally misconceived. </PARA>
<PARA> Introduced in 1976, it provided for the States to receive as general revenue assistance a designated proportion of Commonwealth tax revenue, initially a certain share of income tax revenue, but from 1982-83 to 1984-85, a smaller share of total Commonwealth tax revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, these tax sharing arrangements were topped up by various funding `guarantees', such that in every year but 1982-83, the States received more than their fixed share of taxation revenues. </PARA>
<PARA> From an economic policy-making perspective, the main fault in these arrangements was that as grants were linked to revenue collections in the previous year, no account was taken of the emerging budget and economic position in the current year. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, flexibility to adjust fiscal policy settings in the national interest was severely constrained. </PARA>
<PARA> For a relatively small country such as Australia-heavily dependent on often rapidly changing international circumstances for our economic well-being-this was a risky situation in which to place ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth must be in a position to act decisively and with substantial influence if it is to fulfil its macro-economic responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> So called `New Federalism' denied the Commonwealth that ability. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government acted to remove the shackles of `New Federalism' by replacing the tax sharing grants with financial assistance grants in 1985-86. </PARA>
<PARA> Our aim has been to bring the growth in assistance to the States back under control and to help reduce the growth in public spending. </PARA>
<PARA> The States, of course, have resisted the large and sustained reductions in general purpose payments that the Commonwealth has imposed. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, I expect they will complain when, as I foreshadowed in the April Statement, we maintain that restraint at the 1989 Premiers' Conference. </PARA>
<PARA> But the ritual complaints of State Premiers have worn thin. </PARA>
<PARA> They too must play their part in economic adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, there is no debate about the crucial need for continued public sector spending restraint. </PARA>
<PARA> Reduced public sector spending makes an important contribution to providing scope for the increased private sector investment in new export and import replacing industries that is now taking place. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the need for all levels of Government in Australia to play their role in this has been made all the more urgent by the recent deterioration in Australia's external accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> It needs clearly to be understood by everyone in our community that each month's balance of payments figure is not a statistic in isolation. </PARA>
<PARA> To the contrary, each month's figure amounts to a further loss on our external accounts which must be covered by borrowing. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, each month's figures adds more to our external debt and to our national interest bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Frankly, Australia just cannot afford to go on accumulating debt at the rate it is at present. </PARA>
<PARA> We simply cannot afford the luxury of different levels of Government squabbling about how to divide up a pool of revenue when the overwhelming economic requirement is that all Governments recognise the need to keep their financial demands in check. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's future economic security demands that we have the full support of the States in this endeavour. </PARA>
<PARA> This year, more than in any other recent period, strong economic growth has ensured that the States have the financial capacity to do this. </PARA>
<PARA> The States have had a revenue bonanza in recent years because very strong growth in stamp duty revenue generated by the share market and property market booms has added enormously to their revenues. </PARA>
<PARA> State stamp duty revenue alone last year rose by over 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent years State finances have also benefited considerably from the Commonwealth's Accord with the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> Since wage costs represent a major proportion of the States' costs in providing services such as education, health and police, wage restraint flowing from the accord has helped increase the effective level of resources at the disposal of the States. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of these trends in the States' finances, it has been essential for the Commonwealth to significantly cut payments to the States to encourage them to restrain their spending. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past the States have simply spent all the revenue that has come their way. </PARA>
<PARA> Not to have cut back on Commonwealth payments to the States in current circumstances would have been economically irresponsible. </PARA>
<PARA> The alternative would have been to allow the States to increase their own outlays, offsetting the Commonwealth's spending reductions. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, some States seek to confuse this issue by producing a plethora of statistics comparing growth rates in outlays and revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> Their favourite is to complain that the cuts in Commonwealth payments have exceeded the cuts in the Commonwealth's own outlays and that they are therefore bearing an unfair share of the burden of fiscal restraint. </PARA>
<PARA> Such comparisons are simply irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that if the Commonwealth had not cuts grants by the degree it has it is likely the States would have shown no spending restraint at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The most appropriate measure of the relative fiscal restraint of the Commonwealth and the States is growth in each sector's own purpose outlays. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, comparing apples with apples. </PARA>
<PARA> On this basis, since 1986-87 Commonwealth own purpose general government outlays-that is, excluding public trading enterprises such as Telecom and Qantas-have fallen by 5 per cent in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, and despite the cuts in Commonwealth payments, comparable State outlays have increased by around 2 per cent in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> This growth reflects, in part, the continued strong growth in the States' current expenditures on goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA> These grew by nearly 4 1/2 per cent in real terms in 1987-88, and look set to grow at about the same rate this year. </PARA>
<PARA> None of this is to suggest that the Commonwealth is seeking to impose draconian spending cuts on the States. </PARA>
<PARA> We fully recognise that public services must be adequately funded. </PARA>
<PARA> But by the same token, by cutting out waste and inefficiency and better targeting assistance, there is further scope for the States to curtail spending. </PARA>
<PARA> They must continue to make a contribution to national economic adjustment in proportion to their importance in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I turn now from expenditure and taxation to policies toward government borrowing, where it has also been necessary for the government to diverge sharply from the policies of the previous government so as to restore order in national public finances. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Fraser government came to office, borrowings by State authorities were effectively controlled by Loan Council, under what was known as the Gentlemen's Agreement dating from 1936. </PARA>
<PARA> These arrangements were allowed to fall into severe disrepair by the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, at times State authorities were encouraged to increase their borrowings, including from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> These increased borrowings were purportedly to be used to fund infrastructure for the much touted resources boom of the early 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> However, they also enabled some States to squirrel away substantial cash balances which they could later spend, thwarting national fiscal policy objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Proper oversight of public sector borrowing under the Liberals was weakened in three ways:</PARA>
<PARA>Loan Council failed to extend its oversight under the Gentlemen's Agreement to new, ``Non-Conventional'' forms of borrowing such as financial leases and deferred payment schemes;</PARA>
<PARA>from 1977-78, Loan Council agreed to a wave of special additions to State authority borrowing programs for major infrastructure projects; and</PARA>
<PARA>from 1982-83, all domestic borrowings by State electricity authorities were excluded from control. </PARA>
<PARA> By 1983-84, over 75 per cent of State authority borrowings were outside Loan Council control, and the net PSBR of the State and Local sector had grown from 1.7 per cent of GDP at the end of the 1970s, to 2.9 per cent of GDP in 1982-83, the highest level since the 1950s. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, while there was much worthwhile public sector capital investment in the early 1980s, there was a significant component that could not be properly justified on any reasonable basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the concentration of infrastructure spending in that period added enormously to our foreign debt burden and contributed to the wages blow out and high inflation that marked the period. </PARA>
<PARA> The present government, when it came to office, was faced with the task of re-establishing national control over the net PSBR through Loan Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly Loan Council's acceptance from 1984-85 of the global approach to authority borrowings was secured. </PARA>
<PARA> This approach reasserted Loan Council's responsibility for control over all forms of financing by Governments at all levels. </PARA>
<PARA> In the early period the global limits did not bite as much as they should have because of the cushion left from the Fraser mismanagement of borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA> Increasingly, however, the global limits have become a useful tool of fiscal responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Even so, the States' net borrowing requirement has only declined from 2.3 per cent of GDP in 1983-84, to an estimated 1.2 per cent in 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same period the Commonwealth Government's net borrowing requirement has been cut from a 4.5 per cent deficit to a surplus of 0.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the stabilisation policy issues I have raised serve to highlight the role the States have to play in improving Australia's economic performance. </PARA>
<PARA> But just as the States can impact-for the better or worse-on broader fiscal policy settings, so they can have an important part in either promoting or frustrating necessary structural reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably the States are frequently to be found dragging their feet when it comes to structural reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Each State's financial position is affected by the expenditure consequences of its infrastructure and industry policies. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no use the States crying poor while, at the same time, their profligacy is revealed in continuing explicit or implicit industry subsidies and by sub-economic pricing of key resources, such as for out-moded rail services. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, for its part the Commonwealth has matched its success in fiscal management with a broad ranging program of micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> We demonstrated our determination to progress in this area by overriding restrictive State provisions in order to accelerate the essential deregulation of wheat transport and marketing. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this week, further reforms in the area of science and technology were announced, while later this month a major statement will be made on coastal shipping and the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> But we have to recognise that many of the structural rigidities and impediments to growth are rooted in State practices-particularly in the important area of transport. </PARA>
<PARA> It is crucial to the objective of improving waterfront efficiency that State port authorities reduce their costs, charge economically sensible prices for their services and become more active in encouraging competition within ports.</PARA>
<PARA> Where States have taken steps towards reform they need to be rigorously followed through. </PARA>
<PARA> Most States have not even begun the reform process-they need to lift their game. </PARA>
<PARA> The State railways are another area crying out for reform. </PARA>
<PARA> They largely account for State enterprise subsidies of some $2.3 billion per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> In the skies Commonwealth deregulation of domestic trunk passenger aviation will begin in 1990, and the hard but correct decision was taken on the third runway at Sydney airport. </PARA>
<PARA> But most States seem reluctant to give up their detailed regulation of intrastate air services, even though this will frustrate the full benefits for customers of the Commonwealth's initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, it is also important that progress made by the Commonwealth towards a stronger industry structure is not dissipated by inappropriate State policies. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a complex web of State incentives, taxes or charges and unnecessary and inconsistent regulation within and between States. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, one area where our Federal system has been all too productive is in the generation of unnecessary regulations: packaging and labelling regulations, occupational licensing, and the disparate regulation of companies and the securities and futures industries are cases in point. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President we look to the States to play their part in helping to remove such impediments and structural rigidities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for all these reasons, Mr President, that we repeal the last relic of the Liberal Party's new federalism. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the Explanatory Memorandum, which contains an explanation of the provisions of this Bill. </PARA>

I do not want to go over the detail of the ground we went over last August but there are a number of points which deserve some reiteration. Firstly, I simply make the point that a number of governments of different political persuasion held a bipartisan approach to immigration for over two decades, until the Howard-led Opposition decided last year to break with that tradition. The promised return to bipartisanship by Mr Peacock is reflected in the return to the Opposition front bench of two members of the Opposition, the honourable member for Dundas, Mr Ruddock, now the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, and the current honourable member for Goldstein, Mr Macphee, now the shadow Minister for foreign affairs-two important shadow ministries which bear very directly on this question, as Senator Hill readily acknowledges.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is very important that those things be acknowledged. Throughout the debate over the last nine months Messrs Ruddock and Macphee have stood by the convictions that they expressed in their commitment to a non-discriminatory immigration policy. That commitment was never more tested than when they-as did Senator Peter Baume in this place-crossed the floor last August to reaffirm that race should play no part in immigration policy. Mr Macphee, Mr Michael MacKellar, Mr Ruddock and others have been quite vocal on this issue. If there was ever any cause for confusion about the stance of the Australian Parliament on these issues it emanated from that very noisy disagreement within the Liberal Party and the coalition over that period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clear bipartisan commitment to a bipartisan immigration policy, along with that of the Leader of the Opposition, marks a return to the great tradition established by previous Liberal leaders and government of all political persuasions until last year. It was this bipartisanship that gave the necessary support to the Holt Government in initiating the dismantling of the so-called white Australia policy. It was this bipartisan support that contributed to the overwhelming national and international benefit of Australia. At the risk of being chastised for quoting oneself, I remind the Senate of what I said when we debated a similar motion in August last year. I said that leaders such as Holt, Gorton, McMahon and Fraser:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . were concerned about where this country's real interests lay. They pursued an immigration policy which took that into account. It was a triumph of reason over prejudice, of statesmanship over politics. </PARA>
<PARA>With this motion before us today and the amendment moved by Senator Alston-we will not support it; we would have supported it had it been moved as a addendum-we have the opportunity to put aside the deep divisions of the last nine months and to rid ourselves of that debate. Lest anybody be in any doubt about the importance of it, it was often denied in this place that anyone who travelled in South East Asia and places such as Hong Kong, southern China and Thailand during the last few months would have been fully aware of the dangers in that non-bipartisan approach in this country. It was a matter of profound concern in those countries, to their communities at large and also, particularly, to the business communities in those countries. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Senate knows, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) wrote to the Leader of the Opposition foreshadowing today's motion and invited him to take this opportunity to put aside the debate of the past. I regret that only today we received the amendment to be moved by Senator Alston in response to that letter. The Government invites and encourages honourable senators to support this motion and re-embrace unqualified bipartisanship on Australia's immigration policy once and for all. Responding in a sense to Senator Boswell's interjection about embarrassment about this issue, there are still views on public record which are unrepudiated. For example, on 9 August last year Senator Boswell's leader in this place, Senator Stone, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Asian immigration has to be slowed. It is no good dancing around the bushes. </PARA>
<PARA>He was asked whether he stood by those comments on 11 September last year. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I've never retracted these words. I would never be likely to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>But the will of the Opposition in this matter was expressed in a collective way through the Leader of the Opposition a few days ago. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad for that reassurance. The motion I have moved represents an unambiguous and unequivocal commitment to a non-discriminatory immigration policy. It is a clear statement to Australia and to the world that the white Australia policy is dead and buried, as we believed it was. It is a clear indication to Australia and to the world that Australian governments will not include explicitly or implicitly race or ethnic origin in their immigration selection criteria. It is about acknowledging the multicultural character of the Australian society, and the importance of policies which provide the basis for social cohesion in a culturally diverse society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not wish to be anecdotal in the course of this debate, but there is an 83-year-old pensioner who lives in my street in Melbourne. When the change in leadership took place I was amazed by what he said in a discussion with me in the street. He said to me, `I think John Howard's problems started when he talked about the immigration debate'. This old man, who has lived in that suburb all his life, said, `You can't talk that way now. It used to be common talk when I was a young man, but you can't talk like that any more. Australia belongs to the people who live in it'. I thought that was a very succinct view on this issue from somebody who has been around for a long time. It was a very enlightened view from a man of that age. That is what this motion is about. It is an opportunity for all senators to endorse a principle and a philosophy that expresses most powerfully the core of Australian values, namely, that equality can never be compromised by race, colour, belief or, least of all, country of origin. It is a unique opportunity for the Opposition, which it has accepted, and us to invite all Australians to acknowledge the significant contribution that immigrants from all parts of the world can make, have made and will continue to make to Australia. Although we may differ on the details of immigration policy, I urge, in moving this motion, that never again should we part company on the fundamental principle of racial equality in this Parliament in terms of what this Parliament stands for-the whole of the Australian community. I commend the motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to speak on what is a very important subject. I note that Senator Button in moving and speaking to this motion took up less than half the time that was available to him. One can say from that fact alone that he was decidedly uncomfortable in announcing the course of action that he has just announced to the Senate. The Opposition parties welcome the opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to a non-discriminatory immigration policy which was so clearly enunciated by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) at his press conference on 9 May. Unlike our opponents who, until the 1960s, officially endorsed and supported the white Australia policy, we have a long and proud history of non-discrimination. It is no coincidence that at that press conference one of the first matters put to Mr Peacock on his ascension to the leadership was by Laurie Oakes. Mr Peacock dealt specifically with the immigration question and the very deep divisions which Mr Oakes alleged had been caused last year. Mr Peacock said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> You will see . . . in the policies that I elaborate a clear espousal of a non-discriminatory immigration program and in fact an espousal of bipartisanship. </PARA>
<PARA>One could not have a clearer or more explicit enunciation of the coalition's position at the current time. We are proud of the enlightened and compassionate immigration policies which have characterised this country since 1949 and which have seen some 4.7 million new settler arrivals. These people have made an enormous contribution to Australia, to its economic growth and progress, as well as providing a depth of cultural diversity for which Australia is much the stronger. Ethnic communities are represented at all levels of society. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been a great privilege for me, until recent events, to have been seated beside a fellow Western Australian, Senator John Panizza-his is a remarkable success story-who is passionately proud of his Italian heritage. I have a similar fondness for my Irish colleague on the other side of the chamber, Senator Jim McKiernan. Our immigration policy was released months ago and is supported by every member of the coalition parties. Our past record and our future intentions are there for all the world to see. So why this motion only two days after the Government got egg on its face in a big way for wasting some hours in the House of Representatives in a futile and counterproductive censure motion on the Leader of the Opposition? Everyone knows the state of the economic crisis in this country. Everyone knows that there are more than 30 Bills log-jammed in the House of Representatives which have to be dispatched by the end of next week. Yet the Government chose to waste the Parliament's time and therefore the country's time. Here we are, two days later, and the Government is at it again. </PARA>
<PARA> Why has this motion been moved? After all it is only nine months since both Houses of the Parliament carried a virtually identical motion. The world already knows where the Parliament of Australia stands. This latest version adds two paragraphs. One is an innocuous, motherhood bromide, which acknowledges the importance of immigration to our economic, social and cultural history. Quite clearly, it is nothing that anyone of goodwill could disagree with. So that does not take the matter any further. </PARA>
<PARA> The second paragraph is a grubby little effort intended to deliver an implicit backhander to John Howard, who has done so much to set our parties on track for government at the next election-and the sooner the better. The only reason that was introduced was to try somehow to create trouble and hope that somehow the media would see this not as an endorsement of Mr Peacock but as a criticism of his predecessor. So why are we presented with this motion? We are told by the whitened sepulchres on the other side that this motion is necessary in order to send a signal to the region that somehow there is still continuing apprehension and concern about Australia's immigration policies. That is hypocrisy, cant and humbug. </PARA>
<PARA> How does a message get to our neighbours in Asia? It gets there generally speaking in three ways: One, by headlines; two, by government action; and three, by people talking about it in the region. Look at the dishonesty and deviousness of the Government. It has endeavoured to talk up legitimate fears and differences of opinion that existed in the community last year and which manifested themselves in the political debate. That attempt to exploit divisions was clearly designed to send the maximum possible signal to Asia of differences between the political parties. It was not intended to somehow heal any rifts or to play down any difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> Look at what Mr Hawke had to say. He started running around the country saying that the immigration debate had been more damaging to Australia's image and influence in Asia than any other event in recent times and that it could have cost more than $350m in lost revenue. He did not say that to the local branch of the Australian Labor Party in Wills because I suppose he hardly ever goes there these days. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps he should spend more time there and find out what is really going on. He spoke to that august body, the Australian Institute of International Affairs and the Asia Society-a respectable conference.

Of course, he was doing this for some weeks. This is what he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . one of the first effects of the immigration debates was a reduction in applications from potential business migrants . . . by possibly more than 30 per cent. Such damage to the Business Migration Program could slash capital inflow from Asia into Australia from $1.1 billion to about $750 million, with the potential long-term loss much higher. </PARA>
<PARA>What a disgraceful display. What an unforgiveable attempt to explain away a change in economic circumstances-a fact of life that was very much in the pipeline before any so-called immigration debate. How disgraceful to dump it on the Opposition. Is that the sort of unification we are talking about? Is that the sort of social cohesion we are talking about? Is that the sort of message we want to send to Asia? No, it was a purely political attempt-dishonest in the extreme-to give the impression that the Opposition was responsible for a predicted fall-off in the business migration program. That remained almost conventional wisdom in the media until Senator Ray had the political guts in Hong Kong--</PARA>

He made it clear that there was not any linkage between the two, that the business migration program was falling away because of irresistible offers, by New Zealand and Canada in particular, and for financial reasons, not because people in Asia somehow believed the hypocrisy of Hawke.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Listen to what Senator Gareth Evans, the Foreign Minister, had to say when he decided to wander over to the United Nations (UN). He gave the UN a commitment:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . race will never again be used to judge migrants. </PARA>
<PARA> He said this in all piousness:</PARA>
<PARA> I bring here now on behalf of my Government the solemn undertaking, recently confirmed by both Houses of our national Parliament, that never again shall we allow race to be used as a criterion in the exercise of our sovereign right to decide who shall enter our country. </PARA>
<PARA> That undertaking is made not only as a reflection of deeply held principle, but also because if Australia were to do otherwise, we would deserve the censure of the world. </PARA>
<PARA>What Senator Evans was saying quite clearly was that at that time the Parliament of Australia had made its position abundantly clear and that he had the honour to repay that solemn undertaking to the rest of the world at the General Assembly, with its 160-plus member nations. Senator Evans was telling the rest of the world in October last year-less than six months ago-that Australia had a bipartisan approach, that the Australian Parliament supported the principles that this Government espouses. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is the case, what has changed since then? Nothing has changed, except in terms of symbolism. In his press conference, and in subsequent reporting, Mr Peacock made it abundantly clear-if there were any misconceptions or misunderstandings, here or in Asia-that that is no longer an issue. So why do we need this grubby little exercise? Why was the Government intent on exploiting a sensitive and delicate issue for perceived party advantage? To hell with Australia, was the attitude. What happened on 9 May? There were headlines around Australia. On 10 May, under the headline `Immigration policy to be bipartisan again', the Age said:</PARA>
<PARA> Moments after taking the Opposition helm, Mr Peacock signalled changes in coalition policies and a return to a bipartisan approach on immigration. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Financial Review, under the headline `Repudiation to end damaging immigration row', said:</PARA>
<PARA> Within hours of Mr Peacock becoming Leader of the Opposition yesterday, he indicated an end to his predecessor's `One Australia' policy-</PARA>
<PARA>that is not factually correct, but we are talking about the symbolism and the impression created in the moments after the change of leadership-</PARA>
<PARA>immediately trying to end the ideological battle that has bedevilled the party for almost a year. </PARA>
<PARA>Putting aside the hyperbole, one thing is crystal-clear: the Financial Review is signalling what it regards as a very important symbolic change. It mentioned also Mr Peacock's:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . subsequent promise that the Party will return to its previous bipartisan and non-racially based immigration policy . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What else is there? On page one, the Sydney Morning Herald, under the headline `Libs go back to the future', reported:</PARA>
<PARA> Peacock vows `fairer' nation. Mr Peacock immediately signalled an end to the controversial political debate over Asian immigration by pledging a `non-discriminatory immigration program' and `an espousal of bipartisanship.'</PARA>
<PARA>There it is. The whole of Australia and the rest of the world knew on 10 May that there had been a very fundamental symbolic change in the immigration policy espoused by the coalition. There was no change to the words because everyone supports the policy. The policy has been in the public arena. If the Government had bothered to read it, it could tell us whether it disagreed with it, but it clearly does not. </PARA>
<PARA> If this Government seriously wants to convey a message to Asia in order to enable the nations of the region to know where Australia stands and where the major political parties stand, let it distribute Australian Labor Party and coalition immigration policies to the governments of the region, to the peoples of the region, to any who might be confused and to any businessmen who might misunderstand. Let it write to all of the heads of state and point out what Mr Peacock said at his press conference on 9 May. Let it take out full page advertisements in the Straits Times or the Times of India or any other newspaper in a country of the region where there are supposedly still some people who are not aware of what happened on 9 May and what the headlines around Australia recorded on the following day. </PARA>
<PARA> Let the Government confirm, if it is serious, bipartisan support for the nine principles consistently reaffirmed by both sides over a period of 10 years. Yet we have had it from the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) that the Government will not do that; it will not join with us to support the fundamental principles upon which immigration policy in this country is based.

It said that it would be introduced into the House of Representatives and the Senate on the first day of sitting. This is a sordid attempt to stir up trouble, to excite the media, and to convey precisely the wrong impression to the peoples of the region. I should like to look at Mr Hawke's letter because I think it is instructive. It gives an insight into the seriousness with which Mr Hawke views this very important issue. In his letter-this is sanctimoniousness at its best-he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The divisive immigration debate last year was a deeply regrettable stain on Australia's Bicentennial. </PARA>
<PARA>I take that as meaning that he is sorry that it spoilt the party. Those of us who had to sit through the $40m splurge very much regret that the party was not spoilt before it started. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's major political parties should show national leadership on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA>Our nation should make it clear that this departure from bipartisan, non-discriminatory policies is behind us. How does the nation make it clear? I would think a pretty good way of doing it is for the leaders of both political parties to make it clear. Presumably, Mr Hawke is not saying one thing and doing another. He is professing--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was in Perth being born. The chronology is that Mr Hawke supposedly had a consistent view of bipartisanship and non-discrimination. I will come later to the cant and hypocrisy in the current position. The fact of the matter is that, in recent times, Mr Hawke has been parading himself around the world as the arch apostle of non-discrimination. What he is saying is, `We are okay, but what about you mob? You have to make your position clear'. Mr Hawke wrote his letter on 17 May, a week after Mr Peacock had made our position abundantly clear. What more do those opposite want? They are not going to tell me that Hawke did not bother reading the transcript of that press conference, because he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have noted the statement in your press conference of 9 May that the policies which you elaborate will clearly espouse a non-discriminatory immigration program and bipartisanship on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA>He knows fundamentally what Mr Peacock has said. He knows absolutely where the Opposition stands. Why does he come up with this tawdry and shabby little exercise? He also said:</PARA>
<PARA>I look forward to the opposition's agreement to the Resolution, the passing of which will mark the resumption of bipartisanship . . .</PARA>
<PARA>What is he on about? We know what he is on about. He is trying to stir up trouble. He is not interested in the welfare of the nation or conveying messages to Asia. Those messages are already there. There was not a problem until he started playing around with fire in this manner. It is tragic that politics can be used in this way on such an issue as this. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason why this matter comes forward at all is that the hard men triumphed over the wise men. There is a wise man sitting on the other side of the chamber. I am sure he was very concerned, as a strategist, about the potential for this exercise to backfire. I would probably put Senator McMullan into the same category. He has been around for a while; he knows what politics is about. He knows that the media can turn on you: that is, people get away with a trick once; the second time around it can blow up in their faces. Wise men would have counselled caution. They know that this is a very dangerous strategy, too clever by half. </PARA>
<PARA> But no, the wise men were outgunned. It was the hard men like Senator Schacht and Senator Richardson who called the tune. They wanted to distract attention from the economic crisis. They are not particularly interested that we have got a current account deficit heading for $17 billion, interest rates that are 5 percentage points higher than they were 12 months ago, a gross foreign debt approaching $120 billion or that we need a $58 a week tax decrease to get back to where we were in real terms in 1983. They are not interested in any of those things; they just want to take attention away from the economic crisis. This was thought to be the way to do it. The hard men thought they saw a window of opportunity. The lesson is that before one leaps through an open window one has to make sure it is on ground level. This is going to blow up in their faces. They will jump and find they land in a mess of their own making. It is totally unnecessary to bring this forward. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of trying to create factions and divisions on our side of politics perhaps they should look at their own factional problems. After all, we could say, `Politician heal thyself'. It is a pity Senator Cook is not here to tell us about the inevitable disintegration of the Centre Left. Clearly that is falling to pieces. Maybe those people should establish a resurrected Party secretaries club. I am sure they would be pleased to have Senator Ray as a honorary member. That is about the largest profession represented on the other side of the chamber. </PARA>

He might learn a bit about sensible politics. I am sure he would get advice from Senator Ray not to go ahead with a half-baked motion such as this. That is why I will be formally moving the amendment which sets out the nine principles upon which both parties have consistently agreed over a period of 10 years, from the time that the Fraser Government initiated a Green Paper in 1976, followed by the tabling of that Green Paper in Parliament in March 1977 and a statement to the Parliament by Mr MacKellar, the then Minister. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . we clearly state that basis on which our immigration policies will operate. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that in 1978. Since that time the honourable member for Goldstein (Mr Macphee), in 1981, has said:</PARA>
<PARA> The nine principles of our immigration policy-including the important global non-discriminatory nature of our programs-remain unaltered. </PARA>
<PARA>On the other side, the former Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr West, in May 1983-in other words, shortly after coming to government-said on this very important issue:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has reaffirmed the nine principles underlying migration policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Then there was another entrant through the revolving door. Mr Hurford, the then Minister, said the same thing:</PARA>
<PARA> In summary, my colleague the Minister for Housing and Construction has been responsible for Cabinet endorsement of a statement of nine principles of immigration. Frankly, those principles are more or less the same principles of the previous Fraser Administration. </PARA>
<PARA>That was in 1986. Consistently, this Government has endorsed and espoused those nine principles. They have been slightly modified for the purpose of the migration booklet but they are fundamentally in place. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are interested in genuinely sending a message to Asia, let us not play games, let us not try to demean the former Leader of the Opposition. Let us not try to find problems that do not exist on our side of politics. Let us both agree that immigration is too important an issue to be trivialised in this way. Let us agree that the nine principles represent matters of fundamental concern that go the heart of a non-discriminatory and bipartisan policy-in the sense that that term seems to be loosely used at the present time. Of course we reserve the right to be critical of administrative shortcomings and of various other policy settings that we believe are in need of change. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a great pity in many ways that the Government has not addressed in more positive terms the report of the FitzGerald Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies. Dr FitzGerald said:</PARA>
<PARA>Problems with current immigration policies are not limited to the numbers. Widespread mistrust and failing consensus threaten community support of immigration. The program is not identified in the public mind with the national interest, and must be given a convincing rationale. </PARA>
<PARA>So Dr FitzGerald has made it very clear that there are matters of real concern that need to be addressed. We welcome any constructive attempts to do just that. What we do not welcome are cynical attempts to exploit divisions in the community, to beat up issues where there are no problems, to decide somehow, after two weeks of agonising, that this might be one way in which some problems can be caused on the other side of the chamber. If the Government is fair dinkum, it will support the principles. Is the Government in all seriousness, going to oppose those principles simply because we will not let them be tacked onto a resolution which is flawed in the sense that it adds motherhood-which adds nothing-which contains implicit criticism of Mr Howard but otherwise reiterates all that took place in both Houses of Parliament nine months ago? What is the need for repetition? What has changed?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has a message from the Parliament of Australia. Senator Evans has gone to the General Assembly and told the world about it. It is on the record. If the Government thinks there are misconceptions, it should be telling the world what has happened over the last two weeks. The Government should tell the people of the world what Mr Peacock said. It should tell them about the symbolism implicit in putting Mr Ruddock in as shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs when he crossed the floor nine months ago. It should give them all of those messages. It should let them know if there are problems. It should let them know that the Opposition's policy is clearly one of non-discrimination and bipartisanship. That is the way to do it. The Government does not have to waste the time of this Parliament with all sorts of trivial tactical exercises. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government knows full well the critical necessity to ensure that racial tension is not exacerbated and to do nothing to stir up prejudice and enmity. If the Government is looking for division on this side, it is saying that it hopes that there will be some decent headlines out of this in the interests, of course, of creating political capital. Does the Government want to get a message to the people of Asia that there are still problems in Australia? Does the Government want them to be told that there are differences of opinion between the political parties? If that is not what the Government wants, why does it not tell them what Mr Peacock said? Why does it not send them copies of our policy? Why does it not let them know what Mr Ruddock has been saying in the last two weeks? Why does it not explain to them where we stand? Why does the Government not talk to people on this side of the chamber about their attitudes? Why does it not convey those messages to Asia? Why recycle something that has been through the Parliament and is dead and buried? We know why: Mr Hawke and the hard men think there is a bit of mileage in it. That is a tragedy for Australia. The national interest demands that the Government not seek to divide for naked opportunism and cheap political gain. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not blame Senator Ray for this squalid exercise. His remarks in Hong Kong were courageous. I am sure that he has had no part in wanting to put this motion on the agenda. That is probably why it has taken two weeks to get to the barrier. The Prime Minister's letter says it all. It bears all the hallmarks of a mean-minded political opportunist who is prepared to sacrifice the national interest for 30 pieces of electoral currency. The people of South East Asia do not need reassurances. There are deliberate and unmistakable symbolisms already in place. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button quite correctly pointed to statements made by four Liberal Prime Ministers over the last 25 or 30 years, statements about which all Australians can hold their heads high. It is a pity that the same cannot be said of the other two Prime Ministers, Labor Prime Ministers, this country has had in that period. When Mr Hawke was the shadow Minister for employment, industrial relations and youth affairs, he pandered to genuine fears about job security, playing to his constituency. He said that it was absurd, when we had young people unemployed, to be bringing people from overseas to fill alleged or actual shortages. How disgraceful. What is different about the situation now? Unemployment is much higher. Youth unemployment is much higher. Yet the immigration intake is higher. What hypocrisy. What double standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The other Labor Prime Minister we had in that period was Mr Whitlam. What did he say in 1977? He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Any genuine refugee should be accepted but the Government has a responsibility to ensure they are genuine refugees. </PARA>
<PARA>If there is not symbolism in that I will go home. Again he was clearly pandering to a political constituency. </PARA>

The Government would not let them do it. Yet Government members go around and beat up this sort of fear and apprehension. </PARA>
<PARA> The most unfortunate aspect of this whole debate is that we have a Prime Minister whose track record is fundamentally flawed, who is guilty of double standards in the extreme and who is now trying to create yet more political divisions. Our side of politics has a clear, consistent and honourable record on the issue. The Leader of the Opposition has made our position known to the world. There can be no argument that we have a non-discriminatory and bipartisan approach as enunciated in the nine principles. Yet, for tactical reasons, the Government is not prepared to support the nine principles. It wants to recycle a motion from nine months ago. It hopes that somehow it can find a few people who are nervous, that somehow it will get a headline that will rebound to its credit. But it will not. The press will see it in the same way as it saw that pathetic little performance in the House of Representatives the other day-as a complete and utter waste of time. Let me quote the West Australian of today:</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government should drop the idea of launching a motion in Parliament against any racial discrimination in immigration policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite Labor denials, the move has all the hallmarks of a cynical attempt to exploit divisions in Liberal Party ranks . . . </PARA>
<PARA> It runs the risk of stirring up extremists . . . The Government will have a lot to answer for . . . The matter should be allowed to rest there. </PARA>
<PARA>I move:</PARA>
<PARA> Leave out all words after ``That'', insert:</PARA>
<PARA>``the Senate reaffirms the nine bipartisan principles of Australian immigration endorsed by successive Governments, namely:</PARA>
<PARA>Principle number 1</PARA>
<PARA> It is fundamental to national sovereignty that the Australian Government alone should determine who will be admitted to Australia. No person other than an Australian citizen, has a basic right to enter Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Principle number 2</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from people admitted as refugees and for family reunion, migrant entry criteria should be developed on the basis of benefit to the Australian community, and the social, economic and related requirements within Australia. As a general rule, Australia will not admit for settlement people who would represent an economic burden to Australia through inordinate claims on welfare, health or other resources; who would endanger the community by criminal or other anti-social activities; or whose entry would be to their own detriment. </PARA>
<PARA>Principle number 3</PARA>
<PARA> The size and composition of migrant intakes should not jeopardise social cohesiveness and harmony within the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA>Principle number 4</PARA>
<PARA> Immigration policy should be applied on a basis which is non-discriminatory. There are external restraints on the extent to which Australia can apply a non-discriminatory policy. Some countries will not allow their nationals to emigrate; other countries allow only those with exit permits to leave; some countries will not permit the emigration of skilled and professional workers. Some countries will not allow advertising for migration purposes; others will not allow immigration offices to be established within their territories, or allow immigration officers to operate within their territories. In addition, there are varying degrees of interest in migration to Australia in particular areas. The principle of non-discrimination means that the policy will be applied consistently to all applicants regardless of their race, colour, nationality, descent, national or ethnic origin, sex or religion. </PARA>
<PARA>Principle number 5</PARA>
<PARA> Applicants should be considered for migration as individuals or individual family units, not as community groups. An exception will be refugees in designated refugee situations, although even in such circumstances the criteria for selection will be related to the characteristics of individual applicants. </PARA>
<PARA>Principle number 6</PARA>
<PARA> Eligibility and suitability standards for migrants should reflect Australian social mores and Australian laws. Polygamous unions will not be accepted, nor the entry of child fiances. The concept of immediate family, for eligibility purposes, will be derived from the Australian norm, ie. the unit consisting of husband, wife and minor unmarried children. </PARA>
<PARA>Principle number 7</PARA>
<PARA> Migration to Australia should be for permanent settlement although there should be no barrier preventing the departure of persons wishing to leave. The guest-worker migration flow, until recently popular in the industrialised countries of Western Europe, will not be adopted for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Principle number 8</PARA>
<PARA> While migrants will have the same rights as other Australian residents to choose their place of residence individually or collectively, enclave settlement will not be encouraged. Immigration policy will not consider communities for mass movement to Australia in situations where closed enclave settlement would occur. </PARA>
<PARA>Principle number 9</PARA>
<PARA> Policies governing entry and settlement should be based on the premise that migrants should integrate into Australian society. Migrants will be given every opportunity, consistent with this premise, to preserve and disseminate their ethnic heritage''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sitting on the cross benches, and having heard the contributions to the debate on this motion by Senator Button and Senator Alston, I find it difficult to believe that they both spoke to the same motion. A similar motion came up for debate in this place in August last year. That debate was brought on as a direct result of the unfortunate statements made by the former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong, Mr Howard, and other members of the coalition. I said at that time that it was shameful that it was felt necessary to debate within this chamber and this Parliament a motion that Australia should have a non-discriminatory immigration policy. We have now had that policy for some years. I must say that Senator Alston's words have reassured us all that we are now in for a bipartisan, non-discriminatory immigration policy which will be totally unambiguous. I am not quite sure about the meaning of the word `bipartisan'. Does it mean the Government and the Opposition or does it mean government and non-government? Perhaps the word should be tripartisan or multipartisan. Anyway, let us hope that this debate will set the record straight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's four-clause motion is unambiguous and straightforward; it is, to a certain extent, motherhood. Notice of motion was given by Senator Button on Tuesday. Immediately after I heard that notice given in this place, I telephoned Senator Button's office and received a fax about the motion. The Australian Democrats support the motion as it stands. The Opposition's amendment to that motion, the nine principles, was put into my hand about 40 minutes ago. I have certainly read through them. They are the principles on which present regulations and migration policies are based. However, as I have not been able to discuss these principles with my colleagues at this time, it is very difficult for the Democrats to support them. There are other reasons why they are difficult for us to support. I believe that they would cloud the motion. That would be a great shame. If there is to be any point in this debate at all, it is that the Senate will pass a straightforward, unambiguous motion that Australia continues to have a non-discriminatory immigration policy. Having taken the opportunity to reread these principles, I feel that they may need some updating. As Senator Alston said, they have been around for some time. It may well be that they should be updated in some way, as they have been abused in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me look at the principles before turning to the detail of the four clauses of the Government's motion. The second principle in part reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Apart from people admitted as refugees and for family reunion, migrant entry criteria should be developed on the basis of benefit to the Australian community, and the social, economic and related requirements within Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>That economic benefit clause, which also stands in the first clause of the Government's motion, has been abused in the past. I have only to think of the situation in Wittenoom in Western Australia when during the period of vast immigration immediately after the Second World War a number of Italian migrants-there were migrants from other countries as well but they were predominantly Italian migrants-were taken to work in the Wittenoom asbestos mines. They did not know that they were going to work in mines for the most part; they thought they were going to work on the land. When they got there they were very unhappy about it. I have in my possession certified translations of letters that they wrote to the Italian Consulate in their distress, saying that they did not want to be there; they felt that it was unhealthy. Yet they had no option: they had to stay there and work to pay back their fares. That was of economic benefit to Australia at the time, but now that vast sums of compensation are being paid out at the expense of current taxpayers, that may need some review. I put it to the Senate that if we are going to regard our migrant population as economic units for us to exploit, these people will come to exploit us, and we will indeed deserve that. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at the size and composition of our migrant intake, the Government is suggesting a floating points system. I have discussed that proposal with people who would be directly involved and those not directly involved but concerned about the principle. That would leave itself wide open to abuse. I can think of no other situation and no other system where people can apply on one day when there is one rule and be judged on another day when the rule is completely different. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to principle No. 7, that `migration to Australia should be for permanent settlement although there should be no barrier preventing the departure of persons wishing to leave'. Of course there should be no barrier. However, if we care to look at the breakdown of the figures of people who do leave Australia each year-I do not have those figures to hand but they are quite substantial, in the region of 20,000 to 30,000 permanent departures-we see that there is an extraordinarily high number of people in the professional and high skills categories. That should give us some cause for concern, and maybe that is something that should be looked into. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (a) of the Government's motion states that the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> acknowledges the important contribution which immigration has made to the economic, social and cultural development of Australia;</PARA>
<PARA>We all know the history of migration in Australia, and no-one can deny that history. We did indeed have a policy of populate or perish immediately after the Second World War. We currently have various categories of migration. I think we need to consider very carefully whether the people we bring in in the categories for skills and business migration are going to make a good contribution to the economic, social and cultural development of Australia, or whether in some cases we are bringing in people who want to make that sort of improvement for themselves and then shift out, even to their countries of origin. </PARA>
<PARA> Thank goodness we saw the end of the white Australia policy many years ago. During the white Australia policy period the key words were `assimilation and integration', which all too often meant a denial of origin. Now we live in a more humanitarian era where the key words are `multicultural and democratic pluralism'. I believe that is more in keeping with the Australian fair go for all attitude and in essence will produce the desired one Australia. I read in a recent article that if Australia cannot get it right with its multicultural society, then God help the rest of the world because here we do have a microcosm of the whole world. More than ever before we have no option other than to get it right and learn to live well together. </PARA>
<PARA> The second paragraph of the Government's motion states that the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA>recognises that bipartisan support for the dismantlement of the White Australia Policy and the adoption of a non-discriminatory immigration policy have been to the overwhelming national and international benefit of Australia;</PARA>
<PARA>There can be no doubt about that. The dismantling of that most iniquitous policy has given us international status and an internal national status too. That policy was of course born of a primitive fear and ignorant bigotry, and the present non-discriminatory policy is in keeping with international codes to which we subscribe. In Western Australia over the years there have been very nasty, vicious racist campaigns, with people predominantly using posters, which they stick up all over the place. The main protagonist of this campaign, who blatantly exposes himself as a member of the National Socialist Party, was a few weeks ago publicly discredited. It was revealed that this man, who is mostly against Asian people, in fact has some Asian blood in him. His own father was born overseas and is part Asian. That might help to explain things. We know that this is often the case with other tyrants of the world who have been racist. </PARA>
<PARA> The third paragraph of the Government's motion states that the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA>welcomes the support now publicly expressed by the newly-elected Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) on 9 May 1989 for a non-discriminatory and bipartisan immigration policy;</PARA>
<PARA>I feel that in the circumstances that is fair. I am aware that the Government did offer to withdraw that paragraph in return for an adaptation of the Opposition's amendment, and that offer was not taken up. In the circumstances I think it is fair that that clause should be in. We know that the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) did not vote when the motion was debated last year in the House of Representatives. As I said at the start of my speech, at least it will now lay it firmly on the line. We know that we do have a large number of illegal migrants presently in Australia. In no way can anyone condone deliberate illegal migration, because there are people who do the right thing, who stand in line and wait their turn to be processed overseas in the right way. In no way should favouritism be shown to people who deliberately seek to come in as illegal migrants. However, many of our illegal migrants have been here for a generation or so, and possibly have families and are grandparents themselves. I would like to flag right now that the proposed immigration amendment legislation to be brought in by the Government, which can cause mandatory deportations, could put the situation of many of those people in jeopardy. They could even be related to members of the Senate through intermarriage down through the generations. I think that is something that needs to be looked at very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot of tightening up needs to be done in the area of illegal migration. Surveillance of the northern parts of the coast of Western Australia is absolutely pathetic. The illegal migrants who get picked up I believe are in the minority. Also no follow-up is done on overseas students who come to Australia to attend courses. There is very little checking on whether they actually attend any classes, and when it is found that they have disappeared into the blue, all the information is very much out of date. Likewise, I believe our checking up processes on people who come in under the business migration category, or even as tourists, are not tight enough. While I am on this issue, I flag here that the overseas embassies, consulates and offices which deal with migration are very often understaffed. The staff are not properly trained and many people when first applying to migrate are not given the right sort of counselling and assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The final paragraph of the Government's motion states that the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA>reaffirms its unambiguous and unqualified commitment to the principle that, whatever criteria are applied by Australian Governments in exercising their sovereign right to determine the composition of the immigration intake, race or ethnic origin shall never, explicitly or implicitly, be among them. </PARA>
<PARA>That was clearly spelt out and reiterated when the FitzGerald Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies brought down its report last year. The reference given to that Committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA>In carrying out its work, the Committee should:</PARA>
<PARA> have regard to the principles that Australia's immigration policies are non-discriminatory in respect of national or ethnic origin, race, sex and religion . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That final paragraph is, of course, the crux of the whole matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like briefly to mention citizenship, because this is also something that frequently comes up in debates on immigration. This is the Year of the Citizen. Many of the people who came out to Australia from the United Kingdom during the days of vast migration in the 1940s and 1950s came under the child migration scheme. These people are now adults and some have no birth certificates. They have no natural rights as citizens of this country unless they apply for citizenship. They would be denied the privilege of becoming members of parliament should they be so elected. Yet when they apply now for citizenship, they are told they have to go through the same motions as everybody else. Some may not, in those circumstances, be able to go back to their original country and may not even know who their parents are. These are people who were orphans when they came out, or who have been deserted by their parents, or whose parents thought that they would have a better life in Australia than in the United Kingdom, and so they were sent out as part of the child migration scheme. I would like to place on record that in the Year of the Citizen these people should be granted citizenship as a special criterion. The Democrats support the Government's motion. It is unfortunate in some respects that it needs to be debated again. If this motion has the unanimous support of this chamber at least the record is straight and we can let the matter drop. Then the whole world and the whole of Australia can know that the Parliament and the Government of Australia are totally committed to a non-discriminatory immigration policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank honourable senators for their contribution to this debate which, by and large, has been of an even standard and relatively without difficulty.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday as I was finishing my speech I was calling for the establishment of an endangered species unit which could be had at a relatively small cost to the Government but which has not yet come to pass. It is one of the promised things we are still waiting for. With regard to soil degradation, it was disturbing to read the comments of Dr David Smiles, head of the Soils Division of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), on the Federal Government's announcement of a $45m grant for soil conservation. Dr Smiles and other CSIRO scientists who have been in touch with my office claim that the 30 per cent decline in funding over the last six years has had a devastating effect on programs, staffing and effectiveness in addressing the ongoing problem of soil and productivity loss.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many rangeland field programs have been abandoned altogether. The cost of these short term budgetary savings are only being deferred to a later date when the bill will be even larger than the current $600m per year estimated by Senator Cook. Other field programs desperately in need of funding include those addressing the infestation of feral animals and plants across Australia. From the assault of cane toads and foxes to the spread of mimosa and woody weeds, we are only deferring the cost of feral animal and weed eradication until whole ecosystems collapse from the strain. It is a classic case of blinkered, short term thinking to make the figures look a little better now, and an attitude of `hang the consequences for the future' when future governments will have to pick up a much larger repair bill. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the environment which is the ultimate loser-that includes us, the human species. People make an enormous and drastic impact on the environment. If the environment is devastated beyond repair, ultimately we will be the ones to suffer. It is time we realised our fundamental connection to the land, to the entire ecosystem of our planet. We must see the earth as our source of life and realise that it is in need of urgent nurturing. Sustainability should be the key, as Senator Coulter was trying to point out in his speech yesterday, instead of what we have at the moment which is continued degradation of our environment. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say a few words in defence of grants to voluntary conservation groups. It must be said that some of the best and cheapest environmental research and monitoring is carried out by unpaid volunteers in the community. National Estate program grants contribute to the knowledge base of the Australian Heritage Commission, and other grants enable citizens to participate in environmental assessments and community education. The quality of community input and, ultimately, government decisions increases with the resources allocated to grants to voluntary conservation groups. </PARA>
<PARA> Particular bouquets could be given to many of these community groups which make valuable contributions. There could also be a string of requests for future funding. One request that I would like to support is that of Greening Australia for its national afforestation program for which it is seeking a $15m grant. It would indeed be money well spent. Nobody could argue with that in these days of greenhouse awareness. It is just one of many effective programs coordinated by Greening Australia including the Murray-Darling basin project, land care groups, rainforest species trials, a tree database, a schools nursery scheme and the conservation of remnant vegetation. I believe that all of them, especially the national afforestation program, are deserving of government support-and that is, of course, taxpayers' support. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area of gross disparity in Budget allocation in Australia over the last 10 years has been the proportion of our gross national product (GNP) allocated to the military and the proportion allocated to overseas aid. In terms of military expenditure there has been a slight drop in the proportion of GNP, but the massive drop in overseas aid expenditure from 0.49 per cent of GNP in 1983 to 0.34 per cent in the last financial year has now taken us below the average for development assistance committee member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Indeed, we now rank with the meanies like the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Switzerland, while the Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands give twice as much as we give in terms of percentage of GNP. </PARA>
<PARA> Two issues are at stake. The first question is how seriously are we prepared to try to eradicate poverty in a world where the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer on a much greater scale than is happening even here in Australia. The second question is how we view the best investment we can make for Australia's future security. In other words, do we invest in more expensive military equipment, or do we invest in the economic security of our neighbours? I would like to suggest that we take seriously the proposal that Australia increases aid to 0.4 per cent of GNP this year en route to reaching the target of 0.5 per cent by 1992 as recommended by the recent report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau and the Australian aid program. That figure has also been mentioned as a target by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans). </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to reiterate the point made by the World Commission on Environment and Development which recognised a clear link between environmental destruction and poverty. They are one and the same problem. If we are concerned about the world environment we must do something about eliminating poverty, debt reduction and bringing about fair trade. Economic and environmental issues are greater threats to our security than our military ones. Increasingly the world's people are realising this. We must address those real threats now. That is why I chose to contrast the relative rise in military expenditure with the slashing of the aid budget. There are those who say that we cannot afford it, but I suggest that we cannot afford not to increase our aid budget. The very future of the planet and its people is at stake. </PARA>
<PARA> In convincing the Australian people that we should be increasing the aid budget, it is crucial to make the point that aid is not a one-way street. It is of mutual benefit to all involved. Close to 80 per cent of what we spend in aid comes back to this country anyway. As our neighbours become more prosperous they want to increase foreign trade. We have already seen the result of the increasing prosperity of some of our Asian neighbours who now want to buy our agricultural produce, visit Australia as tourists, or utilise some of our other skills and services, such as education. There is much talk around Australia about our economic difficulties as there was earlier in this debate and, in such a climate, I recognise the difficulty of getting people to understand how much worse it is in much of Africa and Latin America. Real incomes here have fallen 10 per cent to 25 per cent during the 1980s. In the 37 poorest countries spending on health per capita halved and on education it was cut by 25 per cent in the same period. In half of the developing countries, primary school attendance is actually falling because students cannot afford to go to school and in many cases governments are not putting the necessary facilities in place for them. These figures come from the 1989 United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) report on the state of the world's children. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia we complain about the trade imbalance with the United States just as the Americans complain about their trade relationship with Japan, yet this is nothing when we consider that overall money is flowing out of the poor countries to the rich ones to the tune of about $68 billion a year. Australia has seriously cut funds to UNICEF and to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities since the early 1980s. I believe that we should announce our intention to rejoin the International Fund for Agricultural Development, and I hope that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will soon make an announcement to this effect. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth recalling that throughout the 1960s and 1970s Australia was one of the most generous aid donors. Since then, our international standing, particularly our standing with developing country neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region, has been severely undermined by the harsh cuts in overseas aid since the Australian Labor Party (ALP) Government came to office. It is also worth remembering that this same Government was elected in 1983 with a platform commitment to achieve 0.7 per cent of GNP to be allocated to overseas aid within five years of being elected. At the 1988 ALP National Conference, following commitments made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that the level of GNP allocated to aid would not drop any further, this commitment was written into the ALP platform as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 33. Eliminating the disparities between rich and poor is one of the major challenges of our time. Labor accepts this challenge as an urgent priority. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, Labor will-</PARA>
<PARA> 34. Maintain its commitment to achieve the UN target for official development assistance (ODA) of 0.7% of Gross National Product . . . Labor will seek to ensure that the ODA as a percentage of GNP does not fall below the present level and will seek to provide real and definite increases as budgetary circumstances permit. </PARA>
<PARA>`As budgetary circumstances permit' is the opting out clause. Finally, on this point I think it is worth quoting the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade which I referred to earlier. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's continued commitment to achieve the 0.7 per cent target is in real danger of becoming purely rhetorical. </PARA>
<PARA>I deliberately do not advocate spending more money on aid at a time when so many other items of government expenditure are being cut. I am not advocating that alone. That is why I continue to advocate, for example, that one per cent of defence expenditure be transferred to the overseas aid budget as an initial contribution to real security in the region. Obviously, much more could be transferred but I suggest that this one per cent transfer is a realistic goal to start with. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course it will not be easy but I think that this reallocation would be enthusiastically received by a large proportion of thinking Australians, who understand that we can build security much more effectively this way than by following the more traditional military path. Militarisation is increasingly being seen as a gross injustice to the poverty stricken and oppressed masses. Maybe it is hard for some Australians even to conceptualise the problems suffered by the majority of the world's people because of our relatively privileged position on the world stage. Militarisation is a gross violation of human rights. Increasingly, it is being seen as outmoded and counterproductive in terms of international relations and an immoral waste of human and financial resources. Australia, as a relatively unthreatened nation, with no natural enemies, could be a model for a move away from the extreme negativism of a military notion of national security to a more positive approach based on a better sharing of the world's resources. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak on these appropriation and supply Bills with a certain amount of relish. I do so because of the cavalier fashion in which the Government responded to the urgency motion moved yesterday to the effect that we ought to do something about improving our overseas competitiveness. It really is most urgent that we do something about that matter. The economy has been drifting for some years now, despite the protestations of the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) and the Opposition. The Minister for Finance was reduced to a case of extremism to the point of offering his resignation because the Government would not listen to the kind of advice that he was giving it. After witnessing Senator Button's giggling gibberish in his reply yesterday, Senator Maguire garbling his usual socialist platitudes, Senator Aulich presenting, in his most plausible and reasonable way, a whole lot of soft soap and snake oil as if he expected us to believe what he was saying-it was almost as if he believed what he was saying himself-I am constrained to reply in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Six Bills are now being debated cognately-three appropriation Bills and three supply Bills. They are designed to provide money for the ordinary services of Government between July and November at which time the Budget 1989-90 Bills will come into effect. At the moment, Australia is faced with a dangerous situation. The high level of foreign debt that we must service means that the interest component is mounting year by year. It will be passed on to our children, our heirs and assigns, forever and ever; and the cost is mounting. It cannot be serviced-not readily, at any rate. Australia's high foreign debt represents the savings of other people. But, as was mentioned in the debate yesterday, Australia's living standards, simply because of that debt, are declining. The way matters are organised at the moment means that our future is insecure. Our current account deficit is over $14 billion for the year-</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Stone" NAMEID="LJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator Stone</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was for 10 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BJ4">Senator SHEIL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the first 10 months of the current financial year. It was forecast at $9 billion for the whole year. It is $14 billion for the first 10 months, so it will probably wind up around $17 billion for the year. If we continue the way that we are going, next year it will reach $25 billion-$2 billion a month. It is hard even to conceive that the country could be involved with figures such as those. To fix the problem, we must borrow more, earn more or sell some assets such as land. Unease is being felt as a result of sales of land and increasing foreign ownership. Not only Japan but also other countries are buying up Australian land. And why not? When Australian assets can be picked up at bargain basement prices and the value of their currency is high while the value of our dollar is low, why should they not do that? Our net foreign debt is already around $100 billion. When Mr Hawke took over it was about $23 billion-a manageable amount. In that short space of a few years, it has quadrupled to $100 billion. It is being nudged along of course by these successive monthly deficits which, by the looks of it, are gradually increasing and also by the fall in the Australian dollar.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our consumer price index is moving up. At the moment, it is nearly 7 per cent-and we can safely say-and mounting. Interest rates are high. They are currently at 16 per cent and even 19 per cent in some areas. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) says he will not hesitate to use interest rates as a weapon if he thinks fit. The Government, despite its protestations, has not cut its spending. We had the usual charade of the Premiers Conference and the Loan Council meetings last week. There were some savage cuts to States' spending and their ability to borrow but the Federal Government has not cut its own expenditure at all although it says it has done that. </PARA>
<PARA> The famous accord between the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions is a failure. They claim that it is not but one has only to look at the figures to see that productivity has not increased. Therefore, real wages have not been provided for and our living standards are down. Our international competitiveness is down. After all, we are an exporting nation and international competitiveness is important to us. Our dollar has fallen in value and our credit rating is down. In other words, all the lights are flashing either yellow or red on our economic indicator board but the Government, up until now, has not taken any notice of it. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that the Treasurer is now starting to show signs of insecurity. Certainly Senator Button and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) are showing signs of insecurity. And it is about time because we have been warning them for a long time. They have thrown the argument back to us and said, `What would you do in circumstances such as this?'. From this side, I have heard the argument put many times as to what we would do. I have not heard the Government mention opening up the mining industry. The Government's policy on mining is abysmal for Australia. If the Government changed its mining policy, this area, on its own, could almost pay off our debt within a few years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government talks of micro-economic reform in waterfront, coastal shipping, transport and communications. In the sugar industry, the Government has pulled the plug on the interstate sugar agreement and is removing the embargo against imports of sugar. This is all very well. The sugar industry will adapt to this but the Government did not do its homework on this matter. It had to be referred to a Senate committee of inquiry, which came out with a reasonable arrangement for removal of the sugar embargo. But the Committee did not pay attention to the cost of transporting sugar round our coast. The cost of shipping and handling is enormous, and it has been shown that proper reform in that area would save the Government approximately $2 billion-just that one measure. But that has not been done, and I can confidently predict that, if the arrangements stay as they are, it will be a lot cheaper to import sugar from surrounding sugar-producing countries than to take it round our own coast from our own production areas. That is a sorry state of affairs. We have seen a similar situation in relation to the wheat legislation. The Government has deregulated one end of the system, the wheat growers, but not the other end, transport and handling. In those areas we could save an enormous amount of money and make ourselves more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer (Mr Keating), in introducing his last Budget, predicated the whole strategy on high commodity prices. He punted on his luck, and he was reasonably lucky, but he cannot go on being lucky forever. It now looks as though commodity prices are going to drop. That will derail the Treasurer's whole Budget strategy. He has refused to change it up until now, but it looks as if the Government is coming to its senses-at least, I hope so-and is going to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to deal now with a matter that is causing some public comment-health. I do not think that there is one area of the whole health industry that is happy with the way it is being run by the Government at the moment-from the pharmacists to the pathologists, the radiologists, the general practitioners, the Australian Medical Association, all the doctors and health-care providers and the nursing fraternity, plus the hospitals, nursing homes and hostels. If one were to go to any area of health administration in Australia today one would find the people there unhappy. They are unhappy because of Medicare. Medicare is the fundamental and basic cause of the whole problem. It is not as if the Government has not been warned about this for many years. I have warned it myself. However, I do not intend to go over the whole argument. I am getting sick and tired of saying these things to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to the way in which the Government handles legislation that it brings into the House of Representatives. The health Bills are a very good example, but not the only one. The Government brings legislation in subject to the guillotine. It allows only a limited time for debate-maybe one or two speakers on major legislation that is going to have far-reaching effects on many aspects of health. After limited debate the Bills are put to the vote. They do not even get to the committee stage. Any amendments that the Opposition may have are not even discussed; they just have to be tabled. This is a very sour way to deal with Bills. It is a travesty of the political process. It shows the importance of having a Senate, where these things can at least be given time for discussion. At the moment we are having problems because of the cut-off date for Bills in the Senate-when we will discuss them and when we will not. The Government blames the Senate because we have a cut-off date, but it jams so much legislation through the House of Representatives in a limited time that this sort of thing is inevitable. It is not the Senate's fault at all. We have just tried to bring some sanity into the legislative process, and the Government will not see eye to eye with it. </PARA>
<PARA> The current package of health legislation is a big one affecting a lot of areas. In particular, it affects medical insurance, which is the fundamental backbone, the driving force, of the whole private sector of health. It affects the elderly, the pensioners; it affects the way general practitioners will practise in the future; and it affects the medical insurance industry itself. Fundamentally, the Government is opting out of its responsibilities in that area. At the moment the main problem about medical insurance arises at the expensive end of the business. I refer to elderly people who require expensive long term care. In that area the Government has progressively reduced its contribution over the years. It has said that care of the elderly has to be handed back to the private insurance industry, that the burden has to be shared by the insurance companies there. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has cut its contribution from about $450m to $100m, and to just $1m this year-a token amount. Of course, this is driving the insurance companies to the wall. They are not going to be able to provide insurance, yet all the Government wants to do is give them a one-shot, quick fix of $20m-largely, I would say, to take medical insurance off the agenda for the next Federal election in the hope of putting it to bed so that it will not become an issue. But the $20m would only exacerbate the problem and take us further down the road of disruption of private medical insurance. That may be the Government's goal. Perhaps it wants us all to be on Medicare and to have nobody on private medical insurance. Right now the medical insurance companies are in a very dangerous position because of the withdrawal of government funding. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to go on talking about health at this stage. The Bills will be brought into the House of Representatives tonight, I think, so they will be coming over to the Senate next week. This is the only place where they will get a full airing and a decent debate. I notice that the Democrats are going to support the proposal to send the issues of medical insurance and general practitioners' rebates to Senate committees. It is high time those things were inquired into in a big way. I just hope that the committees can report back before our medical insurance industry is completely on its beam ends. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the amendment that was foreshadowed by Senator Stone. It is a long one. Let me read just the first part, which seeks to add at the end of the motion:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . condemns the Government for its failure to pursue policies which will address the twin evils of a dangerous level of foreign debt and declining living standards, leading to a growing loss of control over the future of Australia . . . </PARA>

Just prior to the previous division there was a loud interjection from Senator Puplick which I believe was unparliamentary. I seek your advice as to how we might achieve a ruling on that and a withdrawal. Senator Puplick referred to the Minister at the table, the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus), as not being able to organise a brothel on a battleship. I consider that demeaning not only to women but also to members of the armed forces, and inappropriate language for this chamber.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to draw attention to the fact that, even though the last remarks of Senator Puplick might have been considered unparliamentary, the Government obviously cannot organise a chook raffle. We had in here a junior Minister, the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus), controlling the final stages of the debate on the Appropriation Bills. He was handling the final stages of the Appropriation Bills, the most important part of the Government's Budget, yet he had no idea that an amendment was being moved against his Government by Senator Stone and he did not know whether he ought to oppose it. He had to be shaken into action by his Whip, who had absolutely no idea what was going on either.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) is in the chamber because I wish to ask one or two questions regarding the Department of Transport and Communications, which is a portfolio he represents. I have been concerned for some time, as I know the Minister has, with the operations of Imparja Television of Central Australia in Alice Springs. Some recent press publicity has been given to the possible takeover by Imparja of the television broadcasting operations of the Port Pirie commercial licensee and also the associated operations in Broken Hill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The history of Imparja is well known. But there has been some concern about its capacity to carry on its broadcasting activities in Alice Springs due to a shortage of money. The Federal Government has been supporting the operations of this Aboriginal station to the tune of something like $3.6m or $3.8m a year. As I understand it, the Government is virtually underwriting all of the cost of operating the station. There is concern in the northern part of my State of South Australia about the service, which is currently based in Port Pirie and, of course, just across the New South Wales border in Broken Hill. Are there any plans or negotiations which may entail the absorption into Imparja of the commercial licences which are currently operated from Port Pirie and Broken Hill?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The situation in Tibet was, of course, the subject of quite sustained activity by my predecessor, Mr Hayden, who visited that country and made clear the Government's concern about a number of human rights issues. Since I have been Foreign Minister I have raised the question on two or three occasions with my counterpart, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, making the point that, while we accept Chinese sovereignty over Tibet and do not want in any way to be taking issue with China's status in that respect, we do, nonetheless, believe that there is a case for dialogue between the Chinese authorities and the Dalai Lama and, of course, the people the Dalai Lama represents. We have expressed concern about the occasional violence which has erupted in Tibet from time to time in recent months and recent years and have expressed the hope that the situation can be satisfactorily resolved and that the human rights and other related concerns that the Tibetan people have had can be addressed in a sensitive way.</PARA></TALK.START>

Secondly, can he tell me whether he is likely to be discussing any proposals to establish embassies in some of those countries to which at present our ambassadors may be accredited? Is there any intention to establish additional embassies in countries in respect of which our ambassadors may be accredited on a non-resident basis?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no intention of making a statement on the question of overseas representation, not least because I have no intention whatsoever of closing any further missions. My objective in life is, rather, the contrary-to open some more. I have identified some priorities in this respect if funds can possibly be made available. I do not think it is a terribly satisfactory alternative to extend the accreditation of missions on a non-resident basis although, from time to time, that is an option that is forced upon us by staff shortages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think some of this speculation has been generated by newspaper reports about average staffing level cuts in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of some 78 proposed for this year. Can I just simply say that although it is going to be a problem for us to accommodate those staff cuts this, by and large, is a task that has been confronting us for some time. It has been in the pipeline and it rather represents an accumulation of obligations in previous years. We think we will be able to accommodate the cuts without any adverse impact on our representation abroad and certainly not in terms of forcing any further closures. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point I wish to raise with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade concerns recent statements made by Aung San Suu Kyi, a leading opposition figure in Burma. About three weeks ago it was reported in the press that she had made a statement criticising Australia's supposedly ambivalent attitude towards opposition to the present regime in Burma. Only recently on the weekend, she was interviewed on the Special Broadcasting Service program Dateline and again made the comment that Australia's attitude towards restoration of democracy and human rights in Burma was being compromised because we had economic interests at stake. This has led to some concern on her part that we are not as forthright as we should be in supporting democracy and full human rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a senator with some interest in Burmese affairs, I wonder whether the Foreign Minister can put on the record clearly the Government's position on this matter and, in particular, whether the aid programs that have been restored, or partially restored-namely, the Mandalay dairy project and the water program in the dry areas of north-west Burma-are in fact in accordance with our policies on humanitarian aid. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to take the opportunity to do just that. The Australian Government has in fact been very surprised by reports that the Burmese Opposition Leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has expressed doubts about Australia's sincerity and speculated that our relations with the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council, or SLORC as it is called, may have a commercial motive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia's policy towards Burma remains one of unequivocal support for democracy and political and economic reform. Our diplomatic contacts with the Saw Maung regime, as indeed with a wide range of opposition parties and groups, have been entirely appropriate and correct. The Government has never indicated support for the regime, for the way it came to power or for its continued suppression of opposition groups. On the contrary, we have been active in encouraging the Burmese authorities to hold an early general election, not least through the person of our roving parliamentary diplomat extraordinaire, Senator Schacht, and to improve the observance of human rights. As a result of these efforts, Australia is widely regarded within Burma as having contributed to the authorities' decision on 16 February, announced at the time of Senator Schacht's stay in the country, to announce a timetable for elections in April-May 1990. While we naturally want to protect Australia's commercial interests, actual and potential, in Burma and be in a position to take advantage of opportunities which may arise, interest from the Australian business community in Burma is, I have to say, limited. Two-way trade is quite negligible at the moment, amounting to just $22 1/2m in 1987-88. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of aid, apart from continuing humanitarian aid through the United Nations Children's Fund the only Australian aid project in Burma at present is the Mandalay dairy development project, which was reactivated in March but only to ensure that that project would not collapse and that its socioeconomic benefits, which are aimed at addressing a wide cross-section of farmers and other members of the Mandalay community, were not put at risk. In fact, the $14m investment had been at considerable risk of being completely wasted as a result of problems that were arising with the unsupervised assembly of complicated plant components. It was for that reason that the project was reactivated to ensure that it would be brought to fruition without destroying the investment. Decisions on the resumption of other project activities will be subject to the Government's ongoing assessment of the administrative, logistic and infrastructural environment in Burma. </PARA>

In view of the rapidity of the progress being made, it may be that within the next few months Australia will be involved in an international conference and be asked to upgrade or establish some representation in Cambodia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a little premature to be talking in terms of making appropriations and preparing for a resumption of diplomatic representation in the way that Senator Schacht is suggesting. As I said on 6 April, in answer to a question from Senator Schacht, what we might do in that respect depends very much on the character of the internal settlement that is reached, assuming that the external dimensions of this fall into place later this year with the withdrawal of the Vietnamese. I repeat that it very much depends on the character of the internal settlement, when it is reached and how and in what circumstances. Once a settlement is achieved, as we hope it will be by the end of this year, the Government's intention is certainly to resume diplomatic representation in Phnom Penh as soon as possible. What will be possible is simply impossible for me to speculate about at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have indicated on a number of occasions our willingness to participate in any conference that might be convened in the next few months to address these questions and give some international imprimatur to them. Equally, in the context of any control mechanism, we have indicated that we would be very willing to consider participation in any peacekeeping force that might be established under such international auspices. Again, the nature of any such participation would depend wholly on the nature of the settlement and, accordingly, the nature of the task to be done. Of course, there is also an aid dimension to all this. We do not have a government to government aid program in Cambodia at the moment, although there is some support through multilateral and non-government organisations. We are very conscious of the intense suffering of the Cambodian people over an extended period. We would be keen to resume a proper bilateral aid relationship in the context of an effective settlement which, as I say, we hope will occur later this year. No financial provision has been made for that at this stage. It will depend on circumstances as they unfold. But in the context of both Cambodia and Vietnam, it is to be hoped that circumstances will allow the resumption of a proper bilateral aid program as well as bilateral effective diplomatic representation before very much longer. </PARA>

I do not expect the Minister to forecast any budgetary context, but what is the general context that the Minister engages in with regard to reviewing the base contributions to various organisations, in particular the base contribution to UNICEF, which is currently at the very low figure of $3.3m? Is this an annual review? Does the Government have any intention, in any review which it does undertake, of trying to estimate the effectiveness and efficiency of the various bodies to which it contributes money, and might not bodies which have shown a good track record in terms of very low overheads be those types of bodies which could conceivably see an increase in their base contribution?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is introducing a system of annual reviews of United Nations (UN) agencies, both voluntarily funded and in respect of which there is a committed funding obligation. Those reviews are presently before Cabinet. It is my intention that once Cabinet has looked at this and decided on it, the review documents themselves will be made public in order that we might get a better informed debate going about the worth of the contribution made by these respective organisations. I am able to say that the United Nations Children's Fund brushes up very well in our analysis of its performance and the return in terms of valuable programs for the dollars that we expend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cannot say a great deal about our budgetary strategy, for reasons that Senator Macklin acknowledges, except that the basic way in which I approach these issues of essentially discretionary funds as distinct from locked in funding is to try if at all possible to maintain the same real level from year to year. That is what I will be seeking to do with the UN voluntary funded organisations in this coming year. Of course if we can do better than that in the case of the more deserving programs, I would be delighted. But we have to pay some realistic attention to the condition of the overall fiscal objectives of the Government this year, and more particularly to some of the particular problems we have in the aid budget as a result of an accumulation of locked in contributions to international financial institutions which are going to make demands on the aid budget next year considerably in excess of the forward estimate, which is based on last year's budget taken forward on the same real basis. So there will be a real squeeze in terms of the ability to find money for other programs. It will be a fairly heroic achievement if I can get a sufficient increase one way or another to enable us to maintain the same real funding. That is what I am seeking to achieve, and I hope that is a sufficient response. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator can make her peace with him and I will give her a reply now. The Government is giving some consideration to the extension of the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS), which is currently received primarily in capital cities and some country areas. The Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) is certainly aware of growing interest in regional areas, including Tasmania, in receiving SBS. As a partial response to that interest the Government has initiated two measures which enable country viewers in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania to receive SBS if they have the required receiving equipment. Firstly, the encoding requirement on satellite distribution of the SBS signal was removed in 1987, by me, allowing those with domestic satellite receiving dishes, which pick up the Australian Broadcasting Corporation satellite service, also to receive SBS. Secondly, the introduction of a self-help rebroadcasting reception scheme enables communities to fund satellite reception facilities to pick up the SBS satellite signal and to rebroadcast it for reception in the same way other services are received in the home. For example Wagga Wagga in New South Wales now receives the SBS service through that community self-help scheme, which I would recommend to some of the smaller Tasmanian communities which might otherwise be denied reception.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The allocation of substantial resources is involved in any formal extension of the SBS in other ways to additional areas. The Government is giving consideration to that, and will certainly be taking into account the representations of all the Tasmanian members of this Parliament in our examination of Tasmania, hopefully and possibly being one of the first areas to receive the SBS service. Again I make the point that obviously there are resource implications for this which may make it difficult otherwise than through the self-help scheme or the direct satellite reception options to which I have referred. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise some matters concerning the Australian Capital Territory. They arise out of self-government, not surprisingly, and what is or will be the relationship between the Commonwealth and the new self-government which is finally in place. The first area of concern that I have is in relation to the payment for national functions. The Minister will recall that there was a clear undertaking within the self-government package that the Commonwealth would continue to pay for national functions and that the Territory Government and the community of the Territory would be paying for Territory functions. There seems to be considerable ambiguity in relation to certain functions which primarily would be said to be national but which, nevertheless, provide a service for Australian Capital Territory residents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We saw it first last year only within one month of the self-government package passing in relation to the National Botanic Gardens, the National Botanic Gardens clearly being a national function. Nevertheless, the education services that were provided in respect of the Botanic Gardens were abandoned on the basis that it was seen that they provided a benefit for residents of the Territory. This raised considerable concerns as to whether the same principle would be applied in relation to services provided in conjunction with the Australian National Gallery or the National Library. I would like to know what the Government's position is in that regard. For example, with respect to education services provided in both of those institutions, is the Government accepting that they will remain Commonwealth functions with Commonwealth financial responsibility or will it seek to pass at least part of that financial responsibility across to the new self-governing Territory?</PARA>

That has not been worked out or even addressed yet, at least not in any way that is capable of communication to me at this stage.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last evening in speaking to a report on homeless youth I made passing reference to an Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) television program I happened to watch on Thursday evening of last week. Last evening the Senate rose early and one was able to return early to one's place of rest in this fair city. In my case I did my ironing. I switched on the television and had the unfortunate experience of yet again having to view a program hosted by Peter Couchman. I rise to my feet today in case my remarks of yesterday on one particular program that went wrong are misinterpreted as an attack on youth. Unfortunately, in my opinion last night's program, the theme of which was men, also went wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am concerned that perhaps the Australian Broadcasting Commission is getting too much money and needs to waste it by presenting forums such as I have experienced on the last two occasions that I have watched this program. I shall not be watching it again because it added nothing to the two themes that it talked about, mainly because of the intrusion of the audience's remarks. I shall be watching closely in future years when the ABC comes back to government for increases in funding. If it can waste its funds on programs such as the ones I have mentioned in the Senate yesterday and today, obviously it is getting too much money. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak about the method of taxing trust funds as handled by funeral directors for people who pay money to funeral directors so that when they die their funeral costs will be covered. There is a longstanding practice among many elderly people in Queensland and throughout Australia of paying money to a funeral director while they are still alive to cover their funeral. I think all honourable senators will have met old people who feel very strongly about this. It gives them peace of mind to know that their funeral is paid for and that they will not be a financial burden on their families when it comes to paying their funeral costs. Regrettably, it appears that this is about to change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thousands of elderly people in my State and throughout Australia who have put their savings into a prepaid funeral plan operated by funeral businesses are about to be notified that their contributions will not be enough to pay for their funeral after all. Because of a recent ruling by the Australian Taxation Office, income earned by the funds on their contribution will be taxed at the highest taxation rate of 49c in the dollar. On top of that, the fund money will be further whittled away because the funds will be required to pay, of all things, the Medicare levy and provisional tax with the 12 per cent inflationary factor. The burden, of course, ultimately will be passed on to the contributor. </PARA>
<PARA> Thousands of Queenslanders are going to be adversely affected by this ruling. The cruel irony is that many of them are at the stage of their lives where they no longer pay tax. From the information that I have, the vast majority of people who are concerned about their own funeral costs come from the lower socio-economic groups. They are going to be financially disadvantaged at a time when they can least afford it. The initial contribution which has been reinvested by the funeral benefit fund in a trust to keep pace with the cost of living will no longer cover their expenses. Unless this situation is rectified straight away, the elderly will have to increase their funeral contribution, if they still wish to be independent, or else the extra money will have to come out of the deceased's estate or be paid by the deceased's family. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that in most cases when people make those contributions they go away with a feeling in their hearts that they have done something which will mean that they will not be a burden on their families. This situation will cause widespread concern to those who prepay their own funerals. It will affect those in the community who are least able to look after themselves. A leading funeral director in Brisbane, Alex Gow Pty Ltd, advised me that 88 per cent of those contributors are 65 years or over. Very often many of those people suffer from ailments associated with growing old. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give the chamber an example of how the taxes will affect those funds. If, for example, 10 members each contributed $1,000, totalling $10,000, and the trust account was invested at, say, 12 per cent, the income from that would be $1,200. If the management fee, which is a reasonable figure of 2.5 per cent, accounts for $30, the income tax is assessed at 49 per cent, which represents $573.30, and there is a Medicare levy of 1.5 per cent, the net result is a return of about 5.8 per cent. On top of that, provisional tax, plus the 12 per cent, has to be paid. It is patently obvious that, with inflation the way it is, there is no way in the world that, after a period, that prepayment of the estimated cost of the funeral benefit will pay for the funeral when it occurs. </PARA>
<PARA> The way the system worked in the past was that the contribution was paid into a funeral benefit prearrangement plan and was reinvested in order that the amount kept up with the cost of living, which it usually did. Then, in 1982, the Queensland Government legislated with the State Funeral Benefits Business Act to require funeral benefits businesses to place contributions paid to them in a trust fund. This was quite a responsible move by the Queensland Government, because it put the funds into the trust fund, which made them safer. This is where the first problem arose, however, because it made them liable for tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act came into effect in 1984 and operators of funeral benefits schemes registered under the Friendly Societies Act automatically became registered under part (iii) of the new Act. Any previously unregistered and new schemes were required to register under part (iv) of the State Funeral Benefits Business Act. Prior to that legislation, businesses operated under the Friendly Societies Act. Under the new Act, only corporations can be registered to carry on a funeral benefit business and the maximum amount of benefit which may be applied to a funeral expense is $3,000. So there is no question of people using it as a tax haven. </PARA>
<PARA> Ever since these changes were made, funeral benefit businesses have been applying for a tax exemption for income generated by a funeral benefit fund, while it remains in the fund or is used for funeral expenses. It has taken until February this year for the Australian Taxation Office to make a ruling, and yet the original letters from the funeral businesses to the Tax Office were made in November 1986. It has taken nearly two years for that response to come in. Most funeral benefit businesses in Queensland still have not been officially informed of their tax liability. All they have received is a tax assessment. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the industry have not been officially informed that they will be liable for the Medicare levy and provisional tax. The Tax Office has merely started sending in assessments, with the charges included in the total liability. The industry even took the matter to the Ombudsman in an effort to have the tax position rectified, but with no success. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry is calling for a change to section 23 of the Income Tax Assessment Act specifically to include a funeral benefits business as registered under part (iii) and part (iv) of the Queensland Act 1982, and other similar Acts in other States, to obtain exemption on such funds. They believe, quite rightly, that prepaid funerals should enjoy a tax exempt status. After all, under the Social Security Act 1947, with the application of the assets test, a cemetery plot acquired for the person or funeral expenses paid in advance by the person, or the person's spouse, is disregarded. </PARA>
<PARA> The consumer has, in real terms, bought a commodity, a prearranged funeral, and, therefore, should not pay tax on the investment earnings. Funeral directors who hold the funds in trust cannot touch the money until the service is carried out. At this point they will be paid by the trustees and the money received will become part of general taxable income and will be taxed accordingly on the profits incurred, if any. It is believed that, should a contributor wish to withdraw from the fund, the income component of his or her account should be liable to taxation. No-one would dispute that. That tax could be deducted by the funeral director and forwarded to the Tax Office at the time of refund. It is suggested that in cases where there is an excess of a contributor's account after funeral expenses have been deducted, a pro rata income component of that excess, based on the original ratio of income versus principal before funeral expenses were deducted, should be taxed. The remainder of the excess would then be forwarded to the estate of the deceased.</PARA>
<PARA> Funeral directors all over the country, both small and large, have for many years been approached by people to hold money for them to cover their funeral expenses. Often funeral directors say to people who come to them, `Why do you not just put the money in a building society?. In the majority of cases it would not be taxed because of their stage of life. Or they suggest that people go to an insurance company, which is an avenue used in some States. The answer they get invariably is, `No, I want to be able to say that I have paid here and now for my funeral, so that I can go away and say that I am not going to be a burden on those who may have to cover that expense'. They should be allowed to continue to do so without fear of what I believe is a grossly unjust, unfair tax levied upon them. It is not as if the Government has not had some warning of this. As I said earlier, in November 1986 approaches were made to the Australian Taxation Office. People who run these trust funds in Queensland and in other States have approached members of this Parliament. The Hon. Ben Humphreys, Minister for Veterans' Affairs, wrote to the Taxation Office and received a reply on 30 September 1987. It is worth quoting the reply from the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation:</PARA>
<PARA> The matters which have been raised involve complex questions of taxation and commercial law and therefore have taken time to consider. Similar inquiries have also been received from other areas within the funeral benefits industry . . . </PARA>
<PARA>And so it goes on-typical bureaucratic gobbledegook. It is a simple matter: are these funds to be taxed or are they not? As I mentioned earlier, we have an incredible situation where people pay for their funeral and the taxation system is such that when that time comes, five, 10 or 15 years hence, the money that they paid is not sufficient. I think this an incredible injustice. People have written on behalf of contributors to the Treasurer, certainly in more recent times. The attitude of the Government is to ignore what is a patently fair and just approach. I understand that throughout Australia there are in excess of 100,000 people who want to pay their funeral expenses in advance. Their ability to do so is now at risk. It is up to the Government to make the amendment as suggested so that we can bring some justice to bear on this issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that all honourable senators are aware that in recent weeks and months the Australian community has been paying a great deal of attention to banking and how banks go about their business. Indeed, I have been giving it a good deal of my time in this chamber over the last five months. So much so that senior officers of the ANZ Bank asked to talk with me in Melbourne last week. We had a discussion and they suggested to me that perhaps I was the leader of the current bank bashing movement that is going on in Australia. The expression `bank bashing' I regard as quite inappropriate to describe the reaction of the community. It is suggestive of something that is irresponsible, something that is carried out by thugs in back alleys, whereas I believe that what is occurring in the community is a totally responsible process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have brought the matter into what I obviously regard and what the community regards as the supreme forum of the land and drawn to the attention of the community's elected representatives some of their concerns. Therefore, I consider the expression `bank bashing' to be a most inappropriate description of the process that is occurring within the community. It is a process of revelation, concern and investigation, a process which I attempted to formalise in the form of an inquiry. In that debate Senator Stone and others drew our attention to the fact that there has not been a formal inquiry into banking in this country since the mid-1930s. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the focus, then, of the concern that is being expressed within the community about banking and how banks go about their business? There have been a number of focuses. The one that I have specifically chosen over the last few months has been the serious allegations of corrupt practices and malpractices that have been brought to me which I have extended into observations about the general erosion of the ethos of banking in Australia since deregulation in 1984-85. Naturally the community's attention is more sharply focused on bank charges because they are what impact upon the Australian household day by day and month by month. The particular charges which have attracted the attention of the Australian community have been interest charges. I will be turning my attention to some aspects of interest charges in the next few minutes. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians are interested in the general cost of obtaining credit. They are interested in the fact that small accounts are being discriminated against by the banking system and that apparently unnecessary charges against the holders of small accounts are now common across the banking system at large. They are particularly concerned about the fact that the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) contemplates-and indeed, I think, has endorsed-the process whereby bankers now have access to up to 14 per cent of deposits made compulsory by recipients of social security-in other words, the right to garnishee up to 14 per cent of those deposits. These are the sorts of questions and observations about bank charges that Australians are particularly concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last three of four days their concern about these charges would appear to be totally justified in the light of the extraordinary profits-indeed the banks have even described them as super profits-that have been announced by Australia's leading banks. Honourable senators will be aware that in the last four or five days Westpac announced a record half-year profit of $366m, an increase of 63 per cent on its profit of the previous half-year. The National Australia Bank announced a profit of $408m, an increase of 52 per cent. Yesterday the ANZ announced a profit of $368m for the half-year, an increase of 60 per cent. Yet in the same breath, on the same day, the banks attempt to justify increases in mortgage interest rates of 0.5 and one per cent. We are advised in today's newspapers that the householder and the small borrower will be paying in the order of 17 or perhaps even 17.5 per cent in the very near future for a basic home mortgage. </PARA>
<PARA> And the banks wonder why the Australian community is showing an interest in the rates at which they are paying interest, to contribute to what the banks themselves describe as super profits! Super profits! What an extraordinary term to use to describe the billions of dollars that banks are taking on a half-yearly basis from average Australians, saying that they can justify them.</PARA>
<PARA> So record profits have become the major focus of the media in the last few days. It is inevitable, however, that interest rates, particularly mortgage interest rates, will be the concern of the average Australian. I am going to seek leave to table a document which will reveal to average Australians something they normally do not know about their mortgage interest rates. I seek leave to table a memorandum from the Executive Director (Banking) of the National Australia Bank which he sent to the general managers of all State divisions on 4 April 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this memorandum, which is signed by D. R. Argus, Executive Director (Banking) of the National Australia Bank, to all his State managers, Mr Argus predicts to his State managers that the foreclosure of interest rates will become a matter of great interest to the Australian community and Australian borrowers. He outlines the formula by which banks charge interest. Australian borrowers will be interested to know that they may be paying in the vicinity of 10.75 per cent more for their loans than they believe they are paying for them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Later I will read several paragraphs from the memorandum. Mr Argus says that they have surveyed the rates of interest being charged by National Australia Bank branches on borrowers and it is revealed that in various zones they are charging what he has called `B', or a base rate, a benchmark rate, but with loadings. I understand that these loadings are usually applied. It is indicated in this memorandum that the loadings vary in the case of the National Australia Bank-the date is April 1989-from plus 4.5 per cent up to plus 10.5 per cent over and above the base rate. </PARA>
<PARA> The base rates are advertised periodically in the metropolitan press, presumably with the intention of advising Australians of the rate at which they will borrow from their banks. In April the National Australia Bank advised Australians that they would be borrowing at a benchmark rate of 18.75 per cent, a base rate of 18.75 per cent, a home loan rate of 16 per cent and a home equity loan rate of 17 per cent, but it did not advise Australian borrowers that there were penalties or loadings ranging from plus 4.75 per cent to 10.5 per cent over and above that base rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Average Australians do not know what they are paying in interest rates unless they actually sit down when they get their bank statements and calculate in retrospect what they have paid as opposed to what they believed they would be paying. These loadings can be varied on a week by week basis without promulgation, without disclosure by law or by regulation. They are a variable available to and applied by the bankers of this country week by week and can be as high as 10.5 per cent on top of 18.5 per cent. I wonder how many Australian borrowers out there know that they are paying almost 30 per cent interest on their short term borrowings. I wonder how many Australians out there know that Australia's leading rural financier, non-bank, charges up to 43 per cent for short term bridging finance. This memorandum is in anticipation of the furore that will arise when all this is disclosed. It tells the bank how to cope with the problem. The last three paragraphs of this memorandum state:</PARA>
<PARA> It is imperative to ensure that no unwelcome disclosure results. Experience with the media to date on consumer related issues demonstrates clearly that relatively exceptional instances of customers dissatisfaction are readily portrayed as being typical of the institution and even of the industry involved. </PARA>
<PARA>These loadings are typical. They are declared in this memorandum to be typical of the banking industry at large, and particularly of this bank. The memorandum continues:</PARA>
<PARA> As a matter of urgency, branches should review all pricing practices which may have resulted in inappropriate customer charging or situations in which customers may be unaware of their current pricing status. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, change the practices-the scare is out, the panic is on-because of the process of disclosure. Attend to your books, attend to your rates, because it is going to be on. You bet it is going to be on! The memorandum continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Penalty rates should be looked at both in terms of defensible pricing, and in terms of disclosure rates and their application. This review should cover not only non-business consumers but also all small business loans and all loan accounts of rural customers. </PARA>
<PARA> Should you have any query on the implications of this initiative, please don't hesitate to contact me, as I see the management of this particular issue being very sensitive and vital in a climate of potential super profits being generated within the banking industry generally. </PARA>
<PARA>How right Mr D. R. Argus was in relation to the super profits-up by 60 per cent, 62 per cent and 52 per cent in the case of the three leading banks in this country in the last half-year. It is no wonder that the banks have started to suggest that they appoint, voluntarily at this stage, of course, an ombudsman. The fact is, and I have mentioned it to Mr Allan Cullen, the executive officer of the Australian Bankers Association, that I have had to be the ombudsman over the last eight months. That is why I have 200 cases in front of me. That is why I have been tabling these cases before the Senate. I will give the new ombudsman, or ombudswoman, his or her first 200 cases. All of a sudden, the banks are running scared. </PARA>
<PARA> The ombudsman issue is an attempt to hose down the revelation and the realities of what has been happening in banking in this country for decades. As was revealed in the debate over a potential inquiry, there has not been a process by which these factors and these realities could be revealed since the mid-1930s. Is it any wonder that Australians are up in arms about what is happening in banking?</PARA>
<PARA> This is not an irresponsible process of bank bashing. It is a process of investigation, revelation and demanding accountability for what banks themselves declare to be super profits, at an obscene level, at a time when the average Australian household has to bend its back incredibly even to have a roof over its head. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have before me the photocopies of two photographs. The first one was taken in 1951 in Rome on 6 April and shows nine young men about to leave Italy to come to Australia. Five of those men are now dead from asbestos-related diseases. Four are still alive but are sick and suffering from those same diseases. The other photograph was taken in the 1960s in Wittenoom. It shows 13 happy children in festive mood, some of them dressed up and sitting on the back of a cart. Of those 13 children, six are now dead from asbestos-related diseases. On 10 March 1981 in the other place, Mr Kerin asked the then Minister for Health a question upon notice, He asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Is asbestos included by the National Health and Medical Research Council on the list of human carcinogens?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer was:</PARA>
<PARA>The National Health and Medical Research Council does not maintain a comprehensive list of substances which may be carcinogenic to humans. The list of carcinogenic substances probably referred to is limited to know chemical carcinogens. This forms part of a document on model regulations for the use of industries which handle such substances. </PARA>
<PARA>He also asked:</PARA>
<PARA>If asbestos is not on the National Health and Medical Research Council list as a human carcinogen, what is the reason?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer was:</PARA>
<PARA>It is obviously more useful to the professions, industry and consumers to provide information, advice, codes of practice, guidelines and other such documents on specific materials likely to cause health hazards than merely to produce lists. </PARA>
<PARA>It must be obvious to all honourable senators here that this is a kind of doublespeak. This sort of obfuscation over a period of years by various governments has been instrumental in the suffering and death of the children and young men in the photos that I previously spoke about. But I shall be more direct. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>Mesothelioma is a malignant tumour of the tissue lining the lung. It is causally associated with asbestos. </PARA>
<PARA>That means that one needs to be in contact with asbestos fibres to suffer from the disease. The quote continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Western Australia has one of the highest incidences in the world because of the exposure of large numbers of workers at the Wittenoom Gorge asbestos mines. Whereas 15 years ago there were one to two cases of mesothelioma per annum in Western Australia, there are now 30 to 40 new cases per annum and this incidence continues to rise alarmingly . . . such that we can expect 300 to 500 cases before the year 2000 in Western Australia alone. Unfortunately neither surgery nor radiotherapy nor chemotherapy improves survival and the disease is uniformally fatal with the median survival time being only 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA>There has been documentation over the years going way back. I will cite some of that documentation. Way back in 1918, the last year of the First World War, it was the practice of American and Canadian insurance companies not to insure asbestos workers due to the assumed health injurious condition of the industry. There were various reports of asbestos-related diseases throughout the 1920s. In the 1930s there were numerous reports of asbestosis. In 1931 the British Government amended its workers compensation laws to cover asbestosis. In 1943, in Australia the Baryulgil mine began operation in New South Wales. Also in 1943, CSR Ltd operated a blue asbestos mine at Wittenoom in Western Australia and called the company Australian Blue Asbestos Ltd. Also in 1943, Dr J. McNulty, who at the time was the government radiologist in Kalgoorlie, told Mr Charles Oliver of the AWU of the hazards of asbestos exposure. In 1944, CSR operated a white asbestos mine in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1948 Dr Eric Saint serviced Wittenoom as a flying doctor. On his first visit to Wittenoom he immediately wrote to the Commissioner of Public Health in Perth warning him of the danger of asbestos and at the same time he warned Australian Blue Asbestos likewise. In 1949 the United Kingdom Parliament received a report which linked asbestosis to carcinoma of the lungs and stated that the length of exposure necessary to contract asbestosis could be as low as six months and, for carcinoma, 18 months. The report was available in Western Australia in 1951. </PARA>
<PARA> We carry on with the sad and sorry saga. In 1954 the annual Mines Inspector's report on Australian Blue Asbestos stated that the situation in the mill was disgraceful, with severe dust concentration polluting the entire plant, but added that the most effective remedy would be to exhaust large volumes of air through the roof of the mill building. In 1958 the first diagnosis of asbestosis was made in Wittenoom. In 1959 the annual report of the Health Department of Western Australia drew attention to the number of men affected by asbestos-caused diseases. In 1959 the first case of pleural mesothelioma was diagnosed in South Africa. In 1961 Dr McNulty, in a confidential letter to the Under Secretary of Mines, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>It would appear that repeated advice and warnings of the health hazard from asbestos dust have been ineffective and that strong action will need to be taken. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1962 the first case of pleural mesothelioma was diagnosed outside South Africa, in an ex-Wittenoom mill worker, as reported by Dr McNulty. </PARA>
<PARA> The saga goes on. In 1966, mesothelioma was listed as a prescribed disease for worker's compensation. In 1977 the first autopsy was reported to the workers at Baryulgil in New South Wales. This was the first time those workers, who were mainly Aboriginal people, became aware that asbestos was harmful. In fact, they had been told that asbestos-related diseases could only affect non-Aboriginal people. It is a sad fact that the majority of workers at the Wittenoom mines and the Wittenoom mill in Western Australia were migrant workers. I have in my possession the translation of a pathetic letter which was written to the Italian Consulate in Perth relating how nine Italian immigrants wanted to leave Wittenoom and work no more in the dreadful conditions which they found there. This was not allowed. They had to stay there. Four pounds a week was taken out of their wages to help pay back the fare that had brought them to Australia. They were stuck there. They had no escape. Yet we read in the leading article in the West Australian newspaper on 23 May 1958:</PARA>
<PARA> The new mill under construction at Wittenoom will double output and add more than $2m annually to the State's mineral wealth. State Governments have assisted the industry and their faith in the enterprise is now being amply rewarded, but only a company of the status of the CSR could have ridden out the crises which have beset the industry. The Wittenoom story contains several lessons. The most important is that thriving mining centres can attract population to the empty North. </PARA>
<PARA>But at what price? We all know the more recent history. We have all read in the newspapers of the claims before the courts. But, before moving on to that aspect, I draw to the Senate's attention some extracts of letters that were written in the early 1960s. On 20 September, 1961 a letter was written to a Dr Rennie, a doctor associated with the CSR mines, by a physician, Dr D. D. Letham, who worked in the occupational health section. He states:</PARA>
<PARA>I have been able to locate in Perth records of 12 cases of asbestosis, plus three probable cases, four cases of silicosis or silicotuberculosis, six cases of probable silicosis and one in which asbestosis and silicosis both appear to be prominent. </PARA>
<PARA> When it is known that the labour turnover at Wittenoom has been high, this is indeed a large number of cases . . . </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that early conditions at Wittenoom were appalling. I have had several eyewitnesses' description of the dust around the mill being so thick as to preclude vision for more than a few yards . . . </PARA>
<PARA> It is essential that the management do not rest content with the fact that they have spent so many thousands of pounds on ventilation but that they should not rest content until they are satisfied that their employees are adequately protected. I am suggesting that the Company itself should take an active interest in measuring dust levels. If they are found to be consistently high then steps must be taken to lower the dust levels to those regarded as `safe'. Surely this is the least that can be asked of a company with such a poor record of interest in the health of their employees. </PARA>
<PARA>Another letter to Dr Rennie, this time by Dr Hunt, who was a respiratory specialist, is dated 25 September 1962. It is quite a friendly letter in part. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> My dear Ted, this matter cannot possibly be allowed to rest. . . After examining the evidence which has been produced for you I find it very difficult to believe that a reputable public company could remain in its apparently self-satisfied state and continue to allow the asbestos mining industry to go on killing men unfortunate enough to be employed in it. If however the present situation is to remain unaltered I would feel it my bounden duty to bring the matter to the personal attention of the Premier. I would prefer not to have to do this. I do not want to cause worry and possible distress to a very good friend of mine named Rennie, and I prefer not to start a bout of public mud slinging. Surely you will come and see for yourself, following which I am confident that any further action on my part would be unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Now a letter from Dr Rennie, also dated 1961:</PARA>
<PARA>Apparently, it is quite possible to be so badly dusted as to be totally and permanently incapacitated within four or five years. Both doctors are of the opinion that very urgent action is required . . . As you know, in Western Australia at the present time we are endeavouring to boost our production in every possible way and a public outcry is not going to help to attract Western Australian mining capital to the State. It would also, I am sure, bring about very considerable difficulties for the Company in securing and maintaining an adequate labour force. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Rennie then instances figures relating to diseased workers as being quite horrifying. Today these people have to go before the courts and press very hard for workers compensation. Some workers compensation has now been granted to people. I have here a memo dated 21 November, 1984 written by the Director General of Mines to a Minister in the Western Australian Government. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>In hindsight, it is difficult to understand how the situation could have been allowed to continue; however, it must be remembered that Wittenoom was then one of the few mining operations in the State outside the Goldfields and it was heavily subsidised. If a decision had been made to close the mine it is most unlikely that this action would have received support from either the general public or the miners, as few would have believed that the health situation was sufficiently serious. The company had threatened on at least one occasion (in 1962) that because of demands being made by the Mines Department for improved dust-control equipment, and in view of the low profitability of the operation, the mine might have to close. </PARA>
<PARA> That sets the scene in a nutshell. We know what we have been up against. When we read in the press of people having to struggle to gain compensation and when we read in the press that the State Government Insurance Commission of Western Australia is trying to delay settlement of claims so that people are dying before they receive compensation, it puts a bitter edge to the very sad story. </PARA>
<PARA> But something can be done. Currently, research is being carried out in Western Australia by Dr Bruce Robinson and his team. However, the money for that research will run out later this year. I conclude my speech with an appeal to the Federal Government that, as Medicare expenses, that is, the Australian taxpayer, are now subsidising a lot of the treatment for these people, it would be most apt for the Federal Government to donate very generously to the research being carried out in Western Australia which, as is acknowledged all over the world-I have letters here from the United States of America to say so-is the best place for this research. Unfortunately, Western Australia, with its large number of asbestos-related cases of disease, is the best laboratory in the world for this research to be carried out. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Tasmania)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(1.29)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 proposes to amend the Defence Act 1903 to exempt Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd (ADI) for a transitional period of six years from certain State and Territory laws, charges, taxes and rates. The Opposition understands that the amendments will exempt ADI from being liable to pay approximately $16m in State and Territory stamp duty on the transfer of establishments to the new corporation and will also help them in avoiding the costs of complying with State and Territory regulatory laws for a period of six years, a transitional period, to allow the new corporation to get on a commercial basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition is not prepared to oppose this legislation because we believe that there is an urgent need for ADI to become commercial as soon as possible. The Government has had our support in the establishment of ADI Pty Ltd. It also has our support in the reduction of the number of personnel that have been involved in defence production. Quite rightly the Government has reduced the number of people who were employed in the Department of Defence Support from 15,000 to an expected work force at ADI of 6,700. </PARA>
<PARA> In saying that we support this legislation there are, however, a few matters that I would like to raise while I have the opportunity. The negotiations which have been taking place for some considerable period with the unions are still not completed. In the Estimates committee hearings I asked some questions about this. On 16 May I received an answer to a question I asked about a woman's rights to maternity leave. For example, would she have the right to go back into the Public Service and would she lose her maternity leave? What is the situation generally? The response which I received was that conditions of employment under ADI are still subject to negotiation with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and resolution by the Industrial Relations Commission. So that will affect that specific case of maternity leave. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested, just before coming into the chamber, to receive the latest copy of Australian Defence Industries' newsletter. In it there is a fairly frank discussion of personnel issues. It is an interesting commentary on the problems which public employment has caused this country. This is a newsletter for the new company's staff, as much as for anybody else. It states quite categorically that in order to become competitive it has had to make a strong start in bringing its costs into line with those of industry generally. It states, `We have moved away from public sector conditions of service and where appropriate have adopted commercial industry provisions'. It is a sad condemnation of public sector conditions of service when, in order to make a crust in the commercial sector, a company has to jettison some of the benefits which have been the norm for people in the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Sick leave is given as an example. I have had quite a connection with this problem. It has been an interest of mine. I have been watching what has been happening in the public sector with sick leave. Most honourable senators would realise that some great rorts have been perpetrated in the name of sick leave. The ADI management has recognised this. While reducing the personal credit available to individual employees, the company has put in place a sick leave pool. It puts on the record that the attendance of staff will be monitored closely and that the managed use of sick leave and other forms of leave so that personnel can maximise their absences from duty with and without pay will not be allowed to continue. I am very glad to see that being stated so clearly. Sick leave is a real canker in employment these days, particularly in the public sector, where it has been allowed to grow. People have had unsupervised access to more sick leave than they should rightfully take. </PARA>
<PARA> Also in this personnel newsletter the company states that the removal of many of the unnecessary demarcations which currently exist and which are a source of frustration for employees and a source of unnecessary costs that prevent it from being competitive are to be aimed for, and achieved, hopefully. </PARA>
<PARA> The full bench of the Industrial Relations Commission approved the ADI awards with effect from 8 May 1989 but ordered that they remain in force for a period of six months. That is the clue. The Government has failed so far to see the final negotiations succeed for the work force which will be involved in the new company. </PARA>
<PARA> The short period of operation of the awards reflects the fact that further changes are to occur. Those further changes are to occur simply because the Government has not been successful in negotiating the changes. It reminds me of the ironic circumstance when the Fraser Government tried to take some action to privatise the Bendigo ordnance factory several years ago and it was the Australian Labor Party and its friends in the trade union movement who managed to defeat that exercise. It is ironic to me that the Government is now negotiating the commercialisation of the Office of Defence Production (ODP). It is still having difficulty with its mates in the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Senator Tate was the Minister who gave the second reading speech in the Senate. It referred to the management and the cost structures of the ODP as not always being appropriate to a large manufacturing company. I do not want to labour that point; I am glad that the management and the structures are going to change. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have a problem with the future scrutiny of this company. Being government-owned, it will not be subject to scrutiny by private shareholders. The Government, presumably, will have the opportunity to scrutinise it, but the Parliament will not. We were also concerned that the Auditor-General may not have been in that position. I am glad that the Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, made it clear in the other place that our concerns about the Auditor's scrutiny were unfounded and that the Auditor-General will be able to exercise the scrutiny that is necessary over the new company. </PARA>
<PARA> That does not get away from a couple of problems we still see. One is the question of annual reports. I am informed that the ADI, being a company registered in Canberra, will have to produce its annual report for the Corporate Affairs Commission but that it will be produced for the Parliament only if the Minister so chooses. I hope that something is done to ensure that the report is automatically tabled in the Parliament each year. I feel that it is very important that the Parliament not lose the opportunity to debate the annual report of a government instrumentality. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there is the problem of scrutiny of the company by the Estimates committee. This is a problem that we are facing more and more now with government-owned enterprises. I raised the issue during the Senate Estimates Committee D hearing on 13 April. Mr McLeod, for the Department, answered:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . with the Government's decision to establish ADI as a wholly-owned Government company which was very much against the background of a desire to give to the organisation the same sort of flexibility that is available to a company operating in the private sector, that the public accountability which would be associated with ADI would reflect what is true of a company. I am not sure that it would be appropriate for the company to be examined before the Senate Estimates Committee. Certainly the Department would be entitled to be examined in respect of any funding that it makes available . . . Defence would remain fully accountable for any funds that are made available to ADI in terms of supplementary funding. </PARA>
<PARA>The problem is that ADI will not be available. That concerns me because it is a company on which the future of Australia's defence capability rests. Its ability to supply the forces will have a major impact on our defence capability. If the company is to fail in the exercise of that role, it is a matter of national concern. I recognise the technical difficulties once there is no government funding going into the company. It is not a satisfactory arrangement that the Parliament will be able to scrutinise the doings of ADI only if Commonwealth money is going into it, and then only second-hand through the Department of Defence, which is not always as open in its answers to questions as I, for one, would like. The company will always be at arm's length from the Parliament. It is something which the Parliament must give further thought to because it is a growing phenomenon. I can foresee very real difficulties in the future if ADI and other such organisations are to be safe from the inquiring minds of my colleagues in the Senate Estimates Committee. I do not intend to take the time of the Senate any longer. I simply reiterate that the Opposition is prepared to support this legislation, with the concerns that I have expressed previously. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill is not supported by the Opposition. The second reading speech which was given in this chamber by the Minister for Local Government, Senator Reynolds, gives the Government's reasons for wanting to reduce the quorum in the House of Representatives from its present one-third to one-fifth. A quorum of 30 members would enable the House to meet and proceed with its business. The second reading speech is interesting in that it refers to the responsibilities of members, and in particular Ministers, outside the chamber. There is no doubt that there is a great deal that all of us are involved in at any one time. There are meetings all over the place, constituents coming in, research to be done on speeches-all legitimate work that is done outside the chamber. But reducing the quorum is perhaps not the way to deal with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The real problem, that I see at least, with this proposal to reduce the House of Representatives quorum is the Government's general disdain of the Parliament and the way it will use the Executive to overrule the Parliament. In the House of Representatives, Bills are guillotined through with very little debate. Frequently they then come to the Senate and are subject to a great deal more investigation and consideration. They are frequently amended here in a way the Government accepts. Amendments are made which one would have expected to be made in the House of Representatives had the Bills been analysed more closely. </PARA>
<PARA> We find this attitude displayed in particular by the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh). His cutting of the parliamentary appropriations and his attitude that Senate committees are a waste of money I interpret as a general disdain for the parliamentary process. I would have thought that amendments as to how the chambers should function would be discussed between the parties and a bipartisan approach reached. That has not been the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the example that most of us would think of at present is the immigration review fee. That fee was proposed and brought into the Parliament. It was rejected by the Senate. The Executive, not being happy with the Parliament's rejection of its proposal, brought it in administratively. We all know now the trouble the Executive has got into as a result of proceeding to do something the Parliament had rejected, attempting to get around the parliamentary process. For reasons such as those we do not feel disposed to agree to this proposal whereby a quorum of the House of Representatives will be less than it is at present. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had believed, until I heard Senator Reid's speech, that the Opposition was not going to oppose this Bill. Now that Senator Reid has said that the Opposition is going to oppose the Bill I think I had better make some comments as to why we will be supporting it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter of quorums fundamentally ought to be a matter for each chamber. The Senate, in a recent report, canvassed some points with regard to a quorum of this chamber. I notice that the Government has not broken that one open and decided to have a go at it, and probably for the good reason of wanting some legislation. The House of Representatives has passed this Bill and sent it to the Senate for our concurrence. I think that a reasonable position would be for us to accept the view expressed by the House of Representatives with regard to its quorum arrangements. I am mindful of the fact that there is always a government majority in the House of Representatives, almost by definition. We will see whether that situation continues, given what has occurred in the lower House in Tasmania recently. </PARA>
<PARA> At present it would be the view of the Democrats that, since a majority of the House of Representatives has determined that there ought to be a change to its quorum rule, it would be appropriate for the Senate to concur with that expressed wish of the House of Representatives and pass this legislation. I am quite sure that we would want reciprocal arrangements with regard to any changes that we may wish to make as to how we conduct our business in this chamber. Although the House of Representatives could do the reverse to us, that is, a majority in this place may express some particular wish and the alternative majority in the House of Representatives may wish to frustrate that, I support this Bill on the understanding that if at any stage in the future the majority in the Senate expresses a view with regard to how it wishes to organise its business, and that may require legislation-of course, not many such arrangements do-then the House of Representatives would simply concur, although it would not necessarily be the view of the majority there, as it were, because it may be aligned with a minority in the Senate. It is upon that reciprocal basis that the Democrats support this legislation, which obviously is the expressed wish of the majority in the House of Representatives. </PARA>

Therefore, on 1 July the Australian Wheat Board will no longer be able to trade on the domestic market and two years hence it will not exist at all. It will not be trading on the overseas market either. The consequences of that are that those who said they did not want private trade in wheat on the domestic market will have nothing but private trade as from 1 July.</PARA></TALK.START>

So there is no change in the Opposition's position at all.

<PARA>Dear Senator,</PARA>
<PARA> I am writing to you to seek your assistance to prevent a severe crisis of confidence from engulfing the wheat industry.</PARA>
<PARA> The House today passed an amended Wheat Marketing Bill, but rejected a number of Senate amendments. Those amendments can be portrayed as allowing the Board to ignore the Australian Constitution, to abuse its market power, to risk having people on it who are not the best available, and to expose the taxpayer to the risk of 95 per cent underwriting. These are all unacceptable to the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> If the Senate insists on these amendments, there will be no Bill passed, and the sunset clause in the existing Act will be triggered on 1 July-</PARA>
<PARA>that is 1 July 1989-</PARA>
<PARA>This means there would be no underwriting of the 1989 crop and the Board would suffer a severe crisis of confidence as its very existence after 1991 would be at risk.</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate must pass the Bill as it now stands. The Government has shown a great deal of flexibility throughout the wheat debate-there is no room for more.</PARA>
<PARA> In particular, we will not extend the existing legislation, so any attempt to use these amendments as a back-door attempt to sabotage domestic wheat market deregulation will not work. On the contrary, those who do not want private trade in wheat will risk there being nothing but private trade.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Government takes a very serious view of non-citizens who have become involved in serious crimes involving drugs or violence. Our policy on deportation was first set down on 4 May 1983 by Minister West and was again clarified by my statement in this chamber on 8 December 1988. This Government of course does not accept gratuitous advice in the form of glib one-liners from the latest Leader of the Opposition in Victoria about the need to convince us to protect Australia from the possibility of further criminal behaviour by individuals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our statements and actions over a number of years demonstrate the seriousness we attach to our responsibility to exclude from this country those non-citizens who have seriously abused the privilege of residence accorded to them by the Australian community. Stated briefly, it is our policy that non-citizens who are convicted of the production or distribution of heroin or other hard drugs, organised criminal activity, serious sexual assault, violence, kidnapping or extortion and sentenced to more than 12 months in gaol are liable for deportation. Such deportation decisions, which of course are appealable to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), take effect at the conclusion of the gaol sentence. AAT decisions on deportation are also subject to overruling in the national interest by ministerial statement to this Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst there is always consideration of compassionate and humanitarian circumstances in making any decision to deport, the overriding principle must be the general protection and well-being of the Australian community and its standards. This has meant that, since 1983, 143 non-citizens have been deported as a consequence of being involved in criminal activity. About one-third of these people have been involved in drugs. It should also be noted that we have in place security processes which are second to none in our effort to screen out people with a criminal background and prevent them from entering this country in the first place. To place this matter in perspective, however, my answer would be incomplete without pointing to the fact that people who have migrated here, on average, have half the level of involvement in criminal activities of their Australian born counterparts.</PARA>
<PARA> I also note that the Victorian Opposition Leader, in his descent into the Dark Ages, has also called for the reintroduction of capital punishment. I can only hope that in future Mr Brown, and anyone else who seeks to grab a cheap headline at the expense of our migrant community, at least takes the time to check the history of the matter. As Mr Brown has been in politics since 1979, I would have thought that at least he would have known government policy as enunciated on two major occasions in the Federal Parliament.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen that press release. I thought that I should comment on it because it is an extraordinarily irresponsible piece of work from a shadow Minister. Fortunately, journalists working for Australia's major daily newspapers did their homework better than Mr Moore-much more thoroughly, and earlier. Newspapers ignored Mr Moore and gave the public an accurate and favourable picture of what the Government and the AIDC are trying to achieve by this float.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should remind honourable senators of certain facts concerning the Government's decision to offer the public equity in AIDC Ltd, a new company in which the Government, through the AIDC, will retain 70 per cent ownership. The Government is not interested in privatisation by stealth, as Mr Moore suggests; it is interested in making sure that the capital base of the AIDC grows sufficiently strongly to allow it to play a strong role in supporting the development of Australian industry. Hence the decision to offer shares in it to the public. The AIDC has been managed very professionally and with great prudence. Its assets and profits have grown steadily and at a respectable rate. In terms of comparative performance, it is one of the most successful enterprises of its kind in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> I have every confidence that the float will also be managed competently and professionally by the AIDC. Contrary to what Mr Moore says, the AIDC has engaged professional underwriters to the issue. Journalists were quite aware of that, but apparently the shadow Minister was not. The Government has engaged its own independent adviser on the float-Mr Charles Goode, the Chairman of Potter Partners. His advice and expertise are available both to the Government and to the management of the AIDC. It is a matter of obvious concern that the issue be correctly priced and competently managed.</PARA>
<PARA> It was careless-or, worse, suspicious-that Mr Moore's intervention was made in the way it was and in a manner likely to damage the prospects of a successful float. I do not think it is entirely surprising that this press release was ill-informed. In answer to a question yesterday, Senator Walsh pointed out that Mr Moore had obviously been well tutored by those who had made significant profits from Britain's privatisation program. Apparently he is not concerned with the broader industry restructuring issues, nor is he concerned to get the best deal for the Australian taxpayer. If he were he would not have said what he did. He certainly seems to be obsessed with the process of wholesale sell-offs that can only benefit friends on the stock exchange. In contrast to the way in which the Government is managing the float, Mr Moore has never demonstrated much care or attention to detail, and he seems to have a limited sense of shadow ministerial responsibility.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;National accounts data on household savings are available, but only on a whole year basis. In other words, there is no quarterly publication, broken down by States. Therefore, the most recent figures for States are those for the last financial year, 1987-88. In that year Australia as a whole had a household savings ratio of 8.2 per cent. There are very considerable differences between States. Indeed, when I first became aware of them I found them to be quite remarkable. The State with the highest ratio in the last financial year was Victoria, with 12.8 per cent. The State with the lowest ratio was Queensland, with 2.4 per cent. In other words, Victoria's figure is some 400 per cent higher than Queensland's-an enormous difference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of whether the rates are converging, I have figures for the changes between 1986-87 and 1987-88. For Australia as a whole, the savings ratio increased from 7 per cent to 8.2 per cent; in Victoria there was an improvement from 10.8 per cent to 12.8 per cent; but in Queensland there was a deterioration from 4.1 per cent to 2.4 per cent. No other State has a savings ratio anywhere near as low as that of Queensland. The only other State to experience a decline in the household savings ratio between 1986-87 and 1987-88 was South Australia, and in that case the figure fell moderately from 8.5 per cent to 8.2 per cent, which was right on the national average for that year.</PARA>
<PARA> The determinants of household savings are rather complex. It is suggested by some that the very low figure for Queensland could be affected by the State's high proportion of retired people. There may be some validity in that-I am not sure-but it is certainly not feasible that that difference, or any other similar difference, could alone account for the enormous gap between Queensland's figure and the national average, let alone between Queensland's figure and that of Victoria. By a process of elimination one is led to the conclusion that the appalling economic record of the Queensland Government must be the dominant factor.</PARA>

At the same time they deliver the old, pompous speeches about wanting millions of dollars in expenditure cuts. They never nominate the areas in which the cuts should be made.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recall very well the advertisements which described Elders as a 110 per cent Australian company. Presumably it was prepared by the sort of people who put the Liberal Party alternative Budget together, maybe with some assistance from the new Liberal Party Leader who, on his own admission, does not bring an accountant's approach to bear on the preparation of Budgets or expenditure proposals. Last Friday, Mr Elliott announced a plan that will have the effect of giving Harlin Holdings 49 per cent of the capital in Elders, Harlin being a company in which Mr Elliott has a substantial personal interest. Stephen Bartholomeusz, in his column in yesterday's Age, described the Elliott plan in some detail. He suggested that the proposal may be described as a pro rata issue by Harlin and AFP Investment Corporation Ltd but in reality it is an attempt by Harlin to buy the AFP parcel while camouflaging it as an offer available to all shareholders. He wrote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>If Harlin had simply sought shareholder approval to buy 18 per cent of Elders from AFP in a clean and clear transaction, it is hard to see how the proposal could possibly be sold to shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that Mr Elliott's plan has been organised in such a way that it sidesteps the normal requirements regarding making a fair offer to the takeover target's minority shareholders. Essentially, Mr Elliott is making his shareholders an offer that is not too good to refuse. If they do refuse the offer, Harlin, which is the underwriter of the issue, I gather picks up the shares and wins control of the company. Hence the comments from Mr Bartholomeusz which I have quoted. It seems that Mr Elliott is pulling another swiftie on his shareholders, similar to the swiftie he pulled when he issued shares to himself, paid up to one cent, which then attracted fully paid bonus shares at some later point.</PARA>
<PARA> I am not sure why there is reference in the question to the FIRB-my understanding is that Harlin is an Australian company-unless, of course, it may be believed that control of the company lies substantially in Monaco, which of course is Mr Elliott's favourite tax haven. However, I shall refer that part of the question to the Treasurer for his advice.</PARA>

Unfortunately, it is about the only part of his question that is correct. To explain it all requires some little detail, but the decision taken originally was taken on the recommendation of the Department of Defence and the then Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee. There were a couple of reasons for that recommendation. The Vietnam conflict itself differed from other wars in that the Australian commitment there did not end in a decisive result. In fact, we still had troops there at the time of the request. Secondly, there was no evidence that insufficient awards were available during Australia's commitment in Vietnam. The proposition that there should not be an end of war list was endorsed by Mr Lance Barnard, a member of the Whitlam Government, but only after it had been endorsed by the Fraser Government and by the Minister for Defence in that Government, Mr Fairbairn.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Government does recognise the need for something to be done to take action to save those species of Australian plants and animals which face extinction. Unfortunately, there are many of them. I will not be so unkind as to carry on with the comments of some in the Opposition about the endangered species closest to us.

<PARA> Since European settlement almost a tenth of Australia's terrestrial mammals have become extinct. Another fifth are considered to be endangered. I know the situation is no better for plants. Almost 4,000 species of plants are now listed as rare or threatened. Following staff reallocation and refocusing of endangered species activities in the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service, a unit has been established. Interviews have been held to select the head of the unit, and three staff have so far been allocated to it. Some time ago I appointed the Advisory Committee to which Senator Vallentine referred. It includes representatives from State governments, the scientific community and conservationists. I met with them during April. We discussed at that time a national strategy for the conservation of endangered species. They know of my support for their work. That Committee, as Senator Vallentine has pointed out, has set down a list of objectives that it believes ought to be met and the funds that it believes are required to meet those objectives. I am in the process of addressing the question of funds. During Budget discussions I know that I will receive very strong support from my colleague Senator Walsh in my attempt to do justice to the cause.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already answered this question in response to Senator Archer only a few weeks ago. My answer was to the effect that the Government some time ago received a report compiled by Mr Holdich, from the then Department of the Special Minister of State, on counter-terrorism in Australia. He pointed out that it would be far better for the ready response of sworn police officers to an incident at an airport if those police were subject to one line of command. In any case he pointed out that we are not often engaged in those sorts of incidents, which are mercifully rare. He suggested that police forces at airports are clearly more akin to those engaged in ordinary community policing activities in jurisdictions which surround the airports. For those reasons it makes good sense that the uniformed police officers undertaking these duties at airports be subject to the same command as the State or Territory police force surrounding them.

I would say that the long period of consultation which was afforded by the operations of the Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, which looked at that legislation, indicates the sort of procedure that might usefully be adopted by the Northern Territory Government and Parliament in relation to this matter. It may well be that Senator Tambling and Senator Collins, in a bipartisan way, might suggest to the Northern Territory Administration and Parliament that some such committee be established to look at the many pages of amendments-22 pages of 60 amendments-so that consultations can take place over an extended period.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have read the article to which Senator Zakharov referred. It is headed `Car Theft: A racket with thriving profit margins', and indeed that is the case. The Australian Police Ministers Council, meeting in Adelaide, was, of course, much interested in this matter because most of the participating jurisdictions are those of State governments and the question of car theft is, of course, high on their law enforcement and political agendas. This is particularly the case in New South Wales where the number of cars stolen and not recovered is exceedingly high. Indeed, I believe some 15 per cent of stolen vehicles are not recovered within a week. It is in relation to that 15 per cent, of course, that most concern is expressed because they are reintroduced into the system either as reregistered whole vehicles or as component parts due to the stripping and the conversion of the parts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Ministers were most concerned at the assessment by police forces that a significant component of thefts of unrecovered vehicles is conducted by organised groups who make very considerable profits from their activities. It is not just a question of a spur of the moment decision by people seeking to take a car for a short time. Notwithstanding consideration of this matter over some time in a jurisdiction by jurisdiction way, the APMC was convinced that nothing less than a totally coordinated effort against all aspects of the problem of organised motor vehicle theft is required. That coordination is required because, if one jurisdiction deals with the matter in a strong way and perhaps puts special vigilance, supervision and surveillance on panel beating shops and so on, the car subject to the theft can be transported across State borders or, indeed, into the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA> The Council discussed this matter at its meeting last week in Adelaide. The report concluded that law enforcement agencies cannot be expected to be successful in their efforts against organised motor vehicle theft if holes remain in key areas of the system outside their control. Indeed, there are matters which have to be taken into account by licensing and registration authorities and not merely by police forces and those involved in the law enforcement community. Thus, for example, it is recommended that registration procedures be standardised across all jurisdictions. That would embrace a number of matters and factors, including registration records containing both engine and chassis numbers as prime identifiers. That would be only one part of the uniform registration process which is recommended by Australian police Ministers. It was recommended that the registers of encumbered vehicles should be made compatible between jurisdictions. That would obviously be an important step to take. It was also recommended that component identification on new vehicles be introduced; that the vehicle identification number be stamped directly on the vehicle chassis; and that the establishment of wrecks registers of repairable and non-repairable vehicles be looked at.</PARA>
<PARA> The opinion of the New South Wales Police Minister, Mr Ted Pickering, who has taken a very keen interest in this matter, was that perhaps the single most important thing that could be done would be the introduction of component identification on new vehicles so that each component could be readily identified. At the moment that does not occur, as I understand it, in relation to vehicles produced for domestic sale within Australia. Mr Pickering commented that cars produced for export from Australian factories and manufacturing agencies have this component identification stamped on them. There seems to be a disparity which requires some explanation. Nevertheless, the Council has appointed a working party, headed, I think, by Mr Ted Pickering and supported by representatives from three jurisdictions, to implement the recommendations of the APMC. I believe this matter of great importance to Australians with regard to the safety of their motor vehicles will be very speedily attended to.</PARA>

<PARA>SOUTH AFRICA: SANCTION: SORELMETAL</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to reply to Senator Baume's question yesterday asking why an exemption was granted to allow the importation of a particular pig-iron product from South Africa when, he claimed, there are two other satisfactory sources, Norway and Brazil.</PARA>
<PARA> The importation into Australia of iron and steel products from South Africa is prohibited under Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA> In November last year, an application for exemption from those regulations was received from an Australian importer to allow the import from South Africa of a product known as sorelmetal.</PARA>
<PARA> Sorelmetal is the brand name for a high purity, low manganese iron product used in the foundry process to stabilise very large iron castings required, in particular, by the mining industry. It is manufactured by a Canadian firm with plants in Canada and South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA> The producers of sorelmetal advised the importer that the Canadian plant's output had, through heavy demand, become fully committed to the North American and European markets and that they would have to obtain their supplies from the South African plant.</PARA>
<PARA> Australian foundry industry stockpiles of sorelmetal were expected to run out in about March 1989. Seventeen Australian foundries depended to some extent on sorelmetal and six, employing some two to three thousand people and including the largest producers of cast iron products, were critically dependent on it.</PARA>
<PARA> If these producers of cast iron were unable to meet orders for heavy equipment, other industries, including the mining industry, would be adversely affected.</PARA>
<PARA> The application by the importer was considered by the interdepartmental committee established in December 1986 to examine representations made by Australian companies for exemptions from sanctions.</PARA>
<PARA> After seeking advice from the foundry industry and information from relevant Australian missions overseas, the committee concluded that, while alternative products to sorelmetal might exist, their suitability to the Australian industry still needed to be closely and objectively assessed</PARA>
<PARA> that the alternative products, even if suitable, might not be available where their production was geared to local and existing markets</PARA>
<PARA> and that, at that stage, the serious short term supply problem for the Australian foundry industry could not be resolved without recourse to South African supply.</PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of the committee's recommendations, I decided on 5 March 1989 to allow the industry as a whole a one-off, nine month exemption to permit the import from South Africa of a quantity of sorelmetal, not to exceed 4500 tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA> In notifying the industry as a whole of my decision, it was made clear that the government would not be prepared to consider any further exemption unless it was totally satisfied that there was no alternative to the importation of sorelmetal from South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA> On 8 May 1989 my department was advised that another Australian importer had located two alternative sources for the supply of products which they considered suitable, one in Brazil and the other in Norway</PARA>
<PARA> Both alternatives had previously been considered by the committee. At that time, however,</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That in view of the persistence of low professional morale amongst the Australian defence forces under this Government and in view of the significance of Australia's role in international peacekeeping activities, the Senate censures the Minister for Defence and Senator Richardson for their joint failure to answer a straightforward factual question about Australia's important role in leading the Multinational Forces in Sinai and calls on the Ministers to provide a detailed answer to the Senate not later than three sitting days after today-that is, Monday, 29 May 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason for moving this censure motion is that this is not a security matter. There is nothing that is sensitive to security in the question that I asked the other day. It is simply that the Government would be embarrassed by giving the answer to the Senate. Sadly, I am not prepared to take any notice of what the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) is now promising. He promised on 3 May that he would get the answer to me the following day, so why should I take his word now? Let me repeat the question so that the Senate can decide whether the question is a matter of security. Clearly, he is not going to stay to defend himself; he is embarrassed. This Government has no concern about defence matters. It will only talk. When it comes to action, it is not interested in that. The defence forces of Australia would like an answer to this question as much as the Senate would. The question was:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Was Australia offered the opportunity to provide a senior Army officer to become Commander of the multinational forces in the Sinai. </PARA>
<PARA>What is high security about that? I asked secondly:</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Had approval been given for this appointment when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) vetoed the appointment. </PARA>
<PARA>What is high security about that? The question continued:</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Has the appointment now gone to Lieutenant General McIver of the New Zealand Defence Force; if so, will the Minister advise why the Prime Minister has denied an Australian the chance of such valuable experience when it was at no expense to the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA>What is high security about that, for goodness sake? Finally, and very importantly, I asked:</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Were considerations of Defence Force morale and Australia's international role as a promoter of peace ignored. </PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Defence</PARA>
<PARA>The answer is, of course, yes, but why will the Government not answer? It is not a question of top security; it is a question of the Government's red face and nothing else. Mr Beazley should be censured because he has failed to provide an answer to a question which I asked on 3 March. The order of the Senate is quite clear on this matter: there should be an explanation given if an answer cannot be given within 30 days. We are well past that. Senator Richardson should be censured because he failed to provide an explanation of any kind or to honour the promise he made to me and the Senate in this place on 3 May. Senator Richardson tried to tell the Senate on 3 May that Mr Beazley received the answer in his office on 21 April, and he promised that he would bring me an answer the next day. He also has to be censured because he has been misleading the Senate and has failed to keep his promise to the Senate. It is just excuses, excuses; there is no explanation. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter may not seem to be of vital national importance. Of course, in the world scheme of things, it is not, but it is important on two grounds. It is important to the defence forces of Australia because it goes to the heart of their morale. It shows whether this Government is interested in the forces and in showing the flag in a meaningful way or whether it just sends them off to do the dirty jobs. It is meaningful as to whether a top Australian was going to represent this country as head of the Sinai Force. We know very well that the morale of our Defence Force is already suffering because of this Government's inaction. Here is a classic example. It is a question of an Australian not getting a job that could perfectly reasonably be filled by an Australian and whether the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) vetoed the appointment. Clearly, the job has gone to a New Zealander. Why? That is the reason it is important to the defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter is also important to the authority and the status of the Senate. This Government continues to treat the Parliament with utter contempt. This is but one more example. It has long been the habit of the Government to hide information on defence matters. I know that Senator Ray, being a Minister who attends Estimates committees, is not all that enthusiastic about the willingness of the Department of Defence to answer defence questions. At the moment we are facing a situation where the Department will be looking at when it is going to get its money in the additional appropriations. It has had 120 questions outstanding for over 30 days from Estimates Committee D. A great wad of answers arrived at my office last night after I had spoken in the second reading debate on the Appropriation Bills about the Opposition's position on unanswered questions. Again, five minutes before Question Time today another wad arrived. I think Senator McGauran has about 29 questions that have not been answered yet, and about 14 questions of Senator MacGibbon's and mine have not been answered. </PARA>

This action is unsatisfactory in its entirety. It is designed to give as little information as possible as late as possible so that matters that might be raised in the answers cannot be treated in an effective way in the Parliament. It goes again to my argument that this Government has allowed the Department of Defence to continue this habit of hiding from the Parliament. As honourable senators know, often the Defence Department hides behind security grounds, so I was absolutely fascinated to find that Senator Richardson was telling the Senate that such a straight forward factual question, which required only a straightforward factual answer that had no security implications whatsoever, could not be answered speedily because of high security reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Richardson and the whole jolly Government should be feeling pretty insecure. It is not just the current Senate that has had this trouble with the Department and the Government that is supposed to manage it. I remember Senator Sir John Carrick nearly tearing his hair out while questioning Defence officials on a number of occasions, when they were allowed to obfuscate and hide behind all sorts of excuses as to why they would not be accountable to this Parliament. At the Estimates committee hearing in October last year I asked a very simple question-I would have thought it was pretty direct-on how many matters concerning defence allowances were sitting in the Department of Industrial Relations awaiting determination. I knew there were about 150. In reply I was given a very small table with about a dozen items on it and I was told that the table covered matters in the process of negotiation only--</PARA></TALK.START>

I did not intervene earlier when Senator Newman went on to mention Estimates committees, because it fitted part of a pattern that may well sustain an argument to deal with the failure to answer a question on notice.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that in covering the issues that I have, it all goes to establishing a pattern that shows this Government is not prepared to inform the Parliament of what is going on in the Defence Department. The subject of the motion goes very much to the two Ministers who are responsible to the Parliament for the Department of Defence. Therefore I just repeat that the hair-splitting example that I was giving about the involvement of the Department of Industrial Relations was that it did not include matters which are the subject of policy advice or clarification; requests for policy changes which have not yet been responded to; agreed matters awaiting determination; or case work. It is just another example of what this Government allows the Department of Defence to get away with, and perhaps even what suits this Government for it to get away with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are not satisfied that this Government is prepared to be accountable on the subject of its management of defence. The example I have raised today over the Sinai commander is yet another example. In the questions that we have been waiting for answers to in recent days, we have asked about some pretty important matters-such as conditions of service, injuries to service women and fraud in the Department of Defence. What could be more important than the allegations of huge fraud on the Department? We have asked about the contracting arrangements of the Department, Bendigo Ordnance Factory matters and Project DESINE. Project DESINE is a contract worth $400m over five years. There are a huge number of questions hanging over that, yet the Department does persist in dawdling there and the Government allows it to get away with it. There seem to be an enormous number of problems facing the people of Australia, the Parliament and the defence of Australia all relating to Project DESINE. Yet here we find the Government doing its utmost to hide the answers that the Parliament requires on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to delay the Senate much longer. We have certainly had many examples of the very questionable advice that the Department has given to this Government. For instance, Mr Beazley was given the most awful advice as to the need to reorganise the Department of Defence as per the report from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on the management of Australia's defence. Mr Beazley, on the advice of his bureaucrats-who would be most affected by it-rejected that report. Mrs Kelly, brand new in the job and shouting off her mouth, came out with a totally inaccurate series of statements in the early days of her responsibility for that portfolio, based, I am sad to say for the poor woman, entirely on briefings which she had received from officers of the Department. Mrs Kelly also got a pilots retention bonus through the Cabinet on the advice of her officers. Just this week we have had yet another example. Mr Beazley is claiming that on the advice of his officers he is getting rid of the Chinook helicopters. There are many more examples; I have just picked out a few recent ones. I believe they are evidence of why this Government is being so obstructive of parliamentary scrutiny with its refusal to answer questions. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly the Defence Department and its Ministers have an empire to protect. They have backsides to defend and the Ministers are just putty in the Department's hands. This Department has a budget of approximately $8 billion but it is very much a law unto itself. It considers itself not accountable to the taxpayers who provide that money. Minister Beazley has kept very quiet. He is allowed to visit his hardware, inspect his toys and have a play in the sandpit. Minister Simmons is just kept under lock and key in case he says something meaningful. But there really is nothing meaningful he can say, because he does not have the resources to do anything meaningful in his area. This Government simply does not have the will--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. I am happy to stay on the motion that I moved, because it is a very serious motion. It concerns the failure of Minister Beazley and Minister Richardson, who are both responsible for defence matters in their respective Houses, to keep the Parliament informed. It is very difficult for Ministers to keep the Parliament informed when they are so snowed by their Department that they cannot perform even if they wish to. I believe that in some cases their wishes coincide with the Department's. As I said, they all have backsides to protect and the Ministers are but putty in their Department's hands. So the Government's and the Department's purpose is served by continually failing to answer questions. The Senate will no longer allow this to continue. As I said earlier, to servicemen this is a symbol of the lack of concern for their status and their professionalism. In fact, they regard it as a direct insult to that status and that professionalism. To the Senate it is an example of the Government's continuing treatment of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If I had more time and if Senator Ray was not so anxious to intervene, I could give some examples of Senator Walsh's attitude to giving answers to the Senate and his attitude to Senate committees. But to keep to the point at hand, I believe that this motion should be supported because these Ministers have failed to provide an answer to a question which was placed on notice on 3 March. It was received in Minister Beazley's office, by Minister Richardson's own acknowledgment, on 21 April and it was promised to the Senate by Senator Richardson on 3 May. It is now 25 May, and the Senate will not stand for this contemptuous treatment any longer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Newman has achieved the distinction of moving the weakest censure motion in the history of the Senate. I will start with the first problem with the motion. We are acting under a sessional order. I think it was first moved by Senator Macklin. Senator Newman was given permission to move her censure motion on the basis of that motion. The motion is in several parts. I will read part (c) for the benefit of the Senate:</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reality is that Senator Richardson provided an explanation. He may not like the explanation and will always argue about whether it was the best possible explanation or whether it excused the Department of Defence. Nevertheless, under the sessional order under which we operate, part (c) is triggered only when a Minister does not provide an explanation. I think it is always of slight concern that, having provided an explanation, somebody can be censured, without notice, and then have to defend the matter. That is the first point to be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, Senator Richardson, in his explanation, indicated that the answer would be provided tomorrow. One has to be rather unkind and say that this was all pre-planned. It did not matter what Senator Richardson's explanation was, he was going to be censured. It was not in accordance with this sessional order, either in the letter or the spirit. It was a pre-devised tactic to move a censure motion on Mr Beazley and Senator Richardson. Senator Richardson said that the answer would be provided tomorrow. Yet we have had to have this particular motion. </PARA>

It was ironic that I was approached during Question Time and asked whether the rest of the questions on Estimates Committee D could be answered. During Question Time we were endeavouring to relay messages to try to get those answers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have a situation where, firstly, I argue very strongly that this motion is not in accordance with the sessional order. Secondly, the motion censures Senator Richardson and others for not providing answers. Here we have the classic case of Liberal amnesia. Maybe I was lucky or maybe I was unlucky to be in opposition in this chamber. Many of my colleagues have not been. I remind Senator Schacht-Senator Foreman was here with me-of the amount of unanswered questions we used to get when we were in opposition. It was far worse than anything that exists today. I used to put many questions on notice but my colleague Senator Bolkus used to put in many more. Most were never answered. That was not the fault of the then Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Sir John Carrick, who always tried to chase up Ministers to get their responses in on time. In relation to Estimates committees, there has been a quantitative change and hundreds more written questions are put on notice now. I will be in the same position as Senator Richardson one day because there are certain questions I will refuse to answer when it amounts to a massive cost to the taxpayer. </PARA>

We are now facing, without notice, this monumental censure motion of two Ministers over one question, the answer to which will be provided tomorrow. Big deal! All Senator Newman is doing is devaluing censure motions by bringing up a trivial one like this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the substance of the question, certain serious matters are raised. Not on all occasions do even those opposite expect questions to be answered within a month but they expect an explanation as to why they are not answered. Given the difficulty we had today in getting the questions answered by the Defence Department I would have thought that a more prudent course would be to allow Senator Richardson and others to pursue them with more vigour. I acknowledge and place on the record that Defence is not the best department for providing answers. That is my own experience. It has also been Senator Richardson's experience. It is very difficult when one is a Minister representing another department to be continually chasing matters up like this while doing one's other duties. The Defence Department will have to lift its game in answering questions on notice, either at the Estimates committees or those asked in the Parliament. I hardly think that fact allows for the successful carriage of a censure motion. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, Senator Hill asked me to read the whole of the motion. I have read it but I still do not believe that a motion moved under part (c) can be justified when an explanation is given. It was not as though we did not do it because we were too busy. A full explanation was given as to where the question was at and it was stated that it would be answered tomorrow. I would understand it a little more if the Opposition, having raised the matter today under this sessional order, had pursued it if it had not got the answer by tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to detain this chamber any longer on this trivial matter. I believe that in the context in which it has been raised and on the basis that the answer was to be provided tomorrow it is not only trivial but also a waste of the Senate's time. It debases and devalues the purpose of a censure motion. If someone is to be censured I would have thought it should be taken seriously. We on this side of the House cannot take this matter seriously. This does not deflect from the fact that answers should be provided as quickly as possible. I concede that it is desirable to answer all questions as quickly as possible. I exempt from that category ratbag complex questions the answers to which would cost the taxpayer a fortune. We were as guilty of asking these questions when we were in opposition as the present Opposition is. I am not trying to moralise from that point of view. Maybe Gordon Scholes had the right idea. When he provided answers he also provided the cost of answering the questions. Some of those questions quickly evaporated in those circumstances. I see my colleague, who is about to be reprimanded here, has come back to the chamber. </PARA>

Senator Alston was so weak that he was bluffed out by Senator Lewis. He was so weak that he was done over by the old bull from Richmond-the bloke whose father taught him everything he knows because he learnt his lessons in the Labor Party. That is why we like him so much. That tough old bloke over there did Senator Alston like a dinner. He should not start calling Senator Richardson a wimp. He would have to be the biggest wimp in history to try to pull that trick. I really should not be sucked in by mediocre interjections from those opposite. I was trying to keep my comments relevant, but now I am falling into Senator Newman's trap of irrelevancy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To summarise the arguments, firstly, I still maintain that this is not a proper motion. It has not been moved under a proper head of power in respect of Sessional Orders. Secondly, on the basis that Senator Richardson was going to provide the answer tomorrow, one could have well delayed such a motion. Thirdly, I have at least put on record-and I have done it seriously-that there can be criticism of the Department of Defence in its response to questions. Senator Richardson had the matter relating to the Estimates Committee brought to his attention again today in the middle of Question Time. He has addressed and pursued that matter to such an extent that 153 out of the 156 questions have now been answered. I am sure that he will be pursuing it with ever greater vigour because when one is a Minister representing another department one does not want to get stuck with the blame for its failure to deliver. I am certain that Senator Richardson will be having a word to the defence forces in general and the Department, telling them to hurry up-as I had to do when I represented Defence in this chamber-and to get the answers in on time and to ensure that they are satisfactory. I thought I saw some improvement in that regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief. The Australian Democrats will support this censure motion which we do not regard as trivial. In September 1988, Senator Macklin moved for the adoption of a sessional order after some considerable deliberation in our party room as to whether it was required. That sessional order focuses on the issue of evasion. Frankly, we see that as being the essence of the sessional order. I am convinced by only one of the arguments advanced by Senator Robert Ray; namely, that in the past it has been possible and, to a degree, the practice for the considerable cost and time involved in assembling information to be provided with some answers. This certainly is not true of the questions which are the focus of this censure motion here today. They are not questions which would have taken a long time or involved great expense to answer. We have been advised on two previous occasions that the answer would be given in a short period and it has not. It seems to us that the issue is one of evasion. The essential thrust of the sessional order is to prevent such evasion and we will, therefore, support the censure motion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly to the censure motion. I would like to recapitulate the sequence of events. On 3 March 1989 Senator Newman asked a question of the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley). She raised the matter on 3 May in the Senate. She said quite clearly and unambiguously why it was important that the question be answered. The answer that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) gave her was, quite frankly, contemptuous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to move to a point raised by Senator Robert Ray. Order of the Senate No. 1 in today's Notice Paper, states:</PARA>
<PARA> Questions on Notice-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) That, if a Senate Minister does not answer a question on notice asked by a Senator within 30 days of the asking of that question, and does not, within that period, provide to the Senator who asked the question an explanation satisfactory to that Senator of why an answer has not yet been provided-</PARA>
<PARA>Certain consequences ensue. The answer given by Senator Richardson clearly was not satisfactory to Senator Newman. That is why we are in this position today of debating this motion. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to take up any more time of the Senate, except to touch on a few key points. The Senate is very jealous of its right to have questions answered. The specific question here is a proper, legitimate question. Senator Newman was asking why a senior Australian Army officer could not command the Multinational Forces in Sinai. She also asked whether the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) intervened against the recommendation of the Department that the officer be appointed. That is a very important question. If the Prime Minister intervened, why did he do so? Why did he intervene in the face of professional advice?</PARA>
<PARA> This is not the first time that the Prime Minister has come in when personal matters have been involved. He came in on the VIP aircraft acquisition decision. The Royal Australian Air Force recommended one brand; the Prime Minister, in a state of sublime ignorance, decided that the aircraft needed three engines-he is so precious that he feels safer with three engines. He does not know that by having three engines there is three times the risk of engine failure than there is with one and that the economics get all out of kilter because fuel consumption, maintenance and everything else goes up. </PARA>
<PARA> What are we looking at here? Are we looking at something that is an extension of the hidden subsidies that are going to the New Zealand defence forces because of the failure of this Government to support ANZUS with our recalcitrant colleagues? What is the effect on the Australian defence forces themselves? What we are saying to the men and women in the Australian Defence Force is that we cannot produce a lieutenant-general who is good enough for the post. This is happening in a force which is shattered through the massive resignation rates and the neglect of this Government. With an expenditure of about $7 billion a year and a Defence Force of over 70,000 men and women and about 30,000 reservists, we cannot find one lieutenant-general to fill an international post. What sort of effect will that have on service morale? The absurdity of the situation is that we have 44 two-star generals and above in Australia-far more than we ever had at the peak of the Second World War when we had about a million men and women in uniform. That is the importance of this question. </PARA>
<PARA> The specific question is important but the larger issue is the accountability of the Executive Government to the Parliament. That is why Senator Newman is so right to push this point, having given due warning to Senator Richardson. It is not right for Senator Ray to claim that Senator Richardson can hide behind the privilege of being the Minister representing the Minister for Defence. When he accepts his commission as a Minister and the secondary role of representing a Minister in the other place, he accepts the obligation on behalf of all of us in the Senate to see that the Senate's interests, as part of the Government of Australia, are represented. He has a great obligation to meet those responsibilities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say to Senator MacGibbon that I take my responsibilities in this place seriously. Despite what he may say, being a Minister representing another Minister has its share of difficulties. When the matter about the lateness of the answer to the question was first raised by Senator Newman, I stood up here and gave the advice which I had been given, which was that the answer would be forthcoming the following day. Someone intervened for that not to happen. That someone was the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) who, not unreasonably, given that he was the subject of at least part of the question, wanted to be satisfied with the answer. So the answer was taken to his office. One of the first things I asked when I entered my office in Parliament House at the beginning of this week was, `What happened to this question?'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I acknowledged when I spoke before the censure motion was moved that it was quite reasonable for Senator Newman to be concerned. Because I believed that there was reasonable concern, my office checked with Mr Beazley's office. We have been chasing this matter ever since. With no idea that Senator Newman would move this motion today, I rang Mr Beazley just before Question Time and sought an answer from him as to why it still was not here. I wonder what more Senator Newman or the Australian Democrats can expect from a Minister in this chamber representing a Minister in another place than that. The reality is that it is not possible to get something approved by the Prime Minister, particularly in answer to a question, at a moment's notice. Prime Ministers do have other things to do. </PARA>

Obviously one does not get this problem with questions that come from my Department. It is sometimes difficult chasing Defence. On this occasion, it was a matter of chasing not only Mr Beazley's office but also the Prime Minister's office. What more could I have done?

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The past year has seen a growing debate on the question of the alternatives to the present policy of prohibition in respect of the illegal drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> In Britain the economist has advocated a relaxation of the present policy to `get the gangsters out of drugs'. </PARA>
<PARA> In the United States hearings have been held in Congress on the issue and in this country a former Deputy Commissioner of Police, in the State of Victoria, Mr Paul Delianis, has suggested that at this time there is a case for making the presently illegal drugs available under strict government control. </PARA>
<PARA>This report is going to prove a disappointment to those who expected the Committee to recommend sweeping changes to the present laws. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee believes there is ample evidence that the present policy of prohibition is failing to achieve its objective; namely to reduce the use of those drugs which are presently illegal while preventing supplies of such drugs reaching those in Australia who may wish to use them. </PARA>
<PARA>The illegal drugs are available throughout Australia for anyone who wants them, although at prices often artificially inflated by the illegality. The market for illicit drugs is a demand market-that is, those people who desire to use illicit drugs seek out the supplier and create the market by their own demand. </PARA>
<PARA> For many years governments have attempted to use the criminal law as a means of reducing supply to the market place. This report clearly demonstrates that such an approach has limitations and in so far as its stated aim is to prevent illicit drugs from reaching the market place it has demonstrably failed. </PARA>
<PARA> Evidence before the Committee demonstrated that illicit drugs are available in Australian gaols in all States. If it is not possible to keep illicit drugs from Australian gaols, how is it possible to keep the supply of illicit drugs from the streets in our major cities?</PARA>
<PARA> Those who would seek to increase penalties and to have a greater emphasis on law enforcement need to produce evidence to justify the effectiveness of that strategy. The reality is that there is no country in the world which has been successful in preventing supply from reaching the demand market in those societies. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not to say that law enforcement has not a major role to play in the illicit drug market. The Committee has found that Australian law enforcement agencies have been more successful in making seizures than they have been given credit for, but even the agencies themselves agree that they cannot stop all drugs from reaching the market place. </PARA>
<PARA> Seizures do not represent a loss to importers of the street value of the drugs quoted in press reports but, rather, the purchase price of the drugs in their country of origin. For example, the present cost in Asia of a kilogram of number 4 heroin is $15,000. Recent newspaper reports of a successful interdiction by the Australian Federal Police Force of some 60 kilograms of number 4 heroin put the value of that heroin at $60m. Frankly, this is a nonsense. At $15,000 a kilo, the cost to the importers of that interdiction is some $900,000 at cost, plus the cost of importation into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the importing group has lost the services of some middle range dealers and suppliers in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The experience of law enforcement agencies throughout the world is that the interdiction of a particular importation is immediately replaced by another importation to ensure that supply is readily available on the market place. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence suggests that no special expertise is required to enter the trade so that even if agencies succeed in arresting major traffickers there will be others ready to take their places. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover the more successful law enforcement is, the greater the profits will be for those prepared to enter the trade. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee acknowledges that, by raising the price of the illegal drugs and making access to them risky and difficult, the present policy of prohibition deters new users who might be attracted to these drugs if they were as readily available as alcohol and tobacco. It also encourages heavy users to consider treatment and abstinence because of the cost and difficulty of maintaining a habit. </PARA>
<PARA> However it achieves these effects at a considerable cost to the users themselves and to society. The Committee estimates the direct annual cost of drug law enforcement at $123m. The users of heroin in particular resort to crime to support their habits. The community bears the cost of drug related crime through increased insurance premiums and increased security for their homes and business premises. </PARA>
<PARA> Users seeking to buy drugs are brought into contact with a criminal subculture and may progress from using cannabis and pills to the use of heroin. </PARA>
<PARA> The illegal drug trade is violent because it takes place outside the law and the profits to be made corrupt law enforcement agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> The high cost of illegal drugs means that many users prefer to inject them, thus gaining the greatest effect from a small quantity of the drug. Carried out under insanitary conditions this has obvious health risks and it also leads to needle-sharing, spreading hepatitis-B and AIDS. The illegal drugs are adulterated with substances including talc, glucose, strychnine and arsenic, posing further dangers to users' health. </PARA>
<PARA> Prohibition has eroded accepted civil liberties. Prosecutions depend on informers and the law bears most heavily on the young and the poor. Prohibition also means that the illegal drugs are not available for medical use. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the alternatives to the present policy? The Committee does not believe that increased penalties are a solution. The last two decades have seen a steady increase in the maximum sentences for drug trafficking in this country with negligible effects. Decriminalising the cultivation and distribution of cannabis for personal use would diminish the illegal market but there would be no quality control and no control on underage use. </PARA>
<PARA> Prescription of heroin to dependent users might ease their health-related problems and draw them into counselling on needle-sharing and treatment programs but it would leave occasional and new users still seeking their supplies on the black market. Making the presently illegal drugs available under strict government controls with a ban on commercial sale and advertising would eliminate many of the costs of the present policy. At the same time it could lead to a dramatic increase in the use of these drugs and a consequent increase in health problems. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no easy solution. Each option involves trade-offs between costs and benefits. The Committee emphasises that the present policy results in an absence of government control over the chemistry of the drugs being sold, the outlets where the drugs are sold and who the drugs may be sold to. The Committee therefore recommends that the community give earnest consideration to options by which governments might impose more controls on the sale and marketing of the presently illegal drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> Besides calling for more accurate statistics the Committee proposes that the Commonwealth Government should set targets as indicators of the success of its latest initiatives in curbing the drug trade. Should these initiatives fail to make significant inroads on the market then the Committee suggests that it would be appropriate to consider some relaxation of the present prohibitions as an alternative policy. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meanwhile the majority of the Committee recommends a ban on all advertising of alcohol and tobacco products. The Committee was told that young people are faced with conflicting messages as to the acceptability of drug taking. We attempt to convince them that drugs are harmful but at the same time they are bombarded with advertisements promoting the use of alcohol, tobacco and certain pharmaceutical drugs. The Committee believes that the continued promotion of alcohol and tobacco in particular undermines the credibility of the attempt through the national campaign against drug abuse to reduce the consumption of the illegal drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> I place on record my appreciation and the appreciation of the Committee for the assistance provided by our secretary, Giles Short, our research assistants, Rosa Ferranda and John Carter, and steno-secretary Chris Migus. </PARA>
<PARA> The report commands the attention of the Parliament and of our community. In order to diminish the harm caused by the use of illegal drugs we all need to expand our own horizons and to look at the problem honestly. </PARA>

<PARA>HORTICULTURAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill amends the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987, the Horticultural Export Charge Collection Act 1987, the Horticultural Levy Collection Act 1987 and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is to provide additional charge and levy collection arrangements under which horticultural industries are able to participate in the Australian Horticultural Corporation and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation through product levies and export charges. </PARA>
<PARA> Two problems have arisen with the current arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, some industries, such as the nursery industry have confirmed their willingness to participate in these Corporations. However, there proposed levy and charge collection arrangements cannot be accommodated under existing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, more cost effective collection arrangements have been identified for some industries already participating under the Corporations but again these cannot be implemented under existing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, in order for the better securing of levies and charges on horticultural products, amounts are paid to the Commonwealth on behalf of the producer or owner of prescribed horticultural products by the first purchaser, selling agent or exporting agent as the case may be. </PARA>
<PARA> This arrangement is satisfactory where there are a relatively few first purchasers and agents. However, this structure is not the case for some horticultural products and alternative cost effective collection arrangements have been developed in consultation with industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Under these proposed arrangements, amounts on account of levy and charge will become payable at the point of purchase of prescribed goods and services used in the production of horticultural products prescribed under the amendments. The point of collection will be moved forward in the production and marketing chain to a point before the product being levied has been actually produced. </PARA>
<PARA> The sellers of these goods are services will be obliged to pay the amounts on account of levy and charge to the Commonwealth, but only after they have in turn received payments of the amounts from the purchaser. </PARA>
<PARA> If, however, the purchaser does not intend to produce leviable or chargeable horticultural products with the goods or services purchased it will be possible for them to seek an exemption from the requirement to make payment. Refunds of amounts paid will also be possible under certain situations. </PARA>
<PARA> The nursery industry has advised that it wishes to participate in both the Australian Horticultural Corporation and the Research and Development Corporation. Its proposed collection arrangements will be based on the purchase by industry members of containers such as plastic pots used in the production of potted plants, which will be prescribed as the leviable or chargeable horticultural product. </PARA>
<PARA> The blueberry industry has confirmed that it wishes to participate in the Australian Horticultural Corporation only and has suggested a similar collection arrangement involving the purchase by blueberry growers of cartons in which fruit is packed for sale. </PARA>
<PARA> The operative rates of levy and charge applicable to nursery product and blueberries and other administrative matters regarding the manner of payment will be set down in regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> I am particularly pleased to see that these industries have decided to join these Corporations, which were established principally to assist horticultural industries to develop their potential in export markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Exports are fundamental to the further development of the horticultural industries. These industries will come under increasing pressure as production rises above the capacity of the domestic market to absorb it, and as competition from imports increases. This competition will occur as a result of such factors as the development of quarantine protocols, and the Government's commitment to the freeing of agriculture and other trade through multilateral trade negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore imperative that horticultural industries develop a commitment to export, through marketing; through the development of quality produce; and through a commitment to sustain long term production for export. </PARA>
<PARA> While the response needs to come largely from industries themselves, the Corporations are well placed to act as catalysts is this process. The Government is to contribute $7.1 million over five years to assist the Corporations in their early operations. The apple and pear and citrus industries have participated in the Corporations since their inception and the addition of other industries will assist in the longer term industry funding of them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is expected that the amount raised under the nursery industry levy and charge will be approximately $750,000 per year, rising to $1 million within the first few years. Amounts equal to half of the total raised are expected to be directed to the Australian Horticultural Corporation and half to the Research and Development Corporation. The Commonwealth will match expenditure of industry moneys identified for the latter body dollar for dollar, up to a limit of 0.5 per cent of the average gross value of production of the nursery industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Amounts raised by the blueberry levy and charge are expected to be approximately $150,000 per year. This will have no financial impact on the Commonwealth as all proceeds will go to the Australian Horticultural Corporation. This body is to be fully funded by amounts by levy and charge, and fee for service. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the second main purpose of the Bill, that of providing alternative collection mechanisms for industries already participating in the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments will provide for the Commonwealth to enter into an agreement with a State or Territory in order to provide for State and Territory authorities to collect horticultural levies on the Commonwealth's behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> This arrangement will have particular application to the citrus industry where it will lead to significant reductions in the cost of collecting levies and charges. Levy and charge payers will, under the proposals, be able to make payments to State citrus boards at the same time as they make payments of State levies. </PARA>
<PARA> This will provide for substantial economies of scale in the administration of levy collections. In areas where there are no State boards or where a State elects not to enter into an agreement with the Commonwealth, the present arrangements whereby payments are made directly to the Commonwealth will continue to apply. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, provisions in the Bill will allow persons having responsibility for levy and charge collections to receive payments from the Corporations to offset costs borne by them in the collection process. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporations will be able to enter into agreements with these persons on payments of costs. It is expected that they will first need to consult with individual industry bodies on the payment of levy collectors for that particular industry levy or charge. Funds for such payments would be expected to be drawn from the relevant industry accounts of the Corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill amends the search warrant provisions of the Horticultural Levy Collection Act and the Horticultural Export Charge Collection Act. These amendments refine the powers of authorised persons in relation to entry of premises and provide for seizure of evidence of the commission of an offence. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>HORTICULTURAL LEVY AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Horticultural Levy Act 1987 to increase the maximum rate of levy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Horticultural Levy Act 1987, together with the Horticultural Levy Collection Act 1987, provide for the imposition and collection of a levy on prescribed horticultural products produced and sold or used in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, the Horticultural Levy Act 1987 sets the maximum rate of levy at 2% of the annual average unit gross value in relation to the classes of horticultural products covered by these Acts. </PARA>
<PARA> The funds raised are to finance the operation of the Australian Horticultural Corporation and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> These Corporations are an essential element in the Government's strategy to enhance the capacity of the horticultural industry to expand exports. They provide the mechanism for this sector to realise its full export potential through coordinated and sustained activity both in horticultural products marketing and in research. </PARA>
<PARA> Industry, notably the apple and pear sector, have requested the maximum rate of levy be increased from 2% to 5% with a view to possibly increasing levies to support these Corporations' future activities. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill reflects industry's wishes in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> Operative rates will continue to be set by Regulation under the Horticultural Levy Act. Total amounts of levies to be collected will rise over the next few years as the number of participating industries increases, and as the rates themselves rise as determined by the participating industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Funds raised through increased levy receipts in respect of the Australian Horticultural Corporation will have no financial impact on the Commonwealth. This is apart from the $5.85 million to be contributed by the Government over its initial 5 years of operation. All operating and administrative costs of the Corporation are to be fully funded by levies from industry and fees-for-service. </PARA>
<PARA> Additional funds raised through the increased levy receipts in respect of the Horticultural Research Development Corporation will be matched by the Commonwealth, on a dollar for dollar basis, up to a limit of 0.5% of the average annual gross value of production of groups of products. </PARA>
<PARA> The extent of the Commonwealth's contribution to research will thus depend on the number of industries which agree to participate in the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation and the rates, up to the maximum, at which they are prepared to fund Corporation research activities. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>HORTICULTURAL EXPORT CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Horticultural Export Charge Act 1987. The Horticultural Export Charge Act 1987, together with the Horticultural Export Charge Collection Act 1987, provide for the imposition and collection of a charge on the export of prescribed horticultural products.</PARA>
<PARA> The funds raised are to finance the activities of the Australian Horticultural Corporation and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is the companion of the Horticultural Levy Amendment Bill 1989, dealt with earlier. Whereas the purpose of that Bill was to increase the maximum rate of levy on prescribed horticultural products produced and sold or used in Australia, this Bill increases the maximum rate of charge payable on exports of prescribed horticultural products. </PARA>
<PARA> The maximum rate in both cases is increased from 2% to 5%. </PARA>
<PARA> There are no financial implications other than those covered in the Second Reading Speech for the Horticultural Levy Amendment Bill 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I want to put my comments in the context of the National Committee on Violence, which was set up by the Government, in its own terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Having regard to the increased incidence of violence crime in Australia society and the need for better understanding of the problem and improved methods of combating violent crime . . . </PARA>
<PARA>One may well ask why that task is not being addressed by the Australian Institute of Criminology or the Criminology Research Council. The reason, regrettably, is that they have been starved of funds. Appropriations for the Institute of Criminology in 1988 actually fell in real terms. If we go back to the previous annual report we find that the board itself found it necessary to comment on difficulties arising from the Government's financial constraints. The Criminology Research Council is half funded by the Commonwealth to the extent of a miserly $125,000, and the funding has not been adjusted for inflation, contrary to the undertaking given previously by the Government. So the two principal research bodies in the area of criminology are inadequately funded and are therefore unable to deal adequately with this very major problem of violent crime. If we go down the burrow a little further we find that of the 114 projects contemplated since the Council commenced operation in 1973, only 10 are directly related to crimes of violence. Of the 25 projects currently in progress, only three would appear to involve at least some consideration of family violence. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition believes that the low priority that the Government is giving to the issue of violent crime in our community, as evidenced by its attitude to funding of these major bodies, is to be regretted. One would have hoped that the Government, when it set up the National Committee on Violence as a separate committee to look at this question and gave it massive terms of reference, would have learnt its lesson and provided adequate funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is obviously designed to serve some political purpose, but, regrettably, when it comes to the job in hand, the funding that it has been given is totally inadequate. It has been promised funding of $120,000. According to its terms of reference, working from research, the Committee is to examine the economic, social and psychological context of violence, to see whether there are links between violence and alcohol and drugs, and to look at the effects of mass media upon violence. It is a massive subject. The Committee is expected to travel around Australia to investigate this question. It has already had to produce working papers, which are good papers, contributing to public knowledge of the subject. The important point is that it is impossible for a body of this type to carry out the functions that it has been given with the funding that it has been given. The Government will tell us that we always say that funding is inadequate. We say that it is a question of wrong priorities. This Government can spend $40m on an unnecessary referendum while failing adequately to fund bodies that are looking at the level of violent crime and what actions can be taken to remedy this totally unsatisfactory situation. I use this opportunity to express the regret of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have often spoken in this chamber on the urgent need to reform Australian shipping and the waterfront. The world does not owe us a living, and unless we improve the productivity of our manufacturing sector and our transport sector we are doomed to a very difficult future. It is not that Australians cannot be productive. Per capita, our primary producers are the most efficient in the world. But in areas such as shipping and the waterfront, our record is absolutely deplorable. Our shipping will never be competitive, no matter what we do about reducing manning levels and bringing conditions into line with those of the rest of the community and other richer Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. That will not be effective unless our ports and our waterfront are cleaned up as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not for nothing that our ports have earned the reputation of being the worst in the developed world. We must tackle the problems of both our shipping and our waterfront. We cannot afford to have one waiting on the other like Admiral Sir Richard Strachan and General the Earl of Chatham waiting to launch an invasion during the Napoleonic wars. It was well summed up with the words:</PARA>
<PARA>Chatham, with his sabre drawn,</PARA>
<PARA>Stood waiting for Sir Richard Strachan. </PARA>
<PARA>Sir Richard, longing to be at 'em,</PARA>
<PARA>Stood waiting too. For whom? Lord Chatham. </PARA>
<PARA>The way this Government operates, everything is waiting for something else and nothing ever comes out at the far end. We must tackle all these problems separately and urgently to attain a coherent end. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we need on the waterfront? It is a formidable list. Other countries can do it; why cannot we? We want company employment. We want involvement by the workers in the enterprise through profit sharing linked with company employment, so that employees have some interest in the enterprise. We want proper casual employment, which all other businesses in Australia have, but which is denied to our waterfront. Employees have to be taken from a pool controlled by the Waterside Workers Federation (WWF). We want a single union in each work place, not five or six, with demarcation disputes and one union causing trouble and bringing the whole lot to a shambling halt. We must have competition between stevedoring companies. Competition is without doubt the key to efficiency. We must end the problems of port control and tugs. Finally, and most important of all, we must achieve reliability. The thing that destroys our exports is our reputation as an unreliable supplier. People will not put up with it and will go somewhere else. We have no unique supplies. If we cannot supply reliably, we will not be chosen as the supplier. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have the Inter-State Commission report on the waterfront. It has made some useful recommendations, but it has gone nowhere near far enough. Before the ink on the report was dry, the waterside unions began to lobby the Government to reject or modify many of the recommendations for reform. The unions do not want company employment, though they are perhaps prepared to wear it. But they are not prepared to end the monopoly of the WWF in all ports. They want to fight that to the death. They certainly do not want any sensible system of casual employment. The other issues just are not tackled at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has to make a decision very soon. But will it decide anything useful? This Government has failed totally to tackle the micro-economic reform. During the six years of this Government, our productivity overall has not risen at all. Not only are we not catching up with the rest of the world but also we are lagging further and further behind. Unless the Government is prepared to take on these issues, we will get into deeper and deeper trouble. The world does not owe us a living. We have to earn it through work, and efficient work at that. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to see some sign that the Government is prepared to take on the unions to get industrial efficiency. It is perfectly prepared to take on people such as the wheat growers because the wheat growers do not vote for the Government. But, as soon as it comes to an important issue to be tackled, where the unions are involved, the Government always behaves like a bunch of wimps. This is much too serious. We have to tackle these issues, we have to tackle them soon, and we have to solve them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-The National Crime Authority (NCA) is one of the principal bodies in this nation established to combat the scourge of organised crime. I want to put my comments on its annual report 1987-88 in the context of some highly unsatisfactory developments that have been occurring recently, it seems, in the relationship between the Government and the NCA. The first of those developments became evident when we read in the press that Mr Justice Vincent of the Victorian Supreme Court had been approached to be the new Chairman of the NCA. I would have thought that, concerning an appointment of that sensitivity, it was a highly unsatisfactory press report to be reading. It obviously was a leak that had come out of the Government in some way, and it did no more than discredit the NCA. The matter deteriorated even further because, within a few days, we read that the ultimate successful party, a Melbourne Queen's Counsel, had been approached to be Chairman of the body. We read that he had been approached in fact to be a part time member of the NCA, but had refused because he believed that he was being offered the job of Chairman. We read all this in the press. The matter deteriorated even one step further because, when the Government could not find a judge to do the job-which we also learnt, through the press, that it was seeking-it approached the same person to take on the job as Chairman, and he accepted. So he is Chairman on the basis of his first having misunderstood the offer that was made, and now, knowing that he was far from the first choice of the Government and further that he was chosen eventually only because the Government was unable to find a judge to perform this function. Obviously this body has a need to be kept in high credit in the eyes of the Australian public and it cannot maintain the sort of reputation that it is slowly developing if it is to be treated with such disrespect by this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to raise another couple of matters which are equally unsatisfactory. On 30 June this year the three longstanding members of the NCA will all retire. Apart from the member who has been appointed to the recently established Adelaide office, there are only three members and they have been there for some considerable time. The total knowledge and experience built up by Mr Robberds, Mr Clark and Mr Justice Stewart will be lost on one day. Therefore, there will be no continuity. I would have thought that that is a major deficiency and something that the Government should have looked to remedy by legislation if necessary rather than have a situation where there will be no continuing flow of information at the level of the three permanent members of the Authority. I put that concern on the record. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter that I find disturbing is that we also learn through the press, as we seem to learn everything in relation to the NCA, that part of the package that has been negotiated with Mr Peter Faris, QC, the new Chairman, is that the head office of the NCA will be moved from Sydney to Melbourne to accommodate him. At what cost that will be, we do not know. At what cost that will be in terms of disruption of the workings of the NCA and at what cost it will be in terms of disruption to the lives of employees of the NCA living in Sydney, with their families living in Sydney and their children attending schools in Sydney, we do not know. Rather than learn of these matters through the press it is time that we learnt them from the relevant Minister in this chamber. We heard the rationale of the Government for making these decisions which, on the face of them, are highly disturbing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I wish to add a few remarks to those made previously on the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission annual report 1987-88. It is stated in the report that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . greater public awareness of human rights issues will eventually lead to the elimination of discriminatory practices. </PARA>
<PARA>The stated objective therefore of the Commission is:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . to promote the acceptance and observance of human rights and equal opportunity in Australia by developing public awareness of these rights through public inquiries, community education and complaint resolution. </PARA>
<PARA>Two major inquiries were conducted by the Commission during the review period. One of those had considerable debate in the chamber yesterday. That was the one on homeless children. The other one was the Toomelah report, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Report on the Problems and Needs of Aborigines living on the New South Wales-Queensland border. That report was launched at Toomelah on 15 June last year. The Commission is to be commended for having launched both of those very important reports. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission states that it receives numerous inquiries on a variety of issues. One series of inquiries concerns prisoners' rights. With regard to prisoners' rights, recent publicity over deaths in custody has revealed that prisoners are not always granted the right to prompt and proper medical attention when imprisoned. I draw the attention of the Senate to the statistics in Western Australia alone, where they are quite appalling. Of the 73 deaths in custody since 1980-34 Aboriginal and 39 non-Aboriginal-around 50 per cent were associated with inadequate and/or tardy medical treatment for accident or illness. Unfortunately, those facts have not always been brought out properly and completely in the coronial inquiries because, under the coronial system in Western Australia, policemen in the case of death in police custody or prison wardens in the case of death in prison custody are not obliged to give evidence. There are signs that some States are making changes in this direction. I would welcome such a change in my home State of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also has a section on complaints tendered to the Commission in the area of immigration. Very often these deal with very basic human rights. I draw the attention of the Senate to the proposed immigration legislation which will shortly come before this place. It has been criticised very dramatically on the basis of very basic human rights. In this context I draw to the Senate's attention the Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees that we have signed in Australia. Its provisions say that it is our duty not to impose penalties on account of illegal immigration or presence in certain instances. There is no guarantee in the legislation to come before us that we will uphold those particular guarantees. Under the provisions of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 the Secretary of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs will have no choice but to order deportation of a refugee who is an illegal entrant and who has outstayed the period of grace to a country where that person has a well-founded fear of persecution. According to the legislation as it stands now, that order will be non-revocable. Deportations such as the one which I have described would be quite plainly contrary to conventions to which we are a signatory. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend this report to the Senate. It is a very full report. It analyses and brings before us the issue of human rights, which must be of concern to us all. </PARA>

As honourable senators would be well aware, committees of this Parliament are looking at particular questions in relation to this subject matter. For example, the Senate's own Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee is looking at the question of directors' responsibilities; a committee of the House of Representatives is looking at the question of insider trading; and a Joint Select Committee of the Parliament looked in depth at the Government's corporate package, reported back and greatly facilitated the passage of that legislation within the last week or two.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But the body that has principally had the responsibility for advising in the area of corporate law reform since the setting up of the cooperative scheme in 1983 has been the Companies and Securities Law Review Committee. I believe it has done a good job and deserves credit that perhaps it has not been given. Many of these bodies exist in the Commonwealth structure to advise government and advise the parliaments. They perform admirably but are not recognised for the work that they do. This body has been provided with six terms of reference: the corporate form itself; disclosure and standards of conduct of directors and officers; the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Act 1980; appeals under the cooperative scheme legislation; optional incorporation of accounts; and prescribed interests. A number of the Committee's recommendations have already reached the form of legislation. One immediately thinks of the Close Corporations Bill which we passed the other day and which I understand was based largely on a report of this body. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to recognise the contribution that this body has made under the cooperative scheme and to indicate that the Opposition is appreciative of the work that it has done, an area of work in which I believe the Parliament itself should have been more active in the past but where it is finally better meeting its responsibility. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few comments in relation to the motion to take note of the report of the Australian Law Reform Commission on community law reform for the Australian Capital Territory. Provided it is the report that I think it is-this brief description does not give full details-it is the third report in relation to the Australian Capital Territory, that dealing with enduring powers of attorney. It is the Law Reform Commission's report No. 47. This is another area in which an important body, the Australian Law Reform Commission, has undertaken work on behalf of the Australian community for which it receives, regrettably, little recognition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Law reform in the Australian Capital Territory is important. The Australian Capital Territory not having had self-government in the past and having only just got self-government, areas such as law reform, where the States have a more direct input and can establish law reform commissions of their own, have had to be met by the Commonwealth. Unfortunately, I regret to say that the Commonwealth has not always well met its responsibility. The Australian Law Reform Commission has stepped into the breach in that regard and has put down a number of papers on areas of reform in relation to Australian Capital Territory law. This particular one, as I said, deals with enduring powers of attorney. As far as the ACT is concerned, this reform is long overdue. This matter has been the subject of reform in various States. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations included in this report for the establishment of enduring powers of attorney seem to me, on their face, to be sound. Certainly I hope they will be debated and, after due consideration, adopted. It is worth reminding ourselves that the Australia Capital Territory has the fastest growing number of old people in Australia, so the subject of enduring powers of attorney is particularly relevant to the ACT. I rose not so much to discuss the content of the report, but rather to recognise the work that the Law Reform Commission has been doing in this regard and to commend that work to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the first report from the Higher Education Council that has been tabled in this Parliament. The Senate will recall that in December last year the funding Bill for all education areas in Australia providing for some $7 billion for higher education-our universities, colleges and institutes-was determined in this Parliament. It is a part of the role of the National Board for Employment, Education and Training and its subsidiary councils to give advice to the Minister, and included in that advice is a review of the pattern of funding set out in that legislation. In July last year, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) referred to the Higher Education Council the draft schedule of financial support to our universities and colleges. The response from the Council dated 9 December and over the signature of the Chairman, Dr Greg Ramsey, was forwarded to the Minister by Professor Robert Smith, who is the Chairman of the Board.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because this is the Council's first report, and because it involves the provision of $7 billion for the years 1989 to 1991, it is one that we should take some note of. I note that the Board's covering letter refers to $843m additional expenditure for the triennium. The Board says in its letter that it understands that this $843m is additional to any of the funding that had been provided for the whole portfolio area. I want to note that as the Minister has not corrected that understanding, it is right for this Parliament to assume that the Board has got it right and that there is not a fiddle whereby this $843m is going to the portfolio in some other way. </PARA>
<PARA> The Board is not sufficiently established and does not have sufficient resources for us to be totally convinced that this is the case. We must, very largely, accept the word of the Minister and the Department. It is disconcerting that there are a number of areas in this report where there is a face value acceptance of what the Department says. The Board and the Council do not have the ability credibly to report to the Minister and to the Parliament that, on the basis of independent assessment, something is actually correct. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chairman of the Board called for an independent review of the graduate tax scheme. I concur with that. I believe that there should be that kind of independence even within the Board and its Council. Throughout the report there are references to the necessity in 1988 for the Council to work very closely with the Department. But I sound a warning that there should not be so close a working relationship between the Council and the Board and the Department, such that the Board and the Council lose independence. We are used to the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission being able to report publicly with independence. It has yet to be seen that there is that same level of independence in respect of the Board and the Council. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have time to refer to particular aspects of the report, but I certainly point out that those of us with an interest in education have read the paragraphs carefully. Finally, I note that this report is in our hands four months after its submission to the Minister. It is almost too out of date for us to make sensible comments about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Defence Housing Authority happens to represent one of the few things that this Government has done for defence personnel which are of any substantial benefit. I have always given it credit for taking action in this area. But in considering the annual report today, I wish very briefly to point out that in his press release of 30 January 1986 the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) referred to capital funds being provided for service housing. He talked about $64m in that financial year with an intended increase to around $70m to $80m a year until all houses were brought up to standard. Yet at a Senate Estimates committee hearing on only 13 April this year I was told by an officer that the capital is to be treated as a loan at the long term treasury bond rate, which is currently about 13.5 per cent. I think this is a quite disgraceful exercise by the Government which got enormous political capital out of its announcement that $750m worth of capital would be going into the Defence Housing Authority. It turns out that not only is it a loan-the interest bill is already $13m-but also it will have to be repaid in full at the end of the period. So it was a very misleading announcement by the Minister and he has taken credit under false pretences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also wish briefly to mention a new announcement made by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mr Simmons, about the new rental scheme for Defence Force personnel. I am very glad to recognise the Minister's announcement. It means that Defence Force families will be able to rent private accommodation from the Defence Housing Authority, as the head tenant. This scheme has long been in operation in the British Army. I raised this proposal in this place during my first year in the Parliament, suggesting that it was a very cost effective way of producing better quality housing for the forces. It has taken the Government three years to listen to my constant reminders about this scheme, but I welcome its introduction nevertheless. </PARA>
<PARA> The Defence Housing Authority is to date operating, I believe, in a pretty effective manner. I am very glad to be able to report, on the basis of my visits around the defence bases, that service personnel are gradually recognising that things are improving very slowly. I think this is very much to do with the people who have been put in charge of the Authority. The consultative arrangements that it has put in place with spouses seem to be working pretty well in most areas. That is vital to the long term success of the program. I believe that there is a problem in that it is still bound by scales and standards which are very much the old public service idea of how much square of carpet one can have in one's office, whether people can have one carport or two or an en suite or a family room, and how big the bedrooms can be. They are sadly out of date. They do not reflect modern Australia's living standards. They need to be changed or got rid of altogether so that the Defence Housing Authority is not so shackled by what have often worked out to be expensive limitations. </PARA>
<PARA> I have visited some of the acquisitions that the Authority has made in its first year in office. I have been most impressed with its ability to acquire good quality properties at a reasonable cost to the taxpayer. Many of the houses I have seen have also been upgraded. I raise a query here: in some cases too much money is being put into places which will always remain too old and too small, but the Authority is well aware of that problem. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the greatest problems which may face the Authority is that in some States the old Australian Construction Service has been retained as its agent for repairs and maintenance. In Puckapunyal, for example, this has led to great dissatisfaction. I hope that this will be improved in the future because that Service has not had a good record of speedy, cost effective and good quality maintenance. It is an area where morale will be quickly affected if repairs to homes are not undertaken speedily, if the quality of the workmanship is not good and if the attitude of the workmen is not acceptable to the families whom they are employed to help. However, I would like to congratulate the Defence Housing Authority on its year of operations. It augurs well for the future, and Defence Force families will be the better for its being in operation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first report on the higher education contribution scheme concerns the profiles of higher education institutions and the operation of the student contribution scheme, which is colloquially known as the graduate tax. When the legislation was debated last December in this Parliament the Opposition, with the support of the Australian Democrats, required an amendment to be passed, which was eventually accepted by the Government, that reports be presented in February and August of each year on these two important matters. The Opposition is not yet convinced that the new profile scheme of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, and the present Labor Government is a fitting, sound basis for the allocation of moneys to our universities and colleges on a triennial basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In brief, the profile system sets out to require each institution to give a written statement of its objectives-that is, the profile of that higher education institution-and to set out under various headings the objectives, the courses, the student enrolments, the student completions and so on, not only with regard to teaching but also with regard to research. It is acknowledged by everybody at this point that the format for describing a higher education institution's profile with regard to research is quite inadequate. It has not been soundly conceived. There are a lot of complaints to the effect that, in part, it is meaningless and a distraction. It is not yet in a form that is acceptable to the Opposition, let alone the institutions themselves, or indeed, as I understand it, members of the Higher Education Council and the National Board for Employment, Education and Training. </PARA>
<PARA> The reservations of the Opposition go far beyond that. We are very concerned that backroom pressures should not be placed by the Minister in Canberra on higher education institutions by negotiating in secret the form that the profile will take as submitted by an institution. We want to avoid any pressure from Canberra to induce a higher education institution to define its activities in a way which is so acceptable to the Minister that he then subsequently funds those activities. If an institution, however rightly it thought its activities ought to be in teaching and research in a particular area, were deterred from doing what it thought to be right purely because of the financial incentives given to it by the Minister and members of his Department to gain a financial advantage, we would be seeing the deterioration of higher education in this country through the backroom operation of the Minister and his Department in Canberra. We do not want to see that. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why it is essential for the Higher Education Council to consult with the higher education institutions and give an independent report to this Parliament, even on the terms that the Minister has set out in the White Paper and in Government policy, that this process is honest and sound and is not conducted in a secretive fashion. Because this is a preliminary report, the first report on the profile system, we do expect a much fuller report in August. With regard to timing, many months have passed since this report was prepared in February. We get to see it in May, and we are debating it on 25 May. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the graduate tax, there is a similar need to report. The report by the Council is preliminary, as it must be, because the system had been operating only for some weeks when it was required to present this initial report. Again, in August we want to see a full and as independent a review as possible of the graduate tax system. </PARA>

However difficult it may be to define our terms precisely, we have done so in the report, and the Government make a sympathetic response to those definitions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the last 15 years in Australia, particularly through the activities of parents and teachers of gifted and talented children-and, I might say, a minority activity on the part of teachers without the full blessing of their employing departments and so on-there has been a genuine and positive development in the techniques for identifying gifted and talented children and in the formulation of educational programs that will help those children rise to their full potential. This movement in Australia-not officially recognised, not given sufficient resources and not fully welcomed by the mainstream teaching organisations in many States-led to this Senate inquiry. The good news in the Government's response is that it has responded as positively as it possibly can to everything that we set out in that Committee report. The Government's response states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Select Committee, which tabled its report on 18 May 1988,-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, a year ago-</PARA>
<PARA>is to be commended for its efforts. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government tries to own our own conclusions by looking back over the 1970s and 1980s and, in reference to the Hawke period, the Fraser period and even the Whitlam period, tries to identify government actions that have built a foundation for the good things which we are now commending the Government to pursue further. The response continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government considers that its original objective of fostering and stimulating activity, debate and interest in the needs of gifted and talented children has been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA>Whilst that is a little self-congratulatory on the Government's part, and I believe it is overcongratulatory looking over the last 20 years, nevertheless it is healthy to see that the Government does not want to own up to the fact that it has been doing positive things. The response continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government supports the general direction of the Report's recommendations, in particular those dealing with the professional development of teachers, the development of appropriate teaching and learning materials, and expanding the availability of relevant curriculum information. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's response goes on to mention how this report and our recommendations were referred to the Australian Education Council, which of course comprises the Ministers for education in each of the States and Territories. It was referred to those other Ministers with the full commendation of the Commonwealth Government. I welcome all of that. We had some nine recommendations. The Government acknowledges, as we did, that the main initiative in school programs lies with the States but, to the extent that it is appropriate for the Commonwealth to take the initiative, it is responding. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome all of those elements. I note that there is not any decision here to find additional moneys, to give additional resources to set up a new Commonwealth program that might even, after an initial period, be taken over by the States. That would have been welcomed. Whilst I note the Government's decision not to do that, I commend the Government for its full approval of our report. </PARA>

<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE EDUCATION OF GIFTED AND TALENTED CHILDREN</PARA>
<PARA> For the information of the Honourable Senators, I present a statement containing the Government's response to the Report of the Senate Select Committee on the Education of Gifted and Talented Children. </PARA>
<PARA> On 17 October 1985, the Senate resolved that the Standing Committee on Education and the Arts should inquire into and report upon the education of gifted and talented children. On 17 November 1986, the Committee tabled a brief progress report. After the 35th Parliament took office, the Senate Committee was re-constituted as the Senate Committee on Employment, Education and Training. The Senate resolved on 22 September 1987 to establish a Select Committee to complete the inquiry and report to the Senate on or before the first day of sitting in 1988. This was later extended to 26 May 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The Select Committee, which tabled its report on 18 May 1988, is to be commended for its efforts. The Government has closely examined the report and its recommendations and I am pleased to present this statement in response. </PARA>
<PARA> The Select Committee clearly recognised the difficulty in defining and thereby identifying the gifted and talented child. It also noted that giftedness is not necessarily stable over the years of schooling and is extremely difficult to measure. Therefore, when we speak of the gifted or talented child we must recognise that we are talking of children whose skills and abilities are diverse and multi-faceted, embracing creativity and divergent thinking, originality, sensitivity and improvisation, as well as the more widely acknowledged talents and gifts of academic brilliance and sporting prowess. Recognising this diversity-and responding to it-is a challenge facing all of the nation's school systems. </PARA>
<PARA> Although primary and secondary education in Australia is largely the responsibility of the individual States and Territories, the Commonwealth Government has an important role, which includes providing leadership and encouragement in matters seen to be of national concern. The Select Committee's report clearly documents the significant role the Commonwealth has played in fostering and encouraging the development of gifted and talented children. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the establishment of the Commonwealth Schools Commission in 1973, the Commonwealth Government has taken an active interest in this area. The Government, especially through its Projects of National Significance Program, gave substantial encouragement and opportunity to educational authorities and parent and community groups to examine ways of enhancing the educational opportunities of gifted and talented students. As the Committee reports, this was a period of considerable development and innovation. Many school systems and other groups explored new approaches to educating gifted students, including the use of withdrawal classes, special schools, advanced placement and out-of-school activities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is significant to note that the opportunities provided through the joint efforts of the States, the Territories and the Commonwealth during this period led almost all school systems to formulate policies for the eduction of their gifted and talented students-policies that, in the main, require systems and schools to strengthen their overall performance and through that means meet the educational needs of gifted and talented children. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government considers that its original objective of fostering and stimulating activity, debate and interest in the needs of gifted and talented children has been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> As a general principle, the Commonwealth believes that continuing provision for the gifted and talented should be made by school and system authorities from the general resources made available to them. Most systems now have in place programs for their gifted and talented students and the Commonwealth believes that all should do so. </PARA>
<PARA> As the report points out, it is not a time to be complacent or to diminish our efforts. I share the Select Committee's concern that some of our most able students are under-achieving, often lack motivation, and develop well short of their potential. The Government supports the general direction of the Report's recommendations, in particular those dealing with the professional development of teachers, the development of appropriate teaching and learning materials, and expanding the availability of relevant curriculum information. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is now addressing the role of schools more broadly, in the context of a society undergoing significant social and economic change. In a recent statement on Strengthening Australia's Schools, the Government identified a range of issues concerning schooling and invited the co-operation of the States and Territories to develop and implement a national effort to strengthen the capacity of our schools to meet the challenges they face. These challenges ultimately involve ensuring that all children, including the gifted and talented, reach their fullest potential. </PARA>
<PARA> Working co-operatively with the States, the Government aims to achieve a number of objectives, including the development of curriculum statements of common principles and agreed areas for collaborative action-setting out the major areas of knowledge and the most appropriate mix of skills and experience for all children. The Government is also seeking co-operation adopting common approaches to assessment, including a national approach to monitoring student achievement, assessing school performance and public reporting on schooling. Through these and other means of strengthening Australia's schools, educational opportunities for all students, including the gifted and talented, will be enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA> The successful education of all children is dependent on the attitudes, knowledge and skills of their teachers, and the support services made available to them. The national collaborative effort the Government has initiated will include ways of improving teacher training, at both the pre-service and in-service levels. Collaboration will also be sought to enhance the quantity and quality of curriculum information available to the classroom teacher. The Curriculum Corporation of Australia will be requested to seek the co-operation of the States and Territories to strengthen the services provided by the Australian Curriculum Information Network, including increased attention to the collection and dissemination of information related to the teaching of gifted and talented students. The Government is therefore responding to Recommendation 8 in the Select Committee's Report. </PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth resources available to schools now stand at their highest ever level. Over the period 1984-92 general recurrent grants for government schools will have increased in real terms by 37% for each primary student and 102% for each secondary student. For non-government schools the real increases will be up to 40% for each primary student and up to 30% for each secondary student. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's recent initiatives are aimed at ensuring that the most efficient and productive use is made of these resources. The aim is a strengthened schools system which will be an important component of an integrated system of education and training. The options and opportunities available to students of all levels of ability, and with different specific talents, will be increased as a result of these initiatives. These initiatives support the Committee's recommendation regarding increased financial assistance (Recommendation 9). </PARA>
<PARA> The Government supports the Select Committee's views regarding research into teaching and learning. The practice of teaching needs to be continually informed with new theory. It also needs to be updated in the light of emerging social, economic and technological change. </PARA>
<PARA> The Select Committee has recommended (Recommendations 6 and 7) the establishment of a national centre for research into the education of gifted children. This matter is currently under consideration by the Australian Education Council (AEC). An AEC Working Party has sought State and Territory reactions to the report's recommendations, as they relate to research and training, and has prepared its final recommendations which will be considered in discussion at the next AEC meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> In its report the Select Committee commended the support of business and industry for assisting the development of our more able students. The Government has encouraged an increase in private sector sponsorship in support of local and national initiatives, such as the annual Mathematics summer school. It also wishes to encourage greater involvement by business and industry in all levels of education, to the benefit of all students. </PARA>
<PARA> I attach a list of recommendations of the Report which relate to the Commonwealth's role and provide a response to each recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA>Attachment</PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE REPORT OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE EDUCATION OF GIFTED AND TALENTED CHILDREN RELATED TO THE COMMONWEALTH</PARA>
<PARA> The Report makes a number of recommendations which advocate advancing `the talents of highly able students' (9.2). </PARA>
<PARA> The basic premise of the Report is that:</PARA>
<PARA> the national interest dictates that our education systems encourage gifted children though not at the expense of other children (9.4). </PARA>
<PARA> The Report recommends that the Commonwealth become involved in the support of the education of gifted and talented students in a number of ways which are summarised as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 1:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government make a clear statement that special educational strategies should be provided for gifted children throughout Australia. (Paragraph 7.17)</PARA>
<PARA>Response:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth recognises that decisions about curriculum content, resource allocation to schools and the professional development of teachers are the constitutional responsibility of the States, but it does support the provision of special educational strategies for gifted children. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 3:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends to the Commonwealth Government that the professional development of all teachers in the areas of education currently accorded special assistance, namely, the education of girls, Aborigines and disadvantaged children, include the identification and education of gifted children from those populations. (Paragraph 7.36)</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth recognises the importance of teacher training both at the pre-service and in-service levels in assisting teachers to provide a schooling environment which helps all children reach their full potential. </PARA>
<PARA> Each Commonwealth specific purpose program provides support for children of all abilities within the designated population for which it is designed. In so far as each specific purpose program provides for some professional development of teachers the Commonwealth regards it as appropriate that the needs of gifted children within the target groups be given attention. </PARA>
<PARA> While supporting the Committee's Recommendation 3 in principle, the Commonwealth believes the type of professional development provided should be left to the judgment of those delivering specific purposes programs. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 4:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that the professional development of teachers in the education of gifted children be supported by the Commonwealth Government. (Paragraph 7.36)</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth support for professional development of teachers is provided through general recurrent grants, through specific purpose programs and through post-graduate study by teachers in Higher Education. The States and non-government authorities, higher education institutions and teachers themselves determine the relative weight to be given to professional development related to gifted and talented children. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's report, however, has highlighted the need for the professional development of teachers to take account of the needs of gifted and talented children. The Commonwealth believes that the interest fostered by the report will result in an increased emphasis on professional teacher development relating to the gifted and talented. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 5:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that appropriate videotapes and associated materials for isolated gifted children be funded by the Commonwealth Government and developed in conjunction with subject specialists and experts in gifted education. (Paragraph 6.55)</PARA>
<PARA>Response:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has no direct involvement in schooling and is therefore unable to influence directly what is taught in schools. It does, however, commend the Committee for raising the matter of the needs of isolated gifted and talented children. </PARA>
<PARA> It was accepted by the 60th meeting of the Australian Education Council in April 1989 that the Commonwealth and the States establish a co-operative curriculum structure. The new structure, known as the Curriculum Corporation of Australia will enable the States to evaluate their curriculum needs and the Commonwealth to work co-operatively with the States to develop new curriculum materials. The matter of curriculum materials for isolated gifted children will be referred to the Curriculum Corporation of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 6:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that a national centre for research into the education of gifted children be established in an Australian tertiary institution and that this centre be financially supported during its establishment phase by the Commonwealth Government. (Paragraph 7.50)</PARA>
<PARA>Response:</PARA>
<PARA> This matter is under consideration by the Australian Education Council and will be discussed in October 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 7:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee makes no recommendation about the location of the proposed national research centre, but recommends that the Commonwealth Government consider expressions of interest from tertiary institutions. (Paragraph 7.51)</PARA>
<PARA>Response:</PARA>
<PARA> This matter will be considered within the context of the Australian Education Council discussions in October 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 8:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that priority be given to expanding the information on the education of gifted children within the Australian Curriculum Information Network and that this information be made accessible to educational institutions and those sections of the community with an interest in this area of education. (Paragraph 7.56)</PARA>
<PARA>Response:</PARA>
<PARA> The proposal for inclusion of additional information on the education of the gifted and talented in the Australian Curriculum Information Network (ACIN) will be strongly commended to all those who input data to the system. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 9:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that the Government expand its financial support for the various vacation schools, seminars and workshops designed to enhance the skills of gifted and talented children. (Paragraph 4.64)</PARA>
<PARA>Response:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises that the activities mentioned by the Committee are important in developing the potential of gifted and talented children. The Government agrees with the Committee's contention that these activities could be expanded with further financial support, but considers that this support should come from the private sector. The Government will encourage such support whenever possible. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PF4">Senator COLSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to mention something of the historical background to the Government's response. The response is a result of a decision by the Senate on 17 October 1985 that the then Standing Committee on Education and the Arts should inquire into and report on the education of gifted and talented children. That Committee received 171 submissions and subsequently held public meetings in Canberra and all the State capitals. On 17= November 1986 the Committee tabled a brief progress report, but before it could present a final report both Houses of the Parliament were dissolved, on 5 June 1987. What then occurred is described in the report on gifted and talented children, which was presented to the Senate, as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>After the 35th Parliament took office, the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts was reconstituted as the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, with only one Senator of the former Committee amongst its members. In order to keep faith with the many persons who had taken considerable time and effort to put their views on the education on gifted and talented children before the former Committee, the Senate resolved on 22 September 1987 to establish a Select Committee to complete the inquiry . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to thank those honourable senators who were on the Committee. I thank Senator Teague, who was Deputy Chairman of the original Committee and who served on the Select Committee as well. I would also like to thank Senator Newman for helping in the completion of the report, and my colleague from this side, Michael Beahan who was also on the Select Committee. The Government, in its response, refrained from making recommendations which could not realistically be implemented by the Commonwealth Government. Perhaps recommendation 2, which relates to universities and colleges of advanced education (CAEs), was not able to be acted on by the Commonwealth. We put that in there because we thought that if there could be a recommendation in relation to teacher training for universities and CAEs being funded by the Commonwealth, we should put it in. However, the remaining eight were responded to. The first recommendation of the Committee states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that the Commonwealth Government make a clear statement that special educational strategies should be provided for gifted children throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>We thought that if the Commonwealth did this, it would be a lead to educational authorities throughout Australia. The Government did respond as we had hoped, and said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth recognises that decisions about curriculum content, resource allocation to schools and the professional development of teachers are the constitutional responsibility of the States, but it does support the provision of special educational strategies for gifted children. </PARA>
<PARA>There is not sufficient time to go through the remaining recommendations. In general, I find that the recommendations are quite satisfactory. Like Senator Teague, I think it would have been nice had the Commonwealth been able to provide some funds, but it made quite clear that it recognised that education at this level was the responsibility of the States. However it has provided a great amount of support in its response. I thank the Government for bringing it down. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sad to say that if Senator Colston believes the Government's response to be satisfactory, he really is easily satisfied. I cannot believe that in his heart of hearts he really is as satisfied as he would give us to understand. I want first of all to draw attention to what the Government has said about the skills that this country needs. I think it is very relevant if we are talking about the education of the most gifted and talented children of our country. In the ministerial statement titled Higher Education in Australia, which Mr Dawkins brought down on 22 September 1987, it is said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our traditional attitudes to education and skills formation in Australia have been conditioned by an economy which has been able to rely more on natural resources than on human skills to support our living standards and national development. Just as these circumstances have changed dramatically, so too must our attitudes and practices in education and training . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Our universities and colleges of advanced education are the main source of the highly educated men and women so essential to our continued economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister also said:</PARA>
<PARA> In summary, there are critically important challenges ahead if Australia is to achieve the standards of intellectual capacity essential for success in an increasingly competitive world. The Government has committed itself to working towards change within an expanding system. </PARA>
<PARA>In the document called Strengthening Australia's Schools, the Government said:</PARA>
<PARA>Priority should be given to meeting the basic skill requirements and special educational needs of disadvantaged groups from the earliest years of schooling through to the successful completion of the secondary years. </PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>One of the most fundamental aspects of fairness for all students is the provision of a disciplined school environment in which they can learn, acquire skills and develop their aptitudes. </PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear from the response which the Government has made to the Senate Select Committee's report on the education of gifted and talented children that those are only words. What really counts are the sorts of reactions we got from Senator Walsh when I, Senator Macklin and Senator Haines were all interested in when this Government's response would be brought down. Senator Walsh said that he did not even know about the report because he had more important things to do than read Senate reports. He said that the delay probably indicates something about the degree of respect which the Government has for Senate committee reports, a degree of respect which by and large is entirely justified. This attitude is what comes through in the Government's response to this report. As Senator Colston has just said, the report recognised the difficult areas of constitutional responsibility when it comes to education. It made only nine recommendations, all of which were really within the area of the Commonwealth to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA> Sadly, the children who are leaving school, even though they are the brightest and most talented in this country, drop out because their talents are not recognised. They play up in school, their teachers cannot cope with them and they develop a negative attitude to school. They leave the education system forever. Australia is being disadvantaged. We are not taking these children through the sort of skills development that this country needs and that the ministerial statement spoke about in such glowing terms. This Government has failed to provide for the education of a disadvantaged group in this country-namely, those who are gifted and talented. </PARA>
<PARA> If I had more time I could go through each of the responses from the Government. They are totally inadequate; they are mouthing platitudes. For instance, the Commonwealth believes that the interest fostered by the report will result in an increased emphasis on professional teacher development. It will be nothing of the sort unless the Commonwealth is prepared to put in more resources and give leadership in this area. The Commonwealth puts a lot of money into teacher development and training in this country. It could give a much greater emphasis to the need for teachers to develop skills in order to recognise gifted and talented children and to develop techniques to train them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government says that a national centre for research into the education of gifted and talented children is under consideration by the Australian Education Council and will be discussed in October 1989. We will then see whether the Government is really prepared to do anything meaningful. That is an important recommendation that needs to be taken up. It is not prepared to do anything much about curriculum materials for children, particularly in isolated areas. It has a responsibility for the education of girls, disadvantaged children and Aborigines. In these areas it could be doing something constructive about the education of gifted and talented children within those communities. It is not prepared to pick that up either. The Government agrees with the Committee that the activities being undertaken by volunteers could be expanded if they had further financial support but it considers that that support should come from the private sector. Once again we have seen the failure of the Government to do anything meaningful for gifted and talented children. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would have been more appropriate if I had made these remarks in the second reading debate but the Bill came on more quickly than I expected. Senator Watson has spoken to me and to the office of the Treasurer (Mr Keating). I want to confirm what he has already said in his broad outline-that is, that the Government is in the process of completing its own review to permit taxpayers to deduct the cost of professional advice when attending to tax audits, in general compliance with taxation laws, representation in taxation reviews and dispute processes and in seeking taxation advice. Therefore, we will not be opposing the Bill. The review has included a full consultation process by the Australian Taxation Office with professional accounting legal bodies and will canvass their views. The final outcome of that review will therefore reflect the needs of both the Commissioner of Taxation and the professional bodies. Whilst not opposing the Bill, the Government has not fully examined it in the context of its own review. It is likely that when the Bill gets to the House of Representatives a number of amendments will be proposed by the Government to make it more comprehensive than it is in the form that Senator Watson has proposed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only other thing I wish to say is that there will be, of course, a revenue cost associated with the measure. It is difficult to quantify-indeed, it is more difficult than normal-because advice of the type that Senator Watson has proposed in this Bill and the more comprehensive proposal which the Government may put up by way of amendment, is already effectively tax deductable to a number of large companies which tend to have in-house people, full time employees, who provide that sort of advice to them. That makes it particularly difficult to cost. It also raises the issue-and this is one of the reasons the Government is not opposing the Bill-that the existing arrangements in that sense are more favourable to certain classes-generally larger taxpayers. </PARA>

I also pay some tribute to the Government for accepting what I believe is a very good proposal. We are all taxpayers after all is said and done. Having spent something like 2 1/2 hours with Mr Boucher last night going into the tax file numbering system, I can understand the massive task that the Australian Taxation Office must have not only with taxation laws but with public relations exercises.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IH4">Senator JENKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do wish to speak to that amendment. I addressed some general remarks to this matter when we previously debated this legislation. It is fortuitous that a report on video material was tabled in the Victorian Parliament today. The media reports, such as the one I saw in today's Age, on the report tabled today in the Victorian Parliament are so mixed up and full of so many conflicting statements that they cannot possibly all be true. This has brought this business to a head. I believe that we can clarify matters a great deal in a debate such as this. An article by Robyn Dickson in today's Age, headed `Report urges reforms to allow crack downs on X-rated videos', states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee was concerned about police evidence that any kind of video, including those depicting child pornography, bestiality, extreme violence, sexual violence and terrorism, could be obtained under the counter at Victorian video outlets. </PARA>
<PARA>Such videos are banned in Victoria. In fact such videos are banned all over Australia. They are not X-rated; they are not classified; they have no classification at all in Australia. The report goes on to say that they are banned in Victoria but they are distributed from Canberra by mail order. These are not the videos we are discussing in the Regulation of Video Material Bill 1988 which is before us. Everybody should understand that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Joint Select Committee on Video Material recommended, by a narrow majority, that Australia should have the category of NVE-non-violent erotica. Had that recommendation to allow videos which contained erotica but not violence been implemented, any video which currently has an `X' rating would be regarded as an illegal video. One of the problems is that X-rated videos in the United States of America and in the United Kingdom can contain not only sexual material but also violence. </PARA>
<PARA> This Victorian report has come out very dramatically against violence. We now have a situation in which in the States Australian X-rated videos are banned but there are criminal activities related to the production of video materials which are totally banned in Australia. Therefore, most likely it is a very different matter for the police and other people to distinguish between them. As I said before, videos such as those depicting child pornography and so on are banned everywhere and are not classified in Australia. Part of the problem is that there has been so much misinformation put out to the public that it simply does not understand these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> During the second reading debate I commended Senator Walters for having the courage to define explicit depictions of sexual acts in her legislation because these definitions are not available through the Film Censorship Board. It strikes me as being far more sensible to look at the definitions of and perhaps tighten up on our present X-rated videos which contain non-violent erotica-in other words, depict human actions which are lawful-so that we have total control over such material. Then it would be much easier to know when we have illegal material in this country and to cope with it properly. </PARA>
<PARA> I personally have no truck with the non-violent erotica type of videos. The ones that I have seen have nothing much to commend them, certainly nothing much of artistic merit. But if we were to ban them on those grounds we would be banning a lot of material that is around both on video and on our television screens. However, having said that, many people in Australia would object and do object very strongly to people standing up here and deciding what they should and should not be allowed to view when, in the minds of many people, non-violent erotica is not harmful. </PARA>
<PARA> This Victorian report cracked down very heavily on all forms of violence-violence on television screens, violence on the news; all sorts of violence. It cracked down primarily on violence. There is confusion in the debate because X-rated videos are linked with violence. In Australia they are not. That confusion could be solved very easily by the first recommendation of the report of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material being implemented. I would be very interested to hear what Senator Walters has to say on these matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have the revised copy, the one before that and the one before that in my keeping. So we are dealing with the fourth lot of amendments that have been revised by Senator Jenkins. As she says, the first amendment she has put up is the same in all the revised editions she has handed us but it leaves out `whether or not the material' and inserts `and'. Consequently, that scuttles the whole of the Bill as I had intended it. I am sure that Senator Jenkins just intended to include X-rated videos as they are presently classified, thus changing my section that excludes them. But she has indeed done more than that. I do not know whether she is aware of it but she has made it more liberal than the present situation. Because it would be in legislation, it would override the present guidelines. Clause 5 (3) of the Bill states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Without limiting the generality of subsection (2), video material shall be refused classification for any of the purposes specified in subsection (1)-</PARA>
<PARA>which is the one that would give the Censorship Board the right to classify them-</PARA>
<PARA>if the material includes explicit depictions of sexual acts involving adults, . . . includes any depiction suggesting coercion or non-consent of any kind. </PARA>
<PARA>That is very specific. It reintroduces the old classification of X-rated videos as we knew them when we were sitting on the Committee. But the guidelines have changed quite considerably since then. I do not think Senator Jenkins can be aware of them. The Film Censorship Board has tightened up those regulations. Senator Jenkins's amendment liberalises the guidelines as they have been put forward by the Film Censorship Board. I ask Senator Jenkins: is that her purpose? Does she intend to liberalise the present guidelines the Film Censorship Board has put out very recently-in the last few weeks?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When moving my first amendment, my intention was not to ban erotic material in which there is no violence or coercion of any kind. I am firmly convinced that that will lead to criminal activities, as indeed we see is currently happening in Victoria. That is why I have moved my other amendments. I believe there should be a tightening up of the availability of both the materials and the promotional materials of the videos which are available only to people over the age of 18 years. In other words, the young should be protected from the availability of current R-rated and X-rated videos and people who find objectionable the promotional materials of both R-rated and X-rated videos should not have to be confronted with those materials and therefore offended by them unless they choose to go into areas where those materials are available.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>That would include classifications R and X under the current and updated guidelines put out by the Film Censorship Board. Senator Walters has the definition in clause 5 (1) (g). I am following her definition. Obviously it refers to video materials being allowed to be sold or hired under the current guidelines, only to people over the age of 18. If the guidelines were tightened tomorrow, the new ones would be the current guidelines. As I indicated when I spoke earlier, I believe that some of the guidelines should be tightened somewhat as they relate to some of the currently X-rated material that is available. But that is something else, and it is not dealt with in this legislation. What we are looking at in this legislation is whether currently X-rated material should be banned totally. </PARA>
<PARA> I have given two basic reasons why I feel very strongly against that. One of them concerns censorship. I concede that some of the depictions in X-rated material should go out, but I do not believe that we in this chamber should be making decisions about X-rated material on behalf of Australian adults. One of the first things that a totalitarian regime-whether a communist regime on the Left or a fascist regime on the Right-does is impose censorship, and one of the first things to be censored is sexual material. I personally do not want a bar of going down that track. Protecting the young is another matter; tightening up on the material is another; and being sensible and categorising material honestly as NVE-non-violent erotica-is another. But those matters are not addressed in this legislation. </PARA>

That is not the case. Indeed, the Film Censorship Board made it very clear that an adult depicted as a child could not perform any acts of child pornography. That would be censored.

All these areas are already covered. There is no point in the honourable senator saying that her dislike of censorship drives her to oppose my Bill. It is already acknowledged, both by Government senators and by Senator Jenkins, that censorship has a place. It is freely acknowledged by the arms of the law that censorship is necessary. The evidence that we received from numerous groups all over Australia and from international groups is that continual viewing of X-rated video material has a desensitising effect, even if there is no violence, because it degrades women. While videos that degrade women continue to be produced, I do not want ever to hear the Government say that it is working on behalf of women.</PARA></TALK.START>

People are desensitised when they continually see women degraded. Pretty extreme feminists have said to me, `It is the first time I have agreed with you on anything, senator, but I agree with you entirely about this'. This has brought together women's organisations from all over Australia. Senator Zakharov shakes her head.

In evidence before us, the women from the Office who came before us said that they had not viewed any videos, had no intention of viewing any and would not be supporting any that depicted women being subjugated and degraded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Jenkins wants to put into legislation a relaxation or liberalisation of what is allowed in X-rated videos. She will continue to support her amendment. If the Government wants to override the guidelines of the Film Censorship Board, it will support Senator Jenkins's amendment. We have to remember that the women of Australia are feeling vulnerable. They know that rape has increased 140 per cent in 10 years. They know that severe violence has increased over 200 per cent in the same period. Women will no longer open the door, even in the middle of the day, to answer a knock. When we are campaigning, and we all go out campaigning, we realise that that occurs. As I have said in the Senate before, 14 years ago, when I first came to this Parliament, I was able to go out doorknocking, and women used to open the door straight away. Now they do not. They say, `Who is there?'. They do not trust the knock on the door. They are concerned at being very vulnerable. </PARA>
<PARA> How many sessions have Senator Zakharov and Senator Jenkins attended recently where instruction on self-defence has been given for women? I have attended many. In the community now, women feel that they need to take self-defence courses. We have not had this need in the community before. In the 14 years since I first came into this place, I have never had it suggested that women should attend sessions on self-defence. That is now common. All women's groups are conducting these sessions. Honourable senators might not like to acknowledge the situation and might not like it, but that is the present situation and that is what has resulted from the fact that women feel vulnerable. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these women's organisations have pleaded with the Government and the Australian Democrats, who hold the balance of power, to support my Bill. If the Government and the Democrats are to ignore the pleas of all of those women's organisations, I do not want to hear them in this place again talk about assisting women and helping them to retain their dignity and their methods of bringing up the Australian family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to take much of the time of the Senate, but I cannot let pass some of the things that have just been said-such as that women no longer want to open their doors in the middle of the day. Maybe they do not want to open them to Senator Walters, but I do not have any problems with people opening their doors when I am doorknocking. We had a by-election in Victoria not long ago, so I have been doing so recently. I was campaigning during the middle of the day and I had no problems with people not opening the door.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The figures that Senator Walters quoted are obviously those for reported rapes. Anybody who knows anything about changes in the law and in community attitudes will know that, 20 years ago and more, many rapes went unreported because of the way victims were treated by the police and other people. It was often said that the woman brought it on herself because of the clothes she wore, because she went out at night, et cetera. They are all bygone attitudes in most places and, therefore, the rate of reported rape is very much higher. The Australian Institute of Criminology will tell us that there is no hard evidence that the actual incidence of rape has risen. This is typical of the sort of arguments we get on these matters from Senator Walters. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walters claimed that every women's organisation in Australia bar one supported her point of view. That is absolute nonsense. We all know the sort of organisations that would have been contacted by the Liberal Party when raising that matter of public importance some months ago. They were the predictable organisations, such as the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association and Women Who Want to be Women-who I understand have a new name, Endeavour something; it has a membership of about 30 people. Those were the sorts of organisations contacted. Naturally the Liberal Party did not want to canvass some of the other organisations, but it is nonsense to say that all women's organisations bar one support her point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> They are the two main matters raised by Senator Walters to which I wanted to reply. Most of her points were not worth referring to, anyway. I wonder about the question of mild, non-violent fetishes. That is undefined and I have not had the opportunity to check out what is meant by that change in the guidelines. It could have a very wide range of interpretations. I do not think it has been tested yet and it is not a particularly relevant point to raise. </PARA>
<PARA> In general, I support everything that Senator Jenkins has said. For the sake of my Victorian colleagues I wish to refer to the Age article. Like Senator Jenkins, when I read the article this morning I was appalled at the ignorance displayed in it. I spent some time on the telephone talking to the secretariat of the social development committee in Melbourne, and also to the chair of that committee. Subsequently, I was able to get a copy of part of that report faxed up to me. In fact, the Age article is extremely misleading. The headlines do not match anything in the report. Much of what is in the Age report has been taken totally out of context, obviously for reasons of sensationalism. As a usual supporter of the Age, I am extremely disappointed in the way that that story was handled. </PARA>
<PARA> The report contains something like 26 recommendations. Not one of them refers at all to X-rated videos. The main reference in the report to X-rated videos and so on, which was the last item in the Age report, concerns a provision in the Victorian law which is interpreted as requiring the police physically to send any video which it seizes because it is believed to have been hired in contravention of Victorian law to the Chief Censor for certification of classification. Clearly, that obstructs the operation of the law because that could take up to six weeks and the same Victorian law requires charges to be laid after a period of 14 days. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had pointed out to me the relevant sections of that report which in any way back up the sort of claims that appear to be made in the Age about X-rated videos. The clear misunderstanding that is portrayed there, and was portrayed on Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio this morning-and, to the credit of Pru Goward, was later corrected-is about the confusion which is compounded very often by those in the Opposition about what X-rated videos really are. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, could I just deal very briefly with three matters? The whole question of the Victorian Age report is a reflection on the person who wrote the article, not on anyone else. I tried to get the actual report but I could not get it today; so I do not know what was contained in it and whether it did or did not refer to X-rated videos. I assume that it did not and that the media report incorrectly titled it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But that is completely beside the point. Let us deal with what this material does contain. The amendments by Senator Jenkins are to gut the Regulation of Video Material Bill 1988 in respect of the intention of Senator Walters in moving the legislation. The intention is to gut the Bill so as to enable the continued availability of material which is officially described as hard core pornography. That is what Senator Jenkins is saying. I do not know about the other Democrats. The material is officially described in the explanatory memorandum as hard core pornography. The decision by Senator Jenkins to amend Senator Walters's Bill will have the effect of entrenching hard core pornography in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no need for me to go over the type of material that is contained in X-rated videos. It is unfair for Senator Jenkins to say that by a narrow majority the Joint Select Committee on Video Material decided on non-violent erotica, implying that the majority wanted the current X-rated material to go into a new category of NVE. That was not so. The majority of the Committee expressed its view to the contrary. The majority response to that NVE proposal, on page 302 of the Committee report, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Recommendation II proposes that a new NVE category will contain that material as defined in the current classification of X. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. We, the majority of the Committee, strongly oppose that proposition. It would entrench X-rated pornography (described officially as `hard core pornography'-see paragraph 3.40) in the community under the guise of the misleading title of NVE. </PARA>
<PARA>I also want to say-and I beg the Committee to accept this-that last time we were on our feet there was a reference to the fact that the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA) had misunderstood what was in the material. The SDA has sent us three letters, each distinguishing X-rated videos as being physically non-violent. It is important to place that on record. That organisation knows what is contained in the video materials. The national council of that organisation expressed strong concern about the availability of pornographic video material and the employment opportunities and working conditions of that union's female members. In part, the Association indicated:</PARA>
<PARA>We believe that pornography which portrays women as having an insatiable sexual appetite and/or as the willing victim of sexual domination and humiliation is more dangerous to the status, rights and safety of women than material which shows women as non-consenting victims, since such material creates and perpetuates the myth that women generally are highly promiscuous and available, that they enjoy domination by men . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Those people knew what they were talking about. I have seen material in the X-rated category which deals with employment on the basis of the sexual characteristics of the females concerned. Is that what Senator Jenkins wants? Does she want the perpetuation of that sort of material in the X-rated category? Is she suggesting that on the one hand we condemn, quite justifiably, sexual harassment at work while on the other hand we permit this type of material to go through the Film Censorship Board without any guidelines being applied by the Film Censorship Board except that nobody punches somebody else or shoots somebody else. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Committee, when we are talking about censorship and these other issues, of an observation that was made by Dr Zubrzycki, the Emeritus Professor of Sociology at the Australian National University. He said that pornography functions quite similarly to anti-Semitic or racist propaganda in that it distorts the image of a group or class of people by depicting them as objects for exploitation. This is precisely what pornographic material does to women. I challenge anybody to get up and say that the majority of this material does not do that. The majority of this material has as its intent the purpose of making women objects of sexual pleasure for men and is intended to be a turn-on for men. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, but it is such a difficult and subjective area. The reason that I rise briefly is that once again Senator Harradine talked about the classification of non-violent erotica (NVE) that was determined by the Joint Select Committee on Video Material. I rise to make the point again-as I did in the previous major debate on this subject-that that majority recommendation on NVE and the qualification that was then put on it by Mr Jull, who provided that majority, simply indicates the artificiality of a great deal of what has been said in this debate. The distinction was, as Senator Harradine will recall, that Mr Jull was in that same middle ground. He is not a person who supports that particular material. He would not walk across the street to watch it himself. But, because of his true liberal ideals-and, from my slight knowledge of Mr Jull, I do credit him with those sentiments-he is not a person who wants to impose more censorship and more government regulation on a free democratic people than is absolutely necessary.

<PARA> I have a very large collection of videos. I bring them down with me from Darwin every now and again in the Budget sessions of the Senate, and we watch them in the annexe.

If I had my choice and I were to impose my views on the world, that is the sort of movie I would want people to watch-no sex, no drugs, no rock and roll, no violence and no plots, actually. But there would be great music, great dancing, and very corny sets-wonderful stuff. I yearn for the days when that was the accepted norm-when that was what people liked to watch. That is what people like me still love to watch. I would like, if I could, to pass a law in 1989 saying that that is the sort of stuff that everybody should watch and, in fact, that that is all they can watch. </PARA>

I would like, in a free society, to be able to make that choice myself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been a great deal of talk about the alleged effects of this material in terms of inciting the level of crime and violence that exists in the world today. The people who tell us this say with a straight face that crime and violence has never existed to such an extent in the world before. I must say that they have an extraordinarily warped view of history, even recent history. How could anyone who was even mildly familiar with the history of Australia say that we have only recently become a violent society? What about the First Fleeters and the conditions under which they lived in the mother country? What about the laws that were applied to them and the things that could be done and were done to them by the state as a result of laws passed by members of parliament? It could be cogently and, I think, effectively argued on many fronts that in 1989 we have, to a very great degree, become a far more civilised society than that which existed 50, 100 or 200 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The trouble with people generally is, whether or not one believes in the Christian concept of original sin, that we are pretty violent animals. We do violent things to each other, to other animals of this planet and to the environment which we inhabit. In fact, I think it is fair to say that the violence we have done to our own environment in the last hundred years can be very graphically and effectively described by a crude Australian expression which I cannot use, because it is unparliamentary-but we are in fact fouling our own nest. That indeed is a very profound form of violence. But in terms of the kind of violence that Senator Harradine was talking about-violence to women and to each other-one could argue that, if anything, at least in an organised sense, we are becoming a more civilised society. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me deal with the things that corrupt. This is obviously a major concern for everybody, particularly for parents. I am not suggesting that these feelings are confined to parents, but they are felt by parents, particularly parents of young children. The greatest corrupting influence on young people in this world today is, and always has been, money. As I said before in a previous debate, we are not really taking a rational approach; there is no question about that. If one talks to the people who deal with the most horrible forms of sexual exploitation, the pederasts-the people who organise themselves on an international basis into clubs; they exist in Australia, as everyone knows, and elsewhere in the world, and consist in the main of extremely wealthy and well placed people in the community-one finds that money, and the exploitation of economically deprived people by using money, is still the greatest form of corruption of youth. If honourable senators do not believe that, they should just go the Philippines. But they need not go to the Philippines; they need go only to Sydney or Melbourne. The rational way to counter that is not to ban $50 bills; that simply will not work. </PARA>
<PARA> The Age story has been mentioned again today. The whole point of the Age story is that the material that was described is currently, under present laws, illegal material. We should remember that before we dealt with Senator Walters's legislation, the kind of material that was being hawked around Victoria is currently banned and illegal and people can be prosecuted for trafficking in it. It has been illegal since 1984. That does not stop the traffic. No parliament can do that. As I also said in a previous debate, if the welfare of my children in terms of their moral, spiritual and physical well-being is dependent on laws passed in this Parliament, God help them. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am saying-and I am saying it with some feeling-is that I am personally in a very difficult position on this debate, as are many other people. But, finally, I have come down on the side of drawing a line, as everyone else does. I suppose it is fair to say that the only difference really between Senator Walters's position and mine is that I have drawn the line on one particular part of the map and she has drawn it on another. I guess that is really the only difference between us. But I have, I guess, a predisposed bias to counter and to oppose government regulation on things that we can think, see, read, hear and speak. It takes a lot of persuasion and an enormous amount of evidence to persuade me that I should change my view on that, despite what I think personally. </PARA>
<PARA> An obvious example is the recent movie The Last Temptation of Christ. I have certain beliefs and principles to which I adhere in my own life. I profoundly disagree with a great deal of what was portrayed in that film-and I saw it. But I would really hate to live in a society which successfully passed laws saying that I was not allowed to see it. The fact is-and Senator Harradine cannot deny it-that the people in this place this afternoon, like Senator Walters, the sponsor of this Bill, who are telling us that we cannot see this material and that we should ban it, are the same people who wanted to see that film banned and prevented from being displayed at all in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The Joint Select Committee on Video Material watched an X-rated movie along with a lot of other rubbish, called Deep Throat Two, which was produced by the adult video industry in the United States as a lobbying tool. I must say that, when the pornography was taken away from that movie, the point it made was a very valid one. It featured an American Senate committee deliberating on the question of X-rated movies. The point made throughout the movie, in which American politicians were thundering from the pulpit, `We do not think that people should see this material because it corrupts them', is perfectly true. The question was always asked, `Your committee has sat through dozens of these things. Are you now corrupted as a result?'. The answer from the politician is always `No, I am immune from that personally, but it is the ordinary people out there in the streets who will be corrupted'. Politicians of course, are a special breed who are not corrupted! There are probably as many corrupt politicians around the place as there are in the community at large. By and large, politicians are ordinary people. Some of them are very ordinary people-by and large it is ridiculous for us to take the stand that we are in some way immune from this material ourselves but that everyone else out there should be prohibited from watching it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I personally draw the line on this issue in terms of the protection of young people. I come down quite happily with banning beastiality, child pornography and violence. They have all been banned and prohibited since 1984. But adult people have to have the right in the privacy of their own homes to watch what they want within those broad limits, provided that the youth of this country is protected to the maximum degree that that is possible to do so by passing laws. Despite my own personal views on the question of this material-of course, there is a very large market for it among the good burghers of the Australian Capital Territory-consistent with the recommendations of the Meese report brought down in the United States, I am perfectly happy for the elected government of the Australian Capital Territory to make the decision whether the electors to whom it is responsible can watch it or not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only thing that I agree with in what Senator Collins has just said is that this debate is all about where one draws the line and, I might say, in what circumstances one draws the line. Apparently Senator Collins is opposed to X-rated material-that is, material which depicts explicit sexual acts-being permitted for public viewing in cinemas, but is prepared to allow private viewing of such material, on the ground that it may be harmful to his and other children. That is one of the main concerns of those who draw the line at a different place from where Senator Collins draws it. In being available in private homes, this material easily gets out of control and falls into the hands of those whom Senator Collins, on his own admission, wants to protect and in respect of whom he thinks censorship is justified.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again, I will not speak for Senator Zakharov. It is certainly not about whether we should have censorship. The vast majority of us agree that there has to be some censorship, which does change from time to time because of community standards. The question is where and on what basis one justifies censorship occurring. This is a very difficult question for people such as ourselves to decide in what is an emotive and politically charged atmosphere. In order to assist us to make the decision as to where the line should be drawn, the Senate referred this matter to a committee to see whether it was possible to get some guidance and help from experts, with scientific knowledge and experience of psychology in particular. It seems to me that the only justification for censorship in this area is whether viewing material of this kind-or hearing it-is or could be, on any reasonable grounds, harmful to other people. That is the test, and I would think that that is the test that Senator Collins adopted in the remarks that he has just made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of going to a committee and getting an in-depth study and an expert opinion was to get some guidance on what sort of material is or may be harmful in certain circumstances. The scientific evidence that was received by the Joint Select Committee on Video Material may have differed, and certainly members of the Committee differed in their views of it, but authoritative and convincing scientific evidence was put before the Committee which pointed to the fact that, regardless of whether there is any violence or coercion in this type of material-namely, explicit depictions of sexual acts-the viewing of such material in some circumstances by some individuals could produce conduct which was harmful not only to those people but also to others. I think that what we should mostly be concerned about is not so much the effect of this material on the viewer but the behaviour which may result in certain circumstances from watching this material. </PARA>
<PARA> I have quoted the evidence from Professor Sheehan, a professor of psychology at Queensland University, a leading Australian psychologist who has been a member of the Films Board of Review for some years. He must be taken as an expert who can guide people such as us in coming to these very difficult decisions. I do not propose to read the evidence. I quoted some of it in my speech in the second reading debate. It is quite clear from Professor Sheehan's evidence that there is a real possibility of harmful effects occurring as a result of this material being available. Senator Walters's Regulation of Video Material Bill is simply designed to return the situation to what it was, before changes were made to the censorship laws a few years ago by the present Government. For the first time it allowed an X-rated classification for videos not for public viewing for people over 18 years of age. I find that a most extraordinary distinction for people to be drawing, as I have already indicated. For instance, does Senator Jenkins believe that it is all right to have this material in the home but it is not all right to allow people over the age of 18 years to go into a public cinema and view it? What is the difference? It is totally illogical. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe there is sufficient evidence for us, through this legislation, to change the situation brought about by fairly recent legislation which resulted in this particular category for application to videos only. That is the purpose of this legislation. If Senator Jenkins's amendment is carried, the whole purpose of this Bill will be completely destroyed and it will become a totally pointless exercise. </PARA>

Under those circumstances I think those of us who would support this amendment-I would be amongst them-believe that there is some debate as to where one draws the line, as both Senator Hill and Senator Collins have quite correctly pointed out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the second reading stage I spoke at length on the analogy with the drug trade. I think it is appropriate today to raise that issue again, because the report to which I was referring was introduced into this chamber by Senator Alston this afternoon. The report of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority mentioned a number of issues with regard to the problem of drugs in Australia. In that circumstance it is probably relatively clear, unlike in this circumstance, that an enormous amount of damage is being done to the community. But what is not clear is the correct public policy stance to take with regard to that. Senator Walters's response to my comments on that were again of a simplistic kind: did I want this, that or something else. I do not intend getting into a slanging match with Senator Walters if she wants to carry on that type of hysterical debate. The debate was not about who could be more holier than thou but what in fact is the correct public policy to deal with a serious issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I was explaining that in the drug situation there are two legs-the supply and the demand. We spend most of our time trying to interdict the supply of drugs but very little both in time and resources in trying to do anything about demand. In this area Senator Walters is again taking on the supply exercise. The supply is there because there is a demand. I would prefer us to spend the short time that we have in this place on trying to look at why our society is demanding these types of things, including drugs. Hence, in that report on drugs, I but not everyone on the Committee recommended banning the advertising of tobacco and alcohol. I remind Senator Walters-she should have a look at that report-that we could not get everybody on the Committee to sign that, and they put in a minority report. The reason I signed that recommendation to ban the advertising of tobacco and alcohol was that last year tobacco killed 17,000 people in this country. I think the very least we can do is ban the advertising of that lethal drug, but we could not even get the agreement of everybody on the Committee for that single proposition. I am not casting any aspersions on those people. They argued their case in their minority report. However, I am saying that people with goodwill, who are trying to approach serious issues, will differ on what might be the correct public stance to take on how to deal with them. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought Senator Collins was spot on in his contribution, because he was talking about the type of thing I want to talk about; that is, what is the reason for people wanting these types of materials? Where should we be directing our attention if we feel that is wrong? We will be having other debates in this place, including presumably about abortion, and I am sure the same type of argument will occur. They are not easy ones to deal with. We may all agree that there is something we do not like. In fact I took Senator Collins's point that he does not agree with these videos. We do not have them in my home. I do not permit my children to watch even most of the R-rated movies. I do not permit them to attend many of the M-rated movies. I may be old-fashioned and very hard, but there is a rating provided for the guidance of the community that I take seriously, as does my wife, and our children respect that. In fact we do that even with regard to television at home. Many people in the community do the same thing. But I am not saying that such movies should be banned. They are there, and if other people wish to view them, that is their prerogative. If they wish to send their children along, I do not like that idea but that is their choice. As time goes on my children will view more of those things. We will discuss them and I hope, if our family remains the way it is and we can still talk to one another, their ideas will develop as they grow older. I am not holding that up as though I am better than anybody else, but that is what we do in my family. I do not want to go around dictating what other people should do in their families or how they should deal with these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I have often said that I am not particularly interested in sex education being taught in schools. I am quite happy-and I have done this from the earliest days of my children-to conduct sex education lessons at home, for my children, as is my wife. But I am also a realist, having been in education all my life, and I know that is not something that is done by everybody in the community. Hence, I have supported sex education in schools, to provide for those children who do not have the opportunity to get that knowledge and understanding at home to get it elsewhere so that they are then able, hopefully, to react responsibly on the basis of knowledge. I find it very odd that time and time again people attack a variety of issues, and I say, `In that case, will you stand shoulder to shoulder with me? I am trying to get sex education into Queensland schools'. Then they say, `No way'. There ought to be a consistency of approach. I think a consistency of approach in terms of a liberal stance-Senator Walters is in a party which calls itself liberal-means that one needs an overwhelming reason before imposing a state directive with regard to any personal activity. We have mentioned some of those and I agree there are quite a number. Senator Walters mentioned some of them, for example, child pornography. Not one person in this place has disagreed on that. There are a whole host of others, but obviously Senator Walters would not want tomorrow's edition of the Sydney Morning Herald to be banned. She too draws the line somewhere. She is drawing it on one side on this issue and other people are drawing it on the other. </PARA>
<PARA> On this particular issue I think it is sensible and reasonable to do two things. The first is to allow adults to make up their own minds and to have a series of controls, which hopefully will restrict this material to adults; and secondly, with regard to the Australian Capital Territory-because a lot of this revolves around that issue-if the elected representatives of the ACT wish to prevent the sale of this material in the ACT, then they should have the power to do so. In other States the elected representatives have made that choice. Presumably, the elected representatives in the Australian Capital Territory will follow that. That will solve Senator Walters's problem. It seems to me that at the moment, due to the coming together of the Legislative Assembly in the Australian Capital Territory, and our Constitution which allows free trade between the States other States can receive the material by mail. If the Australian Capital Territory follows the States it will prevent that activity. On a number of occasions this chamber has expressed its view with regard to the general issue. I do not think that will change. However, the circumstances in Australia may very well change. That will depend upon the elected representatives in the Australian Capital Territory, not upon us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Collins told us about our violent history and how violent Australia has always been. He believes that we are becoming less violent as time goes on. I will give a few figures. They are not my figures; they are from the Institute of Criminology. In the past 10 years the incidence of serious assault has increased by 228 per cent. Does Senator Collins still maintain that we are becoming less violent? I repeat: In the past 10 years the incidence of serious assault has increased by 228 per cent. The incidence of rape has increased by nearly 140 per cent. In my speech in the second reading debate I said that we could not ignore these figures nor try to make excuses, as the Australian Labor Party has, by attempting to find fault with them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the causes we were given for the increase is the video viewing of excessive violence. A very well-respected professor at Queensland University, Professor Sheehan, said that continued viewing of X-rated videos by people who have an aggressive nature makes them more aggressive. That is the sort of evidence that our Committee heard. The majority of members accepted it. Senator Collins tried to tell us today that we were becoming a less violent society when all the evidence by the criminologists of Australia has told us that serious assault has increased by 228 per cent in the past 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Collins also said that he would not be told by people like me what he could see. He did not say that his Government did not allow people to view X-rated videos in cinemas. People such as Senator Collins do not allow people to view these things in the cinemas. At least the cinemas have some control over the age of the person going in to view films. There is no control in homes. Parents may well think they have their videos under lock and key but they do not. We received a tremendous amount of evidence indicating that children viewed this material. Senator Macklin said that we had to have overwhelming reasons to stop adults doing what they liked. He did not mention bestiality. What overwhelming reason does he have to stop adults viewing bestiality? I guess we will have to wait until next week when the debate will be continued.

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides an additional weapon against potential corruption in the Australian Federal Police, increases the functions of the Australian Federal Police and improves the administration of the Australian Federal Police in a number of significant respects. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes the inclusion of a new Part VA in the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 which provides for existing and former members of the Australian Federal Police to lose certain superannuation rights and benefits if convicted of an offence involving corruption and sentenced to life imprisonment or a term of imprisonment longer than 12 months or, if a member is found guilty of a relevant disciplinary offence and dismissed from the Australian Federal Police, as a penalty for that offence. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments provide that all contributions payable by the Commonwealth under a superannuation scheme in relation to a relevant member or former member of the Australian Federal Police shall cease, or cease to be payable, when the appropriate court makes a superannuation order. In such cases, the Commonwealth is not liable to pay any employer contributions or benefits under the scheme in respect of that person. The amendments entitle a member or former member of the Australian Federal Police to payment only of a sum equal to the employee contributions plus the accrued interest on those contributions. Similar provisions apply where a member is found guilty of a relevant disciplinary offence and dismissed from the Australian Federal Police for that offence. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Federal Police (Discipline) Regulations do not apply to the Commissioner or the Deputy Commissioners. Amendments to section 17 will enable the Governor-General to determine terms and conditions about superannuation in relation to the Commissioner or Deputy Commissioners having a comparable effect to proposed subsection 49 (2) and applying where that person's appointment is terminated because of misbehaviour involving:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) corruption;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) an abuse of office; or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the perversion of the course of justice, or an attempt to pervert the course of justice. </PARA>
<PARA> The loss of superannuation rights and benefits are penalties for dishonest service and breach of obligation to the Crown. They are not and should not be seen as penalties for committing certain criminal offences. Part VA is not retrospective in operation. Division 2 only applies to existing or former members of the Australian Federal Police convicted after the commencing day for Part VA while Division 3 will only apply to members found guilty of relevant disciplinary offences and dismissed from the Australian Federal Police as a penalty for that offence after the commencement day. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is adamant that it will not fund superannuation benefits of any kind for corrupt members of the AFP. This should be a major financial disincentive to any member of the Australian Federal Police who may be thinking of becoming involved in any corrupt activity now or in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> While this Bill only applies to existing and former members of the Australian Federal Police it is this Government's intention to introduce similar legislation in the Budget Sittings of the Parliament which applies to officers of the Australian Public Service, other government employees and persons holding statutory offices. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also provides for the repeal of the cumbersome redeployment and retirement provisions currently in the Australian Federal Police Act and the inclusion of streamlined provisions. The proposed redeployment and retirement provisions will enhance the efficient administration of the Australian Federal Police to the mutual benefit of the community and members of the Australian Federal Police alike. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also gives effect to the Government's decision, in light of the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee, that a national witness protection program be established. It is to be administered by the Australian Federal Police on a cost recovery basis. Section 8 of the Australian Federal Police Act is being amended to enable the Commissioner to enter into arrangements with a Commissioner of a State or Territory police force, the Chairman of the National Crime Authority, and a prescribed authority of the Commonwealth, State or Territory-other than the Australian Capital Territory-to facilitate the provision of appropriate services. The Australian Federal Police Act as currently drafted allows the Australian Federal Police to provide protection for witnesses in relation to Commonwealth and Australian Capital Territory offences. </PARA>
<PARA> The national witness protection program will not be fully operational until a substantial number of Commonwealth, State and Territory laws are amended to facilitate the effective operation of the program. It is an important and necessary tool in the fight against organised crime in Australia, and the Government is determined to ensure its early implementation. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also contains amendments to the Australian Federal Police of a minor policy nature relating to the appointment of fixed-term senior executive officers, superannuation for fixed-term senior executive officers, prescribing fees for certain police services, the making of regulations for the advancement or accelerated advancement of a member within a rank and for arrangements between the Minister and the Administrator of an External Territory for the provision of police services in relation to that Territory.

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the continuation of a grant to the Northern Territory to subsidise its electricity operations in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government has subsidised the Territory's electricity operations since self-government. The arrangements that commenced in 1985-86 provided for an annual indexed payment of $40m until 1988-89. This amount has applied with the exception of 1986-87 when a lower amount was paid because of reduced oil prices and budgetary considerations. The amount that was provided for 1988-89 was $50.9m. </PARA>
<PARA> It was envisaged when the arrangements were put in place in 1985-86, that electricity assistance to the Northern Territory would terminate after this financial year. Accordingly, there was no provision made for such assistance in the Forward Estimates. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is now evident that the complete cessation of electricity assistance in 1989-90 would place an unreasonable strain on the finances of the Northern Territory and its Power and Water Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> The effects of this on the day-to-day finances of Territory households through significant rises in the cost of electricity would also have been unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA> This point was raised with my colleague, the Treasurer, by those representing the Northern Territory both here and in another place. The Treasurer agreed that Territorians should be shielded from massive electricity price rises. </PARA>
<PARA> His response to this issue is a fine example of how vigorous representations by our Government colleagues from the Northern Territory have won for the people of the Northern Territory protection from what would otherwise have been a major attack on their standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided therefore to continue assistance for electricity generation and distribution beyond 1988-89. In respect of 1989-90, a grant of $40m is to be provided. This Bill provides appropriation for that amount. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to help the Territory adjust to the lower level of assistance, it so also intended that the $40m for 1989-90 be paid before the end of 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has agreed with the Territory that is the years following 1989-90, the level of assistance will be fully phased out. </PARA>
<PARA> It is intended that for 1990-91, the grant will be reduced to $30m to $20m in 1991-92, and $10m in 1992-93. The grant will be discontinued in 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's offer of assistance to the Northern Territory provides for the amount of grants for 1990-91 to 1992-93 to be reviewed in the event that more favourable circumstances arise. Grants for those years will be provided for under the normal appropriation Bills in the relevant years. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to these payments, the Government has decided to waive, from 1 July 1989, the Northern Territory's electricity debt to the Commonwealth with a net present value of $31.9m. This will relieve the Territory of scheduled repayments of principal and payments of interest to a cash value of $6.4m for each of the next nine years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Northern Territory will also be able to continue to submit requests to the Treasurer for special additions to its global borrowing limits to fund the remaining electricity operating deficits of the Power and Water Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> The assistance which has been agreed with the Northern Territory for its electricity operations is an important part of the Commonwealth's financial assistance to the Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The arrangements have been designed to ensure that the adjustments to the Territory's finances will not be unmanageable in any one year. Without the proposed assistance, the burden of restraint which the Northern Territory would be expected to bear would be far greater than the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the Commonwealth is clearly indicating that assistance in respect of the Territory's electricity operations cannot continue indefinitely: for that reason, the Commonwealth has insisted in its negotiations with the Northern Territory that the assistance be phased out. I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not rise to interrupt the flow of discussion in the chamber, but I want to honour an undertaking given earlier today by Senator Gareth Evans who was asked a question by Senator Hill concerning the funding of the national functions-in particular, the education functions-of the National Library of Australia, the Australian National Gallery and the National Botanic Gardens. I am in a position to answer that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth is not attempting to avoid its responsibilities in these areas and will continue to meet the costs of its national functions. So far as the National Gallery and the National Library are concerned, the Commonwealth will continue to meet the costs of both authorities and their ongoing programs, including their education programs. So far as the Botanic Gardens is concerned, the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories is continuing to provide appropriate resource for the education function of the Botanic Gardens as a national institution. That is the answer to the question Senator Hill asked earlier today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for that answer which I think clarifies what certainly has been in doubt to date in relation to the particular functions that I mentioned. I ask the Minister whether he would be prepared to take it one step further for the benefit of the Australian Capital Territory people and comment on the proposal in the paper, of which he would be aware, produced by the Department of Finance which argues that where there is a national function carried out in the ACT, and it is deemed that the ACT people as a whole get an additional benefit; because they are resident here all the time, they should pay something in addition to what the rest of the people of the Commonwealth pay. We on this side of the chamber have said that that would be an unjust situation. Visitors to the ACT who may utilise national functions do not expect to pay more because they happen to be here on a temporary basis. I, therefore, invite the Minister to settle once and for all the fact that the Commonwealth, under its new arrangements with the new self-governing Territory, will pick up the total tab for national functions and will not see indirectly to call upon the ACT people to pay an extra share of the benefit simply because they are resident within the Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>

Because it is canvassed by that discussion paper, it would be inappropriate for me to give the assurance or undertaking that he so eloquently invites me to do, until such time as the Department has had a chance to deal with the responses to the discussion paper and form an opinion based on them. I thank him for his interest in the subject, but I do not think it is appropriate for me to respond in the way in which he has invited me to do at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was thinking for a moment that this would be a very constructive and helpful evening and that the concerns of the Australian Capital Territory people would be put to rest. But, unfortunately, although the Minister has clarified the position with regard to specific services provided by the National Library, the National Gallery and the National Botanic Gardens, such other national public bodies within the ACT will be left in doubt. That is regrettable because there was an opportunity tonight for the Minister to clarify the position. I take into account that the paper put out by the Department of Finance is not new; it was reported in the press on 3 April this year, so it has been around for some time. I thought there might be an opportunity tonight to settle the matter once and for all. But, if the Government is not prepared to do so, the concern that obviously will be expressed in the future by the people of the ACT must rest at that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next matter I wish to raise is also a matter of great disappointment to the people of the ACT. The Government is reneging on its undertakings to guarantee funding for the ACT in real terms, at the same level, for the first two years following self-government. As the Minister will be aware, that promise was given by Mr Holding in his second reading speech to the self-government Bill in the other place. It was reiterated by Senator Richardson in this place when giving his second reading speech to the self-government Bill. It was restated time and again, as I am sure Senator Reid will confirm, during the local election campaign. Federal spokesmen restated that a guarantee similar to the sort of guarantee in relation to the Northern Territory would be given. If the Minister looked at the Estimates Committee debate on 14 April he would see that the public servants talked about the guaranteed funding for that period. There was no question that that would be other than honoured. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week the Government reneged and, under pressure, entered into some weird arrangement. It said that it was possible that the Australian Capital Territory could get the difference between what it was promised and the grant that was given at the Premiers Conference last week if it could prove a special case. The important thing that arises from this is if the Government is prepared to break its promises as easily as that and as quickly following the making of those promises, what does it mean in relation to the various other undertakings that the Commonwealth has given to the Australian Capital Territory upon self-government-undertakings which were accepted in good faith and which became a basis not only for honourable senators on this side of the chamber to enter into long and difficult negotiations but also negotiations that led us, at least in part, to support the legislative package? I bring to the Minister's attention the fact that the people of the Australian Capital Territory feel particularly let down by this breach of promise and would like to hear from him tonight as to how he regards the balance of the promises relating to the acceptance of the Commonwealth's obligations for funding under the self-government package. Do they still stand?</PARA>

He is someone who I understand is consulted from time to time by his side as to the proceedings and proper dealings in this Parliament. He knows that we have just dealt with the departments covered by Senate Estimates Committee C and that Treasury matters are dealt with by that Estimates Committee, not in this Estimates Committee. He also knows that what he has put to me is indeed a Treasury matter, not a matter for the department that is before the Senate at this stage. If this be another of his invitations, I am afraid it is an invitation I must decline, although in declining with whatever grace I can muster in this debate, I might add for the record that the use of the word `renege' to imply that we have done less than honour our obligations is something I do not accept on behalf of the Government. That is not the case with this Government; it might have been the case with the government the honourable senator was part of.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the Minister persists with the attitude that we have seen displayed tonight we will make it a promise. It seems to us that the people of the ACT, at the very least, can hear from this Minister under this head under which the whole matter has been debated from the start of the self- government Bills through to the negotiation of the outstanding financial relationship-not through Treasury, not through the Department of Finance, but through this Department. The Minister would realise that if he read the Estimates. The people of the ACT have a right to know the Commonwealth's position on all the outstanding financial matters. The Government said that for 1988-89-the year in which this new self- governing body of the Australian Capital Territory came into being-it would honour its financial undertakings. It said that for the next two years it would maintain the finance in real terms. The officers of this Department-not the Department of Finance; the officers of this Department-have been busy calculating exactly what that means in dollars. They talk about it in these Estimates. The officers of this Department say to us that it is an extremely difficult task. Yet tonight the Minister tries to pass the buck to somebody else. Nevertheless, it is maintained that the Government will honour its undertaking to maintain finances for the Australian Capital Territory in real terms for two years. Following that, there is to be a transitional period when it will be phased out. What is the Government's current attitude to that? What calculations are being made that will end up putting the new self-governing Territory in the same financial relationship as the States of Australia vis-a-vis the Commonwealth? What is the Government's attitude now?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whether the Minister likes to acknowledge it or not-he is the first person in Australia I have heard deny that in fact the Government has reneged on its promise-implicitly the Government acknowledged that at the conference last week, because it then entered into these special side arrangements with Chief Minister Follett. Nevertheless, I guess this Minister has not kept up with that debate. But he does have a responsibility to the Senate tonight. He has been given the task of handling these appropriations and the people of the Australian Capital Territory want to know whether the reneging on this promise means that other promises that have been made about the continuing financial affairs of the Commonwealth in respect of the Territory will not be honoured. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an extraordinary display. Senator Hill ought to know better than this. As I see from the Hansard of Estimates Committee D, Senator Hill was present and engaged in an examination of Dr Madden, who appeared before that Committee on behalf of the Australian Capital Territory Treasury. Senator Hill knows what his answers to those questions were. I will remind him by quoting Dr Madden. On page 144 of the Hansard of Senate Estimates Committee D of 14 April, Dr Madden, in reply to a question by Senator Hill when pursuing this issue, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>That is a matter largely covered by the real terms guarantee. There are discussions going on at officer level to try to sort that out. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Hill asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Who are you referring to?</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Madden said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Capital Territory Treasury is negotiating that with the Commonwealth Treasury and the Department of Finance at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Hill was present at that Estimates Committee. He would know that the Australian Capital Territory officers appeared in their own right, under their own banner. They sought leave of the Estimates Committee to so appear and make those explanations. However, it is not an appropriate matter for the Department that is before us. That is the difference. If Senator Hill wished to pursue his line of questioning, then the appropriate thing to do in these circumstances would be to address the questions either to Treasury, to Finance or directly to the Australian Capital Territory Treasury officers who, by their own motion I again emphasise, appeared before this Committee. But the department that is answering here tonight is the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. It is not an appropriate dialogue for this Department to engage in because it is not responsible for the area that Senator Hill refers to. I must say that I am a little astonished because I thought Senator Hill, as an experienced senator, would have known all of that. </PARA>

Hopefully I will achieve the same goal through a different course of action. The first answer that I refer to-it is ambiguous and therefore this Department will no doubt be able to clarify the position-is the one relating to outstanding issues which still require resolution or clarification. The first answer that was given-that is, in regard to the financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the Australian Capital Territory Government-related to the transitional arrangements following the real terms guarantee period. I ask the Minister: what is meant by that somewhat ambiguous statement?</PARA></TALK.START>

I have answered Senator Hill on this matter, and I do not propose to engage in a discussion about something that I have said I am not here to answer for-and, in terms of this Department, rightly not here to answer for. If Senator Hill's curiosity is insatiable, there are other forms and norms in this Parliament through which he can pursue his interest. But it is not appropriate to the consideration of these estimates, and to try the journalistic tactic of asking the same question from a million different perspectives to see whether there is a variation in the answers is a bit silly. We are all equipped to deal with that type of thing. It is not appropriate here.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems to me that, if one is unable to obtain answers during an Estimates committee hearing itself because the officers regard the matter in question either as too complex or as one that requires further consideration, and if, as in this instance, they undertake to provide answers later, this is the legitimate occasion on which to seek clarification of such answers if they are unclear. Certainly, a bland statement such as `There is outstanding the transitional arrangements following the real terms guarantee period' requires clarification, particularly in the light of the fact that last week the real terms guarantee ceased to be a real terms guarantee because it was breached by this Government. But if the Minister cannot, or will not, clarify that ambiguous statement, there is not much more that we can do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will therefore move to the second area that this Department said was outstanding-the role of the Commonwealth Grants Commission during the guarantee and transitional periods. I ask the Minister what is meant by that. What is intended to be the role of the Commonwealth Grants Commission during the guarantee and transitional periods? Is the Commission going to have any role in relation to the real terms guarantee which was breached last week?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My particular interest was flagged in a speech I made yesterday concerning the Antarctic Division, particularly with respect to the letting of tenders for the Aurora Australis and the subsequent interference by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) in that process. The matter was discussed at length and questions were asked during Estimates hearings. My concern is that the cost of this whole exercise has been blown out of all proportion by interference from the Minister in what should have been a normal tendering process. As I said yesterday, half the trouble arose from the fact that the Minister was interested in getting the ship built at the Carrington Shipyard in New South Wales prior to a State election. The machinations of all that have resulted in what I believe and I am sure any thinking person would believe is a quite unacceptable situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to a media release issued by Senator Richardson in 1987, when he announced with great pleasure that the tender for the new Antarctic vessel, scheduled to be in service by 1989, had been let for $124m. The press release says:</PARA>
<PARA>`The shipyard will be chosen on a competitive commercial basis, and will be announced shortly'. </PARA>
<PARA>That sounds fine, but in practice, because of a subsidy from the New South Wales Government, the so-called competitive commercial basis disappeared. The tender from the Western Australian shipyard was omitted though it had the backing of a very good overseas firm. </PARA>
<PARA> To start the ball rolling, in the Estimates hearings I asked what the actual cost of the vessel was estimated to be at that time. I was told that the all-up cost would be $124m, as Senator Richardson said in his press release. When I asked what the actual up-front cost would be I was told that, because of the operation of cost-inflators, I think, it was impossible to give me an answer. I think it was said that the figure would not be known until the charter started because there were a number of variables. I ask the Minister: why, if these variables were used in arriving at the figure of $124m, can the same variables not be used to come up with an up-front figure so that the people of Australia might know what this vessel is actually going to cost?</PARA>
<PARA> Back on day one we were looking at something like $7m per annum for an overseas company and, in the case of an Australian company, about $10m per annum, which could have blown out to $12.5m per annum for a 10-year contract. The Secretary to the Department said that this was not a normal process. I think it was a very unusual process for the Minister to come out and announce the tender before the contract negotiations had been completed. In any business enterprise that would be highly irregular, to say the least. Because of those actions by the Minister this vessel has ended up costing Australia heaps more than it should have, yet no one has said too much about it. </PARA>
<PARA> By normal tendering processes it would be absolutely ridiculous, before the tender had been let and the final contract signed, to let the tenderer know that he was going to get the job. As a result of this, not only was the project delayed by up to six months, but also the people who were given the preferred tender were put in a position in which they screwed the Government to the floor for at least an extra $25m. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a shame that the Minister responsible is not in the chamber. I did give Senator Richardson notice that I was going to ask him some questions tonight. Obviously he has forgotten, just as he forgot about the fact that he had never been to the Antarctic Division. When I asked him whether he had been down to the Antarctic Division he said, `Yes'. About three or four weeks later he decided to go there. To me, these convenient lapses of memory just do not add up. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to know when the ship is scheduled to begin service. Will it be in October 1989, as the Minister promised? If not, how much extra will it cost the Division and the Antarctic program? This is most important to Australia. We hear all about the proposal for a world park in Antarctica. I believe that our Antarctic Division needs all the support it can get. It certainly did not need the interference of the Minister on this occasion. All it has done is delay what the Division is trying to do, and it has cost the taxpayers of Australia many millions of dollars. One conservative estimate that I have received-and it does not include any extra hiring of ships-is at least $60m. Can the Minister tell me when the new ship will begin service? Also, can he possibly tell me what the estimated all-up cost of the ship is at the moment?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think it is possible for the quality to improve. It can be matched, but I do not accept that it can be improved. Senator Calvert has asked a series of questions in what, may I say without any criticism of him, was a fairly long dissertation. I tried to keep track of all of the elements of his questions and I will now attempt to answer those that I can pick out of his dissertation. Let me say first, so that I do not have to dwell on it in dealing with each point he made, that he made quite a number of political references. He cast a slur on the reputation of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, concerning Antarctica and the answers that he gave in this place. The answers he gave are the answers that he gave at that time and they answered the issue and disposed of it. Senator Calvert may wish to continue making it a political point, but I refute and reject it. For the benefit of tonight's proceedings, I do not wish to contest it beyond making a simple rejection of it. We had a lot of useful business to transact rather than descend into a political point scoring activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, let me go to some of the issues the honourable senator raised. The first was a direct assertion that the Minister somehow insinuated himself into the tender process and had some influence on the outcome. That is a very serious allegation. It is not an allegation that we accept. The Minister did not interfere in any part of the tender process. I think the honourable senator should be very careful about making such an assertion without checking exactly what happened and how strongly based his evidence is because, as I say, it is not true. </PARA>
<PARA> The next matter deals with the charter of this vessel for a 10-year period. The basic price for charter was $10.8m per season. It varies because of currency fluctuations. As we all know, there have been some currency fluctuations. The present price in Australian dollars is $10.7m and, according to the terms of the contract, that is bedded down as the firm seasonal price. It is now impervious to any further downward pressure on the currency. I was asked whether I can give an all up price for future charter, given what the inflators might be and so on. The basic price is $10.7m and the final price, as adjusted by inflators, will be settled over the whole period when the inflators determine the price over the whole of that period. That answer may not be the one that the honourable senator sought but it is the one that can be given. There is the question of further adjustments according to the inflators. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Calvert asked a series of other questions, including when this vessel will commence service. It is now estimated that it will commence somewhere between 15 December this year and 15 January next year. It could be delayed a little, I should caution. That is the best estimate of commencement that I can give. I am advised that the Department is taking action to provide an interim vessel at a lower cost for the period that the new vessel is delayed, so there will be a stopgap measure to cater for any lapse in fulfilling the program. There may have been some other questions asked but, in terms of taking down all of them in the honourable senator's long dissertation, they are the only ones I have identified and thus answered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall try to keep any more questions for the Minister brief. In answer to my question about the commencement date for the new vessel, the Minister intimated that it could be between 15 December and 15 January, which is well into the season, and he indicated that another hire vessel would be used. Could he tell me the name of the vessel and how much it will cost?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said earlier, the delays were caused by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) interfering in the tendering process. The Secretary to the Department admitted that it was not a normal process for that Minister to announce the tender before contract negotiations have been completed. Senator Cook might think that I am being political but, to say the least, the whole exercise has been very extraordinary. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories admitted that he had attended meetings during the tender assessment and contract negotiation period and did not have a departmental officer with him. That would lead one to believe that there was something crook in Tallarook, to say the least. It is very irregular for lobbying meetings to be held during tender assessment. The Minister for Resources would have to agree with that. I am not saying that Senator Richardson did anything illegal, but in his haste to get this contract let to an Australian company in New South Wales he did not have a departmental officer with him so that he could protect not only himself but also his Department. Why not? Again, why did he announce the selected tenderer before negotiations had been completed? On top of that, I presume that it was he who authorised the Deputy Director of the Antarctic Division to sign a letter of intent to P and O before negotiations had been completed. I cannot be convinced that that is not irregular. Was not Senator Richardson advised by the Australian Government Solicitor about signing it?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators should make all their interjections now because they will be sadly disappointed when they hear the answer. It is a good question for this reason: the tender for it has not yet been finalised. I answered the honourable senator's earlier question by saying that it would be cheaper than the tender figure when the proper vessel comes on stream. I am able to answer that question in that way because tenders have been called, the tendering process has been exhausted and tenders have closed. But no adjudication has yet been made on which will be the successful tenderer. Looking at the body of tenders submitted, we are able to say directly and informatively to the chamber that it will be cheaper than the $10.7m plus the inflator effect that I referred to before. I cannot answer the question until the tender process is completed and I am sure that the honourable senator does not want me to interfere in the tender process to provide him with an answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second set of questions concerned Senator Richardson. I feel sorry for him in a way in that Opposition senators sometimes use him as a coconut shy for whatever allegations they want to trade.

One could accurately describe it as a conspiracy. It is under the bridge as far as I am concerned. Members of the Liberal Party have done it to themselves and they will have to live with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But let me not be distracted from answering Senator Calvert's question. That was the purpose for which I rose. I intend to complete my answer so that I can resume my seat. The tenders that Senator Calvert raised were departmental tenders. The Minister was not involved and did not interfere with them, nor did he direct that the work be allocated to a company in New South Wales. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a shame the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories is not here. Perhaps Senator Cook can tell me why he is not. Senator Richardson has admitted that he did attend meetings during the tender period. For Senator Cook to say that he did not is irregular, to say the least. Leaving that behind, I have to take the advice that Senator Cook has given to me-and I presume it is advice. I find it surprising that the Minister can go out and tell people who will get the tenders and all the rest of it. The tenders have closed yet he cannot tell us who will do the job in December or January. That is most unusual.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The contract price that we have agreed upon is $124m, plus a figure that we do not really know about because of all the variables and cost inflation factors. I am sure ministerial advisers, if they had the time and could be bothered, could work out this figure because they did that previously to arrive at the $124m. I do not accept the answer Senator Cook has given me. One thing we do know is that the price will be more than $124m. I would like, if it is possible-I do not want to know the name of the vessel-to get an estimate of what the delay for the coming season will cost the Antarctic Division and our program. That is a straightforward question without any political bias. When the tenders were called and this contract was let was it not a fact that a very experienced overseas bidder offered a vessel at half the cost of the selected offer?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first part of Senator Calvert's question was another effort to obtain an answer to a question that I have already answered. The essential element in providing him with a final cost involves a tender which is before the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories and not yet adjudicated. On that basis I think that he would have to accept that it would be unreasonable for me to start making estimates. I am advised, however, from the Department-and I can pass on the advice-that it ought not to cost the Department any more money and that it ought not to incur a further cost on the Antarctic program. That will be achieved because of an adjustment in the program for the Department so that it will not involve an extra cost. If the honourable senator wants the final answer to his question, I am absolutely certain that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) will oblige when all the information is known on which he can give that answer.</PARA></TALK.START>

Because the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) has either had a bad tea or is not very happy tonight, and is not in his normal humour, I will be quite happy for him to wait until later on when we discuss primary industries and energy for these questions to be answered. Part of the responsibility lies with the Department of Community Services and Health; part lies with the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories; part lies under the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation; part lies under the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. I do not mind under which department I ask all of these questions. It would be more appropriate if I asked them under one rather than spread them out, but I am happy to spread them out over the whole lot and go on until tomorrow.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. As he is aware, the Queensland Government last year made an announcement that it would build a special materials store at Redbank, a suburb of Ipswich, at a cost of half a million dollars. The site was proposed for the storage of radioisotopes and radioactive hospital wastes. As the Minister is probably already very much aware, this has caused a great deal of public concern, particularly among those people living in Ipswich, about the safety and public health implications for residents who live near the site. The relevant local government authority-the Ipswich City Council-has also been opposed to this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The site itself is well known. It is unsatisfactory for a variety of reasons, not the least of which are: the unstable nature of the area due to now disused coal mines; the possibilities of flooding; the seismological activity that occurs in this region; and, last but not least, its very close proximity to the Brisbane River, where there is already a problem with regard to toxic wastes coming from various other dumps. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation that I am concerned about is what the Commonwealth has done with regard to this proposal. It is fairly obvious that the Commonwealth has a role because it has a whole range of powers with regard to the dumping of nuclear waste in Australia, whether they come under the heading of the corporate powers or, for example, the range of conditions which are imposed on the isotopes which are sold from the Australian Atomic Energy Commission facility at Lucas Heights, or whether other conditions are imposed. I understand some of the products are used in hospitals and therefore produce these wastes. Some of those isotopes are imported already under certain conditions. So the Commonwealth Government is already involved in the usage of these isotopes. What is more, the Commonwealth Government is involved in the transportation of radioactive substances. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin-not the Minister for Resources, who is in this chamber-issued a press release which indicated that the Commonwealth is committed to developing a national repository for low level radioactive wastes. I believe that the Redbank proposal could very well be that national repository, without any announcement having been made. Be that as it may, I would like the Minister to respond to whether the Department, whose estimates we are currently discussing, has allocated any resources with regard to the announcement made last year. What communications has this Department had with the Department of Primary Industries and Energy with regard to development of that national repository? What, if any, has been the Commonwealth's involvement in regard to the proposed establishment of the dump at Redbank? Lastly, does the Government currently have in progress any studies within any of those relevant departments with regard to a national nuclear regulatory authority dealing with the end products? In other words, do we have a body which is concerned with the licensing, regulation, inspection and advice on the disposal of the nuclear waste which is generated from hospitals?</PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister well knows from his own portfolio, there are currently about 50 of these disposal units around the country, which is, of course, inadequate. Obviously, the Commonwealth is involved because of the power it derives from international treaties, its foreign affairs power, its corporations power or simply its import power and its control over Lucas Heights. Obviously it must have undertaken something. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Macklin for his question. Let me go to the first part of the question: has the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories had any allocations? The answer to that is no. Secondly, Senator Macklin asked me: What communications has the Department entered into with the Department of Primary Industries and Energy? I am not entirely sure about that, but I am sure someone can inform me in a minute. However, I can answer the other parts of Senator Macklin's question in terms of the Commonwealth involvement in Redbank, Commonwealth studies on a nuclear regulatory authority and the process of assessment we have engaged in to determine what powers we have in relation to the States and the storage of nuclear waste.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will take them all in omnibus fashion and answer this way: I understand that this particular nuclear waste is, as Senator Macklin rightly described it, low level waste-clothing and other materials which are adjudged by the authorities to be low level-and that it is material that is generated in the State of Queensland. This material is not brought into Queensland for the purpose of storage and as such the Commonwealth would not be clothed with special powers to regulate it. The Commonwealth, however, is not happy about the unilateral decision of the Queensland Government to relocate its repository at Redbank, and we have expressed that dissatisfaction. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth is, and has been, engaged in a study with States and the Northern Territory to see whether we can properly establish and be satisfied with a national radioactive waste repository so that many of the things to which Senator Macklin referred in his question are properly addressed and answered. The Government of the Northern Territory has expressed a particular interest in hosting the site for such a repository. That Government has contacted the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) to undertake a feasibility study. I understand that that study by ANSTO has been completed and is under consideration by the Northern Territory Government at present. The Commonwealth has contributed the sum of $100,000 to the completion of that study and, obviously, once the consideration of the outcome of that study has been completed, we will be in a position to announce what our intentions are. Indeed, the Northern Territory Government may be in a position to make such an announcement first. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to the exercise of constitutional powers-Senator Macklin referred to a few heads of powers, particularly the corporations power in the Constitution-the advice I have before me at the moment on which I can base an answer is that the materials that are being stored at Redbank are generated in the State of Queensland and there appears to us to be no appropriate head of power under which we can regulate the handling of those materials in Queensland. However, we do want to encourage the Queensland Government to join the community of other States and the Northern Territory in supporting a national repository. We think that is sensible and rational; it is something which the people of Australia ought to support. We deplore the unilateral action of the Queensland Government on this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for his comprehensive answer. I will make just one point with regard to the powers: is it not the case that the radioisotopes which are used in hospitals are either imported or generated at Lucas Heights? In both of those situations there are already in place a series of requirements about end use. In other words, it would be reasonable for the waste generated by the use of those materials also to be regulated. For example, I draw the Minister's attention to an answer that I received in this place a couple of days ago-in fact, the Minister gave it to me-with regard to the inspection of food. We place those types of controls on food. The Minister indicated in his answer that, where there was an excess, the Government issued a licence only when it was satisfied that no health risk to any Australian was involved. I am thinking of the same types of usages in these circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an extraordinary conjunction of fate that I should be answering on behalf of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson). I see that Senator Sanders, ever with an eye for the main chance, has picked his opportunity to put these questions to me. Let me answer them as properly and as fully as I could were I the Minister for the environment. Let me answer that part of Senator Sanders's question which relates to my portfolio responsibilities as Minister for Resources, for I fear that he will ask it later in any event under my portfolio. We might as well dispose of it now. I hope it will be a clean finish to the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first part of the question, as I took it down, was: What has the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (DASETT) done to protect the National Estate in the south-eastern forests? Acting on the advice of both this Department and my own Department, the Government initially put a proposal to the New South Wales Government that there be no logging in the areas of the National Estate and areas on the interim list of the National Estate until such time as we could have a further round of discussions with the New South Wales Government to settle the areas that should be protected in order to meet the requirements of the Harris-Daishowa woodchip export licence. Agreement between the Commonwealth and the New South Wales Government was reached in January on the understanding that when I met with Minister Causley in March we would again discuss the areas to be protected prior to making a decision but that in the meanwhile there would be no logging in areas of the National Estate or on the interim list. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret to inform Senator Sanders that, without reference to me and unilaterally, the New South Wales Government commenced logging, as it said at the time, to supply saw logs to the Bombala sawmill prior to the opportunity for Minister Causley and me to meet again to settle any issues that were outstanding. I believe that that Government, although I disagree with what it did, acted within its constitutional authority to authorise logging for sawmill purposes. Because that logging, in the integrated form of forestry that is practised by the Forestry Commission of New South Wales, generated materials that would normally be sent to the woodchip mill at Eden, those materials were sent there. When I became aware of that I instructed Harris-Daishowa (Australia) Pty Ltd to comply with the terms of its licence and quarantine that supply of material because it was not from an area that the Commonwealth had approved. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, I have been to the Eden woodchip mill this very day. One can visually inspect an increasingly large stockpile of materials from the area in which Minister Causley has authorised the cutting-which, moreover, on my instructions, is not being processed by Harris-Daishowa. Indeed, Harris-Daishowa has gone further and said that if it does not process it soon it will have to stand down workers. Nonetheless, in talking to those workers today, I said that I would not agree to the processing of that material until such time as we had an agreement with the State of New South Wales on how the National Estate should be treated in the south-eastern forests. </PARA>
<PARA> As to Senator Sanders's other questions, the form of procedures involved here is the standard form of procedures followed. Whenever a State proposition comes to me involving a proposal which cuts into any area designated as National Estate or as interim-listed National Estate, I refer it to the Minister for the environment. Comment is sought by the Heritage Commission, comment is given by the Australian Heritage Commission and, in the meantime, I busy myself trying to find, to quote the terms of the relevant Act, prudent and feasible alternatives to cutting in the National Estate. I accept the advice of the Minister for the environment and the advice of the Heritage Commission, and I do my level best to find alternatives. If I cannot find alternatives that are prudent and feasible and believe that there is no alternative but to proceed to log part of the National Estate, which is something that I authorise from time to time-and not just in the case of the south-east-as a matter of form I am bound to seek comment from the Heritage Commission on how it is proposed to be done. I get further advice from the Commission about that, but in the end make a decision, based on my statutory obligations, as to what the final proposal will be and notify the State governments concerned of that proposal. The head of power that I operate in doing all that is the export control power, expressed as conditions on the export licences for woodchip companies in Australia. </PARA>

During the process of making these decisions, it could be fairly said that we live in each other's pockets, not only at departmental level but also at ministerial level. While Senator Sanders is right in identifying the distinction between the responsibilities of each of the departments, if I might draw an analogy it would be that of the inbuilt conflict between a quality control officer and a production officer in a manufacturing plant, where there is always a constructive antagonism in relation to each other's requirements and a desire by management in the end to produce a product which conforms with the needs of both.</PARA></TALK.START>

Is it normal business practice for someone to announce who is going to get the tender before anything is actually signed and final negotiations take place, with a resultant delay of six months while negotiations are going on, meaning that the tenderers, who have the great advantage of knowing that they are going to get the job, are able to screw the Government down to the point where they can obtain an extra $25m out of it? Surely the Minister does not believe that is normal practice? I asked a question, which was never answered: While this was going on, was a letter of intent sent to the prospective tenderers? I wanted to know who it was sent by, whether it was cleared by the Minister's office, and was that outside the terms of the Cabinet decision.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When questions are not answered and accusations are made, things transpire around the country and we hear all sorts of rumours about kickbacks. They reflect not only on the Department but also on the Minister. I would like to get these matters cleared up tonight. A lot of the information is contained in the review of the tendering process. Some of the answers were given in the Estimates hearings, but some were not. The point I am trying to make is that when a tender is being let for anything, it is important to do the best one can for whoever one is working for. I put it to the chamber that in this case, Senator Richardson's impetuosity in trying to get the tender let to New South Wales had the net effect of blowing out the price by at least $25m. The contract negotiations took so long because the tenderers knew that they were going to get it. As I found out earlier tonight, that has resulted in the vessel not being ready when it should be, which means that another vessel will have to be taken up in the short term. Whilst I have been told that it is cheaper-and I have to accept that-I do not believe it will assist the Department in planning its ongoing program. I did ask whether there was a letter of intent sent to P and O before the final contract negotiations had been completed, and the Minister said no; but there was.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the Minister would have to admit, even though he does not know anything of what I am talking about, that in usual business practice letting a tenderer know that it has got a job before final negotiations are completed is not, I think in the words of one of the advisers, normal process. That is the point I have been trying to make. I have been trying to find out why it happened and what the overall cost increase is because of that. I think the chamber has a right to know, as the Estimates process oversees this type of operation. It does not reflect very well on the Department or on the Antarctic Division. Allegations have been made, and they were referred to in the Estimates hearings, by Mr Ralfs that in the early days of tendering he was given documents by the Seamen's Union of Australia. I find it incredible that confidential briefing information that is supposed to be provided to Cabinet by the Antarctic Division could end up in the hands of one of the prospective tenderers. Not only that, when the Australian Federal Police investigated the matter they actually showed the documents to the then Director and the Deputy Director. Mr Ralfs believes that his submission was sabotaged. It was admitted in Estimates. Senator Puplick asked a question about this and I think the answer went something like this, `Essentially the answer is that there was an error in the information that went to the Minister. But it was not material to any decisions'. But the fact is that the submission made by Mr Ralfs was changed, by persons unknown, between the time it left his hands and when it got to the Minister. Whether in the final analysis that had any effect on his tender I do not know but in those early days, from what I have read here, it seems the Antarctic Division was quite happy with the proposal he put up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we asked in the Estimates hearing what had been done about it, we were told the officers did not know the answer to the question, but they were satisfied there was no evidence to suggest that it had been done by the departmental sources and therefore there was no investigation. Surely to goodness when the Australian Federal Police are involved and documents that are supposed to be confidential Cabinet briefing documents are in the hands of the Seamen's Union and the prospective tenderers, that warrants an investigation. I think that is a reflection on the Department and the Minister involved. I believe this whole exercise has been dubious. It is a shame that the relevant Minister is not here to answer the question directly. As I said, I find it very hard to continue with any more lines of questioning when I cannot get any answers. </PARA>

I understand that the one-page attachment had a factual error. I have just been shown the Hansard of the Senate Estimates Committee meeting of 13 April, when the question was asked about an announcement or indication that a particular tenderer has been successful without the contract actually being signed. Mr Blunn and Senator Richardson both commented on that. Off the top of my head I am aware of one very important case, the portfolio of the Defence Service Homes Corporation, when it was announced that the Government had accepted the Westpac Banking Corporation tender but no contract had yet been signed. Indeed the details of the final agreement which was signed were not fully negotiated, I would say from memory, for several weeks. It may even have been more than a month after that. So it is certainly not unprecedented for an announcement to be made that the Government has accepted or is going to accept a particular tender without all the details having been fully negotiated, let alone a contract signed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> In the case to which I refer and which I know a good deal about-the Westpac case-that was no realistic alternative other than to do what was done. There were many matters of fine detail and it would not have been a practical proposition to discuss them with all the people who had put in a tender. That would have probably strung the whole process out for another six or 12 months. I expect that was a significantly more complicated deal than the Antarctic ship project is likely to be. Senator Puplick asked whether it was normal. I do not know what is normal, but it is certainly not unprecedented. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) back to matters that I raised earlier in relation to the financial relationship between the Commonwealth and the new Australian Capital Territory Government. I do so out of the Estimates. A number of questions were left outstanding or unclear. I guess the position is even more unclear for Australian Capital Territory residents now than it was a week or so ago. Until then they understood that they had an undertaking from the Commonwealth that for the first two years after the new government came into being Commonwealth funding would be maintained in real terms. As we are all aware, last week the Commonwealth, to put it in a very moderate terminology, varied that undertaking-for whatever reason is irrelevant at the moment. It leaves considerable doubt as to the current position in relation to Commonwealth guarantees for funding for the balance of the first two years and thereafter for the next two years in which it said there would be a phase-down period. The Minister has the advantage of being the Minister for Finance as well. I would like to know what is the Commonwealth's position in relation to the guarantees it gave to the Australian Capital Territory upon attaining self-government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Normally, my position as Minister for Finance might have helped me to answer this question. I was on leave during the week of the Premiers Conference. I have not yet caught up with that sort of detail regarding what happened. I think as the Finance Minister I could provide Senator Hill with an answer-not at the moment and not tonight, but within a reasonable time-to the latter part of his question. In regard to the first part of his question and his reference to the earlier questions, which I did not hear, I am advised that the officers who spoke on Australian Capital Territory matters at the Estimates Committee hearings last April are not now with the Australian Public Service but with the Australian Capital Territory territorial government. Those individuals and their functions are no longer part of the Commonwealth Department. The Commonwealth Department's residual involvement with the Australian Capital Territory now revolves around national functions-for example, the National Capital Planning Authority, the Parliamentary Triangle and related matters.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is correct; I accept that. I am interested in the national functions and responsibilities. In particular, I am looking at the national responsibilities of funding, both through the transitional period and thereafter-funding obligations which the Commonwealth has accepted and which remain in an unclear position. This was accepted in the Estimates Committee when the relevant officer said there were still a considerable number of outstanding issues that required resolution or clarification concerning financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the Australian Capital Territory Government. Over the range of these matters a very large sum of money is involved. The people of the Australian Capital Territory believe that they require clarification.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Uncertainty now exists in relation to the transitional arrangements following the events of last week. I would like the Minister to take a look at that. I do not mind if the answer is not given tonight. I think it is important that the position be clarified, particularly as to how it affects the second year, which is part of the real terms guarantee and the two following years which was to be the period of phase down. What undertakings is the Commonwealth now giving, bearing in mind that the undertakings which it gave only a few months ago at the time of the introduction of self-government appear now to be outdated? I think the Minister would say that they were superseded by unexpected economic circumstances. Where do the people of the Australian Capital Territory and the new Australian Capital Territory Government now sit in relation to the Commonwealth undertakings that were given?</PARA>
<PARA> Another matter which has been put to us by officers of the Department in answers that were recently provided to Estimates inquiries that remained outstanding relates to the role of the Commonwealth Grants Commission during the guarantee and transitional periods. The people of the Australian Capital Territory and the Government would like to know what the Commonwealth is intending to do in that regard. The Minister will recall that the Grants Commission carried out an inquiry into Australian Capital Territory funding. This covered the year 1986-87. It found that after taking into account Commonwealth functions and financial support equivalent to that for the States, the requirement for the Australian Capital Territory was $80m more. Is it the intention of the Commonwealth to have the Grants Commission update those figures? Are they to be taken into account in the transition period?</PARA>
<PARA> The third matter that requires clarification arising out of the Estimates Committee in relation to these transitional financial relations is the treatment of the cost of land development prior to 1 July 1988. In April the officers of the Department told us that the matter was being worked on and that the land in question was pretty much settled. They thought the figure would be in the vicinity of $50m. The considered answer to the outstanding issues question indicates that there is still doubt about the treatment of the costs of land development. I do not know what that means. It is unclear to me and I request clarification. A number of other matters need to be clarified. I do not know whether the Minister can assist us tonight-perhaps he might be able to give us some indication. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot do anything tonight. The honourable senator wanted to know precisely what happened at the Premiers Conference in regard to the Australian Capital Territory and what changes, if any, were made at the Premiers Conference or because of the Premiers Conference to the decision announced, I think in July of last year, about Australian Capital Territory funding. I do not know the answers off the top of my head but I am confident that I could get that sort of information from the Department of Finance. I will get it to the honourable senator by letter, certainly not tonight and probably not tomorrow but I expect some time next week. That sort of information is probably better obtained from the Department of Finance than it is from the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories for the reasons that have already been given.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to what the Commonwealth's policy will be in regard to a Grants Commission review, I think that is a Treasury matter, not a Finance matter. I will approach the Treasurer (Mr Keating) about that. However, I warn the honourable senator that the Treasurer may not be willing at this stage to make a statement on that. Likewise, I should be able to get an answer from the Department of Finance to the third question about the financial treatment of developed or semi-developed land that is being transferred to the Australian Capital Territory Administration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am satisfied with that approach and, on that basis, I will simply run through a list of outstanding issues. I remind the Minister that they are not issues which I regard as outstanding but issues which the Department itself regards as outstanding. The Minister will remember that one of the key subjects of the whole self-government debate was the financial relationship between the Commonwealth and the new self-governing body. With the experience of hindsight, we realise that much less was determined before self-government than we had realised. As I said, these matters in total add up to very large sums of money and are, therefore, very important from the point of view of Australian Capital Territory residents and their future likely local taxation requirements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fourth of these areas is the treatment of notional levels of Commonwealth debt calculated for the period up to the establishment of the Australian Capital Territory trust account. I would be pleased if that could be clarified. The fifth area-and this is being particularly raised with me-is the treatment of superannuation liabilities relating to Australian Capital Territory government employees who were taken from the Commonwealth. I understand from the officers' helpful information in the Estimates Committee hearings that in the case of the Northern Territory the Commonwealth met that requirement for the first seven years. Under a strict interpretation of the guarantees that the Commonwealth has given, which guarantees perhaps have already been modified-</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am to interpret from that that this Government is certainly not going to give financial support for seven years to Commonwealth employees who have become Australian Capital Territory employees. This might be of interest to them. They will be even more interested to learn what the Commonwealth is giving because, on a strict interpretation of the guarantee, one could say that that meant that the Commonwealth would guarantee only the excess superannuation requirement for a period of two years. But, as we know, that guarantee was modified last week. Therefore, there must be a great, currently existing doubt as to exactly what is going to be the liability that the Commonwealth is prepared to pick up. The employees of the Australian Capital Territory would appreciate the Minister's clarification in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next area that remains vague is that of financial adjustments relating to the transfer of territorial functions, the funding of which was not included in the ACT trust accounts in 1988-89. Examples are given of the Australian Government Solicitor functions, the administrative appeals-ombudsman functions, the Public Service Commission's functions and the Archives functions. There may be others. I would be pleased if the Minister could in due course give some indication as to what moneys are involved in relation to those adjustments. </PARA>
<PARA> The next matter that has been raised by the Department in its list of outstanding issues in the financial relationship is that of financial adjustments relating to the definition and gazettal of national land. We would appreciate clarification as to what moneys are involved in that regard, and how long it will take to settle and resolve what moneys are involved. Also, the establishment grant which was foreshadowed in the second reading speech to the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Bill has to be clarified. The Minister will remember that it included undertakings by this Government in relation to the Parliamentary Library, the Treasury computer system and building to house the Assembly and the Executive. They are in a building and I take it that that obligation is being met. What about the other undertakings; are they still to be honoured? What sums of money are involved? The funding basis for the specific purpose payments to the Australian Capital Territory Government for 1989-90 according to the list of outstanding issues, is, as I just said, outstanding and we would appreciate clarification. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst this list is helpful in that it sets out a whole series of heads, in effect, it really does not provide the substantive information upon which the Australian Capital Territory residents or the Australian Capital Territory Government can assess their future financial obligations. That is what we are seeking in this request for further clarification. We would also like clarification in respect of funding for territorial functions retained by the Commonwealth in relation to the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court and policing; the determination of general revenue and special revenue assistance grants for 1989-90; the determination of the general capital assistance grant for 1989-90; and the Australian Capital Territory Government Loan Council borrowings for 1989-90. We are also advised by the Department that further work is required on the operation of section 64 of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act which relates to guarantees offered by the Australian Capital Territory Government. We seek clarification as to what further work is necessary in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> We would like to know when the role of the Commonwealth Auditor-General is to be settled. The financial arrangements for services provided by the Commonwealth to the Australian Capital Territory remain to be settled. We would like to know what ongoing work is in train in that regard, and what will be the obligations of the Australian Capital Territory. The financial arrangements for services provided by the Australian Capital Territory to the Commonwealth are important and require clarification. Recognition of the Australian Capital Territory and Commonwealth-State financial forums still requires further clarification. The Department speaks about `a longer term timetable for inclusion of the Australian Capital Territory in the general revenue pool on a similar basis to the States and the Northern Territory'. What is meant by that? The stated intention of the Government requires clarification. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that list is long, but it indicates the level of outstanding difficulty, or at least the number of significant issues which as I said add up to a lot of the money, that still are required to be resolved before there can be certainty in the financial relationship between the Commonwealth and the Australian Capital Territory. We would be genuinely pleased if the Minister would have his Department look at that list which has been prepared by the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories and give us further information as to what is meant under each of these heads, what are the finances involved, and when the matters are likely to be resolved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that Senator Walsh is getting tired and I presume his advisers are too but I would like to return to my previous line of questioning and the comments I have been making. I have four questions. If Senator Walsh cannot answer them perhaps some of his advisers can. They relate to what I referred to at the beginning-that is, the media release from Senator Richardson in which he said that the shipyard would be chosen on a competitive commercial basis. The first question is: as a result of all the machinations that occurred, in the final analysis were overseas ship operators who approached Carrington Slipways Pty Ltd given to understand that no matter which operator was selected, Carrington would build the ship? How would Carrington have been able to assert that? The second question-getting back to the competitive commercial basis; they were Senator Richardson's words, not mine-is: did Australian Shipbuilding Industries (Western Australia) Pty Ltd (ASI) offer the best price for the construction of the vessel on a commercial basis and therefore on a competitive basis? Is the Minister aware of the level of subsidy provided by the New South Wales Labor Government at the time in order to make Carrington's bid successful?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another point that strikes me when looking through this review is: why was Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd included in the final short list by the Minister even though it had been excluded, for cost reasons, from the list recommended by the Antarctic Division? The final question is one I have asked on about four other occasions but I do not think I have had an answer to. During the tendering process and before negotiations were finalised, was a letter of intent sent to P and O Steam Navigation Co.? Was it approved by the Minister? Whom was it signed by? If that did happen, was the letter of intent outside the terms of the Cabinet decision? Was Cabinet warned by the Australian Government Solicitor about signing it?</PARA>

The advice I have from the officers is the same. One of the earlier questions was about the contract or acceptance tender from P and O Steam Navigation Co. My recollection of the Cabinet discussions at the time-it has however been confirmed by the officers here-was that the Commonwealth's dealings were with P and O. Whoever actually built the ship was P and O's affair rather than the Commonwealth's per se.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise a matter that came up in the Estimates Committee. It is the matter of the construction of a child-care centre on the lawns of the old Parliament House. We raised the matter of the necessity for a child-care centre and of course its location is a matter of interest as well. As a consequence of the questions which were asked, some answers have since been supplied, which in some ways raise more issues than they answer. At the time we questioned the need for child-care places in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). In fact, Senator Hill asked a question-it is recorded on page 155-that has subsequently been answered. One paragraph of the answer is of particular interest:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are no formal mechanisms to assess the overall need for and number of places or resulting shortfall. However, in a general sense it is accepted that the demand for places exceeds the present levels of supply. This is supported by the size of waiting lists, the number of enquiries, and information received from individual services particularly for children under 2 years old.</PARA>
<PARA>Interestingly enough, it then says that a more detailed brief on the above can be provided upon request. I thought the honourable senator had requested the information at the hearing itself. What we were trying to get at is: what is the need for child-care places? We had asked whether there was a list that indicated the number of people registered as eligible for subsidised child-care in the ACT. It seems to me that there are no lists. Presumably, each child-care centre keeps a list of names of people who have dropped in but in that case the same child may be on four or five lists. So I do not feel that that answer tells us of the need for child-care places in the ACT. In fact, I know of private child-care centres in the ACT that do have places. </PARA>
<PARA> The other answer of interest related to the Children's Services Planning Committee setting priorities. The supplementary answer was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Children's Services Planning Committee meeting of 14 August 1987 recorded the following decision in its minutes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee, after considerable deliberation, accorded the new Parliament House as a high priority for child care based on the following' . . . </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VI4">Senator REID</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was the Children's Services Planning Committee, which apparently gave advice to the Government. The minutes went on to record the following factors:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>-the parliamentary triangle has always been considered a high priority area</PARA>
<PARA>-the facility would take pressure off other ACT child care facilities</PARA>
<PARA>-the facility should be built as an extended hours service. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no information there as to what other centres would have pressure removed. There is no indication as to how the funding for the extended hours service would be provided or whether the funds available for child-care services generally in the ACT would be eaten into. I am sure that I do not need to remind the Minister that two or three years ago the National Library said that it had the space for a child-care facility and wanted to provide one. The difficulty of the Library could have been met by placing a child-care facility there. </PARA>
<PARA> We also asked whether the lawns next to the old Parliament House were the only site available for a child-care centre within the Parliamentary Triangle. The supplementary answer lists 15 or 16 places where a child-care centre, if needed, could be placed. That makes it even more intriguing as to why it has to be placed in what I regard as a heritage area, right next to the old Parliament House. I wonder whether the Minister can give us more information to convince us that if there is to be another child-care centre in the ACT it should be in that particular position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been in trouble there before, I suppose. I have not been particularly worried about it. The question of numbers and so on is now an Australian Capital Territory Administration responsibility. However, I can give some background information. An assessment made by the Department of Community Services and Health and the Department of Finance about two years ago concluded that the unmet demand throughout Australia was some 120,000. `Unmet demand' was defined as demand either from sole parents, or from dual parents already in the work force, who had children below five years of age and who wished to have some child-care facility other than private arrangements such as leaving a child with a grandparent. I do not know whether there was a regional breakdown of that figure, but I think it was assumed that provision of facilities would be fairly uniform, on a pro rata basis throughout the country. When an additional program was announced, providing a total of 3,000 places, if I remember correctly, the Australian Capital Territory got an approximately per capita share.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The other aspect of the matter is whether this is the best means of using Government money to provide child-care for people in genuine need. This facility is going to cost a considerable amount of money to build. The information that I have seen indicates that placing a child in a government centre costs considerably more than in a private centre. In Canberra there are private centres that are extremely well run. As was indicated at the Estimates hearings, they are monitored by the Department, and no one challenges the Department's expertise. These private centres are extremely good. If children in need were placed in private child-care centres and the parents were subsidised, it would be possible to get a lot more children into child-care than I believe is possible in providing for them in the way proposed. Is there no way of using the money to better advantage to ensure that the children who really need child-care so that their mothers can get on with the lives are the ones who get it?</PARA></TALK.START>

I presume that Senator Reid knows that the Australian Bureau of Statistics has done a survey of commercial or private child-care centres, or whatever she likes to call them. The results, which were published at least a month ago, confirmed at least some of the things that Senator Reid has said. There was factual information about fees and, I think, much less reliable information about the income stratification of the users.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to return only briefly, and in summary, to the matters raised by Senator Calvert in relation to the question of the tender for the Antarctic vessel. It is not our intention to detain the Committee overly long this evening or to move that these matters be stood over until such time as Senator Richardson is here to answer. I want simply to draw together some threads arising from what I believe to be the scandalous way in which this tender process has been handled. There are a couple of points to be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First, there appears to be absolutely no doubt that the Commonwealth taxpayer has been required to fork out a far larger sum of money than was necessary, for no reason other than to attempt to bolster the electoral stocks of the Unsworth Government in New South Wales. A tender was specifically directed, channelled, guided, towards the New South Wales shipyards for no bona fide purpose, for no purpose other than to allow the New South Wales Government, under the direction of Mr Unsworth, as it then was, to gain some electoral advantage by claiming that it had secured work for a shipyard in an area which, had the matter been dealt with on a strictly commercial basis, would not have got it. This is simply an example of the extent to which a government was prepared to pervert the proper processes of Australian Government tendering to seek political advantage in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point that arises from it is that the Commonwealth taxpayer, in fact, at the end of the day has to pay a considerably greater sum of money for a vessel than would have been the case had the lowest possible tenderer been selected, and the determination of the Government, for whatever purposes, to secure some local manning and construction of this vessel has been set against the best financial standards which should have been applied to ensure that the Commonwealth received maximum value for dollars expended out of Commonwealth revenues. </PARA>
<PARA> The third issue is that letters of intent were clearly sent out. They were signed not by the Minister but by an officer of the Department. Had the Department been entirely forthcoming with us tonight it would have been in a position to indicate to us the name of the officer whose signature appears at the bottom of that letter of intent. We know whose signature appears on that letter. It is not the responsibility of the Opposition to intrude upon the privacy or the personal status of the individual concerned. The opportunity was available for the Government to indicate to us this evening who the officer concerned was. The Government chose not to. We accept the decision made by the Government to choose not to. We know that the Australian Government Solicitor advised that this course of action should not be followed. We know that; the Government could have indicated that but chose not to. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that the draft Cabinet submission considered by the Minister on 23 November 1987 indicated, I think the proper words are that the Australian shipyard be selected on a competitive commercial basis. That formulation appeared in the draft Cabinet submission. It did not appear in the final Cabinet submission. The Government was in a position to indicate to us whether in fact that was the case or not the case and the Government chose not to indicate to us what that position was. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that, on 9 November 1987, the Minister approved a short list and, contrary to the recommendation of the Antarctic Division, included the first preferred option put to him by Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd (TNT), because it was allegedly the next lowest offer made by an Australian company, and that information needed to be before the Cabinet for the purposes of allowing Cabinet to make its judgments. We know that as a result of the comments made in para 5.76 of the report entitled Review of the Tendering Process for the Antarctic Replacement Vessel. </PARA>
<PARA> As to whether in fact that was a genuine attempt to allow Cabinet to make comparisons between Australian tenders and overseas tenders we really do not know. All we know is that the Antarctic Division had recommended that TNT's first option be excluded because it was outside the competitive price range but the Minister, for reasons which have not been adequately explained either to the Estimates Committees or the chamber, insisted that the TNT first option be included in the material that was put before Cabinet for consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> We know from the review of the tendering processes for the Antarctic replacement vessel that the review panel found that not all appropriate practices and procedures were observed. I must say that even after the extensive questioning that went on in the Estimates Committee, conducted by Senator Calvert, by Senator Archer and by me, among others, no satisfactory explanation has been provided to the Parliament for what changes have effectively been made to ensure that the gross failures of the Department to observe proper Commonwealth standards in this matter have been adequately rectified or dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> One could go on for a considerable time through this particular unhappy saga. At the end of the day, one is left with several basic premises. The first of them is that the Commonwealth taxpayer is now required to pay a far larger sum of money than was absolutely necessary for the securing of a replacement Antarctic vessel. That results from a series of policy decisions made by the Government. I and the Opposition do not argue with the fact that a Government decision has been made and that a particular course of action should have been preferred over another course of action in relation to the selection of Australian construction and eventual Australian manning of this vessel. But it really does concern me that the process of obtaining that information has been akin to the process of drawing teeth. Instead of being entirely forthcoming with the Estimates Committee and entirely forthcoming with the Parliament with the information that that was a result of a deliberate Cabinet decision or Government policy, one has had to painfully extract that information which could have been given at an early stage. Indeed, had that been made quite clearly known to the Parliament a great deal of the time of both the Estimates Committee and the chamber may well have been saved. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, there is, to my way of thinking, no satisfactory indication that the deficiencies in the procedure or in the processes indicated by the Review of the Tendering Process for the Antarctic Replacement Vessel have been adequately addressed and that the necessary remedial action has been taken. Thirdly, one is left with a nagging and continuing suspicion that, at the end of the day, considerations about the potential survival of the Unsworth Government were the primary considerations in the mind of the Minister and the Government in this whole process. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, and perhaps most regrettably, may I say that, in the consciousness of mind of what I believe will be the senior members of the incoming administration after the next election, the probity and veracity of officers in the Department concerned in this matter is open to a sufficient degree of concern for us undoubtedly to require necessary remedial action if and when we have the opportunity to do so. </PARA>

<PARA>COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE, 25 MAY 1989</PARA>
<PARA>QUESTION-Senator Michael Macklin</PARA>
<PARA> What is the total number (full-time equivalent) of public servants in your Department employed in providing support services to Members of Parliament?</PARA>
<PARA>ANSWER</PARA>
<PARA> Public servants in Government Departments Australia-wide provide support services to their Ministers directly and to the Parliament indirectly. The Department of Administrative Services provides support services to all Senators and Members, Ministers and Opposition Office-holders, former parliamentarians and former Prime Ministers. It also provides support services to staff employed by Senators and Members, Ministers and Opposition Office-holders and former Prime Ministers. In total, 224 sitting Members, some 115 retired members of Parliament and approximately 1,000 staff. </PARA>
<PARA> The range of service provided by the Department of Administrative Services involves staff from a number of the Department's programs, some full-time, some part-time. For example staff of the Transport and Storage Group provide car with driver service, Australian Property Group arranges leasing of office accommodation and the Parliamentary and Ministerial Services Group arranges purchasing and payment of accounts in compliance with the Audit Act and Finance Directions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Administrative Services has a total staff of some 18,000. Of these approximately 100 staff located in Canberra and the States are employed full time in providing support services to sitting and former parliamentarians and their staff. </PARA>
<PARA>COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE, 25 MAY 1989</PARA>
<PARA>QUESTION-Senator Michael Macklin</PARA>
<PARA> What is the average annual overtime earned by electorate assistants?</PARA>
<PARA>ANSWER</PARA>
<PARA> In 1988/89 it is anticipated that an amount of approximately $1.742m will be spent on overtime payments for Electorate staff. With a total staffing of 667 this amount equates to a pro rata figure of $2,600 per staff member per annum or on average, payment for about 2 hours overtime per week. </PARA>
<PARA>COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE, 25 MAY 1989</PARA>
<PARA>QUESTION-Senator Macklin</PARA>
<PARA> What is the average annual charter costs utilised by Members/Senators?</PARA>
<PARA>ANSWER</PARA>
<PARA> The Remuneration Tribunal has determined that a Senator or Member shall be entitled, at Government expense, to use charter transport within and for the service of the State, Territory or electorate to the annual limit specified. The value of the entitlement is determined by the size of the State or electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> For Members the range is between $5,325 and $25,000 per annum with a minimum requirement for an electorate size of 10,000 square kilometres. The average annual cost of the entitlement is $11,160. </PARA>
<PARA> For Senators the range is between $5,325 and $20,000 per annum. Senators for the Australian Capital Territory do not receive the entitlement. The average annual cost of the entitlement for Senators is $7,670. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall the average annual cost of the charter transport entitlement is $8,853. </PARA>
<PARA>COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE, 25 MAY 1989</PARA>
<PARA>QUESTION-Senator Michael Macklin</PARA>
<PARA> What is the average amount spent annually on equipping an electorate office?</PARA>
<PARA>ANSWER</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Administrative Services provides office equipment, furniture, general official requisites and stores to electorate offices. Approximately $4m will be expended this financial year in providing those services-an average of $17,800 per electorate office. Expenditure in one year doesn't necessarily mean that the same amount would be spent in the following year. For example, all photocopiers in electorate offices were upgraded this year to provide collating with 20 bin capacity and second workstations are being provided to electorate offices. </PARA>
<PARA>COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE, 25 MAY 1989</PARA>
<PARA>QUESTION-Senator Michael Macklin</PARA>
<PARA> What is the average spent annually on maintaining an electorate office?</PARA>
<PARA>ANSWER</PARA>
<PARA> The cost of maintaining electorate offices, ie postage, telephones, repairs and maintenance to office equipment and furniture and fittings will amount to approximately $3.4m this financial year-an average of $15,000 per electorate office. </PARA>
<PARA>COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE, 25 MAY 1989</PARA>
<PARA>QUESTION-Senator Michael Macklin</PARA>
<PARA> What is the cost per annum of an average lease for an electorate office?</PARA>
<PARA>ANSWER</PARA>
<PARA> Lease costs for electorate offices are dependent on a number of factors. For example, the area of the office, whether within or outside the Central Business District, the location (for example ground floor shop front or above ground floor in an office building), and the demand for leased space in the desired location. Senators and Members have the flexibility within guidelines on area and the availability of reasonably priced space, to determine where their electorate offices are located to best meet their representational responsibilities. Rental is generally between $20,000 and $30,000 per annum. An average lease cost does not provide a meaningful reflection of the discretion Senators and Members are able to exercise in relation to their office. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to separate electorate offices, the Government provides conference and visiting facilities in capital cities to enable Senators and Members to fulfil their parliamentary and electorate duties. </PARA>
<PARA>COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE, 25 MAY 1989</PARA>
<PARA>QUESTION-Senator Michael Macklin</PARA>
<PARA> What is the average annual cost per electorate office of staff air fares, ground transport and travel allowance?</PARA>
<PARA>ANSWER</PARA>
<PARA> Each Senator's and Members' electorate staff travel costs are met from an annual budget. The budget is based on the cost of 15 return air fares to Canberra, 100 days travelling allowance and associated car transport costs. Each budget is therefore specifically designed for the Senator and Member taking into account the distance from the electorate office to Canberra. The total cost of all budgets this financial year is $3,398,000-or an average of $17,520 for each Senator and Member. </PARA>
<PARA> An average cost does not however reflect the tailored nature of individual budgets, the flexibility Senators and Members have to determine their staff travel needs and the ability for individual budgets to be adjusted to accommodate extra parliamentary sittings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 8 May this year I gave notice of a motion with regard to a cost of justice inquiry. As honourable senators will remember, two days later the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs was successful in having a motion carried with regard to a reference on the cost of justice inquiry. While that was somewhat narrower than the one I have been consulting on for some 18 months with members of community groups and the legal profession, I still give that inquiry my wholehearted support because it deals with an issue which is becoming of ever-increasing urgency in the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tonight I want to raise one issue, and that is with regard to community legal services. As honourable senators are aware, the ability of community legal centres to meet community needs is being severely compromised by their inability to obtain adequate funding. These important community service organisations are now struggling to maintain the high level of service that they have traditionally supplied. I hardly need stress that these services promote social equity and justice; yet they are being neglected at the moment by a government whose policy professes a commitment to equity and justice. It is hoped that by the time that that inquiry finishes we will have a very clear and unequivocal case for rapidly increasing the funding of these centres. These centres play a vital role in giving support to many people-particularly people without a regular income or with low incomes or people in economic difficulties for one reason or another-who find it necessary to be involved with legal services. But in the meantime, it seems to me that these centres are in fact being deprived more and more of their ability to play that role. The quality of the services provided by the community legal centres is high and they are highly cost-effective due to the level of volunteer involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost benefit argument can be added, of course, to the arguments that I have already made concerning social justice and equity, that volunteer involvement exists only because some funds are provided. If the funds are cut, there will be no avenue for that volunteer involvement. As in so many other areas, as the Government realises, government dollars are amplified enormously when there is volunteer involvement and some government moneys. Honourable senators are well aware, of course, that there are a large number of these organisations. I do not want to run through them all, but every State has a number of them and they have worked extremely well over the years in providing that type of service. </PARA>
<PARA> My question to the Government is: in terms of the provision of legal services to the community via these community legal centres, is it the Government's intention to continue to starve these centres of adequate funds, or does the Government actually have some long-term suggestions with regard to funding that it wishes to make on this matter? I think that unless there is a basic and firm funding commitment from the Government, much of the good work that has been done to date in establishing these centres and keeping them running in that mixture of paid and voluntary work will have been lost, and it will be almost impossible to recreate these centres. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Macklin for the question, because it evinces an interest in an aspect of the provision of legal aid in the Australian community which I regard as extremely important; that is legal aid provided through community legal centres, as opposed to the State legal aid commissions which exist in every jurisdiction except the Northern Territory and Tasmania where Australian legal aid offices provide Federal funding for legal aid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The community legal centres have in fact fared as well as they might realistically have hoped in the last couple of years in that their appropriation in real terms has been maintained at a time when many other areas of the portfolio were being cut back. Indeed, I have been concerned to ensure that at least that funding is maintained in real terms. Only today I sent out letters to all States and to every community legal centre in Australia indicating the provision of, I think, $2,517,000. I will later have incorporated in Hansard a table of the individual grants to each community legal centre. I agree that all that has been achieved is that we have maintained in real terms the funding for these centres. But, as I say, in this current period that represents some modest achievement. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been impossible to secure funding for new centres. Although we did receive several letters and representations from members and senators pleading that that be done in certain instances, we thought it best to consolidate those centres that were already offering services and had built up an established network. I say `network' because, as Senator Macklin quite rightly observed, one of the great virtues of community legal centres is their ability to attract, in addition to the work performed by salaried persons within the community legal centres, contributions of very high quality and calibre from practitioners and other persons who come in-perhaps for two or three hours once very fortnight, but in any case on a regular basis-and deal with clients who seek advice. So the $2.5m that we expend is multiplied, amplified and supplemented many times so that the dollar value of the services provided far exceeds the approximately $2.5m that the Commonwealth puts in. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that is about all I can say in regard to community legal centres. I recognise their important place in the provision of legal aid. I think they are to have their annual meeting in Maroochydore on the Gold Coast on the Queen's birthday weekend, whenever that happy event falls. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer to the report of the National Inquiry into Homeless Children by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission called Our Homeless Children. The reason I wish to do so is that I have received from the Weston Creek Community Service a very detailed response to that report. I hope that those considering the report of the Human Rights Commission will look at this very closely, together with the other submissions they receive. I will not go through the response in detail, but the Service comes to the following conclusion:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The fact that there are young homeless people living in our communities should be of enormous and grave concern to everyone. In responding to this very significant report on ``Our Homeless Children'', the Weston Creek Community Service has registered its concern and its willingness to do what is necessary to alleviate youth homelessness in Weston Creek in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA>It refers particularly to the recommendations, but I want to refer to their comment in relation to recommendation 20.3. It is a comment that I particularly wish to endorse. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The Weston Creek Community Service believes very strongly that non-government agencies are better accepted by the community in supporting families under stress and reiterates that its current level of family support funding is insufficient to meet current community needs. </PARA>
<PARA>There are very positive suggestions throughout this report in relation to the recommendations of the Human Rights Commission, but I think there is a very real place in this area for groups such as the Weston Creek Community Service, as a non-government agency, to be involved. Earlier today I showed to the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray) the introduction to the report. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the first two pages of this report, which I commend to those who will be responding on behalf of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>RESPONSE TO ``OUR HOMELESS CHILDREN'': REPORT OF THE NATIONAL INQUIRY INTO HOMELESS CHILDREN BY THE HUMAN RIGHTS AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION BY WESTON CREEK COMMUNITY SERVICE. </PARA>
<PARA> The Weston Creek Community Service agrees with the Commission in its adoption of the South Australian Council of Social Services definition of homelessness as being:</PARA>
<PARA> ``for homelessness to exist, at least one of the following conditions should be operative:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) an absence of shelter;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the threat of loss of shelter;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) very high mobility between places of abode;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) existing accommodation considered inadequate by the resident for reasons such as overcrowding, the physical state of the residence, lack of security of occupancy or lack of emotional support and stability in the place of residence;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) unreasonable restrictions in terms of access to alternative forms of accommodation.''</PARA>
<PARA> We believe that it is essential that homelessness as it relates to young people be discussed in its widest context to enable a comprehensive and sensitive response to be made to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The Weston Creek Community Service believes that it is totally unacceptable for the community to allow the problem of youth homelessness to continue unchecked and we are keen to do what we can to alleviate youth homelessness in Weston Creek in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> We agree with the Commission in that failure to address the problem of youth homelessness results in costs to the individual and costs to the community. The costs to the individual, as identified in the report, are considerable; financial costs, social isolation costs, psychological injuries costs, health costs, drug and alcohol costs, prostitution costs, disrupted education costs and disrupted employment costs. The costs to the community, as identified in the report, are also considerable in government outlay costs and costs related to crime in the community. The Weston Creek Community Service strongly believes that a perceived lack of current financial resources is no excuse for government failure to address the youth homelessness problem as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA> We support the ``Declaration of the Rights of the Child'' which states ``that all children have a right to enjoy special protection, to receive adequate housing and to be protected against all forms of neglect, cruelty and exploitation.''</PARA>
<PARA> The comprehensive response needed to youth homelessness as indicated earlier must be rapid, sensitive and appropriate to the differing needs of young homeless people. </PARA>
<PARA> We must respond appropriately to young people who leave home for short periods to ``cool off''. We must respond appropriately to young people who need only minimum support by ensuring they have enough financial support and a number of housing options available to them. </PARA>
<PARA> We must also respond appropriately to the chronically homeless, those who share a profound alienation from society, and respond sensitively to each individual on the basis of their age, intellectual disability, emotional disturbance, poor education, inadequate living skills, extensive poverty or combinations of these. </PARA>
<PARA> We know in the Australian Capital Territory that there are at least 50-60 young people homeless each night and we also know from the report that the youth workers in our community are perceived by young people as trusting and supportive. We need to encourage our young people to seek out our youth workers for assistance when they become homeless and when they are thinking of leaving home. </PARA>
<PARA> The Weston Creek Community Service acknowledges that young people leave home when their families are under stress, and agree with the Commission that insufficient funds are currently spent on family support services and preventative programs aimed at families under stress. We know already that our level of family support funding at Weston Creek is totally inadequate to meet the needs of the community we serve. We also acknowledge that family poverty and isolation are important factors in young people leaving home and urge the Federal Government to ensure that all individuals and families have an adequate income to enable them to properly function in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> Before examining the Commission's recommendations in detail, it remains to be said that we agree with the Commission that the number of crisis refuges currently in existence appears to be adequate, that more medium and long term accommodation for young people is desperately needed and that accommodation needs to be different for 13-18 year olds and 18-25 year olds, respectively, according to their different needs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise another matter. It is a story I find quite appalling and one I can hardly believe, but I can only present it to the Senate as it has been given to me. I read from a letter which has been written from a constituent to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons). The letter states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I am writing to you as an employee of the Department of Defence and Taxpayer. I am employed as a Senior Storeman at the Fyshwick Bulk Store of the Department. An incident happened on Thursday 18 and Friday 19th May which caused me great concern and extremely upset me. </PARA>
<PARA>Due to a recurring chest complaint and recent respiratory infection the week before (on sick leave for 4 days), I was wearing a personally owned jumper to help recover from my infection and was told by the Executive Officer of Stores to ``take off my jumper'', as according to Stores' regulations I was out of uniform for wearing the jumper as an outer garment. I have been supplied with a jacket which is regulation issue but it fails to keep my chest warm and is cumbersome for me to carry out many of my duties . . . I refused to remove my jumper on explanation of my illness, and was informed that I would be on leave without pay if I did not. At 9.30 a.m. I was advised by the Stores Manager under instruction from the Executive Officer of Stores that I was indeed on leave without pay. I telephoned Senior Executive Officer of Transport and Stores to request that I could leave my jumper on, and was advised no. As I was quite adamant that I should be allowed to wear it, considering my illness, I continued to refuse to remove it. I remained at work and continued my duties for the day. </PARA>
<PARA>It gets worse:</PARA>
<PARA>On Friday 19th May, I was issued a Minute from the Stores Manager under instruction from the Executive Stores Officer that confirmed the previous days action, i.e. on leave without pay . . . I contacted Branch Staff Cell to ask for a telephone number for Civil Personnel, and was told that I was not allowed to talk to Personnel, I had to go through them. I explained the previous days events and they said that they would investigate the matter. I did however contact Civil Personnel myself and they too said they would investigate the matter. I have in support of this letter, copies of correspondence from my doctor and my mother confirming my health problems, and would ask that you find the time to investigate this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>I have in my possession a copy of a letter from the man's doctor confirming a recurrent respiratory infection and his need to take steps to keep himself warm and well. I also have a confirmatory letter from the man's mother. I have what might be regarded as a remarkable document which is a copy of a minute paper, headed `Subject: Protective Clothing', and directed to my constituent. It reads, in part:</PARA>
<PARA>You are advised that as at 0930 hours 18 May 1989 you were on leave without pay until 1651 hours 18 May 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>I find it hard to believe that such a thing could happen when we are talking about productivity and people attempting to do their work and to be a part of the community. It may well be that the clothing issued is not adequate for this climate and that there should be regulation jumpers, if jumpers are in fact required in that area. The jackets may not be adequate. A situation where a man has been off work sick with respiratory problems for four days and is then faced with this sort of petty bureaucracy is something that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel should look into as a matter of urgency. I hope that his representative in this chamber will report back to the Senate equally as a matter of urgency. I will be very disappointed indeed, to put it very mildly, if this man suffers the consequence of leave without pay for that one day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer to a question that I asked the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) today in Question Time in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. The question I asked was in reference to the establishment of an end of war list. I asked the Minister whether he would approve a request for an end of war list. I wish to reverse a perception that he gave in his answer. The perception would be that the decision of the Minister for Defence in the McMahon Government, Mr Fairbairn, to reject the establishment of an end of war list was endorsed or carried on by the Minister for Defence in the Whitlam Government, Lance Barnard, for the same reasons. However, following a freedom of information request, I have received documents which I believe reject that sort of perception.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The decisions made by Mr Fairbairn and Mr Barnard were made for different reasons. Minister Fairbairn's decision followed a request by the Australian Army, the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force to establish an end of war list. Mr Fairbairn rejected the establishment of an end of war list on the grounds that the hostilities in Vietnam were still going on and that Australian troops were still in South East Asia. However, he did not rule out the establishment of an end of war list in the future. A request was also directed by the three armed services to Mr Barnard. His reasons for rejecting the establishment of an end of war list were different from Mr Fairbairn's because the troops were back from the Vietnam war zone. The Minister rejected the proposal on the grounds that it would be seen to be celebrating the war. What I thought of that reason I dealt with in my second reading speech. It was purely a political decision by Lance Barnard and was in no way, I believe, fairly based. But above all, unlike Mr Fairbairn, Lance Barnard completely ruled out the chance of an end of war list. So the Fairbairn and Barnard decisions were different. They were different men, from a different time in politics and, above all, they had different reasons to reject the end of war list. So I ask the Minister to reconsider the answer that he gave today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise the matter of the annual reports of two Commonwealth bodies. I do so because it is now evident that there will be no other opportunity for the Senate to discuss before it rises the still considerable list of annual reports that remain undealt with. I wish to discuss these two reports because they are added to the list of indefensibly late reports covering the period ended 30 June last year. For the benefit of honourable senators who are not aware of it, it is now May; it is almost a year later that we are eventually getting these annual reports. The standard of Commonwealth reporting is still appalling, particularly in the matter of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For example, in the annual report of the Attorney-General on the Operation of the Bankruptcy Act 1966, we have a statement from the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) expressing great pleasure in presenting the report, without bothering to put a date on it. So the report of the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy has no date on it whatsoever. One wonders whether the delay is due to printing problems or simple bureaucratic delays, but late reporting is bad reporting. The annual report of the Commissioner for Employees' Compensation at least has a date on it, December 1988. Why on earth did it take until May 1989 for a report presented to Mr Peter Morris, the Minister for Industrial Relations, to come to this chamber? We are accustomed to being dealt with with contempt by this Government, which apparently does not like the inconvenience of having to have its reports discussed in a timely and proper way. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, we do not get the opportunity to discuss these very significant reports in this place unless we raise them during the adjournment debate. The Government brings them in here, in this case 11 months after the end of the financial year, as some kind of gratuitous insult to this chamber. As both of them contain matters of some significance, I would have hoped that the Government would try to do a little better. For example, it should try to do as well as it requires public companies to do. If public companies reported as belatedly and incompetently as this lot, they would be fined, their executives would be in gaol and the companies would be delisted from the stock exchange. We can bring no sanctions against those like Mr Peter Morris, MP, who has apparently been sitting on this report, or doing something else with it-heaven knows what-since December 1988, before getting around to presenting it to this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to raise some matters in the annual report of the Commissioner for Employees' Compensation to dramatise the magnificent impact the former Waste Watch Committee, which I chaired, has managed to have on the level of payments under the Commissioner, and the way the exposing by that Committee of the rip-offs and rorts that were going on has brought about a significant improvement by reducing the level of wasted money. This report reveals:</PARA>
<PARA>For the second year in succession, expenditure on worker's compensation declined in real terms. The incidence rate of new claims per thousand employees covered fell to its lowest level in a decade. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Minister, in his summing up, is prepared to say thank you to the Waste Watch Committee, I am prepared to accept his grateful thanks at a time when the Government is being enjoined to reduce its expenditure, particularly to limit its wasteful expenditure. However, the report says:</PARA>
<PARA>Despite the overall reduction in continuing cases there was a further increase in long term cases from 9,351 in 1986-87 to 10,041 in 1987-88. This rise of 7.4 per cent implies that adequate attention has not been given to rehabilitation and redeployment needs of long term compensation recipients. </PARA>
<PARA>Quite frankly I hope that the new arrangements that the Government has entered into-because this is after all the last report for the Commissioner for Employees' Compensation-will involve a much better and much more coherent approach to the rehabilitation and deployment needs of long term compensation recipients, because this is just a waste of a human resource, involving with it a waste of money. As I said, the Government must be commended for responding to the Waste Watch Committee. We see that the report reveals:</PARA>
<PARA>The average incidence rate for 1987-88 is 59.9 per thousand employees covered.</PARA>
<PARA>That is about 6 per cent of the workers compensation rate. By the way, I understand that is about double the great bulk of the private sector-the more clerical ends of the private sector, not those industrial ends where unfortunately the workers compensation rate is much higher-but it is nowhere near as bad as the previous incidence rate. The rate in the latest year of 59.9 per thousand is certainly far better than the previous year's rate of 71.3 per thousand. </PARA>
<PARA> There are still other matters of concern because, as the Waste Watch Committee found, Victoria still has this extraordinary incidence of workers compensation requirements in the Commonwealth Public Service and Commonwealth agencies. It has the highest expenditure and has 31 per cent more long-term cases than New South Wales, even though Victoria has only 72 per cent of the number of employees that New South Wales has. I do not know whether this is because of some sweetheart deal done with some Victorian doctors, whether it is because of the football they play or whether it is the climate. Whatever it is, there is some basic continuing problem which must be addressed. We have the same problem in South Australia, which has double the rate of incidence of new cases in the Australian Capital Territory, which really requires some explanation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is still a curious variation between the incidence of workers compensation claims of various departments and government organisations. For example, it seems to me that there are an extraordinarily large number of claims in the Office of Defence Production. The Government is making changes in the structure of Defence Production, and not before time. The Williamstown Dockyard has an incidence rate of about 35 per cent of workers compensation claims among employees. That is a rate of 350 per thousand employees. That is simply unsustainable; it is incredible. When we look at other Office of Defence Production areas we find, for example, that in the Garden Island Dockyard the incidence of workers compensation among the work force is 27.5 per cent; at the Mulwala Explosives Factory the incidence is 32.4 per cent; at the Maribyrnong Ordnance Factory the incidence is 25.5 per cent and at the Small Arms Factory in Lithgow the incidence is 18.3 per cent. Yet when we look at the figures for the Department of Defence, we find that there is only a 3 per cent incidence among the defence forces. In other words, as I made the point when I was Chairman of the Waste Watch Committee, it is something like 10 times riskier, at least in terms of workers compensation, to work in a defence factory than it is to be in the defence forces. That seems to me to be absolutely ludicrous. Either it means that there is an extraordinary risk variation or, more likely, there is a far greater willingness to find accommodating doctors or extraordinarily bad work practices in that area. This ratio of workers compensation days is also excessively larger that the Australian National Railways Commission where the incidence rate is 21 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to deal very briefly with the annual report by the Attorney-General on the operation of the Bankruptcy Act 1966. I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that according to this report in the latest year there has been a 12.8 per cent increase in the total number of bankruptcies and orders for administration in Australia under this Government. This means that there were 8,124 bankruptcies in the latest financial year. This is an increase of something like 58 per cent since the Fraser Government's last year in office, which was massively drought affected. Many people went bankrupt because of the impact of the worst drought for about 50 years. This Government's bankruptcy level is four times the average under the Whitlam Government. Everyone knows what a disaster the Whitlam Government was, but to think that this is four times as much is absolutely incredible. Liabilities amounted to something like $511m and were covered by assets of only $62m, involving not only a massive economic cost but a large social cost as well. </PARA>
<PARA> I say once again, very briefly, that it is extraordinary to notice the disastrous level of people not engaged in remunerative employment who end up as personal bankrupts. It is extraordinary that 4,400 people were not engaged in any work yet were able to go into debt to such an extent that they became bankrupt, either suggesting there is an excessive level of selling of debt or people are behaving in an extraordinarily reckless way. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that there is also an extraordinary variation between the States in bankruptcy experience. Queensland and South Australia are extraordinary. In Queensland something like three times the number of business bankruptcies took place as took place in Victoria. In South Australia the amount was double. It seems to me that there is a very sound case for a far greater examination of the reasons why this Government has created an environment in which bankruptcies are four times the Whitlam average. This annual report in itself condemns this Government. </PARA>
