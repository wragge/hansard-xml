<TITLE>X-rated and Violent Video Material</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of citizens of Australia points out:</PARA>
<PARA> that all State Governments, State Attorneys-General, most women's groups and the majority of men in Australia, including significant numbers of members of Parliament, are totally opposed to the importation and distribution of `X' and excessively violent `R'-rated video pornography in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> that most `X'-rated material available in Australia is imported;</PARA>
<PARA> that the Federal Government, by its Customs power under the Constitution, and not the ACT Government, is solely responsible for controlling the importation of this pornographic material;</PARA>
<PARA> that by continuing to allow the importation of such pornographic material, the Federal Government is neglecting its responsibility to the women, children and families of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners, therefore, request the Senate to:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Ban `X'-rated pornographic material at the point of entry into Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Exclude from the `R'-rating all gratuitously violent material.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and the senators in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA>The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That every abortion kills an unborn human baby.</PARA>
<PARA> That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Government's first duty is to protect this right to life.</PARA>
<PARA> That the most defenceless and threatened lives are those of unborn babies for whom the Government is duty bound to take extra steps to protect.</PARA>
<PARA> That in 1987/88 taxpayers funds through Medicare provided medical benefits for 61,879 abortions totalling $6.4 million.</PARA>
<PARA> That in the same year Commonwealth grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State Public Hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will carry out its duty to protect the right to life of Australian babies by ceasing to fund abortions through Medicare, restricting grants to the States and by all other means at its disposal.</PARA>

<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>

<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>The Honourable President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA> Medicare cannot pretend to be a universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hardest hit by proposals to restrict access to items 6469, 274 and 275 on the Medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion.</PARA>

<PARA> We the undersigned Australian petitioners call on the Australian Government to take real steps to prevent the abuse of human rights of Aboriginals in prison and police custody.</PARA>
<PARA> A Royal Commission was set up to find out in general terms why so many Aborigines die in custody and the circumstances surrounding each death before the Commission. We the petitioners, would like to express the following concerns:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Aboriginal families and organisations have not received adequate funding from the Federal Government to ensure adequate representation. Yet the Commission faces constant challenge from the powerful police and prison officers' unions in their efforts to shut down the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA>2. The Royal Commission's interim report includes recommendations for changes in custodial practices. Yet only some of the recommendations have been implemented, and only in some places-no government body is monitoring the implementation and the deaths continue.</PARA>
<PARA>3. The occurrence of racist attacks, i.e. David Gundy was killed in his home by the Police SWOS. The Coroner's Court verdict on his killing was `death by accident'.</PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Part 2 of this Bill amends the Australian Industry Development Corporation Act 1970. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable Senators will recall that late last year they considered legislation which cleared the way for the re-organisation of the Australian Industry Development Corporation of the AIDC as it is otherwise known. </PARA>
<PARA> The re-organisation saw the bulk of the Corporation's business transferred to a new subsidiary company, AIDC Ltd. The new company was then listed on the Australian Stock Exchange and ultimately up to 30 per cent of its shares will be offered to the public. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of the re-organisation the Corporation was to carry out Treasury operations on behalf of AIDC Ltd, that is undertake borrowings, engage in interest rate, currency and foreign exchange agreements as well as futures contacts on behalf of the company. Such activities are categorised under the AIDC Act as non-transferring assets and liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Corporation was to remain the contracting party to such agreements it was always intended that the actual benefits and costs associated with these non-transferring assets and liabilities would be transferred to the subsidiary. </PARA>
<PARA> To reflect this position, it was decided to treat these non-transferring assets and liabilities that were in substance part of the transferred business, as being assets and liabilities of the subsidiary for income tax purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it has now become apparent that the earlier amendments to the AIDC Act fall short of achieving this result. Non-transferring assets arising out of the above exchange agreements etc. which were intended to be treated as assets of the subsidiary for tax purposes, have actually remained with the Corporation for such purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill seeks to amend the AIDC Act so that, for tax purposes, the relevant non-transferring assets are transferred to the subsidiary and the subsidiary is deemed to be in the same tax position in relation to the assets as the Corporation was prior to the transfer. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of the re-organisation was the transfer of the Corporation's staff to AIDC Ltd. This necessitates the broadening of the Corporation's and Chief Executive's delegation powers to include employees of the subsidiary. </PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of AIDC Ltd also saw the Government examine the Corporation's use of the Commonwealth guarantee. </PARA>
<PARA> While the subsidiary itself is not guaranteed, the Corporation will act as the borrowing vehicle for the company. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly it was decided to continue the Commonwealth's guarantee under an agreement entered into by the Corporation until 1 July 1994. </PARA>
<PARA> To remove the guarantee any earlier would have created an unacceptable degree of uncertainty not only for lenders to and other parties involved with the Corporation but also for the subsidiary as it tries to establish itself in the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth guarantee will continue to apply to borrowings and other obligations entered into by the Corporation before 1 July 1994 until their maturity. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments in regard to the taxation and delegation matters are to have a commencement date of 1 July 1989, which is the day the re-organisation of the AIDC took place. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment proposed by Part 3 of the Bill to section 4 (1) (a) of the Bounty Ships Act 1989 will expand the maximum size limit of bountiable vessels constructed or modified in Australia from the existing level of 10,000 gross construction tons (gct) to 20,000 gct. The existing level has been in place throughout the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for the proposed amendment is that conditions for shipbuilders have changed rapidly in the recent past with an improvement in the competitive position of local builders. There is now evidence that certain shipbuilders can be competitive in the international market in the size range of 15,000 gct to 20,000 gct and with bounty at the rate of 15 per cent of construction costs. The Government proposes that these larger shipbuilders should not be disadvantaged by exclusion from bounty when the opportunity arises to build larger vessels. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments made by Parts 4 and 7 of the Bill will result in more flexible administration of the Designs Act 1906 and the Trade Marks Act 1955. Although not momentous in nature, the changes will align some of the administrative provisions of the Patents Act, Trade Marks Act and Designs Act and update the penalties for committing offences against the Designs Act. Advances in administrative practice brought about by computerisation will be able to be more readily adopted in the Patent, Trade Marks and Designs Offices. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments are couched in the same straightforward drafting style of the Patents Bill 1989 which was introduced into the other place in June this year.</PARA>
<PARA> Minor amendments of the Patents Act 1952 and the Patents, Trade Marks, Designs and Copyright Act 1939 are made by Parts 5 and 6 of the Bill, respectively, to correct a drafting error and make a small number of consequential amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> No financial impact is expected to arise from these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to put arrangements in place for the provision of general purpose assistance to the States and the Northern Territory in 1989-90, consistent with the decisions taken at the May 1989 Premiers' Conference and Loan Council meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will replace the States Grants (General Revenue) Act 1988 and the States (Works and Housing) Assistance Act 1988. Both forms of general purpose assistance-general revenue grants and general purpose capital funds-are being provided under one Bill this year, because, as I will mention later, the arrangements for general purpose capital assistance are to be simplified in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> The current estimate of general purpose funding for the States and the Northern Territory under the Bill totals $13,135 million, or about 15 per cent of estimated Commonwealth Budget outlays in 1989-90. As such, these payments constitute a major element of the Commonwealth's Budget. In combination with the global borrowing limits agreed at the Loan Council meeting, they also have a major bearing on the spending and borrowing of State governments. </PARA>
<PARA> General purpose payments to the States and the Northern Territory are estimated to decline by around 3 per cent in real terms in 1989-90. While the real reduction in general purpose funding is less marked than in 1988-89, it will add to the effect of the significant reductions in payments to the States and global borrowing limits of recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> These reductions in payments and borrowings have been a key part of our strategy to ensure that all levels of Government in Australia contribute to fiscal restraint: something that is essential in order to reduce pressures on domestic demand and the current account deficit. As a result of the funding cuts agreed in the last few years, State spending has been more restrained. Together with the strong growth in the States' own revenues, this had led to a decline in the State sector's net borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA> Further restraint in State budgetary policies, however, is required. The level of payments provided for in this Bill will help ensure that the States continue to share in the burden of restraint. </PARA>
<PARA>General Revenue Grants</PARA>
<PARA> Most of the assistance to be provided under this Bill is in the form of general revenue grants, which are currently estimated to be $12,825 million in 1989-90. The vast bulk of this amount comprises financial assistance grants, but it also includes special revenue assistance to the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> At the May 1989 Premiers' Conference, it was agreed that the pool of financial assistance grants in 1989-90 would be determined on the basis of a reduction from the forward estimates at the time of:</PARA>
<PARA>$550 million in savings; and</PARA>
<PARA>a further $45 million to fund the special revenue assistance for the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>This implies a reduction of $595 million in financial assistance grants, but net savings from the forward estimates of general revenue grants of $550 million. Consistent with the arrangements in 1988-89, both financial assistance grants and special revenue assistance are to be adjusted for the difference between the actual increase in the CPI in the year to the March quarter 1990 and the forecast at the time of the Premiers' Conference, so that the real level of assistance agreed at the Conference is maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> The distribution of financial assistance grants is to be determined on the basis of per capita relativities determined by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in its ``Report on General Revenue Grant Relativities, 1989 Update''. As in 1988-89, the relativities are applied to a combined pool of financial assistance and hospital funding grants. However, in 1989-90 the entire `incentives' component of hospital funding grants and certain penalty provision adjustments are to be excluded from the pool of funds to which the per capita relativities apply, whereas only funding for AIDS was excluded in 1988-89. These amounts are excluded from the calculations so that they are distributed on the basis of specific factors such as the State by State incidence of AIDS cases, rather than the relativities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill includes provisions for each State's financial assistance grants to be reduced so as to recoup 90 per cent of the additional revenue available to the States and the Northern Territory as a result of the removal from 1989 of exemptions for Telecom, Australia Post and the OTC from a range of State taxes and charges such as stamp duty and land tax. It is estimated that the additional savings to the Commonwealth from this measure will be about $70 million. Because the States will retain 10 per cent of the additional collections, the net effect of this measure will be to enhance their fiscal capacity. Similar arrangements applied in 1988-89 when the Commonwealth recouped 90 per cent of the extra revenue accruing to the States as a result of removing the exemptions from payroll tax for a number of Commonwealth business enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision is also included in the Bill to make appropriate minor adjustments to financial assistance grants in 1989-90 and the base level of assistance in respect of the recoupment of payroll tax paid by business enterprises for 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> As noted earlier, the Northern Territory is to be provided with special revenue assistance in 1989-90 at a base level of $45 million. Four States, including the Territory, received special revenue assistance in 1988-89 to ease the adjustment to reduced levels of funding and the new per capita relativities. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will continue to move the Northern Territory to a financial basis comparable with the States. If special revenue assistance to the Northern Territory had been terminated in 1989-90, however, the Territory would have experienced a substantial fall in its general revenue grants. </PARA>
<PARA>General Purpose Capital Grants</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the payment of $310.5 million in interest free capital grants to the States and the Northern Territory. This is the same amount provided as grants in 1988-89 under the States (Works and Housing) Assistance Act 1988 and is to be distributed on the same basis as in 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> The arrangements proposed for 1988-90 do not, as in previous years, provide for concessional loans for public housing. These loans are being replaced by additional grants under the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement (CSHA). These additional grants amount to $310.5 million, the same amount as the concessional loans provided in 1988-89, and will be distributed on the same basis. The distribution of the new grants will be adjusted over the period to 1992-93 to correspond with that for other general housing assistance under the CSHA. Providing these funds as grants rather than as repayable advances increases the value of the payment to the States and should allow them to provide additional assistance to the public housing sector. </PARA>
<PARA> One further change from the arrangements put in place last year is that under this Bill the payment of general purpose assistance has not been made conditional on State observance of the global borrowing limits. Such a provision was included in the States Grants (General Revenue) Act 1988 in response to the refusal of Queensland to agree to the resolution of Loan Council which set the limits, for 1988-89. All States have agreed to the resolution for 1989-90. However, should any State in the future fail to commit itself to the global limits or fail to use its best endeavours to observe them, the Government would be prepared to propose the reintroduction of the provision to this or future legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> No provision is made in this Bill for payments of general purpose assistance to the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). However, provisions in Appropriation Bill No. 2 allow for analogous payments to be made to the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is an integral part of the Commonwealth's financial relations with State Governments and the Budget. I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the related explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA> That the report be adopted. </PARA>
<PARA>This report is the fourth report of the Committee concerning a matter raised by a person under Privilege Resolution 5 of 25 February 1988. On 25 September 1989, the President, in accordance with Resolution 5, considered two letters from Sir Charles Court relating to remarks made by the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) during Question Time on 6 September, and referred the letters to the Committee of Privileges as a submission under Resolution 5. The Committee decided to consider the submission, and wrote to Sir Charles Court asking him to provide a response, based on his submission, which the Committee could recommend for incorporation in Hansard. Sir Charles responded to the Committee on 4 October. The Committee recommends that the response included in the Committee's report, which has been agreed to by Sir Charles Court and the Committee, be incorporated in Hansard. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>PURSUANT TO RESOLUTION 5 (7) (b) OF THE SENATE OF 25 FEBRUARY 1988</PARA>
<PARA>I consider the remarks by Senator Walsh in the Senate on 6th September, 1989 about me and the North West Shelf Natural Gas Project to be both offensive and inaccurate. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not the first time Senator Walsh has used the privileges of Parliament to inaccurately and unfairly attack me and my part in the project. </PARA>
<PARA>The pertinent matters to prove Senator Walsh wrong are:</PARA>
<PARA>The North West Shelf Natural Gas Project is Australia's biggest ever single energy project. This was in spite of attempts to thwart it by the Whitlam Government. These attempts caused serious disruptions to the construction timetables and costs. They also had serious consequences for the timing of the marketing of the domestic and export natural gas. </PARA>
<PARA>It has given Australia a huge supply of environmentally effective clean energy for domestic and export purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>It has been the salvation of the Western Australian economy over the last six years, pumping money into W.A. at rates up to $4 million a day. </PARA>
<PARA>It has created many thousands of employment positions both directly and indirectly and has generated many new and sophisticated skills which are available for future use in Australia on petroleum and other projects including overseas engineering contracts. </PARA>
<PARA>It has developed standards of safety on construction work never previously achieved in Australia thus setting a pattern for the future. </PARA>
<PARA>As a result of the take or pay agreement negotiated by the Government I led and the SEC of W.A., there was early access to large quantities of condensates extracted from the natural gas in Pilbara thus creating export income and import offsets ahead of the LNG export phase. </PARA>
<PARA>The take or pay contract for domestic gas was a catalyst for this project to develop domestic gas quickly and make it possible for the LNG export phase to be proceeded with on the timetable which has been achieved. In addition it hastened the time for substantial royalties to flow to both Commonwealth and State Governments. </PARA>
<PARA> The LNG export phase had commenced with Japanese contract commitments which will build up to exports of $2 billion a year or the equivalent of another wheat, wool or iron ore cheque for W.A.-with more to follow. </PARA>
<PARA> Without this take or pay contract for domestic gas no export LNG phase-desperately needed by Australia-would have been possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Take or pay contracts are normal arrangements and in the interests of both parties. </PARA>
<PARA> The contract was not responsible, as the Senator suggests, for ``a $1 billion plus bill, because of this contract, which a megalomaniac who happened to be the Premier at the time, back in the late 1970's, had forced the State Electricity Commission Commissioners to sign.''</PARA>
<PARA> Likewise, equally false is Senator Walsh's other claim- `` . . . the Western Australian Government requested some financial relief from the Commonwealth because of the disastrous consequences of the take or pay contract that that pompous old fraud Charles Court signed some eight or nine years ago''. </PARA>
<PARA> There was no direction or pressure applied to the State Electricity Commission to sign this agreement in the negotiation of which they were fully involved and were acquiescent. It was a logical extension of their energy commitments to the State. </PARA>
<PARA> Any deal worked out in 1984/85 between the Federal and W.A. (Burke) Governments in respect of the project was entirely between the two Labor Governments of the time and not because of the agreement negotiated by my Government and SEC. </PARA>
<PARA> No such negotiations with the Commonwealth Government would have been necessary nor would have taken place had I contained in Office and not retired from Parliament in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreement my Government and the SEC negotiated had ample provision for renegotiation with the Joint venturers if circumstances changed. Above all it provided for the domestic gas to remain competitive against coal and oil. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only assume the Commonwealth/State 1984/85 negotiations took place because of inexperience on the part of the Burke Government and an over reaction to one of the aberrations that periodically and inevitably occur within the economy-particularly commodity markets for natural resources and energy. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than have any long term accumulating debt from the take or pay domestic gas contract due to temporarily not being able to take contract quantities, I understand SEC is already taking its full contract figure. It is also drawing on some of the initial build up of natural gas inventory. </PARA>
<PARA> As further evidence of the wisdom of the original take or pay Contract entered into, the present Western Australian Government is exhorting companies to find and develop more gas; ways of increasing the capacity of the pipeline to deliver additional gas are also being actively pursued. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of what the Senator infers, gas paid for and taken into inventory is not lost to SEC. It is drawn upon when demand arises thus greatly improving the SEC cash flow in those years when the gas is taken from inventory-as originally envisaged. It is also realistic to assume the gas will yield higher prices to SEC in years of sale as against the time it was paid for and taken into inventory. </PARA>
<PARA> Had I not encouraged the negotiation of the take or pay agreement with the full support of the Government I led I would have been justifiably criticised today as a person of no vision and no faith in our State and the nation's future. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh apparently is not aware of the comments made at the University of W.A. in 1983 after Premier Burke and his Government had been fully briefed on the project. Amongst other things he said, ``This project is absolutely stunning''. He reiterated this and more in eulogy of the project when he launched the official start of the domestic gas operations in 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh also said about me, ``the Western Australian politician who engineered the greatest losses ever inflicted upon the taxpayers and consumers of Western Australia is the same Western Australian politician who is now being holier than thou and conspiring with a number of other people in Perth in an attempt to crucify the State Government for having made some mistakes . . .''. </PARA>
<PARA> This is both offensive and wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> The first part of this statement in respect to the alleged losses has been answered earlier in this submission. </PARA>
<PARA> The reference to ``Conspiring'' has been proved completely false. The W.A. Government tried a similar claim under the privileges of Parliament. There never has been any conspiring by me as has also been confirmed by the other parties wrongly accused. </PARA>
<PARA> The limited reply that Resolution No. 5 apparently permits makes it well nigh impossible for a person attacked in such a manner by Senator Walsh to adequately reply. However, I tender the foregoing in good faith hoping it can be recorded in the proceedings and Hansard of the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the following matters be referred to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry and report on or before the first day of sitting in 1990:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the nature of the fiduciary relationship that exists at law between a bank and its clients;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the practical implications of that relationship for the purposes of a bank's day-to-day dealings with its clients;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the avenues of redress that may be open to a client who considers that a bank is in breach of its fiduciary obligations;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) whether any current or recent practices by banks may be viewed as contravening their fiduciary duties to clients; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the extent of any such practices and the action that should be taken by the Government to prevent them and compensate those adversely affected by them. </PARA>
<PARA>Legal and Constitutional Affairs</PARA>
<PARA>To translate this motion into layman's terms, it simply proposes that, in the interests of the average Australian, there now be a general inquiry into the manner in which banks are conducting themselves in Australia today. This is not a new proposal; it is a proposal which I have been addressing conscientiously in this chamber for almost 15 months. It is only a slight variation on a specific proposition which I put to the Senate in April and which was defeated by the combined vote of the Government and the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The long and the short of it is that we are saying that it is time for a cold, detached and objective look at what is happening in Australian banking today. We do not pretend for one moment that the Subcommittee of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs will have either the time or the resources to undertake the in-depth examination that we believe is justified, but we sense that this is the most appropriate first step. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this reference to the Committee is simply to establish whether there is a prima facie case for a more comprehensive inquiry into banking in Australia today. I am sure that the Senate is aware that there has not been such a comprehensive inquiry into banking in Australia since the 1930s. I am sure that the Senate is aware that the focus of this inquiry is the fundamental fiduciary relationship which exists in law between a bank and its client. In layman's terms a `fiduciary relationship' means that there is an obligation upon a bank to consider the interests of its client equal to that of its own. </PARA>
<PARA> Historically and traditionally, there are those who would have said that Australians could have had confidence that their banks were pursuing their interests as vigorously as they were pursuing their own. However, since deregulation of the banking system in this country-and deregulation occurred in 1984-85-we believe that there is clear evidence that the whole ethos of banking has changed dramatically and has swung in favour of the banks and that the banks are exploiting this new climate in a greedy manner which is unprecedented in Australia's history and which makes them the world's greediest banks. Those who are disadvantaged by this new ethos of banking are the average Australian and the average Australian family. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, this proposition for such an investigation was placed before the Senate by me in April and defeated then by the combined vote of the Government and the Opposition. So I suppose the question can reasonably be posed: why bring it back? Has the situation changed in six months? I believe it has changed quite dramatically. There has been an enormous shift in public opinion about banking in this country in the six months since this proposition was discussed in April. I do not believe that a single senator or Federal parliamentarian can deny that. It has in fact been acknowledged in the other place by Government members in recent weeks. It has been the subject of some considerable debate within Government ranks in recent weeks. In fact, the Government was on the verge of having such an inquiry, but it backed away from an inquiry for reasons I will discuss in greater detail shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> Why has there been a build-up of animosity within the Australian community about banking? Certainly a good deal of media attention has been attracted to banking in the last six to eight months. Today we shall hear the argument advanced by both the Government and the Opposition that this theme is purely and simply a populist theme promoted by the Australian Democrats, specifically by me, in order to capture some pre-election interest. They are right, of course: It is absolutely vital that this matter be brought before the Australian public in a pre-election context. It is absolutely vital that the Government be made to face the issue in the few months before an election. It is absolutely vital that the Opposition be called upon to state its position on this crucial matter. If `populist' means an acknowledgment of the fact that in the community there are people who have a burning concern about this issue, it is a populist issue. They are the sorts of issues which should be precisely those that are being addressed vigorously, conscientiously and with genuine intention, by parliamentarians in the period immediately prior to an election. So if that is the definition of `populist', this is indeed a very populist issue. </PARA>
<PARA> But there is more to it than that. It has been said that we are into bank bashing. What is bank bashing? If it means being critical of the greediest banking system in the world, then we are into bank bashing. If it means acknowledging that the banking system has abandoned the interests of its clients in pursuit of its own profits, then okay, we are into bank bashing. Indeed, the banks are bashing Australians out of business and out of their homes. I believe it is genuine retaliation. It is an appeal, through the only means available to them-an appeal to their elected representatives. It is a response from genuinely exploited, persecuted and downgraded average Australians and their families to a banking system which is running riot in this deregulated state. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a growing awareness of the degree of greed being displayed by banks. It is an extraordinary degree of greed, which I will elaborate on in a moment. There is a growing awareness that banks are enjoying what they themselves call super profits. There is an interest in how they arrive at these super profits. I think there is a return to an examination of the very nature of banking. We are all aware that during the 1920s and 1930s, during the period of the social credit movement or Douglas credit, there was a burning concern in communities about the very nature and the power of banks. </PARA>
<PARA> Look at just how powerful, in the crudest basic way, these institutions are. In the first place, they have the power to create credit or money. Credit is the positive side of the entry that goes into the ledger. To extend credit to a client is a nice positive sounding phrase. But what the banks are actually doing is extending a debt to a client; they are inviting a client to enter into a substantial debt. So the first power of the banks is to create credit or to create debt in the community. They have created massive debt in our community; the debts of ordinary Australians, the debts of families and the debts of businesses are substantially created deliberately by banks. </PARA>
<PARA> The second aspect of banking is that the debt then has to be serviced in the form of interest payments. If we are talking about a mortgage, the interest payment is from 17 running through to possibly 18 per cent. One might be lucky, if one borrowed a few years ago, to have an interest rate held at 13 1/2 per cent. So one services one's mortgage, overdraft, personal loan and every debt through interest payments of a magnitude probably somewhere between 18 per cent and 30 per cent. These are absolutely undreamt of levels of interest rates. Ten years ago it would have been inconceivable that we would now be servicing this vast national debt at these levels of interest-basically with the interests of only the banks at heart. </PARA>
<PARA> The third aspect-this is the most devastating power of the banks-is that if people cannot continue to service that debt, as many Australians now cannot, the banks can move to foreclose on them, taking their homes, businesses, assets and the lot. I was sent a tape the other day with the title I want the earth plus 5%. It is about the attitude today of the greedy banks in Australia and internationally. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a growing awareness that banks are all-powerful. There is also a growing awareness that they are running riot and bleeding us white. That awareness expresses itself in the form of foreclosure on assets. I had a conversation with a farmer about five minutes before I came into this chamber this morning. He was saying, basically, `Can't you do anything because I am going to lose the farm this week?'. There are literally thousands of Australian primary producers in such a position. So there is a growing awareness and a growing concern about this extraordinary power of the banks. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, deregulation was supposed to make banking more competitive. If you and I, Madam Acting Deputy President, were competing in the market-place we would normally do so by offering our services at reduced price. The banks have not done that. They behave like a cartel even though that is prohibited under the Trade Practices Act. Although they will deny it, this group of people, through deliberate collusion, actually puts its prices up. If we watch the behaviour of the banks we can suspect only that there is a cartel operating because, if one puts up its charges or its rate of interest, sometimes within hours and certainly within days not only will competing banks, their competitors, do the same thing but so, subsequently, will building societies, credit unions and virtually all other financiers in this country. That is cartel-like behaviour even though the banks will deny it. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the ethos of banking in a deregulated banking system has dramatically changed and essentially it is about profit making. Is there any evidence that this profiteering is running riot? Let us look at the profits of banks in just the last 15 to 18 months. In the last financial year all major banks in Australia announced record profits. They called them, in their own terms, `super profits'. In a confidential memo, the manager of finance in the National Australia Bank Ltd, Mr Argus, expressed embarrassment about these super profits and said, `Under no circumstances must certain information be made available in the context of these embarrassingly high profits'. But that was last financial year. We have now seen the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the people's bank, announce an increase in profits of 74 per cent. That was in the same fortnight that it put out its hand to take a portion of the $200m subsidy from the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to make it appear as though it was keeping down its mortgage rate and really holding the interest of Australian families first and foremost. So the banks took $200m in taxpayers' money from the same people who were being leached by interest rates in the first place. That happened in the same month that the Managing Director of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia was reappointed at a salary of $250,000 a year-a 100 per cent increase in salary. This is the ethos of banking in Australia in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This is the deregulated, out of control, profiteering, greedy banking ethos that we are confronted with in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the Argus memo which I have tabled in the Senate. It revealed not only the super profits in the banking industry, and the embarrassment thereof, but also other things which were happening in the banking industry. Above all, my point is that it is irrefutable that the fundamental fiduciary relationship between banker and client has been dramatically changed and eroded under deregulated banking. This matter requires investigation. Such an investigation is included in the terms of reference of the motion which I have put before the Senate today. The banks have enormous dimensions of greed. We ask ourselves: How are they making the super profits? They make them by operating at profit margins which are twice the level that is acceptable to international banks in Switzerland and other similar banks overseas. In other words, Australia's banks are copping it easy, to a point where they are laughing at us. They are operating at profit margins which are twice the level of those which are considered to be economically acceptable to similar banks in other Western economies. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to bank charges, we really do not know what banks are charging us. Hopefully, very soon it will be obligatory for banks to state their range of charges and their rates. I will refer to some examples. We know that banks actually charge people to operate small accounts. There was a time when the banks paid to attract such deposits, but now the banks charge people for making small deposits and holding small accounts. I refer to some extraordinary examples of the ethos of bank charging. One example of a miscellaneous bank charge-and that is what it is shown as on most bank statements-was for an amount of $28,000 that appeared on a corporate account fairly recently. Admittedly it was a huge account, but that was the amount of the miscellaneous bank charge. When it was queried, the bank said, `Sorry, it is a mistake, forget it'. So the company was told to forget a $28,000 mistake. If the bank had got away with it, it would have a beautiful windfall, would it not?</PARA>
<PARA> A businessman in Tasmania with whom I spoke recently operates three business accounts at the same branch. He has queried the last 35 miscellaneous bank charges on those three accounts. They have all been withdrawn because the bank could not explain them or justify them. A woman in Tasmania thought she had made arrangements for an account in Melbourne to be transferred to a Hobart branch. The bank said that the arrangements would be made. She went ahead and drew eight cheques, none of which was for more than $40. They were all bounced and there was a $25 fee for each of the eight bounced cheques. Does that suggest that the banks are considering the interests of their clients as being equal to their own?</PARA>
<PARA> Another example is that of a pensioner who was charged $15 for forgetting to put his signature on a cheque. It would have cost the bank 41c to advise him of the error by mail, or less by phone, but it charged him $15. Is that an example of banks considering the interests of a client as being equal to their own? Another extraordinary example is that of a gentleman who pursued the matter of bank fees for two years. He said, `Tell me what these fees are'. Eventually he received a letter from his bank, after two years, which said, `If you persist in asking us about these fees we will send the matter to our lawyer and the legal fee will be charged to your account without redress'. Is that an example of the fiduciary relationship? It is an example of how banks see that relationship today. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most pathetic of all examples is the one that was quoted in the local press 10 or 12 months ago. A young child went into the local branch of a bank with a piggy bank, it was opened and counted, and the child was charged 10 per cent of the contents of that piggy bank for the process of opening and counting it. Is this an example of the ethos of banking in Australia today? It does not matter whether we are talking about $28,000 mistakes in miscellaneous bank charges or a child's piggy bank. It is all an expression of exactly the same mentality and attitude in banking in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA> The great concern in the community today is interest rates because that is where it hurts most. Who knows what interest people are paying to banks? Most people do not know. The Argus memo which I referred to earlier-the confidential memo from the finance manager of the National Australia Bank to his State managers-revealed that he did not know what interest rates were charged on overdrafts. It was a memo about the discrepancies between loadings that were put on overdrafts. It revealed the fact that the National Australia Bank branch managers put a loading varying between about 2 per cent and almost 10 per cent on top of the base rate of 18.25 per cent. The Argus memo said, `We didn't know this. We are now telling you and we are telling you it's bad news because it projects a bad image, particularly in the light of these embarrassingly high super profits. Above all, we must make sure that this does not get out and about because it is bad for our image'. What image? The image of the fiduciary relationship? Of course it was bad for it. The long and the short of it is that most of us do not know what interest rates we are paying to banks at any time. </PARA>
<PARA> We can all cast our minds back to our primary school education when we first started to do interest calculations. We needed to know three things to find out how much interest was paid. We needed to know the amount on which it was being paid, the rate at which it was being paid and the period over which it was being paid. Most of us do not know any of those three things about the interest we are paying to our banks. We pick up our bank statement and it says, `Bank interest-X number of dollars'. Interest at what rate, on what sum and over what period? We do not know. The bank never tells us. The bank could not give a damn. It just writes a figure in. The realities are that the banks are running riot and the Government knows it. That is why the chairman of the relevant committee in the other place recommended an inquiry. The Opposition knows it but it is not going to acknowledge it. The community knows it. It knows that the banks are running riot and enjoying super profits but it would prefer to address the technical questions of banking-the interface between the management of the economy and the banks-all of which are very serious, challenging and relevant questions but they are not the questions I am posing. The question I am posing is not the relationship between banks and this economy or the world economy but the interface between banks and ordinary everyday Australians. The nature of that relationship as it is stated in law is what we are asking to be investigated. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not even touched on the matters of allegations of malpractice and corruption which I have brought into this place week after week and the parallel allegations of neglected duty by the Australian Federal Police in investigating those matters. I have not even mentioned those issues at this stage. That is another vast area which has to be investigated if we are really going to look at what is happening in banking in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA> What have been the reactions to the suggestion of an inquiry into banking? The Australian Bankers Association says that an inquiry is not necessary, that I am exaggerating, that there is no corruption in banking and that banking is squeaky clean. That is about as credible as my saying that there is no corruption in politics or the police saying that there is no corruption in the police force. It is a farcical response. It is a ludicrous response to what clearly are justifiable concerns within the community. The banks accuse me of not doing my homework. I have done thousands of hours of homework in relation to the issue. They accuse me of not providing any evidence. I have come here week after week tabling the evidence of what is happening out there. The media have reacted. They believe that there is a real issue in banking in Australia and they have been pursuing it, albeit often at their own legal peril, for the last few months. </PARA>
<PARA> The community is aware of the fact that there is a problem out there. That is why it is getting behind me and forming a Bankwatch in Perth, Adelaide, Leeton, Albury, Nowra, Sydney and Brisbane. We are forming groups called Bankwatch to insist that the process of examination continue. Even local governments are now aware of the problem. They have written me a letter expressing support for the concept of an investigation. I have a letter from the Conargo Shire Council over the signature of the Shire Clerk, which passes on to me a number of recent resolutions of that Council supporting an investigation. The second resolution says:</PARA>
<PARA> RESOLVED . . . [to] support action investigated by Senator P McLean (Democrat), Mr S Martin, MP (Labor) and Mr R. Price, MP (Labor) calling for an inquiry into finance and banking; that additionally, Council support moves for an independent Committee to be set up to investigate the role of banking and finance in Australia and that Council indicate the intent of both this motion and motion no. 179 to Senator McLean, Mr Martin, MP, and Mr Price, MP. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, two of those people were interested for a couple of weeks but, as soon as the pressure came on from within the ranks of government to back off the issue, all of a sudden I was left in splendid isolation as the one proposing a bank inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Stone. It could well be my fate in life and it is one that I am prepared to pursue. Why has the Government reacted in the way it has? Its backbenchers have said, `For heaven's sake, do you realise what is out there in the community about banking?'. That has been the cry. Then, of course, there was the possibility of the Government actually creating an inquiry. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) said, `Good grief, do we really want this? Do we really want to expose the realities of a deregulated banking system?'. He said, `I am the architect of this deregulated system. I am the one who has been singing its praises and putting the final pieces in place'-through legislation that passed through this Senate two days ago. He said, `This is the model which is supported by the Opposition and which will remain in place in Australian banking possibly for decades. Do we really want the truth about this investigated and revealed? The Government backbenchers backed away as quickly as a snap of the fingers. There is not enough moral courage in the Parliament to take on the banks. It is as simple as that. The banks are the most powerful institutions in the land and there is grave reluctance to challenge them about their ethos, their modus operandi, their profiteering and their exploitation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So there was a reversal. For about 10 days we had a possibility of a bank inquiry on our hands. Panic broke out among the banks and then finally in the Treasury and within the Caucus, and the Government backed off. The Opposition's reaction has been superficial. The last time the matter was debated in this chamber it said that a lot of the cases were sub judice and that we could not interfere with the processes of law. The majority of them are not sub judice. The reality is that there will always be some disputes between a client and a bank before the courts. Of course, one does not interfere in cases which are sub judice, but there is a lot more which one should investigate and interfere with which are not sub judice. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we will hear the populist argument trotted out by both the Government and the Opposition. Of course, this is a populist cause. It is populist causes which should be addressed by the Government and by the alternative government. The fact that the Australian Democrats are the only ones who are prepared to make it a populist cause, and pursue it as such, is something of which we are proud. If the Government wants to base its redress on that, and respond at that level, it is politically naive. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, what we are really doing is continuing to blow up a storm. As I say at every public meeting I address on this and other issues, politicians-all of us-are fickle. That is the nature of politics. We have to respond to storms and winds. That is what democracy is-people blowing up storms and their representatives responding. Perhaps we have to blow up a huge storm about banking so that eventually a government which has got enough moral courage, short term or long term-or an alternative government which has got enough moral courage-will bend to the wind and begin the process of returning to sanity and justice by setting up an inquiry, albeit relatively briefly, to establish a prima facie case and recommend to the Parliament a suitable structure to investigate, and reveal to Australians, that the fiduciary capacity of banks to truly pursue the interests of Australians has long since collapsed, and that something desperately needs to be done about it. That is the intent of this motion. I wait anxiously to hear the response from the Government which accepts this at heart. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McLean has unashamedly said in this Senate that he is pursuing a populist cause. There is no need for us to denigrate the idea that elected representatives of the people try to bring to the attention of a chamber such as the Senate a matter of great concern to many people. No doubt there are grave misgivings among members of the community-some more explicit than others-and maybe it is true that there is a general unease about the way in which banking and financial institutions are conducting themselves, which generates considerable profits for their shareholders to whom they also have a duty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is easy to see why those who fall foul of a particular branch manager over a particular transaction gather together in meetings, such as those which Senator McLean addresses, and call for an inquiry of some sort into the banking industry. My distaste for Senator McLean's performance here today is not so much because he is trying to represent those Australians who feel hurt in some way by the actions of the banking sector, but because he holds out a false hope in his motion which he has brought to the Senate today. The expectations that he thereby arouses cannot be fulfilled, as one can see from looking through the terms of his motion. He is being extremely cruel and heartless in pretending that he can come into this chamber and, if he got this motion passed by the Senate, would resolve the hurt and undo the damage that some people may consider they have suffered at the hands of their bankers. It is for holding out that false hope that I condemn Senator McLean who, on this issue, has become an obsessive figure. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice he came up again with a charge against the Australian Federal Police that members have been involved in some sort of cover-up in relation to the matters which he has brought to the attention of the Senate. I have explained to the Senate on several occasions how all the matters tabled by Senator McLean have been considered quite properly by the Federal Police in the only way open to them, that is, to consider whether any criminal charges might be properly laid as a result of the information which he has tabled; and the Federal Police have said that there are no such cases. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that is his current obsession. I have repudiated and rebutted here in the Senate his allegation against the Federal Police, whom he has virtually accused over many months of engaging in some sort of grand conspiracy, particularly with Don Sanders, the esteemed Managing Director of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, in a way which has led us, he would claim, to a cover-up of serious criminal activity, because it is only serious criminal activity-breaches of Federal laws-that the Federal Police can properly investigate. Indeed, as he would now surely concede, most of the matters that he raises are matters to be dealt with in the civil jurisdiction of appropriate courts. I will come to that in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator McLean continues with this baseless allegation, this repudiated allegation. But that is only a side issue; it is not actually part of his motion. His motion is not concerned with criminal charges; it is concerned with fiduciary duty. I will speak about that in a moment. It is the false hope that he holds out to these many hundreds of Australians-perhaps to a wider group of Australians, numbering tens or hundreds of thousands-who feel some hurt and who have misgivings that I find most objectionable. One immediate indication of the false hope is that Senator McLean, in putting this motion to refer certain matters to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, asks it to conduct an inquiry and report on or before the first day of sitting in 1990. In other words, he is saying to the Australian people that the Senate Committee can undertake this huge inquiry, which it would be, consider and deliberate and produce a report by the first sitting day of 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Everyone in the Senate chamber who knows the tremendous load being undertaken by that Committee under the distinguished chairmanship of Senator Barney Cooney of Victoria would know that that is quite unreasonable. It could never possibly be achieved. I have had a look at the list; there are five or six major inquiries being undertaken, including the cost of legal services and litigation in Australia today. That is a huge inquiry in itself which we know will consume the attention and the resources of that Committee for many, many months-well into the next calendar year. Yet Senator McLean, in his populist way-he says that that term has a certain political dignity, and I will concede that for a moment-says that he can organise a Senate committee to discharge its responsibilities in a considered and proper way by the first sitting day of 1990 in relation to his proposed limited inquiry into certain aspects of the way the banking industry relates to individual clients. It is utterly unable to be achieved; it is a false hope. Senator McLean is to be condemned really for that alone. People will not find quick answers presented by a Senate committee by the due reporting date that he suggests. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter concerning false hope is this: part (e) of this motion states that the Committee should require and report on:</PARA>
<PARA>the extent of any such practices-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, practices which contravene fiduciary duties-</PARA>
<PARA>and the action that should be taken by the Government to prevent them and compensate those adversely affected by them. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator McLean is holding out the hope that the Committee will recommend to the Government that those who have been adversely affected by a breach of fiduciary duty should be compensated. He must know, as every honourable senator must know, that there is no way in which the Senate Committee can award compensation; there is no way in which it can direct that compensation to be paid. The most it could do, if it were appropriate-I will argue that in a moment-in particular cases brought to its attention would be to suggest some payment, though on what basis I do not know. If there is a breach of fiduciary duty between a bank and a client, quite clearly the duty to pay compensation or damages, as it is more properly known, would rest on the bank. For the taxpayers of Australia to bear some cost in settling the result of that breach of fiduciary duty would be quite extraordinary. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean is going out to these hustings and to these public meetings and saying to people who are concerned or to individuals who write to him or who call on him in his many thousands of hours of homework that he undertakes obsessively on this issue, `Look, I am going to set up a Senate committee and if it finds that you have been adversely dealt with by the bank in breach of its fiduciary duty'-which somehow the committee will determine-`I will make sure that that committee gets you some compensation from the taxpayers of Australia'. That is an extraordinary proposition and one which I think is completely unfair and cruel to the people concerned because, once again, it is a hope that cannot be fulfilled. The committee can merely recommend and indicate whether it is appropriate. Of course, it is utterly inappropriate that that should occur. That is part of the false hope that Senator McLean is holding out and which makes the term `populist' have the sort of colouring and the degenerate political qualities that are usually associated with it. </PARA>
<PARA> Were I to have been prepared to accept the term `populist' earlier in good faith as merely representing a storm of public opinion, when we get to the stage that Senator McLean has reached on those two issues alone-the reporting date and holding out the hope of compensation-I now say populism, in the more traditionally adverse sense of the word, is properly applied to Senator McLean. I do not like to make these debates personal but I believe that Senator McLean is misleading people in a grievous manner which will hurt them.</PARA>
<PARA> I will just ask a little more about how this committee will operate. The term `compensation' is spoken about. Senator McLean's motion talks about compensating those adversely affected by breaches of fiduciary duty. Compensation is a term which we more commonly think of in terms of damages; that is, a way of assessing the real impact, the real hurt and the real economic disadvantage which has been suffered by a person as a result of the breach of fiduciary duty. It has to be measured in some way. It has to be established that there has been a breach of fiduciary duty and then there has to be a measurement of the damages. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean is apparently expecting that people will-as they must because of the way in which he is generating false hopes-come before the committee and state their case. Somehow the committee will have to act in the role of a court and make a determination as to whether there has been a breach of fiduciary duty and whether compensation might be awarded. That is not a proper role for a Senate committee. Senator McLean said, `I brought this up in April; I am bringing it up again because great things have happened in the last six months'. He did not mention two things which have happened in the last six months. One is the decision by the banking sector to set up the office of banking ombudsman. I will elaborate on that in a moment. In the half hour allocated to him, Senator McLean did not mention-I wonder whether he mentions it when he goes to various public meetings around Australia-that the office of banking ombudsman has been established. I wonder also whether he has mentioned that in the last several weeks there have been very interesting decisions by the Federal Court of Australia indicating how banks owe fiduciary duty to their clients, for example, particularly in relation to the Swiss francs business which has been one of the catalysts for the concerns in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that Senator McLean will have a clipping of all matters relating to banking but he did not appear to bring this one into the chamber. I read an article in the 2-3 September issue of the Weekend Australian that stated:</PARA>
<PARA> A company developer yesterday successfully rejected a claim by Westpac Banking Corporation that he pay about $800,000 losses incurred when the Australian dollar fell against the Swiss franc in 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> In the second foreign currency loan case Westpac has lost this year in the Federal Court, Justice Foster yesterday in Sydney found Mr Barry Lee, then manager of the Liverpool and Castlereagh streets branch of the bank had been negligent when he told Mr Charles Henry Spice there was `no catch' in an off-shore loan. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Justice Foster found that the bank, through its officers, was in breach of the common law duty of care and their conduct was misleading or deceptive under the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA> He ordered the bank to accept $800,000 in full settlement. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, many of the matters which Senator McLean raised earlier this year concerning those sorts of foreign currency loans have been addressed in the proper forum: the court. The court has made its findings on the facts but in relation to the law which it has further explained and clarified in its relation to this question of Swiss franc loan losses. Of course, there will be cases where claims are dismissed by the court. In fact, a report in today's Age states:</PARA>
<PARA>A Melbourne businessman who lost $336,510 in a loan in Swiss francs yesterday lost a claim against the National Australia Bank in the Supreme Court. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Justice Tadgell dismissed all the claims, ruling that the bank had discharged its duty to warn of the risks in a foreign currency loan. </PARA>
<PARA>But is not that the proper forum? Is that not the way in which these matters should be investigated?</PARA>
<PARA> There is another forum in which some claims might be properly looked at. The banking ombudsman may provide that forum. Senator McLean studiously avoided mentioning this innovation which, once again, will be found in any file that he might have compiled in his office in relation to banking matters. For example, if one picks up the Australian Financial Review of 24 October this year, one finds the following under the heading `Bank ombudsman to decide on what's fair' by Richard Brass:</PARA>
<PARA>Banks will be liable for claims of up to $100,000 from aggrieved consumers under the terms of reference of the banking industry ombudsman scheme, released yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA>Does Senator McLean have that release? Has he examined it? The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Funded by the banks themselves and modelled largely on the British bank ombudsman system, the scheme will provide for disputed claims of up to $100,000 to be dealt with by the ombudsman if the dispute-settling procedures of the bank involved fail to produce an agreement with the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA>We know that a council will be set up with three of its members being drawn from consumer organisations and three from the banking industry. I must pay a particular tribute to my colleague Senator Bolkus, the Minister for Consumer Affairs, for his role in ensuring that consumer organisations which represent clients of the banking industry might have a place on this council. Of course, the council is to be chaired by the former Governor-General, Sir Ninian Stephen. I hope that I do not hear from Senator McLean any suggestion that a council under such eminent chairmanship as that of the former Governor-General, Sir Ninian Stephen, will be anything other than independent and of great integrity. The council will be able to use its powers in a way which will help alleviate some situations. It will be able to investigate and resolve a dispute in a way which may not necessitate the full paraphernalia of a court hearing. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that, if Senator McLean looks at what has happened in the last six months since he moved a motion of this type, he will see that there has been considerable movement and considerable response in appropriate ways, in terms of the Federal Court, the Supreme Courts around Australia and the setting up of the office of banking ombudsman, to the sorts of concerns which undoubtedly exist out in the community. But I believe that to come into this chamber yet again and to move a motion which holds out very false hope for those who may feel aggrieved or adversely affected by a decision of their banker or who may be the subject of some relationship that has gone sour is very cruel and very heartless. This chamber should play no part in fostering Senator McLean's particular obsession. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I propose to speak briefly to this motion. Six months ago Senator McLean, as he has reminded us, came into this chamber and took up the time of the Senate, as he is doing today, by putting forward a motion not totally dissimilar from the present one which called upon the Senate to institute a committee of inquiry into the banking system and, in particular, into certain matters in the banking area to which at that time he was attaching particular importance. At that time the Australian Democrats were expecting, as most of us were, an election to be called in July or August of this year. Undoubtedly an election would have been called at that time but for the fact that, following the change in leadership in the coalition parties, the Government found that it was no longer convenient and that Mr Keating's great game plan was no longer operating quite as smoothly as he had hoped. Therefore, that election had to be postponed; it has recently again been postponed. An election is now scheduled for the early part of next year and Senator McLean is moving his pre-election motion to refer these banking matters to a Senate committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the last occasion, he chose a Senate select committee-I hope I am correct in saying that-but on this occasion he has chosen the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I confess an interest in that respect because I happen to be a member of that Committee. The Chairman of the Committee, Senator Barney Cooney, is in the chamber. I am sure that if Senator Cooney were to speak on the matter he would confirm my view-indeed, the view just stated by the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate)-that the sheer hollowness of the motion from Senator McLean is nowhere better illustrated than in the very idea that the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs could conceivably conduct an inquiry of the breadth and magnitude put forward in Senator McLean's motion within the ambit of the time period laid down in the motion, namely, that it be completed before the first day of sitting in 1990. That is just over two months away, with the Christmas period intervening. Senator McLean may be prepared to commit the staff of the Senate to working throughout their Christmas break; I am not prepared to treat people in that way, even if the Australian Democrats are so prepared for their own political purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Since last April when we debated this matter, nothing has changed. I qualify that statement in one degree, picking up as I do one or two of the comments made by the Minister. One or two things have changed. In particular, we have seen a number of court decisions in some of the areas that were the subject of Senator McLean's originally expressed concerns. I will not bore the chamber by repeating the decisions which were quoted by the Minister, although, as he pointed out, one decision illustrated that not all of Senator McLean's concerns apparently are shared by the courts of the land. That is as we would expect because quite clearly there have been varying experiences in this area, as has been said in the past. There have been experiences where quite clearly banks have been lacking in the full discharge of their fiduciary duties to their clients. There is no question about that. Some bank managers have been; others have not. That is what we would expect. In the web of life we find that some people are competent and others are incompetent. The toy politicians on my left are in the latter category and among bank managers there is an admixture of the two. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Tate quite rightly said, this is a shameful attempt by the Australian Democrats to exploit the unhappy personal circumstances facing many Australians today as a result of this Government's policies. That is not quite the way the Minister put the point, but it is true that a number of people today are in great distress as a result of very high and prolonged interest rates, as well as for other reasons. Senator McLean put a lot of stress upon the result of deregulation. We do not have time to debate that question today, other than to say that, as usual, it is a subject on which the Australian Democrats' knowledge could be put on the head of a pin. What we have today is a motion which sets out to shoot the messenger. The situation in the monetary banking area today is 99 per cent the result of government policies and one per cent the result of the actions of particular individuals in the banking system. But, lo and behold, the Australian Democrats once again want to shoot the messenger! The fact is that if-I stress the word `if'-any inquiry into these matters were to be appropriate, it would not be an inquiry to be carried out by a Senate select committee or standing committee. We have made that point before. It would be an inquiry carried out by a properly constituted royal commission with independent and properly appointed experts in the field-not by a bunch of politicians including, God forbid, some toy politician from the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> As a matter of fact, we have had a couple of committees of inquiry of that kind in the last decade. In case Senator McLean has not heard of it, I remind him of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System in 1981-82. Hot on the heels of that Committee, just after the Government came to office, we had the Martin Review of the Australian Financial System which had the narrower job basically of looking into the recommendations of the Campbell Committee and giving a second opinion on them. This junk stuff contained in the motion before us today, as Senator McLean was partially honest enough to admit, is no more and no less than a piece of cheap populism designed to promote the electoral fortunes of the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to waste the time of the Senate any more than it has been wasted already this morning by debating the motion further. However, I do want to pick up one of Senator McLean's more extraordinary comments in advancing the reasons that we should be considering this proposal. He said that the banks have the power to create debt and are creating debts all over the place. He is saying that it is all the banks' fault that people are in debt; that the banks created the debt. I do not know where Senator McLean spends his time. I have a small mortgage. My bank did not create that debt. I went to live in Queensland and became a member of this place, somewhat to my cost. As a consequence of moving my abode I wanted to buy a house in Queensland. I could not quite afford to do so, so I went to my bank and said, `Will you lend me the necessary balance?'. </PARA>
<PARA> According to Senator McLean's exposition of the way these things go, the bank created that debt. I created the debt by going to the bank and asking it to lend me money. If Senator McLean cannot understand the distinction he should not be participating in a debate on such matters. However, I quickly correct myself by saying that this debate is not about banking; it is not about any of the matters which are ponderously and pompously set out in the motion before the chamber; it is about the Australian Democrats wanting to get a reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs so they can get the television cameras in showing Senator McLean putting forward all this populist stuff that he has picked up. He told us that it is filed in cabinets six feet high in his room. I have no doubt that it is because, as the Minister pointed out, he has become quite obsessive about this matter. However, I do not see why the Australian Parliament should have to waste its time dealing with Senator McLean's obsessions or, even less, the political future of the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent times on ABC radio the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Janine Haines, has appealed to Australians not to desert the Australian Democrats. For years the Democrats have scurried around like the proverbial political jackals that they are, trying to pick up every bit of decaying carcass of public issue that is in sight. Every time some ex-Liberal Party, ex-Labor Party or ex-National Party voter gets a bit disgruntled with the party of his original preference and wonders what he can do to punish it, the Australian Democrats come along and say, `Vote for us. We don't stand for anything. We have no policies. We simply put forward whatever you want to hear. Then we go down the street and tell the other fella something which is 180 degrees opposite to what we have told you, but he does not know about the conversation we have had with you'. </PARA>
<PARA> That has been the practice of the Australian Democrats ever since their party was formed. One has to say that, on the whole, they have parleyed that into a rather successful operation of a minor kind over the years, but unfortunately for the Democrats-and this is their real problem-the Green Independents and others, who are now contending for other kinds of populist issues, are giving them some competition. It now looks as if the Australian Democrats will be in real trouble at the next election in getting any of their short term senators re-elected. I can only devoutly trust that that will be the case. As a result they are whipping themselves into a frenzy by putting forward in this place, as we see to our cost every day, more and more populist motions on this or that. Whenever they think they can spy a dissatisfied clientele-irrespective of whether it is three of four voters in the country-they will bring forward a motion and send out press releases hoping to get the attention of people who are utterly dissatisfied about this or that, so that they can ride forward on their white chargers and go to their rescue. </PARA>
<PARA> All I can say to Senator McLean and his colleagues is that this kind of shoddy, shabby corruption of a political debate will not work. I believe that the Australian people are not quite so stupid as the Australian Democrats clearly think they are. They will not have the wool pulled over their eyes by this continual parade of good intentions-of course, the intentions are different with every group-on the part of the Democrats. I will not dignify the motion by continuing to debate it in this place. Australia faces a national crisis and yet the Democrats bring forward this sort of stuff. Last week they talked about putting a tax on bank promotional advertising or some other thing that at that time they thought might gain them a vote or two. The Opposition opposes the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-In layman's terms, the proposition before the Senate is to ask one of the Senate's standing committees to decide whether or not we have a problem in banking in Australia; if so, what should be done about it; and specifically to provide an answer to the question: `Are average Australians being disadvantaged by the way in which banks conduct their business in the community?'. It is a fairly simple proposition. It may well be that after relatively short deliberations the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs will come back and say, `We sure have a problem. It is a big one and it needs to be addressed in a certain way', perhaps by a royal commission or some other mechanism. Both Senator Tate and Senator Stone have made a big thing of the fact that the enormity of the challenge is such that it renders it impossible. It may well be that the enormity of the challenge simply means that the Committee comes back very quickly and says that we need to put in place a highly resourced royal commission which can probe the magnitude and dimensions of this question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Tate started off by saying that I have come to the rescue of a few people who have, to use an expression, `fallen foul of the banks'. Obviously he was not registering the point I was making, that is, that most Australians are dissatisfied with banks. If `falling foul' means incurring unacceptable levels of interest, resenting undisclosed and unknown levels of charging, all Australians have fallen foul of their banking system. That is why there is such a high level of resentment in the community. Senator Tate, in a very weak response to a profound issue, attempted to suggest that it was all about a handful of people who had fallen foul of the banks and had disputes that should be resolved in the courts. Of course some of those disputes can be resolved in the courts. However, most of the people I am talking about can never pursue their dispute with a bank in the courts. They are broken financially, emotionally and maritally. They cannot match the unlimited resources of banks or the banks' access to the best legal minds. </PARA>
<PARA> To say that these few people who have fallen foul of the banks, should pursue their cause in the courts is to fly in the face of what the realities are. That is exactly what Senator Tate has done as the Minister for Justice in this land. He turned his back today on the realities regarding some aspects of justice. He accused me of creating false hope. What hope did I create? I created the hope that a standing committee of this Parliament might be prepared to look at one of the most serious social issues in Australia today-and Senator Tate calls it a false hope!</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister quite reasonably responded to allegations that have been directed at the Australian Federal Police. I have not directed those allegations; they have been directed by Australian constituents. I have brought them into the chamber and I have put them before the responsible Minister, who resents the fact that I have done so and has chosen to see it as some sort of insult. I saw it as some sort of obligation to bring such allegations into the chamber. However, the Minister chose to be offended by the allegations. That level of reaction is not adequate. The Minister and Senator Stone both made a big issue of the fact that the courts are available as a mode of resolving problems of justice in this country. The courts are available, but access to them on these issues is available to relatively few people. If one gets there it is usually after a number of years. It is usually after enormous expense. It requires a particularly persistent, courageous, well-resourced, determined and well-informed person even to begin that process. </PARA>
<PARA> I have tabled the case of a gentleman from Newcastle who had to take on the State Bank of New South Wales, which claimed to be the Crown and therefore exempt from the Trade Practices Act. He had to take that issue to the High Court of Australia to win a technical point in order to go back into the Supreme Court of New South Wales to try to get damages from the bank. Very few people have the moral courage or the resources to get that sort of act together. I believe that the Minister for Justice should be concerned about the fact that ordinary Australians do not have access to the courts. Most of those people cannot get access to legal aid. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw, Madam Acting Deputy President. There was no offence meant. My point was that the intention of the motion was misrepresented, perhaps unintentionally. We were not suggesting that the taxpayer be the compensator, or that the taxpayer meet the bill for damages. That, of course, would be unrealistic. It is a ridiculous suggestion. It is not a suggestion. The suggestion is that the Committee observe and comment on the means by which people might be compensated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will come to the question of the ombudsman, because it is very important. I was aware of the fact that I had more time available to me. I have asked to be the first person to appear before the Australia Bank Council and to appear before the ombudsman. I have had a tentative reply from Sir Ninian Stephen in response to that request. I think most honourable senators will be aware of the fact that it is partly-and it has been acknowledged in the press as being so-in response to what I have been doing in the Senate over the last 15 months that the Australia Bank Council has been formed and that an ombudsman is about to be employed by that Bank Council who will be responsible to it. The role of the bank ombudsman is a model that is pursued overseas with some effect and with some limitations. The Jack report in Britain made observations about the role of the bank ombudsman in Britain. It is suggested that it is not unreasonable to see the bank ombudsman as perhaps the bank looking at banks, and many people find that unacceptable-as unacceptable as the police looking at the police. </PARA>
<PARA> The concept of a bank ombudsman has lots going for it but it also has its limitations. I concede the fact that the Australia Bank Council seems to be very credibly structured at this stage, but it has not actually met yet to the best of my knowledge. I am not prepared to give it bouquets in advance because it happens to have reputable people on it. I am not disputing that. Nor am I prepared to give it bouquets in advance because it is chaired by an eminent Australian. We have to wait and see how the Bank Council, the ombudsman and the chairperson perform in this new role. The Council has to establish its credentials by performance. I have asked to appear before it, as I have said, and I will table before it the 50 affidavits-I will probably have 60 or 70 affidavits by then-that I have tabled in the Senate. I will put them on the table before the ombudsman. I will push them across the table and say, `There is your first year's work'. The reality is that I have been the de facto ombudsman for the last 12 months. That information will go across the desk. I know that a lot of it will come back because the terms of reference are such that it will not be appropriate for many of the complaints I have been addressing in the Senate to go before the ombudsman. </PARA>
<PARA> The very fact that there is a limit of $100,000 compensation from the banks for disputants makes it a petty cash league of redress. Many of the cases which I have tabled in affidavits before the Senate involve sums well in excess of $100,000. Very few of them involve less than $100,000. In other words, a person would have to go before the ombudsman, perhaps win compensation for $100,000, then pursue the balance of it-and in some cases it is millions of dollars-back in the court of law. There will be, in fact, an appearance of justice having occurred and a process of redress being available. It may well be just a preliminary process of redress which will sap the energy, the commitment and the expectations of these individuals for a relatively limited outcome. I have some reservations about it, but I am prepared to take it on good faith. However, I will not make the judgment in advance, as the Minister is doing here this morning, that all will now be well because we have a bank ombudsman. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had intended to mention it all the way along. I knew that I had the good fortune of having the extra time available. So let us not pretend that the concept of a bank ombudsman will resolve all of our problems about banking. It will not. In fact it can even be argued that it is a pretty fair old operation, as far as the banks are concerned, to contribute between the four major banks which have made massive profits of billions of dollars. Do honourable senators know that the banks will put up $2m to fund this process, they will write it off against their tax, and they will save millions of dollars in legal fees by enticing people to go before an alternative process and the lawyers will just rip millions of dollars out of the banks? It could be seen to be a jolly good financial operation as far as the banks are concerned because it has an extra pay-off; it has a public relations dimension to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All of a sudden the banks have responded to all these allegations about their bad image and they have created a process which deals with petty cash claims, which saves them taxes and legal fees and which will probably deal with only a handful of cases in a year anyway. I am not as confident about this process of the bank ombudsman as the Minister for Justice is. The Jack report in Britain was not as confident or as praising of the process of the bank ombudsman; in fact, it said that it was very much a case of banks looking at banks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Different terms of reference, yes; I am just speaking in general terms. But in Britain it is very much a case of banks looking at banks and about petty issues of disputes. So it may well be that the bank ombudsman is a part of the answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From my discussions with the responsible Minister, the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus), I agree with him that we should look closely at it for 18 months and monitor it and, if it is working, perhaps sing its praises. But one thing we have to do is to test its credibility to the limit; make demands on it; and insist that it delivers if the ombudsman is to get a six-figure salary, which he or she will, and if the chairperson, the former Governor-General, is to get a six-figure salary. But the bill will be picked up by the banks, so the banks will be the employer of the ombudsman. It raises some pretty fundamental questions. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate raised the question that certain decisions have been made by courts in Australia about Swiss bank loan disputes. I think he was almost arguing my case. He was citing the fact that the Swiss loans fiasco, which caught out approximately 1,400 Australians, was one aspect of the banking farce in this country which forced people to go into courts. Judgments are now being made in their favour which cite the fact that banks have abandoned their fundamental fiduciary relationship. For a while there I thought that the Minister for Justice was arguing my case for me because he was citing the very evidence that I have tabled in this Senate to the effect that, in many cases, the banks have abandoned those whose interests they are supposedly representing while they make their billions of dollars of profit every year. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Commonwealth Bank is to experience a 74 per cent increase in profit in the last 12 months and make super profits it obviously has to be at somebody's expense. If the four major banks in this country are announcing record profits, which they describe as super profits, and they are embarrassed by them, it obviously has to be at somebody's expense. It is at our expense. The best that the spokesperson for the Australian Bankers Association could do the other day to respond to these observations about their absurd, obscene levels of profit was to say, `If you think we are ripping you off now in the deregulated banking system you should know the realities about how we were ripping you off before deregulation'. That was the reaction of the Australian Bankers Association when, on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald three or four days ago, the observation was made that the banks in this country operate at levels of profitability and margins twice those required by Swiss international banks and equivalent banks overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Stone's contribution to this debate this morning was nothing short of pathetic. It was really just a tirade against a group of senators whose political aspirations and ideas happened to differ from his; so he launched a tirade. We are used to it. He began the tirade by saying that I was taking up the time of the Senate in bringing before it the issue of banking in Australia today. I believe that my contribution has been much more constructive and much more legitimate, in terms of using the time of the Senate, than that outburst which we got. It really was classic bigotry of the old style that we listened to. As an adolescent I can remember being appalled by the bigotry between Masons and Catholics and that sort of blind rejection of the fact that other people might hold another point of view. We were subjected to classic bigotry in the chamber this morning but we have become accustomed to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Stone said that it was all a pre-election gimmick by the Australian Democrats. I deliberately said at the beginning of my speech that it was a pre-election issue. That happens to be a coincidence, but it is a real pre-election issue and it is an issue that should be raised, heightened and made a primary election issue. That is exactly what we are trying to do. I do not believe that it is a gimmick or politicking; I believe that it is quite appropriate and legitimate for us to do that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, as Senator Coulter says, it would be utterly irresponsible of us not to do it. In fact, hundreds and thousands of Australians are pleading with us to do it, so that is what we are doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that Senator Stone also falsely argued some of the same propositions that Minister Tate argued-namely, our expectations of the Committee and the role of the courts in resolving these sorts of disputations. He then used some colourful phrases such as, `In the web of life we must expect some of these injustices from banks'. He then pleaded with us to expect these things in the web of life. I believe that one has to be discerning. I believe that it is our primary role to discern between reasonable and unreasonable expectations in the web of life and then try to rectify, on behalf of the community at large, some of the unreasonable expectations in the web of life. I mean, really, it was colourful phraseology, but it addressed only part of the realities of this web of life and it failed to acknowledge our role in relation to them. Of course, the language then became even more colourful when Senator Stone talked about the Democrats picking over the decaying carcass of social issues. The issues that we have picked over in the last 12 years have been issues like the environment, social justice, privacy and electoral reform. We have pursued those issues. Those have been some of the carcasses-to use the emotional phraseology of Senator Stone-that we, as a Senate, have been addressing in the last few days. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge every senator and every Australian to read the speeches of Senator Stone of today and of 5 April when he last addressed this motion. They will get great insight into where he stands on the issues of the day. He had the gall to stand there as the leader of a party with seven senators and direct abuse and ridicule at the leader of another party with seven senators. He grandstands his Party as a party that is on the move. Is he unaware of what will happen to his Party in Queensland in a few weeks from now? It really was the most extraordinarily superficial response. Did he actually address the serious issues which I had raised, of excessive interest rates, undisclosed charges and absurd profits? Not a word was addressed to any of these matters. But we got colourful phraseology about carcases, webs of life and pretentious power play from a leader of a party that has, really, the same standing numerically as the Australian Democrats in this chamber. Frankly, I do not believe that his Party pursues with as vigorous a social conscience as ours the issues that lie within the so-called carcases that he says that we pick over. I saw it just as an utterly pathetic response to a profoundly important issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I will continue to bring this issue back to the chamber. I do not believe it is wasting the time of the Senate to bring before it what we see as being the gross inadequacies, injustices and exploitations which are inherent in one of the most important social phenomena in society-banking. I make no apologies for bringing the matter before the Senate, and I will continue to do so. I will continue to try to blow up the storm I was referring to earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply commend to the Senate and to the Australian people the proposition which we are now debating as a matter of Senate business-namely, that the most appropriate standing committee available to us should deliberate on a number of vitally important issues, but basically that the committee should look at the question whether the average Australian is being well served by the Australian banking system. It might well start by looking at the role of the Reserve Bank of Australia, as I read it in this chamber the other day; and it might well start that by looking at the duties of the Board of the Reserve Bank, which are to stabilise the currency, create full employment and ensure that the banking system of the land functions in the best interests of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposition before the chamber today is simply that that is not what is prevailing in Australia today and, therefore, the Board of the Reserve Bank is failing us. The Reserve Bank itself and the Government are failing us. Australians are being exploited by the most fundamental institutions in the land. They are all-powerful and are operating within a banking model created by this Government in 1984-85. It was specifically the brainchild of the present Treasurer (Mr Keating). It is sustained by the support of the Opposition and will be kept in place by the alternative government, the Opposition, should it be elected to power. But the victim, in every way, is the average Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> We have simply proposed that one of the standing committees investigate whether perhaps there is something rotten in the state of Denmark and come back and make recommendations to this chamber as to what can be done about it. I think that is an eminently responsible and sensible proposal for us to bring forward-populist or otherwise. In a pre-election context, it is a most timely occasion to bring the matter forward. It is apparent that the Government is seeing it in election terms. Its own backbenchers are screaming for such an inquiry. The Government has pulled it off. The Government backbenchers are screaming for such an inquiry because an election is coming up and because it is a populist demand. The Treasurer has said, `Let us kill it; because there is an election coming up and the inquiry will reveal the inadequacies of the policies the Government has put in place'. I commend the motion to the Senate as being extremely appropriate and very timely. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will be supporting the Australian Federal Police Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989. The Bill introduces a form of fixed term contracts in the employment of the Australian Federal Police (AFP). The relationship between the Australian Federal Police and the Hawke Government over the last year or so has been somewhat unfortunate. One will recall that last year the AFP felt forced to take unprecedented industrial action because of the unsympathetic way in which the Australian Government was addressing its financial problems, particularly in the light of the tragic murder of Assistant Commissioner Winchester, and the inability of the Australian Government to properly appreciate that that investigation required considerable extra funding or, if the Government did appreciate that, its unwillingness to provide that funding. Unfortunately, relations between the Government and the AFP fell to an all-time low. Nevertheless, there are some positive aspects in this legislation and, if it indicates a growing confidence on the part of the AFP, it is something that we are pleased to note.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill applies to police officers and public servants who are employed by the AFP. Not surprisingly, we have followed the development of the Bill during the months that it has been debated in principle. In particular, we have been interested in the reaction of the Australian Federal Police Association (AFPA) and other relevant unions. We understand that the AFPA now supports the Bill although it has from time to time had reservations about part of it. The 13 other unions represented in the AFP-it is probably worth noting that there are still 13 other unions represented within the AFP, including the Public Service unions-oppose the Bill because they see it as one step towards contract employment. We believe the Bill has merit and we ask the unions to think again if they are of a mind to continue their opposition in ways that might be disruptive. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is part of the modernisation of the AFP. It follows on from the career structure review which took place earlier this year and which introduced broadbanding of ranks, merit promotion and other reforms. The Government now wishes to introduce two more major reforms, which it does by this Bill. The first is to put all AFP personnel, both police officers and public servants, under the Australian Federal Police Act. This is desirable to obtain flexibility in determining the overall complement of the AFP. The second reform is to abolish permanency of employment and replace it with fixed term contracts of employment. Police officers will be given the option to take a fixed term appointment or resign. Public servants now working in the AFP will have a choice of a fixed term appointment or being made subject to the mobility provisions of the Public Service Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The justification for fixed term appointments is that they give flexibility in managing the force. The needs of a police force change from time to time and management must have the flexibility to bring in officers with the skills that are needed and to be free of officers without those skills-those who have suffered burnout, as it is referred to, and those who have lost their enthusiasm and efficiency. Under the present system those who are incapable of being promoted, or who do not want to be promoted, must be kept on in employment because they have virtual permanency of employment. The system proposed in the Bill is that police officers and public servants in the AFP will all be on fixed term appointments which will be renewed only if the employees are efficient, productive and honest. If their appointments are not renewed at the end of their fixed term the employees will receive, by way of compensation, an adjustment of 12 1/2 per cent of their accumulated salary over the term of the contract. The Australian Federal Police Commissioner will have the power to fix the terms and conditions of employment subject to general policy guidelines given by the Minister for Justice. These guidelines will require adherence to the national wage case guidelines and the statutory authority coordination arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> By this means most terms and conditions will continue to be determined by the Industrial Relations Commission through awards. It is proposed that a common award will be put before the Industrial Relations Commission. As a step in the right direction, the terms and conditions of the higher ranks of deputy commissioner or senior executive commissioned police officers, such as commanders, the assistant commissioners and senior executive public servants, are expressly removed from the jurisdiction of the Industrial Relations Commission. They will be determined by the Commissioner. A power is also proposed which will make temporary appointments for up to 12 months. This should add to the flexibility to be achieved by these changes. That is something that the Opposition is pleased to witness. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill introduces reforms which are consistent with the coalition parties' industrial relations policy. We are pleased that the Government has seen the wisdom of that policy, as is demonstrated by this piece of legislation. I draw the attention of the Government to clause 1.15 of the Opposition's policy, dealing with the issue of public employment. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> We will adopt practices in the Commonwealth public sector that will set an example in the pursuit of flexible and harmonious workplace relations. </PARA>
<PARA>In clause 6.1 of the policy it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We will adopt a more flexible market oriented approach to industrial relations in the area of Commonwealth employment. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 4 of the Opposition's public administration policy states:</PARA>
<PARA> In some cases it may be appropriate to move certain classes of employees outside award coverage altogether. This could be done through the use of voluntary agreements as set out in our industrial relations policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, it may be seen that, at least in part, this Bill is consistent with our policy. As I previously indicated, I commend the Government on moving in that direction. The fixed term appointments proposed by the Bill fall short of the full-blooded contracts that we would have in government. Constables, sergeants and superintendents will have hybrid fixed term appointments and their terms and conditions will be fixed mostly by awards. Only the term of the appointment and the adjustment payment will be fixed by a means other than the award-that is, by determination of the Commissioner. The scope of an individual police officer or public servant to negotiate his or her own terms is therefore limited. However, the contracts of the senior ranks of commanders, assistant commissioners, deputy commissioners and senior executive public servants will be capable of variation from officer to officer. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that the Bill is a step forward, doing away with permanency of employment and requiring performance or termination of employment. In all the circumstances we believe that we should therefore recognise this Bill as a moderate advance towards contract employment. We will support it. I add, however, that we will watch very closely the administration of the Bill when it becomes law. In particular we will watch over those matters which have concerned the Australian Federal Police Association, which it has brought to the attention of my colleague the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Brown. For instance, we will watch over the workings of the internal review proceedings which will be used when decisions are made as to whether a contract will be reviewed. We will expect the Australian Federal Police and the Government to administer these new arrangements fairly, bearing in mind that they will be dealing with individuals, their careers and livelihoods. Otherwise I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to support the second reading of the Australian Federal Police Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 I indicate that initially I was apprehensive about some aspects of this Bill. I want to make clear the nature of those reservations and the factors which overcame my concerns in this instance. Those apprehensions have been reinforced by some of the remarks made by Senator Hill in his support of the Bill. In my view it has always been an important feature of the Westminster system of government that public sector employees should have security of tenure. This has been premised upon the assumption that this security will enable such public servants to tender fair and frank advice, free from the threat of political persecution or other consequences that might follow, were their employment not so secure. I acknowledge that this description is a gross oversimplification of what is a very complex interrelationship between public servants, their Ministers and the government of the day. But it is that element of the principles underlying that relationship which led me to be apprehensive about this Bill. An inherent feature of this Bill is that there will be a change to that traditional relationship for one sector of Australian government employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not one who believes that tradition is, of itself, a case for retaining any particular feature, including the nature of Public Service employment. It may be that there is a case for review of the nature of public sector employment in the contemporary Australian version of the Westminster system. Senator Hill said that this is a step forward because it leads towards doing away with permanency. That is something that I think needs more careful consideration than the rather cavalier contribution that Senator Hill has just made and the even more grandiose and absurd suggestions made by the shadow Minister for public administration, Senator Bishop. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to make major changes, as would be inherent in a move towards a contract system of tenure, I would wish to see such a change made in a considered and planned manner, after some sort of proper review or public debate of the pros and cons. I certainly would not welcome a major change initiated in an ad hoc manner in a relatively small part of the Public Service. I expressed those concerns within my Party, to the relevant Minister and to others. However, the second reading speech by the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) gives some assurances. The Minister in his second reading speech referred to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris). He said:</PARA>
<PARA> There have been some concerns expressed as to the potentially wider implication of these proposals for other public sector employment. My colleague the Minister for Industrial Relations has confirmed that during the discussions that led to this Bill those particular concerns were canvassed. He has stated that fixed term appointment in the Australian Federal Police is a response to a set of unique circumstances and should not be seen in any way as providing a basis for moves to fixed term contract employment in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA>I welcome that commitment by the Minister for Industrial Relations, as the responsible Minister for that matter. I do, of course, recognise that there are special circumstances in the Australian Federal Police (AFP). As the Minister for Justice said in his second reading speech, the Bill will enable, wherever possible, positions which do not require police powers to be filled by civilian staff, which will result in a better utilisation of scarce police resources. I acknowledge that there is growing significance in the development of an overlap of activities by police and civilian employees of the AFP. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, as the Minister said, the Bill will allow for-and it is his description, but I share it-the development of a professional and dedicated work force which is purpose designed for the unique task of Federal law enforcement. It is not only a unique area of Federal government employment, but also it is a quite different sort of police force in many ways from those in the States. Therefore, there is certainly a case for saying that the very nature of policing lends itself to a fixed term tenure system and that probably explains why the Australian Federal Police Association has supported this proposal-not unanimously, not without reservation, but in the end it supported it. </PARA>
<PARA> A particularly important element, which I am pleased that Senator Hill also referred to, is the stress that policing places upon individual officers, which tends to lead-to use that overused phrase-to burnout among members of that force. Evidence which has been raised in discussions indicates that the overall term of employment of officers of the Australian Federal Police at the moment is in the area of 10 years-approximately 11 years. For this reason, and to take proper account of this significant stress element and the consequential staff turnover, the fixed term appointment system may well prove to be well suited to the requirements of the AFP. We have always had special and unique employment arrangements for members of the defence forces, although they are Australian Government employees. Doing that in the AFP is not of itself a precedent but it is important that it does not become a step on the road to doing away with permanency unless we undertake a very broad-ranging and considered review and decide that in some way that should be done. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another element that nobody has sought to emphasise greatly, although I do not wish to dramatise the matter. It is quite significant or, as the Minister said, `noteworthy', that this type of appointment to police forces was a recommendation of the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct in Queensland. Mr Fitzgerald's report and recommendations would appear to me to indicate that this initiative should facilitate the maintenance of the high levels of integrity that we have within the Australian Federal Police. I do not want to dwell on that but I think it is important. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the proposals in this Bill relate only to the AFP. They recognise the unique environment in which the AFP operates. It is important to note that this is not a change which is cost driven; it is not about reducing conditions of service of employees; it is not about reducing the rights of unions to represent their members; and it does not conform to the industrial relations agenda espoused by some on the conservative side of Australian politics. All conditions of service and union rights will be retained. There are some details of the proposed changes about which concern has been expressed, particularly by the Public Sector Union, and the effect of these will need to be monitored. I will certainly be doing so. It is significant to note, to ensure that there is no misunderstanding, that the terms of these contracts for staff of the AFP will be determined by the Industrial Relations Commission through the normal award making procedures. I think that is important and worth while and I support it. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes are about ensuring that the AFP is able to obtain and retain honest, competent and hardworking employees and are designed to act as a disincentive to corruption. I am sure everybody in this Senate and everybody in Australia-with isolated exceptions-would want to ensure that the AFP is able to maintain its high standard of effectiveness, accountability and integrity. Therefore, I support the Bill and will be following very closely the development of the new employment system. I would be even more enthusiastic if I thought that this Bill might serve as a catalyst to a continuing debate on the nature of Public Service employment. That would be a very worthwhile debate which would enhance Australian political dialogue and discussion in our democracy. I would welcome that continuing debate but I suspect that it might be a bit too much to ask. Without getting my hopes up too high in that area, I support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Australian Federal Police Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, one of a couple of Bills which are on the Notice Paper for discussion in the next few weeks. This Bill, as honourable senators who have already spoken today have pointed out, involves a number of changes but probably the most contentious of these is the fixed term contract exercise. I do not want to rehearse all of the items that have been the subject of discussions with the various unions on this legislation. Some rather strange comments have been made, certainly from the point of view of the Government, suggesting that this was the only option in terms of the fragmented nature of the Australian Federal Police (AFP). There are, fairly obviously, a whole range of models which could have been adopted and which are currently operating within Australia. However, the Government has chosen to operate on this one. The main bulk of the Australian Federal Police seems to be reasonably happy with the types of responses that the Government has given.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hope that the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) will be able to reiterate at least the reported comments of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) with regard to the thin end of the wedge argument about other Public Service areas. Quite frankly, I do not think that the reassurances that it is not going to occur will be of much use but it will be nice to hear them at least yet again and certainly hear them in this chamber from the Minister, who I am quite sure believes them, although I am not quite sure that the Government does. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fairly obvious that this is a try-out for fixed term contracts in the Public Service and that if the Government is re-elected it will be extended to other areas. The usefulness of that probably remains to be seen. I am not at all concerned about the contract system in this particular area. If it were able to be corralled to this area it might be a useful exercise. I do not think it will be corralled, but it would be useful if it were. I am very supportive in my own State of the recommendations of the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct, which are not acceptable to the National Party, and probably not even to the Liberal Party in my State because the police force there is opposed to them. The innovation with regard to contract systems here might, however, assist in allowing that to occur in other States. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned, however, by the other types of changes that are made in the Bill. Some of these have been picked up by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills in that they bounce the mechanisms that have been employed before, particularly with regard to adopting tribunal recommendations rather than the Commissioner having the determination. Under this legislation the Commissioner can determine the length of contracts. The Minister can make policy recommendations with absolutely no concern for informing the Parliament of those and no reassurances that the Parliament will be informed about them. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it extraordinary that in this day and age, with all the things that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has been engaged in and what this Parliament has been talking about, we should not have had some sympathetic legislative drafting with regard to that item. But these things are a matter of time and obviously the Attorney-General's Department has not yet woken up to the fact that there are new ways of dealing with matters, one being to keep the Parliament informed of what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA> The current section 30 of the principal Act will be changed by clause 24. From my point of view I would have preferred to leave the old method in. I do not propose to move an amendment because I do not think it will be accepted. We will have to keep very close tabs on clause 24. I am not here reflecting in any way on the current Commissioner, whom I hold in very high regard, or members of his staff, but I do not think the mechanism that has been chosen to allow the Commissioner to have the power to determine the terms and conditions for members of the AFP is a useful one from a number of points of view, not only from our point of view as a parliament but also from the point of view of the Commissioner. I am not at all sure that the Commissioner necessarily relishes the types of industrial problems that are about to be landed on his lap or, hopefully at some stage in the future, on her lap. The problems I see are going to be immense. It seems to me that it would have been better to have a softly, softly approach with regard to this matter, a quieter move forward to the contract system. Leaving the Remuneration Tribunal exercise in place may have been a less dramatic move. It may be that the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) and the Minister for Justice are about dramatic moves, but in this regard it might have been better to take a softly, softly approach and to have left the determination with the Tribunal in the first instance. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to canvass at great length the other matters dealt with in the Bill because there are a number of pressures on us today in terms of time. I think that the reorganisation of the Australian Federal Police is long overdue. I am hopeful that this reorganisation will allow the AFP to develop, as it has done in the last couple of years, towards a strong and effective police force. It has gone forward in leaps and bounds in terms of its effectiveness in the last couple of years at least. A lot of that is due to the very conscientious work that the Minister at the table, the Minister for Justice, has put in. The cooperation that has been shown by the new chief of the National Crime Authority (NCA) with the AFP is a very hopeful sign. The fact that Mr Faris has gone out of his way, I believe, to make sure that at the beginning of his term of office there is a good, firm working relationship is very important. I am also very encouraged by the response of the AFP to that new approach on the part of Mr Faris. </PARA>
<PARA> I am hopeful that the cooperation between the two arms of crime control that are under Federal jurisdiction will be fruitful. I am quite sure that the types of problems that have arisen in the past do not have to be repeated year after year. It is in the interests of crime control that those two bodies work together in their own particular areas. Where there is a necessity to share information, I am sure that we will not have some of the petty exercises that have inhibited effective control in the past. Undoubtedly that has not all been from one side but I think that working over those types of recriminations does not help anybody. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the reorganised AFP and NCA will work together on a common task-that is, crime control, particularly in the area of drugs. I believe that in the next few years the AFP will probably be more and more involved at the Federal level in the drug control exercise and that probably the NCA will move into other areas under its charter which have not been able to be given the type of attention that is necessary, particularly in the area of computer crime. I think that will come about because a number of other developments that have taken place, such as the cash transaction authority and so on, have actually developed a variety of mechanisms to enable the AFP to do that type of work effectively. It is my hope that this type of internal re-organisation, which has been accepted by the police force as a move forward, will contribute to that. </PARA>
<PARA> In the end, the judgment we have to make on these pieces of legislation is not a structural judgment but concerns whether or not the aims and goals of the organisation are furthered. The response that the AFP has had to this legislation is that it will further that. I am happy therefore to support the legislation on that basis and to see whether or not in the next couple of years that goal has been achieved. I hope the Minister will respond to the couple of criticisms I have made with regard to the structures. He might be able to give some assurances with regard to whether or not this Parliament may be informed about the type of general policy outline directions that the Minister may give to the Commission from time to time, as detailed under the Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I rise to close the debate on this extremely important legislation, the Australian Federal Police Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989. I want to thank particularly all those honourable senators who have spoken in the debate-Senator Hill on behalf of the Opposition, Senator Macklin on behalf of the Australian Democrats and Senator McMullan on behalf of the Federal parliamentary Labor Party. It is extremely important that the Australian Federal Police (AFP), its police and staff members, know that this whole chamber of the Parliament is behind the Australian Federal Police Commissioner in the very necessary restructuring and refocusing of the AFP so that it might better discharge the very onerous duties which we as an Australia-wide community place on its shoulders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Much can be done by way of award restructuring, administrative arrangements and so on, but there comes a time when it is important-and it has proved necessary-that the Federal Parliament indicate in a Bill such as this that the very necessary and considerable restructuring required in the AFP is being undertaken with wholehearted non-partisan support of all members of the Parliament. I am extremely anxious that the Australian Federal Police understand that that is the case. As I say, I pay tribute particularly to honourable senators who have indicated that today. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the tenth anniversary of the Australian Federal Police, which by coincidence we are celebrating at about this time, is a most auspicious time for this legislation to be passed through the Federal Parliament. It really puts the seal on the achievements of the last decade under Sir Colin Woods, Major-General Grey, and now Mr Peter McAulay, and sets the stage for another decade of great achievement as we move into the next century-indeed the next millennium-the second century of this great Commonwealth of Australia, this Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in regard to the nationwide Federal Commonwealth responsibilities of the Australian Federal Police that much of the restructuring is designed to help achieve a capacity to ensure that we as a nation live in a law-abiding and, so far as is possible federally, a crime-free society. But, in focusing on that, we must not forget the very important role that the Australian Federal Police plays here in the Australian Capital Territory. Indeed, within this Territory its community policing role is an extremely important one and one which the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory and I have had many discussions about over the last several weeks. This has led to the setting up of a working party which will ensure that the Australian Federal Police continues to give great service to this community here in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> In this tenth anniversary year it is extremely heartening for me as a Minister to know that the members of the Australian Federal Police-both the police members and the staff members-themselves are supportive of what is a most radical and innovative change in the way in which policing is to be organised in Australia. To move with the consent of so many members of the Australian Federal Police to a less quasi-military and less bureaucratic model is a very considerable achievement which could not occur-and will not succeed, whatever the Federal Parliament says-without the concurrence and willingness to give the proposals a go which I believe has been indicated by the Australian Federal Police membership. I am very grateful to the ordinary members and their various elected representatives, who have brought about this quality of appreciation of what is at stake. This has enabled the Commissioner's proposals-supported as they are by the Government and the Federal parliamentary Labor Party-to be brought into this chamber and to gather the support which they have from all sides. </PARA>
<PARA> In speaking of the parliamentary Labor Party, I should like to pay a special tribute to several members of the Caucus, to Senator McMullan, who has spoken, to Senator Barney Cooney and to Mr Langmore, a member of the House of Representatives. They have called on me on three or four occasions to express their concerns, their misgivings and how these might be remedied. I think they have been extremely fruitful discussions. Senator Zakharov and Senator Giles have also, in the relevant parliamentary Caucus committee, indicated their concerns and played their part in ensuring that award conditions of members of the Australian Federal Police are properly attended to and protected. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of approaches made to me in late September by the triumvirate of Senator McMullan and Senator Cooney and Mr Langmore, I had discussions with the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Peter Morris, which led to his writing me a letter in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>My Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday we discussed the Government's proposals for fixed term appointments to a unified work force for the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA>You indicated to me concerns expressed by some of our Caucus colleagues as to the potentially wider implication of these proposals for other public sector employment. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to confirm that during the discussions that led to this proposal those particular concerns were canvassed. Fixed term appointment in the Australian Federal Police is a response to a set of unique circumstances and should not be seen in any way as providing a basis for moves to fixed term contract employment in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA>PETER MORRIS</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, it was as a direct result of those representations by Senator McMullan, Senator Cooney and Mr John Langmore that I secured that written understanding of what I had conveyed to them as being the intention and the tenor of the discussions in Cabinet in relation to these matters, which led to the second reading being amended to make that clear in the way in which Senator McMullan indicated in his contribution. I thank them for providing an opportunity to place that on the record in this way, due to their very persistent and, I must say, extremely effective lobbying on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The fixed term appointments to a unified work force of the Australian Federal Police are not a precursor to wider reorganisation along these lines in the Australian Public Service. If it is a precursor, as Senator Macklin pointed out today, perhaps it will be a precursor to very necessary changes in other police forces around Australia. Indeed, Mr Tony Fitzgerald, in his very famous report after his inquiry in Queensland, indicated that he thought that the fixed term contract was the best way in which a police force might be organised. I hope that the incoming Labor administration in Queensland, after the next election, will take up his proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Macklin raised a matter which was apparently raised in the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and which was the subject of an Alert Digest from that Committee, received, I think, yesterday. I have not had time to fully consider it, but I will speak about the tabling of ministerial guidelines. During the parliamentary debate on the Australian Federal Police Act 1979, the then responsible Minister undertook to table any ministerial guidelines made under the Act, and this practice has been followed. I assure the Committee that any written ministerial policy guidelines given to the Commissioner of Police under the new Australian Federal Police Act will be tabled for the information of Parliament. Given the exigencies of the timetable for legislation this session, I will not give an explicit undertaking, but I do not see why that practice could not be contained in the legislation. I can assure Senator Macklin and the Scrutiny of Bills Committee of my good faith in that matter, and I will certainly ensure that that is made a provision of the omnibus Bill next year. I have not had a chance to look at the other matter raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee in its Alert Digest, but I understand it could be the subject of a reply to that Committee in the next week or so and need not hold up the passage of this legislation. I think that is conceded. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that, in the tenth anniversary year of the formation of the Australian Federal Police, this Federal Parliament is here given an opportunity to ensure that the Federal Police force is structured in a way which will enable it to achieve its objectives and goals, which are objectives and goals set on behalf of us all as residents-the fortunate inhabitants-of this great Commonwealth of Australia. I believe that the AFP, under its present Commissioner, Mr Peter McAulay, is moving in a way which will certainly satisfy this Parliament as it seeks to achieve those objectives and goals. I thank the Parliament for its support for this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA>As the Senate will be aware, it is now two months since the 1989-90 Budget, which is the subject of the Appropriation Bills we are debating today, was delivered by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the other place. It is obvious from the major economic statistics released during the last few days that the Government's economic policies are already, in the short space of two months, way off course. This Budget has provided no answer to Australia's fundamental economic problems. Both international credit rating agencies, Moody's Investors Service and Standard and Poor's Corporation, have now twice downgraded Australia's credit rating in the international bond markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The Reserve Bank of Australia, in its annual report delivered shortly after the Budget, has extensively criticised the Government's inadequate, one-dimensional tight monetary policy and the high interest rate regime, pointing out that while, of course, interest rates of the magnitude which the Treasurer has now put in place can be expected in time to dampen down demand, to cool the overheated economy-to use the Treasurer's words-if too long prolonged-they have now been in place for almost 18 months-such interest rates can also have a counterproductive effect because they tend to kill off the business investment, the provision of which is in the end part of the only solution to our economic problems-namely, to lift our national productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday's consumer price index released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed inflation running at around 8.3 per cent for the 12 months ended the September quarter. I interpolate the comment that the Government has done a good job in selling to our commentators the view that the annual inflation rate for the 12 months ended September is 8 per cent. If our journalists were to read the release put out by the Australian Statistician, they would see that the Statistician points out that for analytical purposes-that is, economic analytical purposes as distinct from the purposes of legal contracts and other such uses-the appropriate figure for the 12 months ended September quarter is not 8 per cent, but 8.3 per cent. I hope that that is clearly established and that the Government does not seek to deny it. </PARA>
<PARA> What happened to the Treasurer's forecast of just 14 months ago in the 1988 Budget that by 1989-90-that is, the financial year we are now in-inflation would be running at between 3 per cent and 4 per cent? We now have an inflation rate running at between 8 per cent and 9 per cent, and seemingly stuck in that range. Only earlier this week I gave the Government the benefit of the doubt by saying that it seemed as though inflation was stuck at between 7 per cent and 8 per cent. I have had to revise my view. It is obviously stuck at between 8 per cent and 9 per cent. The Treasurer's forecast of 14 months ago was blown out of the water because, among other things, it was based on a grab for votes, with an election timing policy plan in mind, obviously, through an irrational and unsustainable wage-tax trade-off with the Australian Council of Trade Unions that simply could never be delivered except at the cost of blowing out these major aggregates, including not least the aggregate of foreign debt, on which we have also had some further confirmatory figures published this week. </PARA>
<PARA> We all make forecasts and are confounded by the results but in this area at any rate I can claim to have very accurately forecast this outcome in a paper delivered on 2 September last year to the Business Congress of the Australian Economists Conference held in the Canberra Hyatt Hotel, in which just after the Budget was delivered I made it very plain that the Treasurer's wage-tax trade-off deal was simply non-deliverable and that if it were to be delivered, it would be disastrous. Of course, we are now experiencing the disaster that the Treasurer has delivered, not just to his Party but also to the people of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government's accord with the trade union movement has done nothing more than perpetuate inflation at these high levels. That inflation, and particularly the wage inflation that goes with it, perpetuates bracket creep and high taxation levels. It perpetuates that ever-growing gush of money into the Government's coffers, something which the Opposition is simply not prepared to countenance any longer. We have given a commitment to return the proceeds of what the economists call the bracket creep process, and we shall do so in our first Budget. Assuming that there is an election before the middle of next year, we shall have a Budget presumably by around August of next year. In that Budget we shall deliver on that commitment by way of our first instalment. Will the Government give a similar commitment? If the Treasurer will not give a commitment to return bracket creep to the taxpayers, it simply means that he and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) support even higher taxation under their high inflation rate regime. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned yesterday's figures on the consumer price index. On Wednesday of this week we had another in the now long string of terrible-in the sense of frightening-balance of payments deficit figures. Seasonally adjusted, the current account deficit for the month of September alone was just over $2,000m-$2,016m. We failed to pay our way in the world by $2,016m in one month on a seasonally adjusted basis. For the three months ended September that means we have failed to pay our way in the world, on a seasonally adjusted basis, by $5.8 billion-over $5,800m. </PARA>
<PARA> This means that the balance of payments figures forecast in this year's Budget also are already, despite protests to the contrary from both the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, and the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) when he returned yesterday, beginning to blow out, just as they were doing at this time last year in respect of the forecast in the 1988-89 Budget. The Government will have to answer this. Either what I have said is true-that the balance of payments forecast in the Budget is blowing out-or, if it is not, the Government will have to tell us how we are going to get the balance of payments deficits in the second half of this financial year-that is, the first half of 1990-down to not much more than $1 billion a month. I remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that for the last three months they have been running at just under $2 billion a month. </PARA>
<PARA> How will that precipitous decline in the balance of payments deficit come about within the next three months? How will it happen? It will not. I imagine that in the next three months we cannot look forward to a dramatic jump in our exports. On the whole our exports have been doing quite well and I expect to see them continue doing quite well. But we are not looking forward to a 25 per cent increase in our export performance three months from now. We are certainly not looking forward to any improvement at all in what is called the net income deficit-the amount which we are required to pay out month by month to our foreign creditors on that $108 billion of net foreign debt which we had at 30 June this year. That interest bill will not diminish, nor will the other form of property income payments on foreign ownership of this country diminish in the next three months. </PARA>
<PARA> There is only one way in which the balance of payments deficit can fall from its present level of just under $2 billion per month to not much more than $1 billion per month only three months from now-and that is by a howling recession. The Government will have to answer this. Either we are right when we say that the balance of payments forecast in the Budget is already shown to be totally and hopelessly wrong again, or, if we are wrong in that regard and if the balance of payments forecast will be right after all, is it not the case that the only way in which it can be right is through a major recession developing in the first half of next calendar year? The Government will have to answer that question. It need not think that it can go on evading it. We will keep putting the question to it. Sooner or later Mr Keating will have his back against the wall and some journalist will have the courage to ask him that question and to keep on asking him until he answers it. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the result will probably be somewhere between the two. I suspect that in 1989-90 we will see the balance of payments deficit blow out beyond the Government's Budget forecast but probably not as much as we might think by looking just at the figures for the last three months. Some recession in the economy will begin in the first half of next year-as to the precise time, I hazard no guess-that will begin to bring imports down somewhat and therefore make the balance of payments look temporarily a bit better. But the Government has not admitted to either of those outcomes as yet. It will. I promise it, it will. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask: What have we had from Mr Keating in response to the $2 billion deficit on the balance of payments announced last Wednesday? We have had him simply expressing relief and suggesting that at last the Government's policies are working-when we have such a balance of payments figure in seasonally adjusted terms! If the Government does not like the seasonally adjusted estimate that the Australian Statistician now produces-the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) at Question Time yesterday did not even know those figures existed-let it look at the raw figures, the original data, at the $1,777m deficit, I think it was, recorded in September. How can we have arrived at a situation in which a Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia goes out and tells the market to breath a sigh of relief because we have had a balance of payments deficit in the month of `only' just over $1.77 billion?</PARA>
<PARA> As the Opposition's Economic Action Plan, released by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) on 12 October last states, there have been only two occasions in our country's entire history-only one occasion since Federation-when the external debt burden has accelerated as rapidly as we are now seeing: the first was in the last century in the 1880s before Federation and the second was in the late 1920s. On those occasions the service ratio of gross property income rose very rapidly, topping out at about 40 per cent of gross national product in 1890 and in 1931. Last financial year we had exports growing at one per cent and imports growing at 25 per cent. Australia now ranks third in the size of our debt to commercial foreign banks behind only Brazil and Mexico. That is the distinction which we have achieved under this Government. The Empire State Building which Mr Keating has built-as he called it earlier this week in the House of Representatives-consists of $108 billion of net foreign debt, second only in commercial banking debt terms to Mexico and Brazil. </PARA>

All that growth in imports is in the form of capital goods and will in due course at some time improve our export performance'. Where is the evidence? The people of this country have long ceased taking Mr Keating's word for things. They have begun to notice in recent days that that word changes a lot from time to time depending on the debate of the day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators will remember the massive boost in export production we were to get after 1986, in the aftermath of the famous banana republic statement and the then policies of the Government-which at least were more directed to our problems than the policies of the last two years or so have been-which were to produce a massive increase in exports too. Do honourable senators remember the J-curve? Has anybody heard about the J-curve in the last year or two? Perhaps if this Government is here long enough and should we see our exchange rate decline massively as it did during 1985 and 1986 we will hear the Treasurer once again pump up the J-curve rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA> In the office of Treasurer today we have a man who has failed. He has failed himself. He has failed his Party and, most importantly, he has failed Australia. The fact is that only about $2 billion-to take a generous estimate-of the $5 1/2 billion deterioration in the balance of payments last financial year can be identified to an increase in capital goods imports. There has been some such increase and I welcome that. But to say that that is the reason for the deterioration in the balance of payments situation is, to use a kindly phrase, to handle the truth carelessly. Since the last election we have had two wasted years. We have had a government which told us that this will be the term of office of the Hawke-Keating Government in which it will embark upon a massive program of micro-economic reform for fixing up the heartland of Australia. We were to have a privatisation program of all of those less than wholly efficient government business enterprises. We were to have a reform of the waterfront. We were to have something done about the coastal shipping shambles whereby it costs more to send goods from Melbourne to Hobart than it does from Hobart to Tokyo. </PARA>

<PARA> Where are the Government's policies to deal with our problems today? There are no policies. The Opposition by contrast has, culminating in its Economic Action Plan of a fortnight ago, a whole series of publications of policy-32 in all. The Government today has none. However, as the second reading amendment that I have circulated notes, there is an urgent need for the Government to adopt our policies or something very like them. The credit rating agencies had something to say about the one claim that this Government makes for responsible fiscal policies, namely, the massive size of the Budget surplus. Moody's in August this year stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Moody's noted that the recent federal budget covering the current 1989-90 fiscal year generates an even larger surplus and contributes to the needed growth in national savings. Nevertheless, the rating agency believes that the budget fails to decisively address the issues of external imbalance and productivity. </PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what we have said in our Economic Action Plan. The areas of external imbalance and productivity are those that the Opposition's Economic Action Plan seeks to address. Because I see we are approaching the time for questions I will conclude these remarks by foreshadowing the second reading amendment standing in my name. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did read with some dismay the Hansard of the adjournment debate of 24 October in which Senator Tambling seriously questioned the qualification of Commissioner Dodson to undertake the work that has been given to him as one of the commissioners of the inquiry into Aboriginal deaths in custody. I also was very upset-I cannot say I was amazed-by his statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is also very important to question why mates of the Minister are given these responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA>In my view, this amounts to a scurrilous attack on Mr Pat Dodson. The implication is that Mr Hand had indulged in some sort of cronyism in arranging the appointment of Mr Dodson as a commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important to put on the record that Mr Pat Dodson is a very capable and well experienced person. He is a member of the Yaoro Aboriginal tribe and was born in Broome in January 1948. He was educated in the Northern Territory and Victoria and became a Catholic priest in the early 1970s. After leaving active pastoral duties, he became manager of information and education at the Central Land Council in 1983 and its director in 1986. He was appointed to the additional position of Acting Deputy Chairman of the Aboriginal Development Commission in May last year. There is no doubt that his capability and experience would be extremely helpful to the royal commission.</PARA>
<PARA> The real point I want to make is that the suggestion that Mr Pat Dodson be appointed to the royal commission did not come from Mr Hand or, indeed, from me. The suggestion was made to us, I think about Easter of this year, by Elliott Johnston, QC, the successor to Mr Muirhead as the chief commissioner, if you like, of the Aboriginal deaths in custody inquiry. Mr Johnston was concerned, as was Commissioner O'Dea, about the huge workload in Western Australia, where there are 33 reported deaths. It was decided that, rather than appointing two commissioners with identical terms of reference, responsibility would be divided functionally so that Mr O'Dea, the existing commissioner, would concentrate on hearing individual cases and the new commissioner would inquire into underlying factors-social, cultural, legal and so on-associated with the deaths.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that not only did Mr Elliott Johnston make the suggestion but it was taken up with great enthusiasm by Mr Peter Dowding, the Premier of Western Australia, whose position in regard to the commission at that stage was quite hostile. But Mr Dowding indicated, in conversations that I had with him, support for the appointment of Mr Dodson, which, as I say, was necessary if the commission's work was to progress satisfactorily in Western Australia. The suggestion that Mr Dodson's services be sought for this joint royal commission was made by Elliott Johnston, QC, and the matter was taken up with enthusiasm by the Premier of Western Australia. It was on that basis that the appointment was made. It certainly was not made by Mr Gerry Hand. He certainly was not appointed because he was a mate of the Minister, whatever that sort of coloured phrase is meant to imply.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Dodson was appointed part time from 1 July 1989 and full time from 1 August 1989. It is important to note, in view of some of the publicity that has been generated by Senator Tambling, that the cost of Commissioner Dodson's office will be substantially less than the cost of each of the other commissioners' offices, which average, approximately, $1,970,000. Savings will be achieved because there will not be the same sort of need for formal legal oriented hearings and the court reporting and witness expenses associated with them. There will be fewer staff and, being located in Broome, there will not be the costs associated with capital city offices.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that Senator Tambling has been way off the mark in his criticism of the appointment of Mr Pat Dodson. Indeed, I reject utterly the sort of scurrilous attack and the continuous denigration of not only a good Australian such as Pat Dodson, who is undertaking this task on behalf of two governments, but also the implication that he obtained the appointment because of a network of cronyism under the patronage of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand.</PARA>

<PARA> The Government is not attacking pharmacists. The Guild Executive rejected our offer and went to the Tribunal. They lost their argument. It is not a cost cutting exercise-we expect PBS spending to increase and we are committed to maintaining the PBS. It's been like arbitration-an independent court and the pharmacists didn't do as well as they thought. They've got an inflated idea of what they should be paid. They're doing OK. Look how many there are of them. The Government offered them a deal 2-3 times better than the Tribunal gave them. They were greedy and stupid. They knocked it back-now they're whingeing. No better than the pilots. Don't worry, the Government will make sure that you get your pharmaceuticals. If pharmacies close for extended periods we will have discussions with State Governments to enable PBS drugs to be dispensed by the hospitals. The PBS is a great scheme.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer to recent reports indicating that the Federal Government has protested to the Chinese Government over the lack of protection for Australian diplomats in China facing increasingly violent demonstrations. Has the Chinese Government given any assurance that security will be stepped up in this area and how serious is the threat to the safety of Australian personnel? What steps has the Government taken to deal with the problem in Australia which has given rise to the demonstrations in China?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very concerned about reports of increasingly unruly and angry demonstrations outside our Shanghai Consulate-General on the language studies issue. High level recommendations were made to the Chinese authorities on Wednesday this week. My Department called in the Chinese Ambassador, Zhang Zai; our Ambassador in Beijing also called on the Foreign Ministry; and the Consul-General has been in constant contact with the Shanghai authorities. The purpose of these various representations was to request provision of adequate protection for consular staff and property and guarantees that the Consulate-General would be able to function normally. We were given firm assurances that the Shanghai authorities would be asked to take all necessary measures. However, yesterday, 26 October, a large crowd again gathered outside. The mood was angry; police protection was manifestly inadequate; and staff were prevented from leaving the premises. Following urgent representations in both Shanghai and Beijing, adequate police protection was then provided, enabling staff to leave.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of these continuing disturbances, the Consul-General, in consultation with the Ambassador in Beijing, decided to close the Consulate temporarily to give the situation a chance to settle down. I support that decision and I make it clear again that it is the responsibility of the Chinese authorities to provide the protection necessary to enable the Consulate-General to discharge its normal functions. Of course, it is also the Government's responsibility, which I acknowledge, to try to remove, or at least address, the underlying causes that are producing the demonstrations. They flow from the Government decision of 30 August to change the English language intensive courses for overseas students entry criteria which affected the huge backlog of applicants for ELICOS courses. Resultant changes in criteria caused uncertainty in the minds of many applicants regarding their eligibility and, if ineligible, about the refund of their pre-paid fees.</PARA>
<PARA> To address these concerns, the Government has done a number of things. It has strengthened staffing in Beijing to accelerate processing of applications to remove the uncertainty of the threshold. It has negotiated an agreement, announced at the beginning of this week, with the Association of Recognised ELICOS Centres to refund fully all pre-paid fees and to make, in addition to that, a $100 goodwill payment, which is not to be a precedent for the future, but is a reflection of the financial cost that has been borne by those students who in good faith invested or borrowed large sums of money to put themselves in a position to take advantage of these courses which they are now not able to follow up. We have also agreed to examine the case for temporary financial assistance where it is independently determined that ELICOS institutions face substantial difficulties as a result of these arrangements. It is our intention, provided there is proper independent determination of this and not just a try-on, to ensure that the money that is owing to these students is paid. The ELICOS Association has also agreed that under these arrangements speedy refunds would be made. Constant discussions are taking place to ensure that that occurs.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government fully appreciates the disappointment that is motivating these students. I am certainly not suggesting that they do not have the right to demonstrate peacefully and express those concerns: far from it. Realistically, there is not much that we can do to alleviate the disappointment of those who will now miss out on access to Australia as a result of the new rules which, I think, are widely understood in the Australian community. But those who are worried about losing their money have had their concerns addressed. I hope that that message will get through more rapidly than it seems to have got through to date and that, as a result, we will see a progressive alleviation of the very disconcerting situation that presently exists in Shanghai.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the report. It was Mark Twain who said there are `lies, damned lies, and statistics'. On that ascending scale of condemnation this report would have to rate as one of Mark Twain's statistics. The document was commissioned by the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies Inc. as a basis for trying to provide some `scientific' justification for what was a pretty shoddy effort by way of a campaign being run against this Government and now, as a consequence of the Liberal Party's new vision on this subject, against the coalition as well, on our commitment to extend company tax to goldmining operations in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The key finding of the report is that the payment by goldmining companies or gold exploration companies of ordinary corporate taxation would mean a reduction in gold production in Western Australia by about 20 per cent, resulting in a net loss of 6,000 jobs, a loss to the State income of $300m, and a lump sum capital loss of $3.7 billion. Those conclusions, like many conclusions of lobby groups, are fashioned to justify an argument rather than objectively working out what is the case and what the objective truths are. I think this type of survey would be laughed out of court in academic circles. The Association's first problem is methodological. It asked gold companies to forecast their activities and how they would be modified in the future because of the introduction of ordinary corporate tax. The forecasts were to relate to the period between May and November last year. The sample size was 32 exploration and mining companies. Over 420 companies are exploring for gold and mining gold in Western Australia, approximately 100 of whom are miners and 320 explorers. It appears that none of the larger companies-companies that would actually have forward forecasting-were included in the sample; therefore, if smaller companies that were not as well organised as the major companies were asked, it is unlikely that they would have had plans. So in that case the survey would be biased.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no satisfactory exposition in the survey of the methodology used, so there is no process by which one can check the results. For example, we do not know how many forms were sent out soliciting information and what the response rate was on the returned forms. We do not know how many refused to comply with the survey on the grounds of commercial in-confidence and we do not know how many companies actually have forwarded plans for 1991-92. I would suggest that there was inadequate consideration of other phenomena which might impact on the mining industry: for example, what world bullion prices are and how they move; what type of incentive that provides for further exploration effort; and the fact that the industry in Australia has boomed and is peaking. A graph which simply projects that the boom will be endless would be a silly representation of where the industry is at.</PARA>
<PARA> However, I am advised that, using information gleaned from this report, an alternative conclusion is that there would not be a $3.7 billion capital loss but a $2.5 billion capital gain. So without an exposition of the methodology it is hard to work out exactly why that conclusion is as it is. I am also advised by the Western Australian Department of Mines that 8,844 people are employed in the goldmining industry in Western Australia. ACIL seemed to assume that for every one percentage point reduction in production there would be a loss of 120 jobs. That means that, in total, 2,400 jobs would be lost. It then multiplied that figure by 2.5 and came to a conclusion of 6,000. It has not justified why the multiplier is 2.5. I can only say that it is a figure that was plucked out of the air. As a consequence of those sorts of errors, the Mark Twain ascending list of condemnation indeed applies appropriately to this case.</PARA>

Does this substantial difference in payments to two groups who are to lose their jobs due to government decisions mean that a waterside worker is worth three times more than a timber worker, or does it mean that the Minister for Transport and Communications is three times more effective in Cabinet than the Minister for the Environment?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think at the time I was putting up with an Estimates committee that went on all day, which means that, occasionally, a few Ministers cannot get to Caucus meetings. Payments to workers who are retiring, being retrenched or whatever in these circumstances always have to have some relationship to the income. The income of workers is usually determined by what the market will pay. The market has been paying the waterside workers a lot of money for a long time. Whether that is justified is entirely a matter of opinion; obviously the market and the Government do not believe that that can go on forever and that is why so many of them are being retrenched.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, as Senator Boswell would be well aware but has never admitted in this chamber, timber workers in north Queensland were paid pathetic amounts of money by their employers; unionism was always discouraged; there were no redundancy packages for them whatsoever. They were the worst treated workers I have ever come across. Since the Government made its courageous and correct decision in north Queensland those workers have moved on to other jobs and are now doing very much better, as is north Queensland. That is why the issue has died so much in north Queensland. That is why we have won Federal seats on the issue and will now win State seats on it as well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate will be well aware that Australia, as an efficient producer of a wide range of agricultural commodities, has much to gain if the negotiations on agriculture, currently under way as part of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations, are successful in addressing the problems which currently bedevil world trade and agriculture-problems such as high levels of domestic support, protection and export subsidies. Australia, as a member of the Cairns Group under the very effective chairmanship of Michael Duffy, has been instrumental in advancing the progress of the negotiations. The United States proposal to which Senator Foreman refers draws heavily on ideas that have been promulgated by the Cairns Group. We are, therefore, very pleased with the proposal as it is clearly in line with the long term objectives of the agricultural negotiations to establish a fair and market-oriented agricultural trading system. At the heart of the United States proposal is the proposed conversion of import access barriers to tariffs and the eventual prohibition of export subsidies, and the most prevalent are trade distorting, internal support measures. The highly trade distorting nature of export subsidies is recognised and an accelerated five-year phase-down is proposed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator asked me what effect all this would have on Australian primary producers. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, in a study on United States grain policies in the world market, which was released just yesterday, estimated that the cost to Australia of the price discriminatory element alone of the United States export enhancement program in 1987 and 1988 was in the order of $US150m to $US238m. The United States has been reported as claiming that, were its proposal to be accepted by participants in the agricultural negotiations in Geneva, the benefit to consumers and taxpayers worldwide would be more than $US275 billion a year. The benefit to Australia's efficient primary producers, over the long term, again would amount to billions of dollars. Mr Duffy has already expressed Australia's support for the general thrust of the United States proposal in his recent discussions with the United States Trade Representative Carla Hills. The Cairns Group is currently developing its own comprehensive negotiating proposal prior to the next ministerial meeting of the group, which Mr Duffy will chair in Chiang Mai in Thailand on 21 to 23 November.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think everybody understands that indexation means that the real value of a payment is maintained over time. Many payments have been indexed for a number of years. For example, the age pension was first indexed in 1976. This year the Government made a decision for the first time ever to index virtually all social security payments and, most importantly, to index payments to families with children. Although such payments were not formally indexed in the past, since this Government has been in office such payments have been substantially increased in real terms, even though there was no formal indexation. For example, under the family assistance system, or the family assistance scheme, as we call it, in 1983 the payments per child were increased from $15 to $17; in 1984, to $19; in 1985, to $21; in 1986, from $21 to $22; in 1987, a very major increase from $22 to $27 for children under 13 and to $33 for children aged 13 and above; in 1988, the payments increased from $27 to $29 and $36 respectively; and this year the payments increased to $33 and $43 respectively, achieving the benchmark that the Government had set some years ago of payments equal to 15 and 20 per cent of the married rate pension.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since all those payments have been formally indexed, their value in real terms is guaranteed until such time as some government changes the legislation. The importance of indexation was recognised very clearly by Senator Chaney in 1976 when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> These adjustments-</PARA>
<PARA>and that adjustment was the indexation of the age pension to which I referred earlier-</PARA>
<PARA>do not depend upon the good will or the ill will of politicians. They will be automatic. This is an historical first in this country.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a pity that Senator Chaney did not deliver for Australian families when he was Minister for Social Security the same protection against erosion of real value that the Fraser Government, to its credit, delivered to age pensioners in 1976. I suppose it is even more of a pity that Senator Chaney continues not to recognise the importance of indexation of family payments. Indeed, it is very difficult to establish just what the Opposition's position is on this. Yesterday Senator Chaney said:</PARA>
<PARA>That all stands. That is a clear position. It has not changed in the statement.</PARA>
<PARA>That was in respect of family payments. On Tuesday, Mr Connolly, who was speaking on his own portfolio area for a change, said:</PARA>
<PARA>As with other pensions and benefits, the coalition supports their payment to families and their indexation.</PARA>
<PARA>But if we look at this morning's Sydney Morning Herald we discover that the Leader of the Opposition has clarified the Opposition's policy on indexation and made it clear that there is no commitment to index family allowances at all. The Opposition says that it believes in competition, variety and freedom of choice. It has certainly given the electors some freedom of choice. The electors can choose whichever one of the three mutually inconsistent policies that the Opposition has put up on this matter, among many others.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd may well be a beneficiary because it is a company that has an aggressive exploration policy in the Timor Sea. The main aspect of the agreement that relates to the question I have been asked is that it does delimit the area into three zones: a joint zone, zone A, between Australia and Indonesia, an Australian zone B, and an Indonesian zone C. It sets down a mining regime for both countries. It sets down a production sharing formula as well. It provides details for company and personal tax arrangements, details for employment conditions and details on how prior claims will be met.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The part relevant to the Northern Territory is that, as well, it provides for the administrative arrangements to oversee the operations in this area through a ministerial council with a joint authority to carry out its work. The headquarters of the joint authority will be located in Jakarta, but the technical directorate for the joint authority will be located in Darwin. Initially for Darwin that will mean some staffing, some location of equipment and some office space being taken in that city for the operations of this joint authority. Later next year I hope that the ministerial council and the authority can work to achieve a situation in which the joint governments announce a program of releases of offshore acreage for exploration purposes and invite companies to bid for the rights to explore in those areas. If that is the case, Darwin is located ideally for it to be a staging ground for a lot of offshore activity for oil explorers in the Timor Sea. Already it is the location of the major Australian Timor Sea exploration and production effort.</PARA>
<PARA> In zone A, the area that is jointly regulated by Indonesia and Australia, the main geological feature is a formation known as the Kelp structure. Many exploration experts have speculated that it may contain up to one billion barrels of oil. It could be oil; it could be gas; it could be sea water; but it is a very promising exploration target. I expect there to be very stiff competition between potential explorers for the rights to explore in that region. Zone B, the Australian area, is on the continental shelf and that too is an area of very high prospectivity.</PARA>
<PARA> If, following the exploration effort, there are significant discoveries, Darwin and the Northern Territory stand to benefit again as the potential staging post for the whole of the production operation. Therefore, this agreement, significant as it is between Australia and Indonesia for a host of reasons, some of which Senator Evans referred to in his statement today, is significant for the Northern Territory too for industry reasons. I add for the benefit of Senator Collins that, because of that, I notified the Minister for Mines and Energy in the Northern Territory, Mr Barry Coulter, of this this morning.</PARA>

<PARA>The Opposition is raising this matter today because it is of considerable importance for at least two reasons. The first is that it exposes the Queensland branch of the Australian Labor Party for what it is. It is a party which, even in opposition-and it is going to stay in opposition for a long time-seeks to drink from the taxpayers' cup through its discredited, dishonoured and dishonourable Federal big brother, the Hawke Labor Government in Canberra. The Hawke Government has mercilessly, brutally and deliberately bled Australian taxpayers to death during its seven years in government. On top of that, it has produced an economic crisis in Australia virtually without precedent. The second reason why the debate is important is that it exposes once and for all the totally political nature of the Hawke Government's so-called National Media Liaison Service, the NMLS, better known as `aNiMaLS'. It could be more accurately described as the Government's thought police. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Joe</PARA>
<PARA> Naturally this office stands ready to assist wherever possible during the State election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> I'd like to offer my services in dealing with any Federal issues in the agriculture, mining, rural and provincial affairs areas which I have no doubt will be raised during the campaign. </PARA>

<PARA> I would be obliged if you could pass this advice on to all candidates and sitting members. </PARA>
<PARA> I will also seek expanded monitoring of such issues from NMLS offices in Brisbane and Townsville. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Richardson was then asked a supplementary question by Senator Parer and in response to that he stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Like Mr Kerin, I will be most concerned to see during the course of not just the Queensland but the South Australian election as well that outrageous claims made about Commonwealth policy are answered. Because that tends to be the order of the day in election campaigns, I, too, will make sure that those States are well and truly monitored. Where statements are made that are outrageous, I will also make sure they are corrected. That is the proper role for the National Media Liaison Service. It is not a role in the campaign. </PARA>
<PARA>That answer contains absolute nonsense. It contains a complete lack of knowledge or a wilful misunderstanding and interpretation of the stated role of the directives issued by the Minister himself as to the functions of the NMLS. Amongst other things the Minister's directives to the NMLS as to what it is all about-this is the fourth point-says:</PARA>
<PARA>Representatives will not work with local or State Party Branches and will not be involved in Party programs nor electoral campaigning. </PARA>
<PARA>It is simply not possible to interpret that function, that directive, to the NMLS in terms of what it shall or shall not do to enable it to play the role that is being envisaged for it by Mr Kerin's office. It says that representatives-I repeat this-will not work with local or State branches and will not be involved in party programs nor in electoral campaigning. Absolutely totally what Mr Kerin's office is offering Mr Goss's office is assistance in State electoral campaigning. There is no other way in which that can possibly be interpreted. That is not really surprising because the whole history of the NMLS, the `aNiMaLS', since this Government came to office and established aNiMaLS, in 1983, has been to turn it progressively into a blatant political party organisation at taxpayers' expense. </PARA>

That was John Brown's portfolio. It went there because John Brown was a political heavyweight. He had the political nose. Honourable senators should look at what has happened to John Brown. He certainly had a nose. Paul Kelly gave the reasons for this change in an article in the Australian on 22 September last year. Kelly said that the change was made because the unit was seen to be ineffective in the 1984 Federal election. He said that Mr Brown took it over and gave it a political thrust. When it had done its work after the 1987 election, very effectively I must say-I believe there is a reasonable argument to mount that the 1987 election was won for the Government by `aNiMaLS'-it went back to the Minister for Administrative Services. </PARA>
<PARA> In the run-up to the next election it has gone back to Senator Richardson-the numbers man of the ALP, the wheeler and dealer of the ALP, the complete political animal, the Minister for truth and, as so aptly described recently in the Sydney Morning Herald, the keeper of the `aNiMaLS'. That change back to Senator Richardson was made without any public announcement at all. It is extraordinary that at the beginning of 1989 when this transfer was made back to Senator Richardson the National Media Liaison Service, the disseminator of government information, did not put out a press statement. There was no statement made at all of that transfer. In the Estimates committee hearing just three or four months earlier, when I quoted a Sydney Morning Herald report that the transfer would be made to Senator Richardson, Senator Ray, the Minister at the table at the time, rubbished me and said that I should not listen to every ragbag news report that I get. Three or four months later it has gone exactly the way it had been predicted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's concern with the operations of the NMLS has been well documented over a lengthy period. Many members of the Opposition-Senator Baume, Senator Messner, I and many others-have pointed attention increasingly to the overt political nature of this organisation. The first guideline of the National Media Liaison Service, as laid down by the relevant Minister of the day-now Senator Richardson-says that its role is to provide accurate and timely information on government policies and programs to the media throughout Australia as well as information on policies to interest groups within electorates. I repeat that: to provide accurate and timely information on government policies and programs. Michelle Grattan, in a notable speech last December in terms of the operations of the Government in the media area, amongst other things, said:</PARA>
<PARA>More controversial on the propaganda front is the work of the NMLS. It is a questionable use of taxpayers' money because it is totally political. One of the more extraordinary features about it is that perhaps 80 per cent of the transcripts it has put out publicly this year are not from government Ministers but from the Opposition. It is the Ministry of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA>The Director of the NMLS, Colin Parks, was questioned before the Estimates Committee three weeks ago about the role of `aNiMaLs'. He was asked specifically to comment, and to quantify the degree of dissemination of opposition material as distinct from government material, that was made. He was not prepared to either agree or disagree with Michelle Grattan's estimate that 80 per cent of the work of the unit, in terms of the transcripts put around, was involved with Opposition material. That is an extraordinary situation for the director of the Government's unit to be in. He is the person who is in charge. He is the person who directs the activities of the unit. He is the person who wears two hats. He is not only the Director of the National Media Liaison Service but also the Director of the Ministerial Media Group. When questioned as to his political activities he said that as a director of the NMLS he does not do anything political. What he, in effect, does is put on his Ministerial Media Group hat. The role of the Ministerial Media Group and of the leader of that group is to provide advice to the Government, which obviously would be of a political nature. There is a con, a confusion and blurring of lines there at great cost to the taxpayers. It is a dishonest attempt by the Government to disguise the activities of the director of the Media Liaison Service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Service is supposed to provide, according to the guidelines, information to members of parliament and senators. There is nothing in the guidelines to suggest that there be a discrimination between Government members and senators and Opposition members and senators. Indeed, on 21 September this year in a television interview when the Minister, Senator Richardson, was asked whether there was discrimination, he said that he was not aware of anyone ever having been denied access to a transcript. He was wrong. It was only in the Estimates Committee three weeks later that the Director of the NMLS, Colin Parks, agreed that there had been a long-standing decision not to service Opposition members and senators. That was absolutely contrary to what Senator Richardson had told millions of viewers on television on 21 September. Because he had made that mistake and had misinformed-I will not use a stronger term-television viewers as to the breadth of coverage of the NMLS he subsequently, and, conveniently, just before the Estimates Committee met, issued a directive instructing Mr Parks that in future he was to supply transcripts to all members and senators on request. The activities of the NMLS in terms of servicing and dissemination of information to members of parliament have, from its inception until three weeks ago, been absolutely contrary and discriminatory in relation to its guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the question of the role that the NMLS and the Federal Government will play in the State election in Queensland. It is not just a matter of the services of the NMLS; there will be the full blast of the Ministerial Media Group. No doubt there will be full use of the 60 or more consultants who, over the last year or so, have been in the paid employ of Government Ministers at a cost to the taxpayer well in excess of $2m. The use of consultants is to get around the so-called guidelines on staffing in the Public Service and ministerial offices, and the cost of consultants has increased fivefold in the last four years. When we add that to the $12m-plus cost of the NMLS and the uncosted additional amounts of the Ministerial Media Group, we get a huge body of apparatchiks doing nothing but support, at public expense, the blatant political activities of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, a government, or any political party, has to be political. It would not exist if it were not. But it is wrong and disgraceful that any political party should undertake all its political activities at the taxpayers' expense. This Government has done that since the day it came in. It has been bleeding the taxpayers of this country dry. It will use its ministry of truth unit to play a role in the forthcoming Queensland election campaign-I will bet my bottom dollar that it will do exactly the same in the South Australian campaign-in a way that I believe every Australian would be outraged about. </PARA>

Whatever happened to any sort of careful analysis of the behaviour of the Queensland Government? If someone happens to be in Queensland just before the 6 o'clock news on Sunday night and watches any one of three commercial television stations he will see a five-minute program paid for by the Queensland Government called Queensland 2000. It is no coincidence that for the last five weeks Ministers in marginal seats have been featured on Queensland 2000. Since Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen left office-and we all thought he had elevated this to an art form-Ahern and then Cooper have managed to spend $25m on paid Government political advertising. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McMullan might be right once again; he could be. Let us get it straight about today's matter of public importance. It is not so much an attack on the National Media Liaison Service (NMLS) as a desperate attempt by this Opposition to divert some more attention from the horrible week it has had. And it has been horrible. Shadow Minister after shadow Minister has bitten the dust. Let us ask Mr Braithwaite and Dr Hewson what sort of a week they have had. Let us ask Mr Connolly what sort of a week he has had. They have had a rotten week-and I understand that-but they ought to be used to it by now. They ought to be accustomed to it. The difficulty is, of course, that every time the Opposition goes through one of these bad weeks and the National Media Liaison Service, as part of its legitimate role, highlights one of these incredible gaffes and the gallery write about it, and the Opposition says once again, `Let's shoot the messenger'. But it cannot keep shooting the messengers. Members of the Opposition have to stop shooting themselves. They have the most shot-off feet in Australian political history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I notice that Senator Michael Baume is going to speak in this debate. He is a past master. His efforts during the 1987 election campaign were a far greater contribution to Labor's victory than anything the National Media Liaison Service could ever have contemplated. To this day we remain grateful to Senator Michael Baume. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Media Liaison Service is not a new organisation. It is not a new idea. Senator Short talked about Mr Young establishing it in 1983, but all Mr Young did was rename an organisation which was formed under the Fraser Government, when it was called the Government Information Unit (GIU). The real crime of the National Media Liaison Service in Senator Short's eyes is that, unlike the Government Information Unit, it is efficient and effective. Of course, that is another reason for this attack-it is because it does such a good job that it causes so much irritation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the historical record. Let us see what we inherited as a government-the notorious forerunner of the National Media Liaison Service, the Government Information Unit. I want to draw on some documents, documents which can be on the public record, to show just how hypocritical this whole debate is. The Senate will realise that normally governments do not have access to the confidential records of their predecessors-and neither should they-but the Government Information Unit could not even manage to shred the files when the Fraser Government was thrown out in 1983. Two manila folders survived for posterity, and I am glad that they did. </PARA>
<PARA> The first document I want to refer to is stamped `Confidential'. It is dated December 1978 and appears to be the extract of a Cabinet document. I am happy to table a copy of that document for the record. It reports a proposal to appoint liaison officers in the State capitals following a report from the GIU that the media in the States was unusually susceptible-a great phrase-to anti-Canberra and anti-government stories. The paper set out the functions of those liaison officers for this forerunner of the National Media Liaison Service. I want to quote to the Senate exactly what `his' role was-there being no suggestion, of course, that there could have been a `her' in there, in the male chauvinistic environment in which the Fraser Government lived. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA>- To report regularly on significant State issues which have or could have relevance to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>- To disseminate effectively Government information in his State. </PARA>
<PARA>- To liaise and communicate with Ministers and Members, State and Federal; Division Officers; Media; Special Interest Groups. </PARA>
<PARA>All that is fine-how could we complain?-but let me read the next paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA>- To monitor, analyse and report on television and radio current affairs and comment programs as they affect the Commonwealth Government in any way. </PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what the National Media Liaison Service does now. There were no complaints from Senator Short or Senator Michael Baume, who were members of the Fraser Government, about the Government Information Unit. One can search Hansard all day and night, but one will not find any complaints from them. They were very happy to have a government body doing exactly what the present one does. The document goes further:</PARA>
<PARA>- To undertake responsibility for arrangements for Ministerial visits to the State concerned to ensure best media coverage and full use of a Minister's time. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, the National Media Liaison Service officers are occasionally involved in that practice. They certainly do not have responsibility for itineraries, but help out where they can. It is the next sentence which shows the difference in character of the Government Information Unit of the Liberal-National Party Government from that of the National Media Liaison Service now. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>- To maintain close contact with party officials in the State, keeping them fully informed of developments on the Federal scene. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat, `close contact with party officials in the State'. </PARA>
<PARA>The sad thing for the hypocrites who want to build something out of this debate is that nowhere in our literature, nowhere in the records of campaign meetings of the Australian Labor Party, will they find anything about National Media Liaison Service officers keeping Party officials fully informed. Their roles are separate. They are not permitted to do that. But the Fraser Government permitted an organisation to do it directly and deliberately, and that is what condemns Senator Short today. The Labor Party has no record of any close contact with GIU officers; the Australian Democrats have no record of close contact with GIU officers; so to which Party was this document referring? It was the Liberal Party of Australia, and it may have been the National Party of Australia. That was a truly disgraceful use of taxpayers' money and one that I, as the Minister responsible, simply will not permit. </PARA>
<PARA> These so-called liaison officers in the GIU were to be appointed, at taxpayers' expense, to work for the Liberal Party. That is not just an allegation, because the fact that they did so was documented just three years later, on 8 April 1981, when the Labor Party had incorporated in Hansard some documents leaked from the Liberal Party. I want to table those documents. There is no need to keep them secret, after all, because the Liberal Party was never secretive about the use of Government money for its own election campaigns. One document, a media guide, states:</PARA>
<PARA>This modest `Media Guide' simply provides some useful hints on obtaining local coverage and on maintaining a mutually beneficial relationship with the media.</PARA>
<PARA> For the seasoned campaigner, the guide may serve as a handy `checklist'. </PARA>
<PARA>What it did not say is that, for the seasoned rorter, it showed the way to use Government money for political purposes. Unfortunately, the Government of the day allowed GIU staff to attend election campaign planning meetings, and that is where Senator Short stands condemned because, when that was going on, he had nothing whatsoever to say about it. There is no record of any member of the Fraser Government at any time raising the slightest query about this use of taxpayers' funds-a use which I have said I, as the Minister, would simply not permit because it is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear from the documents which I have tabled that the GIU had a key role in the Liberal Party campaign apparatus. If one looks at how far it went, one realises that the Fraser Government-of which Senator Short and Senator Michael Baume were members-had no shame whatsoever. Not only was the GIU used to campaign against other political parties, but it also ran the personal vendettas of the Prime Minister. I remember a certain Minister resigning because, he said, Mr Fraser had a manic obsession to get his own way. Honourable senators opposite may remember that person. His name is Andrew Peacock. The problem for Mr Peacock was that, within seconds of his making that now-famous speech at a press conference, Malcolm Fraser was listening to a GIU-provided tape of what Mr Peacock had had to say. That Government not only blatantly-to use the word in the Opposition's own motion-used the GIU against its political opponents, but also used it against members of its own Party. There can be no more disgraceful use of taxpayers' money than that which took place while the Government Information Unit existed. Some background notes on current issues for candidates dated May 1981 really told it all. Russell Schneider, a former Fraser Government press secretary, became a journalist and wrote in the Weekend Australian on 14 March 1981 as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The Unit (the Government Information Unit) became a handy off-shoot of the Liberal Party at last year's election campaign, being able to monitor news broadcasts and help Ministers arrange their programs. </PARA>
<PARA>The Labor Party remembers that because of what the GIU did in relation to capital gains tax during the 1980 election campaign. There was no doubt about where the GIU stood and what it was being used for, but all we got from the Liberal Party was silence. There was not a word-not a syllable-uttered against that disgraceful use of public money. </PARA>
<PARA> It gets worse. We have heard talk today about bleeding the taxpayer dry, about how much the National Media Liaison Service costs. Let us look at the costs. The GIU's budget for 1982-83, seven years ago, was $1.4m. The National Media Liaison Service spent less than $1.2m in 1988-89. Six or seven years later it could not spend as much as its predecessor had spent. That is how disgraceful that operation was. </PARA>

No Minister in the Fraser Government ever took the slightest interest in making sure that it behaved with propriety. As I have said, no-one could testify better on that point than Andrew Peacock.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 11 November 1982 the Senate was told of yet another Government Information Unit document. This time, the Government Information Unit was not harassing the Labor Party or spying on its own members. No, it had gone further; it had found yet another function. This function was to harass interviewers to make sure that they were put off during their attempts to interview Government members. Of course, it referred to Derryn Hinch. The advice was to distract his producer or his researcher outside while the interview was being conducted so that no notes could be passed on to poor Derryn. Of course, this does not say much for Mr Hinch. I want to defend him. I cannot imagine why the Government Information Unit would have such a low regard for him. But that is what happened. </PARA>
<PARA> It also makes one wonder what the Unit thought of the Government Ministers being interviewed by Mr Hinch; how hopeless it must have thought they were. There it was again in black and white: how to distract the interviewer. That is the sort of puerile nonsense that this Unit carried on with. That does not happen today, and as long as I am the responsible Minister I will make sure that it does not happen. There is no doubt that the Government Information Unit spent much of its time monitoring what was said about Government policies. I and the Government can have no query whatsoever about that. That is a legitimate role for such a unit. It is a legitimate and necessary function of that kind of organisation. Governments obviously have to know about criticisms and misinformation campaigns so that they can respond to them. That is what the National Media Liaison Service now does. It monitors, transcribes and analyses criticisms of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no secret that most of that criticism will come from the Opposition. Because the job has been done efficiently for so long, Opposition members have finally learned how much damage it is doing them. I suggest to Senator Short, Senator Michael Baume, Senator Messner and anyone else in the Opposition that, if they were to perform properly, they would not have a problem. The only thing that has been exposed today is their terror of their inability. They cannot perform; they cannot get their act together; none of them knows where the others stand; and they are caught out on an hourly basis. As they say in the classics: that is tough cheese. It will keep happening as long as this Opposition cannot fire. The National Media Liaison Service will continue its role and Opposition members will continue to suffer as long as the quality of their performance is as it has been today. That will not make its role illegitimate. </PARA>

Anyone listening to what he said will, I presume, now be totally convinced of the merit of the Opposition's case against both him, as the Minister in charge, and the National Media Liaison Service (NMLS), which has now become a clear and blatant political instrument of this Government paid for by the people of Australia. It is a political instrument not simply of this Government but of any Labor Party government in any State in Australia that happens to be in an election environment. How do we know that? We see it from the letter which was tabled in this place today as part of a question asked by Senator Parer from Queensland. He simply asked whether `aNiMaLS' would be involved in the Queensland campaign. The Minister replied:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The National Media Liaison Service will not have a role in the Queensland and South Australian elections, neither should it. </PARA>
<PARA>When he then heard the contents of the letter, he gave the most nonsensical, dissembling reply, in which he said that, of course, it will be monitoring what people say about Commonwealth policy in these elections because in an election campaign `that tends to be the order of the day'. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>I, too, will make sure that those States are well and truly monitored. Where statements are made that are outrageous, I will also make sure that they are corrected. </PARA>
<PARA>I draw the attention of Senator Richardson to the text of the letter from the office of Mr John Kerin, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and one of the outstandingly honest members of this Government, as can be seen by the fact that he is always in total conflict with his colleagues, and is at the moment. Mr Kerin's office has written to the office of the Queensland Opposition Leader, Mr Goss. The letter states, `I will also seek expanded monitoring' Not just monitoring. I give honourable senators the key words: `Because there is an election campaign I will seek expanded monitoring'. Can there by anything clearer than that? This is a political response to a political situation at the public's cost, because the people involved are employed at the cost of the taxpayers. They are to participate in an expanded monitoring of such issues-for no other reason than that there is an election campaign on in Queensland. That is in the letter. It is not the normal monitoring that goes on out of the Townsville spying office or the Brisbane spying office, the propaganda office, the Goebbels office in those centres; this is expanded for one reason only-and it is clear-because there is an election campaign. Yet this Minister got up here and quite happily said, `Nothing like that would happen. I would not respond and take part in a State election campaign'. He is condemned because of this letter. What is worse is that there was not one word of apology from this Minister for misleading this place. </PARA>

<PARA> If the Minister is unaware of them, I will quickly go through another response to a question about the number of press people around. For example, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has one adviser press secretary but many other press people. The Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis): one journalist. The Treasurer (Mr Keating): one journalist. The Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh): one journalist. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris): one journalist. That goes on for pages in the document I have. Each Minister has his own little propaganda operation. This Minister pretends that this is the same as happened under Fraser. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me tell honourable senators that I think there were five press secretaries under the Fraser Government. That Government created the Government Information Unit (GIU) to make up for the fact that Ministers did not have their own press secretaries. The Minister knows that but he seeks to come in here and to deceive this place by pretending that `aNiMaLS' is exactly the same as the GIU was under Fraser. What absolute nonsense! How much are people in `aNiMaLS' getting? They must be very good. They are being paid as much as a member of Parliament. These journos who are trying to destroy the Opposition, who are acting in a political way, are being paid exactly the same as a politician. I suppose that is only fair because they are acting as political animals. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister clearly knows as little about what the journalists are getting as he knows about what they are doing. Their pay is $54,691 including the $9,104 per annum payable in addition to salary to occupants of these positions. On top of that Mr Parks gets about $62,000, as I recall it. That is what Mr Parks gets-Mr Parks who manages to operate at election time; the man who runs this non-political operation. According to the Minister, `I would not let someone run a political operation'. Mr Parks who runs that operation at election times operates out of the campaign headquarters of the Australian Labor Party. The Minister cannot deny that. He just says, `He is wearing a different hat when he operates'. It is absolutely incredible. </PARA>

<PARA> We have a clear situation where there has been this massive build-up in the number of people and the cost to the public of a propaganda operation funded at considerable expense and doing far more-in a far more devious way, I might say-than can ever be claimed was the activity of the previous organisation. Let me deal very quickly with this point. As the Minister said-he tabled some documents-there have been some discussions in the past about what was the role of the Fraser Government's group. I can remember Mr Dawkins and Mr Duffy in 1981 thumping their breasts and saying how disgraceful it was that there was a Government Information Unit. Mr Duffy in the House of Representatives said about the Government:</PARA>
<PARA>It will learn that the people of Australia will not, and should not, tolerate public servants being used as part of the Liberal Party machine. </PARA>
<PARA>Is it not incredible how the morality suddenly changes when those opposite get their snouts in the trough? Is it not also incredible that those opposite allege that the documents that were tabled show a massive GIU involvement in political activity under the Fraser Government?

We will go into that later. To pretend that the GIU whose monitoring role was exactly as I have outlined it here-honourable senators may have some arguments about its other role, about the fact that some GIU people sat in on meetings-was doing nothing like what the Minister is now encouraging and paying with taxpayers' money the National Media Liaison Service to undertake is nonsense. To pretend otherwise is deliberate nonsense and is done with the intention of misleading the people of Australia about the way in which their money is being used in this disgraceful way.

Just look at the difference between the role of the GIU then and the role of the current organisation. As to the Tasmanian reference, we have an accusation that because a member of the GIU attended a Liberal Party of Australia meeting he was therefore deeply involved at government expense in the Tasmanian election. If this Minister is trying to pretend that a person is not entitled to attend such a meeting-not to participate, not to be involved in the campaigning-or does not have the democratic right to go to a campaign meeting, then I say that this Minister has even less idea about the democratic process than I expect him to have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that the National Media Liaison Service will participate, and it is being instructed by this Government to participate, in a State election campaign. There has never ever under the GIU been such an instruction. But let us see what the media says. The media agrees with me. Peter Bowers said:</PARA>

They ignored the previous speaker for the Opposition. I do not blame them one bit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was not in the House of Representatives between 1975 and 1983. I would love to have been there when Mr Short, as he then was, and Mr Michael Baume, as he then was, got up and said, `We have received this terrible transcript from the GIU'. They tore it up and said, `Never bring this to us again. This is a misuse of taxpayers' funds. We are shocked and appalled'. They attacked the Fraser Government. They said, `Tear it up and put in a brown paper bag'. It might even have been the sort of brown paper bag that Sir Joh thought he was receiving. They would never have tolerated such a thing. </PARA>
<PARA> I am actually thinking of dismissing my research officer to whom I said, `Go through the Hansards. Find all the times that they spoke about it'. He said, `There were not any'. I thought: that cannot be right; these honourable men would not have said something today and nothing seven or eight years ago. These are people who are outraged. These are people of consistent moral uprightness. They would have been concerned; they would have spoken out'. But actually I think my research officer was right, that in all those years they never said a word. They sat there mute and indolent hoping that nobody would find out. </PARA>
<PARA> The voters might not have found out about the Government Information Unit (GIU) but they certainly found out about Messrs Short and Baume. That is why they are here now-they were kicked out very quickly from the other place. What are they actually complaining about? What is their complaint in terms of the national role of the National Media Liaison Service (NMLS)? They are not saying that the NMLS tells lies about us. They are saying the NMLS tells the truth about us. People find out what we have actually said. There has not been one occasion on which anybody has said that the NMLS has misinformed people about the comments made by shadow Ministers. They are saying that the NMLS accurately informed people about what we had said. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not blame some people for being outraged about having the truth told about them. This can be very embarrassing and it has been very embarrassing from time to time for some of the participants in this debate. I understand that, but this is really not the basis for confected moral outrage. If one stands up in public and says that certain things ought not to be done, one is going to be judged by what one has done in the past. The two people who have already spoken in this debate and Senator Messner, who will speak after me, were beneficiaries of the Government Information Unit in its legitimate activities and, I am quite certain, in its illegitimate activities. </PARA>
<PARA> What on earth is happening? Are Senator Baume and Senator Short saying that no government should monitor what people say about it? There are two reasons that every government since the advent of newspapers and particularly since the invention of the tape recorder has endeavoured to monitor what people say about it. I accept that one of them is a partisan reason and that everybody does it-that is, we need to find out what people are saying about us so that we can respond. But we also need to find out what people are saying about us because sometimes this is useful information to have. Of course, during the period of State elections, particularly when Queensland conservative governments are in desperate trouble, we find that wilder and wilder allegations tend to be made about the Federal Government. I suppose it does take a little more effort on the part of NMLS to track down what people might be saying about the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to refer back for just a moment to the pretended outrage that NMLS should provide transcripts of things that are said by the Opposition. I have before me a document headed `Government Information Unit, Transcript of 2CA News, June 19 1981'. I thought: This must be a document which contains something important that had been said by some person in the Government. But, no, the document contained what had been said by Bill Hayden. It is a transcript of what the then Leader of the Opposition said. </PARA>

I would have thought that this was quite proper; perhaps Mr Baume, as he then was, does not. That is his proper judgment. But it is entirely consistent with current activities, as it should be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The letter that has been the cause of this so-called furore is an absolute non-event. I was not in the chamber for Question Time. A colleague said that a letter had been incorporated in Hansard. I wondered whether something dramatic was in it. But that letter is saying that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) is going to try to find out what is said about Government policy during the course of the Queensland State election. Would not he be a very strange character if he did not do that, with all of those National Party desperates running around the back blocks of Queensland trying to drum up any reason to win a vote? Of course, we have it on very good authority what a bunch of desperates they are. We have the de facto shadow Minister for something or other, Mr Howard, saying today:</PARA>
<PARA> The Nationals warrant a spell on the sidelines. Their organisation deserves a clean-out. If accountability in government has any meaning they have failed some of the most basic tests . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is why the Liberal Party is trying to create a diversion today about the Queensland election. As Mr Howards says in that article, everybody knows that the Liberal Party cannot govern in its own right. That is not a controversial remark; I think it is a unanimous view. Certainly, Mr Howard is correct. He is a good enough analyst to accept that it is true. Therefore, the Liberals have to govern with the National Party, this bunch of people who warrant a spell on the sidelines; this bunch of people whose organisation deserves a clean-out; this bunch of people who, in government, have failed the most basic tests of accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators opposite do not want the public to know what has occurred down south, as the Queenslanders might say, so they thought they would whip up some mock drama to try to divert attention. But it will not work. The Australian people and Queenslanders are going to be aware of the significance of coalition government in Queensland for two reasons. The first is the very effective demolition by Mr Howard of two myths-that the Liberal Party might govern in its own right and that the National Party might be a fit partner with which one could go into coalition. The second reason is that the Western Australian coalition partners are proving how impossible it is to run a decent government in coalition, bearing in mind the state of relations between the Liberal and National parties in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Liberal Party has said, `I will not be in the same room as the Leader of the National Party. I will not work with him ever again. We will not work with the Nationals until they change their leader'. It sounds remarkably like Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen in the lead-up to the 1983 election. The relations that soured then have never recovered. The coalition knows that, if people ever get the chance to concentrate on whether or not a viable alternative government to a Goss Labor government exists, they will say, `No, it does not. The Liberal Party cannot govern in its own right. We do not want that bunch of desperates from the National Party back again and a coalition would be inherently unstable'. So we have a situation where there is a desperate attempt to cover up for the inadequacies of the Queensland Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Concern has been expressed about the use of taxpayers' money in State elections. Let me make two references. I will not speak about the National Party, whose rorting of the system was so effectively established by Senator Richardson. Rather, I will refer to the Liberal Party. Senator Baume was responsible for misleading the Senate. I am sure that this was inadvertent. He would not have done it deliberately because I know that he has respect for the chamber. We disagree on a lot of things but not on that. Senator Baume said that the person who worked for the GIU to whom I had referred by way of interjection had been to a public election meeting in Tasmania in 1982 and that it was his democratic right to do so. Of course it is his democratic right to go to any public meeting of any party, although he probably would not have had one if he had gone to a Labor Party one. I do not challenge his democratic right to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tasmanian Liberal Party does some funny things, but I do not think it conducts its campaign committee meetings in public. The minutes of the Tasmanian Liberal Party campaign committee, which was preparing its State election campaign in 1982, reveal that Mr Montgomery was playing a key role in the Liberal Party's campaign for that election. This was revealed by Senator Button in the Senate on 11 November 1982. The information was accurate then and it has never been refuted to this day. It may be that somebody in Canberra did not know about it, but there is no doubt that it was done and that taxpayers' money was used in that State election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberals in the Queensland coalition Government were a so-called check on the excesses of the National Party. While the coalition parties were in government in Queensland this abuse of the advertising process went on, just as it is going on now with the Queensland 2000 program. It had a different name in those days and now and again, very rarely, a Liberal Minister was allowed to go on the program, as long as he did not say anything with which the National Party did not agree. But the Liberal Party did not ask that its hands not be sullied. It did not say, `This might be some misuse of the taxpayers' funds and we do not want to know about it'. It said, `Please let us into the white cars at any price'. That is what this debate is about. </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Liberal Party knows that if ever a party had a classic situation where it ought to do very well in an election, it is the Queensland Liberal Party because although the Queensland Government has been absolutely discredited, it has been there for 32 years. When people are not used to change, the easiest campaign position in the world is to go back just six years-not 32 years-to how it used to be in coalition. As a person who has been a bit of an analyst of election campaigns a bit too long, I say that would be a very easy campaign to run and that one would have to be a mug to blow it-and the mugs have blown it! Despite the very easy campaign that they ought to be able to run, they know that the opinion polls are saying that three years ago they had a golden opportunity and they blew it. They are now doing it again, so they have rung up down here asking for something that might divert attention from the fact that the only real alternative Premiers are Russell Cooper and Wayne Goss. </PARA>
<PARA> We have this desperate attempt by Mr Howard to talk about Mr Angus Innes as the third man of Queensland politics-sort of the Harry Lime of Queensland. That really is not a goer. There might be some very interesting analogies in that reference in terms of the way Queensland politics is being conducted, but it does not take us very far as a proposal that he can be seriously considered as the Premier. Not even the Liberal Party considered that. It wanted to throw him out and get a new leader before the election, but she would not come into the Parliament because she knew that the Liberals could not get elected. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition knows it cannot win in Queensland; it knows that the National Party is discredited; and it knows that the Liberal Party cannot win. The Liberal Party does not want the public to become aware of the fact that it can govern only with the discredited Nationals. It wants to divert attention from Mr Howard's very effective demolition job of the National Party. It wants to divert attention from the absolute debacle in the coalition in Western Australia and pretend that this confected outrage about a letter from someone who does not even work for the National Media Liaison Service, who is not offering the services of the National Media Liaison Service to the Labor Party, if stretched far enough might justify a rehash of all the old speeches about the NMLS. The Liberal Party thinks that, if it pretends that the GIU did not provide information to all the people who were to participate in this debate on behalf of the Liberal Party, it might just divert the attention of one or two voters. All I can say is that the Australian Democrats and the Press Gallery both got it right: they did not bother to turn up. The proposal does not warrant the time of the Senate. It is a pity that we are not debating the Appropriation Bills; the sooner we get back to them the better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Any observer of politics knows that where mock rage and anger are spilled out across the chamber, as they were by the two Government members who have just spoken, there is a gross failure on the part of those speakers to address the real issues. It is about time that we reminded ourselves what they are. This matter of public importance, so ably moved today by my colleague, Senator Short, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Hawke Government's misuse of the taxpayer-funded National Media Liaison Service for blatant party political purposes in ALP state election campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the general proposition, but what are the specifics about which we are talking? I will make the case that there is no point easier to prove than that the Labor Party at this very moment is misusing the National Media Liaison Service (NMLS) in the Queensland context by virtue of the evidence that has been produced by a letter addressed from the office of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, to his colleague, the Leader of the Australian Labor Party in Queensland, Mr Goss. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is it so easy to prove? First, Senator Richardson, who led for the Government on this debate, made the point at the outset that this is in response to activities of the present National Party Government in Queensland. Senator Richardson referred to a television program that has been running not for the last few months, not for the last few years, but for many years to promote aspects of Queensland Government activity. He then used this as a justification for why the Labor Party has used the NMLS to become involved in the election campaign in Queensland. No case could be easier to prove than that. Senator Richardson spoke those words. He has demonstrated that the only reason for the NMLS to be involved is that it needs to counter the activities of the Queensland National Party Government. He has admitted that this electoral activity is being undertaken. That being so, what are the tests of the Hawke Government's approach in terms of whether we can rely on what it has set down as guidelines for managing the NMLS? I turn to the statement by Senator Robert Ray who, on 23 October 1987 in a Senate Estimates committee, spelt out quite clearly the role and function of the NMLS. Point (d) states:</PARA>
<PARA> Representatives will not work with local or State Party branches and will not be involved in Party programs nor electoral campaigning. </PARA>
<PARA>That proves the point: it is the intention of the Government, by its own rules, that the NMLS will not be involved in electoral campaigning. As I have already pointed out, Senator Richardson has condoned the activities of the NMLS by drawing attention to the fact that it is there for one purpose only; that is, to combat the activities of the National Party Government in Queensland. The case has been proven by Senator Richardson himself. There is every reason, therefore, for the Government to desist immediately from this activity and the NMLS should withdraw from its activities in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these things are well known. During the 1987 Federal election campaign, the newly appointed head of the NMLS, Colin Parks, became involved in political activities. We know of the way in which transcripts not only were prepared and disseminated to Government Ministers for their information, but also were spread around like confetti to the Press Gallery so that the arguments could be picked up by the Press Gallery and used against the Opposition parties at that time. Senator McMullan tried, in a plausible way, to make out that somehow, as long as the NMLS monitors the operations of the Opposition and then spreads the transcripts around to Ministers, that is okay. I have to say that we in the Liberal and National parties would agree with that. However, that is not where the matter stops. As we all know, the operations of the NMLS go to spreading around information of this kind and Mr Parks and his offsiders actively promote points to the press in such a way as to ensure that the Government's point of view is put across and that the Opposition is seen in the worst possible light. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what is wrong with the argument that Senator McMullan and Senator Richardson have put forward. That is why they have failed to convince us on this side of the Parliament that there is any validity in what has happened. It is just fortuitous that, as luck would have it, the letter referred to in this debate, which was addressed to Mr Goss, that so-called self-proclaimed paragon of virtue in Queensland-the Leader of the Labor Party-stated that, in fact, he was entitled to get all the support he might claim from the Federal National Media Liaison Service which is paid for by the taxpayer and operated by the Hawke Labor Government. That is the case in a nutshell. We do not have to go too far back to demonstrate that that is the core of today's debate. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the House know, from our investigation in the Estimates committees, that in the period since the Government came to power in 1983 the cost of running the NMLS is more than $12m. Furthermore, we are aware of the considerable activities of press secretaries who operate from ministerial offices. There is also, literally, a football team-if not more-of consultants who have similar capacities over and above those of the press secretaries paid for from the ministerial vote. A consultant to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), Mr N. G. Freudenberg, who is well-known to us all, undertakes the political role for the Prime Minister in many ways. In Mr Lionel Bowen's office, a Mr Ainsworth undertakes media relations activities on behalf of Mr Bowen. Mr Geoff Walsh, who is also in Mr Bowen's office, undertakes similar activities. In Senator Button's office a Mr Bremner is there to monitor, evaluate and advise at a high level on press releases and matters of that kind. A Dr Gold is also in that office. In the office of Senator Gareth Evans, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, there is a Mr B. A. Grant. The list goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I would make is that, irrespective of what the Government claims is the cost of the National Media Liaison Service, this is just the tip of the iceberg because below that is the cost to the taxpayer of several million dollars paid to consultants who act in much the same capacity as-and no doubt in conjunction with-the taxpayer-funded National Media Liaison Service. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague points out, it is a way of getting round the rules. It is well-known in the Public Service that consultants are often used in this capacity. This is supplementary information which has not been revealed. We have no way of challenging these payments because they are hidden in the bowels of the Budget. Consequently, they are appointments which we cannot raise during debate in the Parliament. We can mention them only in the context of this kind of activity. We would like the Government to tell us what the real cost is of its thought police operations in this country. Quite obviously they are having a significant impact on the taxpayer's dollar and obviously they are being used for straight-out political activities. That case has been overwhelmingly proven today by speakers from the Liberal and National parties and admitted, by way of implication, by the Minister in charge of the National Media Liaison Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to some of the furphies that are around. Senator McMullan and Senator Richardson have said that the head of the NMLS, Mr Parks, takes no part in the political activities of the Australian Labor Party. That would have to be one of the greatest nonsenses of all time. We know, as it has been admitted, that in the 1987 election campaign Mr Parks was ensconced in John Curtin House, the Australian Labor Party's building in Canberra, during every meeting and operation of the Labor Party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Reid points out, it was all at taxpayers' expense. Are we to believe that he was there to act as a tea lady or to serve biscuits to the people who were active in the campaign and that he was never asked for his advice or asked to comment on the media operations of the Labor Party during that campaign? Of course not. We know that he was the funnel for media transcripts to be transmitted from his network of operatives in the various States right into the heart of the Australian Labor Party's 1987 election campaign. As we know, that election turned out to be a victory for the Labor Party, but it was a very hollow victory because the Liberal and National parties together polled more votes than the Labor Party did, although they failed to win the election. It is a fact of life that we in the Liberal and National parties have to live with, that we outpolled Labor but lost the election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That indicates, I think, the degree of ability and the power that emanates from the activities of the National Media Liaison Service. We all remember that during that election campaign the thought police were able to so monitor the operations of the Liberal and National parties as to be able, effectively, to use the media in individual electorates where it mattered. That is what demonstrates, again, the effectiveness of that little operation. For the Government to come in here and say that Mr Parks acted purely as a government agent, paid for as a public servant, and had no role in working within the Labor Party campaign leaves me breathless. I am sure that when the Australian people are aware of all these facts they will agree. </PARA>
<PARA> The effects of all this are already showing on the political landscape of this country. This body has gone beyond its charter. It has gone beyond what was set down by Senator Ray in his 1987 statement. It has exceeded its activities and authority by undertaking a new role in the Queensland State election. Obviously it will run blocking tactics in Queensland during the current campaign, doing so in direct response-as was admitted by Senator Richardson today-to what the Queensland National Party has done over a long period. That is the justification for this action. It is admitted and it is wrong. The Government is condemned for undertaking such activity. There should be an immediate instruction from Senator Richardson that the operatives of the NMLS in Queensland desist from any further activities in the Queensland election campaign. </PARA>

Normally I would not speak on the adjournment but the letter tendered by Sir Charles to the Committee is a mixture of internal inconsistency, of errors of omission, and of false assertions. The letter is basically stereotype Court-skite. A paragraph on page 4 states:</PARA>
<PARA>There was no direction or pressure applied to the State Electricity Commission to sign this agree- ment . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He cannot have it both ways. If, on the interpretation of this document as being standardised Court-skite, Sir Charles Court is claiming to be responsible for everything that happened with the North West Shelf, he cannot simultaneously say that the decision to sign the take or pay contract was an autonomous decision of the State Electricity Commission. So much for the internal inconsistency. The most serious error of omission is that he neglects to mention that some 16 per cent of the total take or pay contract was gratuitously added on to the contract by him. That has been a major source of the embarrassment. I will deal with a few other assertions and false assertions. The letter states on page 4:</PARA>
<PARA>Without this take or pay contract for domestic gas no export LNG phase . . . would have been possible. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an assertion. He claims that it was false for me to say that the Western Australian Government requested financial relief from the Commonwealth because of the disastrous consequences of the take or pay contract. That is a false assertion. That is precisely why the Western Australian Government approached the Commonwealth for assistance to get out of the financial jam into which the take or pay contract had placed the State Electricity Commission (SEC), and therefore the Government. Sir Charles asserts:</PARA>
<PARA>Any deal worked out in 1984-85 between the Federal and W.A. . . . Governments in respect of the project was entirely between the two Labor Governments of the time and not because of the agreement negotiated by my Government and SEC.</PARA>
<PARA>That statement is plainly false. In fact, a report published by the Western Australian Government in 1985 showed that the accumulated losses on the then projections of actual gas sales would have totalled some $7 billion. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> No such negotiations with the Commonwealth Government would have been necessary nor would have taken place had I continued in office and not retired from Parliament . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The agreement my Government and the SEC negotiated had ample provision for renegotiation with the Joint Venturers if circumstances changed. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement is false. Sir Charles's defence of his role in this sorry saga has also varied over time. Some three years ago he asserted in a letter to the West Australian that in fact it was good business for the State to be paying for the gas in the early 1980s which may be used in the year 2000. I suggested at the time, as I have suggested since, that, if Sir Charles really believes this, he should put together a private consortium to buy the gas which is paid for and leave it in the ground, because I am quite sure that the State Government and the SEC would be happy to sell it. He has never attempted to act on that suggestion. But his tune has now changed. In the letter which is republished in the Committee's report he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I understand SEC is already taking its full contract figure. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether that is true. If it is true, one of the reasons is that to the SEC, having been required by the contract to buy the gas whether it was needed or not, any price in excess of the cost of pumping the gas down from the North West Shelf was a price that would have been acceptable. In the second paragraph on page 6 of the report reproducing Sir Charles's letter, he says:</PARA>
<PARA>It is also realistic to assume that the gas will yield higher prices to SEC in years of sale . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It may be realistic to assume that. However, that statement indicates that Sir Charles is unaware of the principle of the time value of money or discounting; he is either unaware of it or he chooses to ignore it. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Had I not encouraged the negotiation of the take or pay agreement . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate should bear in mind that he claimed earlier in his letter that it was a spontaneous decision by the SEC. The tune has changed a bit there. He says that if he had not done so he would have been accused of being a person with no vision. Again, that is quite wrong. In an article published in the Independent monthly newspaper I specifically referred to Sir Charles as a man of vision. The theme of the article was the high cost of visionaries. He certainly had many visions-hallucinations might be a more accurate description of them. In that article I referred to his visions concerning a Peruvian con man called Dr Shrian Oskar, who was funded by the taxpayers to establish an oil seed mill in Bunbury, the Ord River scheme, the Manjimup cannery-which had more rescues than Rothwells-and so on, and so forth. I put these matters on the record because otherwise the matter would have little interest next week. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not respond to the comments made by Senator Walsh because I have not had a proper opportunity to read the submission by Sir Charles Court to the Committee of Privileges. However, when we talk about the activities and the careers of parliamentary leaders having left parliament, one cannot help but reflect upon the ascension of Mr Hayden to the position of Governor-General. One cannot help noting Mr Whitlam's activities since leaving the Parliament. One cannot help but note Mr Burke's ascension since leaving parliament-Senator Walsh might call it `swanning around'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the Senate of some comments made by the present Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) at the opening in Perth of the North West Shelf, stage 2, on 19 September 1989. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> Forty years ago, on the other side of this vast continent, the Australian people began construction of one of the largest and most complex engineering projects in the world: the Snowy Mountains Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, we celebrate a milestone in another massive feat of Australian engineering: the North West Shelf project. It's called upon the same capacity for vision and the same reserves of human skill and dedication that characterised the Snowy Mountains Scheme, and it's created an industry that will foster Australian jobs and Australian exports into the twenty-first century. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians may perhaps be blase about the magnitude of resource projects throughout our continent: the huge coal fields in the eastern States, the vast iron-ore mines in this State, the oil fields of Bass Strait, our bauxite, gold and copper mines. </PARA>
<PARA>He is talking about the North West Shelf gas project for which Sir Charles Court is given credit by most, but criticism by Senator Walsh. The Prime Minister continues:</PARA>
<PARA> But this one dwarfs them all. The North West Shelf project is, simply, the largest single resource project in our history and perhaps the largest anywhere in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Back in the 1960s, not even the most optimistic of people who saw a small company called Woodside Petroleum acquire a number of exploration permits in the remote north-west of Western Australia could have imagined the scale of the discoveries that were to be made, or the magnitude of the development those discoveries sparked:</PARA>
<PARA> - 375 billion cubic metres of natural gas;</PARA>
<PARA> - $12 billion in investment expenditure;</PARA>
<PARA> - 8,000 jobs onsite and offsite;</PARA>
<PARA> - exports worth up to $2 billion a year from 1994. </PARA>
<PARA>What that barrage of figures tells us, very simply, is this: for a nation dependent as Australia is on successful competition on the world's marketplaces, the North West Shelf represents a massive contribution to our economic well-being and to the prosperity of future generations of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why, as Prime Minister, it is my very great pleasure to congratulate the joint venturers on their tremendous achievement in bringing this project to fruition; to welcome the support of the eight Japanese electricity and gas utilities who will purchase LNG from the North West Shelf; to pay tribute to the work of the National Liaison Group, which has played a vital constructive role throughout the duration of this project; and to thank the skill, energy and commitment of the thousands of workers and staff who have given their best efforts to this project. It is of course a matter of regret to me that-due to a variety of circumstances-we are not gathered at Karratha today to see this great project. I certainly look forward to inspecting it one day. </PARA>
<PARA>Ladies and Gentlemen,</PARA>
<PARA> I've been making the point recently, in discussing Australian's economic position, that we are undergoing an investment boom. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who are worried about our current account deficit should come to the North West Shelf and see the way in which this project-dependent as it has been in part on foreign investment-will translate into future export growth. </PARA>
<PARA> Across the whole spectrum of industry-not just in resource projects but throughout the manufacturing sector-investment which today is contributing to our current account deficit is laying the foundations for substantial export growth in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time it's impressive that such a large proportion of the work on North West Shelf has in fact been performed by Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the more than $6 billion already spent, about three quarters has been spent in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, Australian industry can compete with the best of them when it comes to major resource projects like this; at the same time we have acquired new skills and capacities which will help make us even better partners in major resource and engineering projects in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>He then said:</PARA>
<PARA>I want to express a special welcome to our Japanese guests today. </PARA>
<PARA>Exports from the North West Shelf mark the beginning of a new phase in the already very healthy relationship between Australia and Japan. </PARA>
<PARA>The future is very bright for both of us. </PARA>
<PARA>In the mid 1990s, this project will be providing some 15 per cent of Japan's LNG imports. And Australia can play an even greater role in supplying energy resources to Japan. Over the next decade, energy exports to Japan could treble in real terms to $3 billion a year. </PARA>
<PARA>Ladies and Gentlemen,</PARA>
<PARA>The North West Shelf has been completed on budget, and two months ahead of schedule. That's a great achievement in itself-proof, if more was needed, of the hard work, cooperative spirit and sheer dedication brought to this project by thousands of people. </PARA>
<PARA>I offer my congratulations to you all and my confident best wishes for the future of this great project. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are the comments of the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, in response to this project which, in my view, certainly would not have commenced or been completed without the personal commitment and dedication of Sir Charles Court-as has been acknowledged by people such as Brian Burke. That contribution, that dedication, that foresight and that wisdom contrast in a realistic way with the present Labor Government in Western Australia which, if my memory serves me correctly, has received more than a sharp tongue-lashing from Senator Walsh himself, not the least being on the evening of the last State election. That contrasts with the hundreds of millions of dollars of investment made by that Government on behalf of the Australian taxpayers in the aborted petrochemical industry which, of course, will now be lost for all time at great cost to all Australian taxpayers. Senator Walsh was unreasonable and, in my view, unfair and inaccurate in the comments he made in respect of Sir Charles Court who, on only a very superficial reading of what he has said, seems to have set out the situation and the facts in a clear, concise and proper way. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) During 1988-89 the Department of Transport and Communications used 38159 reams of paper for photocopying and typing. The value of this paper was $185546. This cost includes only bulk paper products and does not include other paper products such as envelopes, forms, letterhead paper, etc. which are extremely difficult to quantify.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) to (5) As announced by the Prime Minister in his Statement on the Environment on 20 July 1989, the Ministers for Administrative Services and the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories are investigating the possible use of recycled unbleached paper in Commonwealth Government offices. Also, Commonwealth and State Environment Ministers recently agreed to set up a working group to develop standards for recycled paper for government use and to examine further uses for low grade recycled paper. In addition all portfolio Ministers have been asked by the Prime Minister to report to Senator Richardson on the wastepaper recycling strategies which their departments have adopted and ways in which those strategies may be improved or extended.</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister intends to issue a report early next year on the progress being made in relation to the measures announced in the Statement, including the results of the current investigations into the use of recycled paper by departments and their wastepaper recycling strategies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, upon notice, on 15 August 1989:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the ABC's PM program of 17 July 1989 during which the Minister said about the environment that, ` . . . the Hawke Government has made good decisions on a weekly basis. They've just been piled up, one on top of the other, so that everyone with a concern for the environment knows that we've put the runs on the board', could the Minister list these `good decisions' week-by-week for the approximately 325 weeks the ALP has been in Government.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2464" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cannot justify expending the enormous resources needed systematically to review the excellent record of the three Hawke governments as sought by the honourable Senator. However, set out below is a two-part answer. Part A contains a sample of decisions by the third Hawke Government. Because of the enormous number of decisions, it is only possible to give a few examples. Part B summarises the Hawke Government's major achievements in protecting our environment. This, to a degree, duplicates some of the points covered in Part A.</PARA>
<PARA> Together, Parts A and B will satisfy the honourable Senator of the distinguished record of the Hawke Government. Of course, other Ministers have made many other excellent decisions (in addition to any referred to in the examples) which are not noted here.</PARA>
<PARA>PART A</PARA>
<PARA>Some examples from the tourism area are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Amendment of Australian Tourist Commission Act.</PARA>
<PARA>Following the report of the Australian Government Inquiry into Tourism in 1986, the Australian Tourist Commission Act was amended in December 1987 to include, inter alia, provisions to ensure that Australia is protected from the adverse environmental and social impacts of international tourism (para 6 (c)) and to closely monitor and report on the effects of international tourism on Australia's natural environment and society (para 7 (e)).</PARA>
<PARA>Tourism in the Antarctic.</PARA>
<PARA> In March 1988, I asked the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts to inquire into and report on tourism in the Antarctic, including reference to the impact on the environment. The Committee reported in May 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>Reference to Industries Assistance Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>In July 1988 the Treasurer referred the travel and tourism industry to the Industries Assistance Commission for inquiry and report. The Commission was required to examine the factors affecting the development of the industry, including major impediments to competitiveness and efficiency. Environmental issues were addressed during the inquiry. The Commission released its draft report in June 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>Discussion Paper on `Directions for Tourism'.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government circulated in September 1988 a Discussion Paper titled `Directions for Tourism', which proposed broad objectives as the basis for the future development of the Government's tourism policy. This paper included objectives and discussion of environmental issues related to tourism.</PARA>
<PARA>Environmental Guidelines for Tourism Developments.</PARA>
<PARA>In October 1988, at the meeting of the Tourist Ministers' Council, I undertook to have the Commonwealth prepare a set of draft environmental guidelines for tourism developments. These will be considered by Ministers at the November 1989 of Tourist Ministers' Council.</PARA>
<PARA>Some examples from the Antarctic Division are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Antarctic research.</PARA>
<PARA>A substantial program of Antarctic research investigating issues relevant to the environment with 135 projects will be conducted in 1989-90.</PARA>
<PARA>Heard and McDonald Islands.</PARA>
<PARA>Introduction of the Heard and McDonald Islands Environment Protection and Management Ordinance in January 1988.</PARA>
<PARA>Aurora Australis.</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth has signed a charter for the new Antarctic research/resupply vessel, Aurora Australis, with special capabilities for research on environmental matters relating to the southern ocean ecosystem, oceanography and weather and climate. Aurora Australis has been designed so that it will have no fuel between its inner and outer holds to limit environmental damage in the case of grounding-a feature not found on any other Antarctic vessel. The Aurora Australis, the first Australian built, flagged and crewed ice strengthened research and supply ship, is scheduled to enter service in the 1989-90 Antarctic season.</PARA>
<PARA>Upgrading of scientific facilities.</PARA>
<PARA>Decisions have been taken to proceed with scientific laboratories at Australia's Antarctic Stations which will significantly enhance Australia's ability to conduct environmental research in Antarctica.</PARA>
<PARA>Prevention of Mining or Oil Drilling.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government decided not to sign the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities but to seek the establishment of an Antarctic Wilderness Park and arrangements which will prevent mining or oil drilling in Antarctica and a comprehensive environmental protection convention for Antarctica.</PARA>
<PARA>Ethnics Inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA>A Working Group of the Antarctic Science Advisory Committee examined procedures to ensure that the conduct of Antarctic research projects involving animals (including the specific techniques and conditions for experiments) is justified, taking into account animal welfare and conservation implications.</PARA>
<PARA>Radiation Code of Conduct.</PARA>
<PARA>A set of guidelines for the purchase, safe storage, transport, use and disposal of radioisotopes was developed. The guidelines are designed to ensure the safety of scientists and support staff participating in the Australian Antarctic program, and the protection of the Antarctic environment from contamination. The guidelines are being used as the basis of a code which is expected to be finalised in October 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>Establishment of Ethics Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>The Antarctic Animal Care and Ionising Radiation Usage Ethics Committee was established to develop and maintain a code of practice, and to examine research proposals involving the use of animals and ionising radiation use.</PARA>
<PARA>No more use of Hydroponics.</PARA>
<PARA>A decision has been taken to cease hydroponic cultivation at Australia's Antarctic stations to minimise the possibility of the accidental introduction of external flora and fauna to the Antarctic environment.</PARA>
<PARA>Guidelines for Environment Assessment.</PARA>
<PARA>The Antarctic Division has introduced decision/action guidelines for the assessment of the environmental implications of activities to be conducted in Antarctica.</PARA>
<PARA>Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Seals.</PARA>
<PARA>The Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Seals was ratified.</PARA>
<PARA>Waste disposal.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia initiated a comprehensive program to clean up Australian Antarctic stations, introduced strict waste disposal guidelines for stations and environmental training for all expedition participants, and began the development of management plans for Antarctic stations. The Antarctic Division is now giving priority to a program to return rubbish and clean up the areas around Australia's Antarctic stations.</PARA>
<PARA>Some examples from the other territories are:</PARA>
<PARA>Christmas Island.</PARA>
<PARA>In January 1986 extensions to the Christmas Island National Park to cover approximately 17% of the Island were gazetted. In 1988 it was agreed in principle to further extend the National Park to cover 60-70% of the Island. Public comments were sought in April 1989. In February 1988 the then Minister for Arts and Territories announced that there would be no further clearing of rainforests in any future mining operations. In 1988/89 the Government provided $0.5m for selective rehabilitation of cleared areas to promote the breeding success of the endangered Abott's booby bird and other endemic species.</PARA>
<PARA>Cocos (Keeling) Islands.</PARA>
<PARA>In December 1986, the first full-time ANPWS conservator to the Cocos (Keeling) Island Administration was appointed to provide nature conservation advice, education programs on conservation matters and to conduct surveys of sea bird populations.</PARA>
<PARA>Jervis Bay Territory.</PARA>
<PARA>In December 1985 Bowen Island was declared a reserved area because of its significant conservation values. In July 1988 a Draft Management Plan for Bowen Island was published with the objectives of protecting and conserving the Island's natural and cultural attributes. In April 1989 the Commonwealth regained vacant possession of the whole of the Island consistent with those objectives. A comprehensive ecological study is being undertaken of the habitat and terrestrial breeding cycle of the fairy penguin colony on Bowen Island.</PARA>

The final nomination, lodged in September 1989, includes spectacular examples of the world's increasingly rare pristine tall eucalypt forests. The Tasmanian Wilderness including the existing Western Tasmania Wilderness National Parks which were declared a World Heritage Area in 1982 are expected to be placed on the World Heritage List in December 1989. South-West Tasmania is one of the world's greatest temperate wilderness areas. The new World Heritage nomination, which was favourably reviewed by the World Heritage Bureau in Paris in June 1989, protects valuable areas of rainforest, alpine vegetation, archaeological sites, rare and threatened species and the tall forests.</PARA>
<PARA>Tasmania Forestry Package: As part of the agreement on areas to be nominated for the World Heritage List, in November 1988 the Federal and Tasmanian Governments signed a $30 million five year timber industry assistance package. The package encourages responsible and sustainable forestry while protecting important environmental values.

<PARA>The Government contributed $60,000 through the International Tropical Timber Organisation towards a study into forestry management policies and practices in Sarawak.</PARA>
<PARA>Some examples in relation to natural resources are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Endangered Species: In July, 1989, the Prime Minister announced a ten year Endangered Species Program. The Government has pledged $2 million in both 1989-90 and 1990-91 to the 10 year program. An Endangered Species Advisory Committee (ESAC) and an Endangered Species Unit within the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS) were established in 1988. ESAC represents conservation groups, the rural community and Commonwealth and State nature conservation agencies. It is formulating a national strategy to conserve endangered species and their habitats.</PARA>
<PARA>Kakadu: Stage 2 of Kakadu National Park was declared in 1983 and placed on the World Heritage List in 1987. In 1986, the Government purchased the Gimbat and Goodparla pastoral leases. About 65% of Gimbat and Goodparla became Stage 3 of the Park in June, 1987. The remainder of the Gimbat and Goodparla leases became a Conservation Zone under the provisions of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation (NPWC) Act. On 5 October 1989 the Government decided to drastically reduce the size of the conservation zone. Ninety-eight per cent of the zone will be incorporated in Kakadu National Park. The remaining 2 per cent will become an exploration zone and will be referred to the Resource Assessment Commission for environmental and economic assessment. In 1987, the Government amended the NPWC Act to prohibit mining in the Park.</PARA>
<PARA>Resource Assessment Commission: Legislation establishing the Resources Assessment Commission (RAC) was passed in June, 1989. The Commission is an independent body which will investigate major, complex resource, land use and environment issues referred to it by Government.

<PARA>Wesley Vale: The North Broken Hill/Noranda Forests Inc joint venturers dropped their plans for a $1 billion pulp mill at Wesley Vale in north-west Tasmania after the Federal Government insisted on stricter environmental conditions than those negotiated between the companies and the Tasmanian Government. The Government was particularly concerned about the impact of 13 tonnes of organochlorines which would have been dumped in Bass Strait every day. By the end of 1989, the Government will have established a set of guidelines for pulp mill projects which will ensure Australia has the toughest and best standards of any country in the world.</PARA>
<PARA>One Billion Trees: The One Billion Trees Program was announced by the Prime Minister in the `Our Country, Our Future' Environment Statement on 20 July 1989. With direct Commonwealth funding of $4.7 million a year supplemented by State, industry and community contributions, the program will ensure that at least one billion additional trees will be growing by the end of the century. It is estimated that over 200 million trees have been established since the National Tree Program was established in 1982.</PARA>
<PARA>Remnant Vegetation: In June 1989 the Commonwealth contributed $1.5 million to the Victorian Government for the purchase of Greens Bush wetland for nature conservation purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>The `Save the Bush' program, also announced by the Prime Minister on 20 July 1989, provides $1 million in 1989-90 and increasing funds in later years for conserving the last vestiges of our once extensive forests, woodlands and grasslands (over two-thirds of Australia's original tree cover has been removed since European settlement). These small remnants of our national heritage, often precariously surviving on farms and along roadsides, provide habitat and migration corridors for our unique wildlife. They are an essential but all too often neglected adjunct to Australia's national parks system.</PARA>
<PARA>Biological Diversity: National strategy on biological diversity is being developed to ensure all ecosystems are represented in a reserves network.</PARA>

A series of legislative changes designed to improve the operating efficiency of the Commission were also approved.</PARA>
<PARA>Wilderness: A National Wilderness Inventory was initiated in 1986. The Australian Heritage Commission has completed the inventory for Tasmania and Victoria. North Queensland and South Australia are currently being worked on. The Prime Minister announced on 20 July 1988 that funding for the program will be accelerated to ensure its rapid completion nationally.</PARA>
<PARA>Some examples in relation to the Murray-Darling Basin are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>One of the first projects initiated by the Murray Darling Basin Ministerial Council (established in November 1985) was a major Environmental Resources Study.

<PARA>Plan of management for the Coringa-Herald National Nature Reserve in the Coral Sea. This plan of management, for an outstanding coral reef system with significant feeding habitat for seabirds, was laid before both Houses of Parliament on 15 August 1989 and is expected to come into effect after 20 sitting days before each House.</PARA>
<PARA>(Draft) plan of management for the Ashmore Reef National Nature Reserve in the Timor Sea. I decided to publish this plan of management under the provisions of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act to enable public input before the plan is finalised.</PARA>
<PARA>Proclamation of Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs Marine National Nature Reserve in the Tasman Sea. On 23 December 1987 the Government proclaimed this reserve, protecting the most southerly open-ocean platform reefs and their ecosystems including the rare black cod.</PARA>
<PARA>Agreement with the USSR to protect migratory birds. The Prime Minister sought the assistance of the States and Territories in January 1989 in developing the text of a proposed Agreement with the USSR. All have given their support to this initiative which aims to protect migratory birds on their Soviet breeding grounds and during their migrations to and from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Support for the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance. Australia has advised the Convention Bureau that Australia supports the proposed amendments to the Convention, which will strengthen its authority and provide greater international commitment to the protection of wetland habitats.</PARA>
<PARA>Wetlands of International Importance. Stages 1 and 2 of Kakadu National Park have been listed pursuant to the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance. The inclusion of Stage 2 confirmed international significance of the extensive flood plains of the Park and strengthen Australia's obligation to protect and conserve the flora and fauna of Kakadu National Park.</PARA>
<PARA>Proposed Accession to Convention on Migratory Species Wild Animals (Bonn Convention). The Prime Minister has written to the States and Territories informing them that the Government proposes to accede to the Bonn Convention, which seeks to provide international protection for migratory animals throughout their ranges.</PARA>
<PARA>Accession to the Convention on Conservation of Nature in the South Pacific (Apia Convention). In August 1989 the Prime Minister approved the formal accession by Australia to this Convention, which establishes a broad framework for nature conservation among the nations of the South Pacific Region.</PARA>
<PARA>Support for an international program to protect marine turtles. The Government, through the ANPWS, has developed a program to be applied in the South Pacific Region to conserve and manage marine turtles.</PARA>
<PARA>Ban on imports of ivory. The Prime Minister announced in August 1989 a ban on the importation of ivory into Australia, in recognition of the critical conservation status of the African Elephant.</PARA>
<PARA>Support for Indian Ocean Whale Sanctuary. At the International Whaling Commission Australia voted for the continuation of the Indian Ocean Whale Sanctuary, which means that no whales may be killed in the designated zone of the Indian Ocean by any country.</PARA>
<PARA>Release of whale watching guidelines. The Government launched a publication providing guidelines to people who wish to watch whales at sea. The guidelines are designed to minimise disturbance of whales while allowing people to enjoy the experience of whale watching.</PARA>
<PARA>Establishment of national data base of whale strandings. A national data base has been established in the ANPWS. It will provide information on all strandings and will contribute to our understanding of the causes of strandings, how to prevent them and how to minimise their effects.</PARA>
<PARA>Continued opposition towards Japanese ``scientific whaling''. Australia has continued to oppose, in the forum of the International Whaling Commission, the hunting of whales by Japan under the guise of ``scientific research''.</PARA>
<PARA>Investigation into controls on introduction of exotic species via ships' ballast water. An investigation will be carried out on appropriate measures to prevent the introduction of marine organisms, such as toxic algae, in ships' ballast water from other countries.</PARA>
<PARA>Support for controls on introduction of exotic fish. A nationwide decision has been taken by all Australian conservation agencies to regulate the introduction of exotic fish to prevent the escape of undesirable species into Australian waterways.</PARA>
<PARA>Some examples in relation to the operations of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>September 1987: Hamilton Island Enterprises is seeking a permit under Regulations of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act, I designated them under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act as proponent and directed them to produce a Public Environment Report (PER) on a proposed walkway at Hardy Reef. The PER will be used as part of the assessment for a permit required under the Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA>Declared that the Central Section Zoning Plan would come into effect on 1 October 1987.</PARA>
<PARA>October 1987: Shute Harbour Marine Pty Ltd was seeking a permit under Regulations of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act, I designated them under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act and directed them to produce a Public Environment Report (PER) on a proposed marina at Shute Harbour. This PER satisfied the Authority's requirements and a permit to construct a marina was issued on 31 August 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>April 1988: I convened the 13th Great Barrier Reef Ministerial Council Meeting, held on 10 May 1988 in Brisbane.</PARA>
<PARA>July 1988: Declared that the Mackay/Capricorn Section Zoning Plan would come into effect on 1 August 1988 and approved the making of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Regulations for this section. This completed the zoning of the Marine Park.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor C Hawkins from the University of Queensland was seeking a permit under the Regulations of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act, I designated him as proponent of the proposed seawater aquarium intake pipeline at Heron Island. Neither an EIS nor a PER was required, however, Professor Hawkins had to satisfy a number of strict environmental conditions. A permit for the installation of the pipeline was issued in January 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>October 1988: Farndale Ltd is seeking a permit under Regulations of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act, I designated them under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act as proponent for a proposed marine development at Lloyd Bay and I directed them to produce an Environmental Impact Statement.

<PARA>February 1989: I convened the 14th Ministerial Council at Orpheus Island on 26 and 27 April 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>I approved the Authority entering into a contract with the Australian Institute of Marine Science for a research project: Nitrogen and Phosphorous Budgets for Great Barrier Reef Shelf Waters.</PARA>
<PARA>I announced a two year moratorium on further floating hotels in the Great Barrier Reef to enable monitoring and assessment of existing proposals.</PARA>
<PARA>March 1989: Dreamworld Corporation Pty Ltd is seeking a permit under Regulations of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act. I designated them under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act as the proponent and directed them to produce a Public Environment Report (PER) for the proposed observatory upgrading at Green Island. When the PER is completed it will be used as part of the assessment for a permit required under the Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA>April 1989: Dallhold Nickel Management Pty Ltd is seeking a permit under the Regulations of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act and I designated them under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act as proponent for the proposed offloading and refuelling operations in the Central Section of the marine park. In order to facilitate the environmental assessment requirements of both the Commonwealth Acts and the Queensland State Development and Public Works Organisation Act, the proponent is preparing a single environmental assessment report which is to be subject to a 28-day public review period.</PARA>
<PARA>July 1989: I appointed 15 new members to the Great Barrier Reef Consultative Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>August 1989: P&amp;O Resorts Pty Ltd is seeking a permit under Regulations of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act and I designated them under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act as proponent for a landing stage at Wistari Reef. A decision is yet to be made on the need for and degree of environmental impact assessment appropriate for the project. A permit has been issued by the Authority for P&amp;O to install and operate a day-visitor pontoon at Wistari Reef.</PARA>
<PARA>Some general examples in the international area are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Bilateral arrangements: Negotiation of the Australia/USSR Environment Protection Agreement is almost completed. The France/Australia Working Group of experts on the environment has been established.</PARA>
<PARA>Ambassador for the Environment: The eminent, former Governor-General, Sir Ninian Stephen, has been appointed Ambassador for the Environment.</PARA>

<PARA>Ratification of SPREP Convention: Australia ratified the Convention for the Protection of the Natural Resources of the Environment of the South Pacific Region (SPREP Convention) in July 1989. Objectives of the Convention include pollution control, environmental assessment and conservation of nature in the South Pacific Region.</PARA>
<PARA>PART B</PARA>
<PARA>HAWKE GOVERNMENT'S ENVIRONMENTAL ACHIEVEMENTS 1983-1989</PARA>
<PARA>World Heritage</PARA>
<PARA>The World Heritage Convention protects the world's cultural and natural heritage. It is the most successful and respected international agreement in the field of heritage conservation. Australia is a world leader in implementing the Convention, being the only country which has enacted legislation to carry out its responsibilities under the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government introduced the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act in 1983 to fulfil its obligation under the Convention to protect and conserve areas of outstanding universal value within Australia. The Act was used to put in place regulations which prevented the construction of the Gordon-Below-Franklin Dam and the logging of the North Queensland rainforests.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia has eight properties on the World Heritage List: Kakadu National Park; The Great Barrier Reef; The Willandra Lakes Region of Western NSW; The Lord Howe Island Group off the coast of NSW; The Western Tasmania Wilderness National Parks; The Australian East Coast Temperate and Sub-Tropical Rainforest Parks (the NSW Rainforests); Uluru National Park; The Wet Tropics of Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA>South-West Tasmania</PARA>
<PARA>Almost 1.4 million hectares, or about 20% of Tasmania, will be protected by World Heritage Listing following the World Heritage nomination in December 1988. The area includes spectacular examples of the tallest forests in the Southern Hemisphere-the increasingly rare, pristine tall eucalypt forests. The new areas are expected to be placed on the World Heritage List in December, 1989 and are in addition to the existing Western Tasmania Wilderness National Parks which were declared a World Heritage area in 1982. South-West Tasmania is one of the world's greatest temperate wilderness areas. The World Heritage nomination, which was favourably reviewed by the World Heritage Bureau in Paris in June, 1989, protects valuable areas of rainforest, King Billy pines estimated to be several thousand years old, alpine vegetation, archaeological sites, rare and threatened species and the tall forests.</PARA>
<PARA>As part of the World Heritage agreement, in November 1988 the Federal and Tasmanian Governments signed a $30 million five year timber industry assistance package. The package encourages responsible and sustainable forestry while protecting important environmental values. A major commitment to plantations in the package will offset resource losses, and help the industry become less reliant on native forests in the future.</PARA>
<PARA>NSW Rainforests and Uluru National Park</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian East Coast Temperate and Sub-Tropical Rainforest Parks were placed on the World Heritage List in 1986. Uluru National Park became Australia's seventh World Heritage property in 1987. In 1985, the Federal Government granted inalienable freehold title of the Park to the traditional Aboriginal owners. The area is leased back to the Government for use as a national park for the benefit of all Australians and the international community.</PARA>
<PARA>Wet Tropical Rainforests</PARA>
<PARA>The World Heritage Committee formally inscribed the Wet Tropics of Queensland on the World Heritage List in December, 1988. Earlier in the year, regulations made under the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act brought an end to rainforest logging in the nominated area of about 8,900 sq. km. A $75 million package of job creation, management, plantation and infrastructure initiatives was introduced to compensate those affected by listing.</PARA>
<PARA>Ozone Layer Protection</PARA>
<PARA>In March, 1989, the Commonwealth passed tough legislation which places Australia at the forefront of international action to phase out the use of ozone destroying chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) and halons. Australia and Sweden are the two countries which have acted fastest on CFC and halon elimination.</PARA>
<PARA>Under the Commonwealth legislation, the import and manufacture of aerosol sprays with CFC's will be banned from the end of 1989. There will also be a range of other controls on the end uses of CFC's and halons in air-conditioning, refrigeration, fire extinguishers, foams, insulation, and electronic and fabric cleaning.</PARA>
<PARA>A National Ozone Strategy developed by the Commonwealth and State Governments-in consultation with industry and public interest groups-was adopted in July, 1989. The National Strategy will cut CFC and halon use in Australia by an estimated 95% by the year 1995. This is significantly faster than required under the Montreal Protocol which Australia signed on June 8, 1988. The strategy is also far tougher than new controls expected to come from the revision of the Montreal Protocol which will be finalised in 1990. Halons and CFC's are also greenhouse gases and the cuts in their use to 5% of 1986 levels by 1995 will reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 17%.</PARA>
<PARA>Greenhouse</PARA>
<PARA>Australia has committed itself to a comprehensive program of research, public education and immediate action on the Greenhouse Effect.</PARA>
<PARA>In April, 1989, the Government announced an additional $7.8 million for Greenhouse research till June 30, 1990. The Prime Minister has said that this is only the first stage of an ongoing commitment which will ensure Australia is at the forefront of international Greenhouse research. Australia is well placed to do critical research in the Southern Hemisphere which will ensure that global models now being developed are complete and accurate.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia has also pledged another $6.25 million over five years to a climate modelling program which will record and help predict changes in sea levels, air temperature and rainfall patterns in the South Pacific as a result of the Greenhouse Effect. It is anticipated that this program will be maintained for at least 20 years.</PARA>
<PARA>A National Greenhouse Advisory Committee was set up in 1989. It will provide expert policy advice and promote public understanding of the issues. $350,000 has been allocated for the first two years of a public education program.</PARA>
<PARA>A preliminary report on the technical aspects of reducing Australia's Greenhouse gas emissions is being prepared. The Prime Minister's `Our Country, Our Future' Environment Statement said that Australia will play its part in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, both domestically and internationally.</PARA>
<PARA>On 3 October 1989 the Australian and New Zealand Environment Council resolved to investigate ways to reduce greenhouse gases by up to 40%. In addition, the Council adopted the Commonwealth's proposal to reduce energy use by examining (a) minimum standards of energy efficiency in new government buildings and for domestic appliances; (b) more efficient domestic water heating services and household lighting (using compact fluorescent globes); and (c) fuel consumption standards for cars and light duty vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA>Antarctica</PARA>
<PARA>The Government decided that Australia should not sign the Antarctic Minerals Convention and initiated discussions with Antarctic Treaty countries with the aim of negotiating a comprehensive Antarctic environmental protection convention and having Antarctica declared a wilderness park free from all mining activity.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia successfully pushed for and continues to seek improvements in environmental protection amongst Antarctic Treaty nations. This includes a new Antarctic protected area category, environmental impact assessment, Southern Ocean ecosystem conservation and stronger waste disposal requirements.</PARA>
<PARA>The Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Seals was ratified.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia initiated a comprehensive program to clean up Australian Antarctic stations, introduced strict waste disposal guidelines for stations and environmental training for all expedition participants, and began management plans for Antarctic stations.</PARA>
<PARA>The Antarctic has emerged as a critical laboratory for study of the Greenhouse effect and the depletion of the ozone layer. Research on the history of climate change and future trends makes up more than one-quarter of the Antarctic science program.</PARA>
<PARA>Since 1986 the Antarctic Science Advisory Committee (ASAC) and the ASAC Grants Scheme, has allocated $1.4 million for Antarctic scientific research projects. This is in addition to scientific research undertaken by the Australian Antarctic Division which in 1988-89 spent over $10 million on its land based and marine science programs.</PARA>
<PARA>An animal care and ethics committee was established to oversee Antarctic scientific work involving animals.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auora Australis, the first Australian built, flagged and crewed ice strengthened research and supply ship, was launched on 18 September 1989, and will enter service in the 1989-90 Antarctic season.</PARA>
<PARA>A major construction program has rebuilt the Casey Base, and significant parts of the Davis and Mawson bases. ANARESAT, a satellite system has brought rapid and reliable voice and data communications between Australia and its Antarctic stations.</PARA>
<PARA>A recruitment drive to attract women to work in Antarctic was initiated. In 1988-89, Australia became the first country to appoint women station leaders to Antarctic.</PARA>
<PARA>Endangered Species</PARA>
<PARA>In July, 1989, the Prime Minister announced a ten year Endangered Species Program. The Government has pledged $2 million in both 1989-90 and 1990-91 to the 10 year program. An Endangered Species Advisory Committee (ESAC) and an Endangered Species Unit within the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS) were established in 1988. ESAC represents conservation groups, the rural community and Commonwealth and State nature agencies. It is formulating a national strategy to conserve endangered species and their habitats.</PARA>
<PARA>Great Barrier Reef Marine Park</PARA>
<PARA>One of the first environmental actions by the Hawke Government after assuming office in 1983 was extending the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park from 14% to 98% of the Great Barrier Reef Region. By August, 1988, zoning plans for all the 344,000 square kilometre marine park area were in place, making it the world's largest and most significant marine conservation project. The marine park is co-operatively and jointly managed by the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has supported the world's most extensive research program on the Crown of Thorns starfish. The multi-disciplinary research is trying to determine the causes, measure the effects and identify suitable control mechanisms. Three million dollars will be spent on this research over the next 3 years. Population outbreaks on coral reefs are now a problem throughout the Indo-Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA>Kakadu</PARA>
<PARA>Stage 2 of Kakadu National Park was declared in 1983 and placed on the World Heritage List in 1987. In 1986, the Government purchased the Gimbat and Goodparla pastoral leases, which comprise much of the headwaters of the South Alligator River. About 65% of Gimbat and Goodparla became Stage 3 of the Park in June, 1987.</PARA>
<PARA>The remainder of the Gimbat and Goodparla leases became a Conservation Zone under the provisions of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation (NPWC) Act. On October 5, 1989, the Government decided to prevent mining in 98% of the Conservation Zone by incorporating this area into Stage 3 of the Park. The remaining 37 square km strip along a small section of the South Alligator River will be known as an exploration zone. The Resource Assessment Commission has been asked to examine the economic and environmental considerations of any mining development in this exploration zone. The RAC inquiry will also investigate the Jawoyn's aboriginal sacred site claim under the Commonwealth Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1987, the Government amended the NPWC Act to prohibit mining in the Park.</PARA>
<PARA>The wetlands of Stage One of the Park were included on the list of areas recognised under the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitat. The wetlands of Stage Two are expected to be added soon.</PARA>
<PARA>Significant work has been done by the ANPWS to eliminate mimosa, an introduced plant, and buffalo from the Park. Mimosa is seriously degrading Top End flood plain ecosystems. The elimination of buffalo from the Park over the last few years has dramatically improved the recovery of vegetation on the floodplain and in Stage 3. Fears have been raised that the migration of the cane toad will see it eventually invade Kakadu with devastating effects on wildlife. The Government is investigating possible biological controls agents.</PARA>
<PARA>Sandmining</PARA>
<PARA>A revised proposal for sand-mining in the Shelborne Bay/Margaret Bay region of Cape York was stopped in 1988 on environmental grounds. The ALP platform was amended at the National Conference in June, 1988, to make it clear the party was opposed to sand mining in the region as well as Fraser and Moreton Islands.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Heritage Commission</PARA>
<PARA>By almost doubling the resources of the Australian Heritage Commission in 1988, the Government strengthened its leading role in the conservation of the National Estate. A series of legislative changes designed to improve the operating efficiency of the Commission were also approved.</PARA>
<PARA>National Estate Grants</PARA>
<PARA>The National Estate Grants Program was set up by the Whitlam Labor Government. The program is designed to help conserve and present the National Estate. It plays an important role in maintaining Australia's natural and cultural heritage for present and future generations. Since 1973-74, almost $45 million has been allocated to more than 3000 projects in all parts of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Wilderness</PARA>
<PARA>A National Wilderness Inventory was initiated in 1986. The Australian Heritage Commission has completed the inventory for Tasmania and Victoria. Work is progressing on the respective inventories for North Queensland and South Australia. Funding for the program will be accelerated to ensure its rapid completion nationally.</PARA>
<PARA>Native Forests</PARA>
<PARA>$2.9 million has been allocated over the next three years for the setting up of a National Forests Inventory. The inventory will include a survey of old growth forests in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Resource Assessment Commission</PARA>
<PARA>Legislation establishing the Commission was passed in June, 1989. The Commission is an independent body which will investigate major, complex resource, land use and environment issues referred to it by Government. RAC's first inquiries will be into forest and timber resources, the Kakadu exploration Zone and management of Australia's coastline. Justice Stewart has been appointed chairperson.</PARA>
<PARA>Wesley Vale</PARA>
<PARA>The North Broken Hill/Noranda Forests Inc joint ventures dropped their plans for a $1 billion pulp mill at Wesley Vale in north-west Tasmania after the Federal Government insisted on tougher environment conditions than the companies had negotiated with the Tasmanian Government. The Government was particularly concerned about the impact of 13 tonnes of organochlorines which would have been dumped in Bass Strait every day. By the end of 1989, the Government will have established a set of guidelines for pulp mill projects which will ensure Australia has the toughest and best standards of any country in the world.</PARA>
<PARA>National Industrial Chemicals Notification Scheme</PARA>
<PARA>The Government introduced legislation in the 1989 Budget session of Parliament which will set up a notification and assessment scheme for hazardous industrial chemicals. Under the scheme, all new and some existing industrial chemicals will be evaluated to assess their potential hazards to people and the environment.</PARA>
<PARA>Waste Management</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has introduced legislation to control hazardous waste exports and imports. Australia was active in the successful drafting of the UNEP Convention on Hazardous Wastes. Australia was also a party to the London Dumping Convention's decision to phase out incineration of noxious liquid wastes at sea by the end of 1994.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia has previously had to rely on the export of intractable wastes for disposal overseas, principally in the U.K. where those wastes have been destroyed by high temperature incineration.</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth is co-operating with the NSW and Victorian Governments in developing a national high temperature incinerator for the disposal of certain intractable wastes such as PCB's and some organochlorines. The proposal is being developed by an independent task force set up by the governments. The task force is currently consulting extensively on issues of design and siting. As a result of agreement by the NSW Government, the facility will be located somewhere in that State.</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth played a leading role in the development by the Australian Environment Ministers Council (comprising Commonwealth and State Environment Ministers) of National Guidelines for the Management of Hazardous Wastes agreed to in 1986. The guidelines describe a comprehensive set of measures for the satisfactory management of these materials. The States are now implementing these standards.</PARA>
<PARA>Voluntary Conservation Organisations</PARA>
<PARA>When the Government came to power in March, 1983, grants to voluntary conservation organisations had been about $350,000 for some years. Over the following two years, this was increased to $635,000 then $850,000. In 1988-89, 44 voluntary conservation organisations will receive $1.116 million in Federal grants. In addition to the above grants, the Government initiated a system of meetings with peak conservation organisations which are held two or three times every year. The meetings allow the groups to raise major environmental issues directly with the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>Murray-Darling Basin</PARA>
<PARA>In November, 1985, the Federal, Victorian, New South Wales and South Australian Governments established the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council. The Council provides a strategic focus for planning and managing the Basin's natural resources to achieve sustainable use.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the first projects initiated by the Council was a major Environmental Resources Study. Published in 1987, the study detailed the extent and severity of degradation of the Basin's environmental resources. This degradation is estimated to cause losses to agriculture of $260 million per year. River salinity costs are estimated at a further $35 million per year.</PARA>
<PARA>In addition to the Environmental Resources Study, the Council has also:</PARA>
<PARA>initiated studies involving on-farm water use and irrigation;</PARA>
<PARA>released a Salinity and Drainage Strategy; and</PARA>
<PARA>developed a draft Natural Resources Management Strategy with an indicative three year budget of $45.2 million.</PARA>
<PARA>One Billion Trees</PARA>
<PARA>The One Billion Trees program was announced by the Prime Minister in the `Our Country, Our Future' Environment Statement on July 20, 1989. With direct Commonwealth funding of $4.7 million a year supplemented by State, industry and community contributions, the program will ensure that at least one billion additional trees will be growing by the end of the century. It is estimated that over 200 million trees have been established since the National Tree Program was established in 1982.</PARA>
<PARA>The Save the Bush program, also announced by the Prime Minister on July 20, 1989, provides $1 million in 1989-90 and increasing funds in later years for conserving the last vestiges of our once extensive forests, woodlands and grasslands (over two-thirds of Australia's original tree cover has been removed since European settlement). These small remnants of our national heritage often precariously surviving on farms and along roadsides, provide habitat and migration corridors for our unique wildlife. They are an essential but all too often neglected adjunct to Australia's national parks system.</PARA>
<PARA>National Rainforest Conservation Program</PARA>
<PARA>In June, 1986, the Government provided $22.25 million for the establishment of a national program on rainforest conservation with the States. Queensland is the only Australian state with rainforest which has not joined the Commonwealth initiated program.</PARA>
<PARA>Drift Net Fishing</PARA>
<PARA>Australia was instrumental in framing the Tarawa Declaration at the 20th South Pacific Forum meeting in July, 1989. The declaration says that drift netting violates international law and calls on Japan and Taiwan to immediately abandon their operations in the South Pacific. It also called on the rest of the world to support a convention banning the use of drift nets in the Pacific. It is claimed drift net fishing could lead to the collapse of the South Pacific tuna fishery in the next few years.</PARA>
<PARA>I thank the Honourable Senator for this opportunity to list some of the achievements of this Government over the last two years or so.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) The 1988/89 rate was $0.60 per kilometre. An application to increase the rate to $0.69 per kilometre for 1989/90 has been lodged with the State Contracts Board. These rates are set on a ``depot to depot'' basis which includes the distance from the car depot to the passenger pickup point, the actual journey with the passenger and, after the passenger leaves the vehicle, the distance back to the car depot.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Sydney taxi rate is $0.75 per kilometre on a ``pickup to drop'' basis. This means the rate is charged for the period the passenger is in the taxi. For most journeys the COMCAR charge would be considerably in excess of that for taxis.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Rates are set to cover the full costs of providing the service and are economically based.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) (a), (b) and (c) Approximate per kilometre costs on a ``depot to depot'' basis based on hourly rates charged at ``pickup to drop'' are not available (other than for one category of passenger, judges and other judicial office holders, in Sydney). Factors which make a direct comparison complex include average traffic speeds (which vary throughout the day), likely journeys and traffic conditions to be encountered, distance from depot to pickup point, distance from drop to depot and waiting times etc.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) (a) The reason that the Transport and Storage Group tendered on a per kilometre depot-to-depot basis for the NSW State contract for judges and judicial office holders is that the request for tender specified this method. The tendered rate per kilometre on a ``depot to depot'' basis was assessed by the Transport and Storage Group as equivalent to its VIP hourly rate, pickup to drop, for typical journeys for this category of passenger.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) (b) The intention is that there should be no significant difference between the rates for work for NSW judges and other judicial office holders and work for Commonwealth Parliamentarians.</PARA>
