<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night we had just started to discuss the amendment to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) moved by Senator Stone on behalf of the Opposition. The amendment seeks to put in place a regime with regard to information that may be provided by the Commissioner of Taxation to a number of law enforcement agencies such as the National Crime Authority, the Comptroller-General of Customs and Federal and State police forces. The amendment and the Government's Bill have something in common in that they are in agreement that this material should be able to be provided. They differ in the provisions that they seek to use to do that. The Government has sought a method by which the Taxation Commissioner can, on the Australian Taxation Office's behalf, provide material or information basically if he is satisfied that the information is relevant to:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) establishing whether a serious offence has been, or is being, committed; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the making, or proposed or possible making, of a proceeds of crime order.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition, in response, has sought to interpose a method-as I was saying last night-which has been used in quite a number of places, that is, to interpose the legal system between the agency seeking or providing the information and the people who are seeking it or providing it, whichever the exercise is. </PARA>
<PARA> Another clear difference between the Government's approach and the Opposition's approach is that the initiative in the Government's Bill is on the side of the Commissioner of Taxation, while the initiative in the Opposition's amendment seems to be clearly on the side of those people seeking the information. It is not clear, either from the Government's amendments in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) or from the Opposition's amendments to the Government's proposals, whether the alternative is acceptable. Basically, the legislation is silent, as is the amendment, on the issue of whether it is possible, under the terms of the Government's Bill, for one of those agencies to simply request the Commissioner for information, and for the Commissioner to then provide that information once the agency has satisfied the criteria set out in the Bill. There does not appear to be any reason why that could not occur under the Government's legislation. The legislation is silent on that matter; hence, one must believe it is possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask Senator Stone to clarify this, but my reading of the Opposition's amendment is that the fact that a formal request has to be made by the people seeking the information seems to preclude the Taxation Commissioner from actually offering information. I do not know whether that is the intention of the Opposition's amendment. If it is, it raises significant difficulties. In terms of the information and the areas that we are talking about-and we must remember that we are not referring here to a situation in which this material can be used essentially for anything other than intelligence operations-both groups have the ability to access intelligence and information about whether a serious offence has been or, as the legislation provides, is being, committed. I would be very worried if the Opposition's amendment were constructed in such a way. Senator Stone has indicated his wish to speak as to whether the amendment would preclude an operation coming from the other direction. </PARA>
<PARA> My second concern about the Opposition's amendment is the time frame. As a member of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, I have some working knowledge of the operations of that Authority and of the time frames that are often involved in reaching a decision. Sometimes the time frame is extremely short. I am particularly worried that the Opposition's approach to this matter could very well rule out the exercise that is included in the Government's proposal-if there is an imminent possibility of a serious offence being committed, it might be stopped or the people who are seeking to perpetrate it, immediately arrested. The Opposition's suggested method seems to imply that that would take considerable time. I ask Senator Stone to respond to that concern. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point I wish to make is that when this chamber not so long ago debated the tax file number legislation, which my Party opposed, we debated cognately with it the Privacy Bill 1988. I have, on behalf of my Party, introduced two private members' Bills dealing with this matter and the Bill which was passed was the Government's second attempt at this legislation. So attempts to establish some type of privacy commissioner have a very long history. </PARA>
<PARA> Division 2, section 27 (1) of the Privacy Act lists the Privacy Commissioner's functions. I will read out the pertinent functions from that long list:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioner has . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (a) to investigate an act or practice of an agency that may breach an Information Privacy Principle and, where the Commissioner considers it appropriate to do so, to endeavour, by conciliation, to effect a settlement of the matters . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (b) when requested to do so by a Minister, to examine the proposed enactment that would require or authorise acts or practices of an agency that might, in the absence of the enactment, be interferences with the privacy of individuals. </PARA>
<PARA>In regard to section 27 (1) (b), I ask Senator Tate whether the Government has considered requesting the Privacy Commissioner to examine how this exercise may be accomplished and whether protocols and procedures need to be put in place immediately so that the Australian Taxation Office is provided with guidelines by the Taxation Commissioner as to how to proceed in this matter. Section 27 (1) (h) states:</PARA>
<PARA> (h) to conduct audits of records of personal information maintained by agencies for the purpose of ascertaining whether the records are maintained according to the Information Privacy Principles;</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is particularly pertinent. As Senator Stone said in moving his amendment last night, recently there have been gross violations of privacy on the part of the Taxation Office. In the last 24 hours I have endeavoured to get hold of the statement made by the Taxation Office with regard to these violations. I have not been able to do so. I ask Senator Tate whether he has a statement on this matter from the Privacy Commissioner. I understand that, in terms of the media report at least, the Privacy Commissioner has now required the Taxation Office to establish a privacy organisation function or person. As I said, I still have not been able to get clear details from anybody as to what has gone on in regard to a particular violation of privacy when a lawyer received information with regard to 35 taxpayers. Senator Tate has indicated that he now has that information. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the problems that we have run into in considering the Opposition's amendment. My initial response to the amendment was certainly favourable. However, looking at it as a member of the Joint Select Committee on the National Crime Authority, I am cognisant of the way in which the Authority operates and, to me, the time frame problem is a very real one. I am sure that neither Senator Stone nor anybody else in this place would be interested in protecting in any way people who have committed or will commit crimes, hence when we put in place a legislative mechanism we have to be reasonably careful to ensure that we do not assist criminal activity. As I say, Senator Stone and the Government, as shown by its amendments, have one thing in common: they believe that we can now move to the situation of providing this information. What we are debating is how to do that. The Australian Democrats are also of the opinion that this information should be provided. I am not sure that the method that the Opposition has chosen will facilitate that matter on the two points that I have just raised. I would like to hear from Senator Stone with regard to those matters, and from Senator Tate on the other matters I have raised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stone is engaged in consultation, so I will just mention one or two matters additional to those which I exhaustively went through last night. Was Senator Macklin pointing to section 27 (1) (b) or 28 (1) (b) in the Privacy Act?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>examine a proposed enactment that would require or authorise acts or practices of an agency that might, in the absence of the enactment, be interferences with the privacy of individuals. </PARA>
<PARA>I am getting some information on the actual application of that in this instance. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will see what we can do about that. In general, Senator Macklin is correct in suggesting that where there is a strength or an advantage in the Government's proposal it lies in the fact that, quite clearly, we are depending on a cooperative attitude being fostered between the Commissioner of Taxation and the law enforcement agencies. Indeed, it will be the case that when a law enforcement agency is confronted with a particular serious type of criminal activity or, even more clearly, is proceeding upon a proceeds of crime track, it may approach the Commissioner of Taxation and make a request or seek to know whether there is anything held within the Australian Taxation Office which might be of intelligence use to the law enforcement agency. So that is understood to be part of the cooperative, more administrative scheme, as opposed to the court based scheme proposed by the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the misgivings that have arisen in the community concerning the disclosure of taxation information by the Commissioner of Taxation, his officers or, at least, the Taxation Office-inadvertently, I am quite sure, but, nevertheless, negligently and in a way that has harmed the reputation of the Tax Office in regard to the certainty and sureness that information it holds can be maintained confidentially-it is a fact that discussions took place between the Privacy Commissioner and the Commissioner of Taxation very recently. The press release put out by the Privacy Commissioner advising of new Tax Office controls says:</PARA>
<PARA>A Privacy Ombudsman will be appointed within the Australian Tax Office to ensure adherence to privacy standards, Federal Privacy Commissioner, Mr Kevin O'Connor, was advised today. The Taxation Commissioner, Mr Trevor Boucher, advised Mr O'Connor of plans to create the new position at a meeting in Melbourne today. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on with a review of the situation which had developed with, perhaps, the lack of adequate controls over the provision of information from the Tax Office to certain persons. About three paragraphs from the bottom of the first page, the press release says:</PARA>
<PARA> The Privacy Ombudsman to be appointed shortly will have special responsibility for ensuring adherence to privacy standards within the Tax Office. </PARA>
<PARA>I will try and get the attachment to that press release for Senator Macklin concerning the outline of the advertisement that is to be placed or has been placed in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette relating to that particular office within the Tax Office. The lapses in confidentiality need to be overcome. I believe that the appointment of a Privacy Ombudsman within the Tax Office will assist. It has to be constantly emphasised that as far as this Parliament is concerned such a useful administrative arrangement is one that ought to be in place and perhaps ought to have been in place. Nevertheless from the point of view of this Parliament it is the role of the Privacy Commissioner established by statute under legislation passed late last year which is important. As I pointed out, every time the Commissioner of Taxation makes available to a law enforcement agency material concerning Australian taxpayers in a way which would otherwise be an interference with privacy but is justified and would be justified under this legislation then a notation to that effect must appear on the file. </PARA>
<PARA> The Privacy Commissioner as required by this Parliament will have access to those files, be able to audit the notated files and will be able, if necessary, to report to the Parliament on any abuse that he discovers in relation to the passage of such legislation. </PARA>

As I also pointed out last night, if indeed the Commissioner of Taxation releases information that does not fall within the objectives set by this Parliament, namely, information to do with a serious offence or with respect to proceedings under the proceeds of crime legislation-that is the legislation that confiscates the profits of crime of those convicted of serious offences-the Taxation Commissioner is guilty of a breach of section 16 of the tax Act and will be subjected to very severe penalties. Indeed a mandamus can be sought from the High Court of Australia in order to ensure that the Taxation Commissioner does his duty and keeps within the statutory bounds. What I am saying is that there are procedures available--</PARA></TALK.START>

The fact is that this Parliament late last year, recognising that a court based approach in this area would be very costly, cumbersome and difficult for people to take advantage of, provided that we really should rely on the Privacy Commissioner and the cheaper administrative arrangements, surveillance and supervision that he can undertake as the preferred method of ensuring adherence to the will of the Parliament in relation to the maintenance of privacy and confidentiality of information given under compulsion, in this case to the Tax Office, as required by law. It is that notation of files and the supervisory role of the Privacy Commissioner which will provide the sort of protection that is required. It will be bolstered somewhat by the appointment of a Privacy Commissioner within the Tax Office. As I said, that is perhaps to protect the standing of the Tax Office which has declined somewhat in the public mind as a result of some recent instances. But as far as the Parliament is concerned it is the reliance on the Privacy Commissioner which is paramount.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond quickly to the couple of questions which were, I think, specifically addressed to me by Senator Macklin. I will have more extensive comments to make about the position of the Minister for Justice at a later stage of the committee debate. Some of my other colleagues want to speak also. I rise momentarily now simply to say that Senator Macklin asked me whether he was correct in his understanding. I hope that if I recall Senator Macklin's questions inaccurately he will assist me because I was being rather harassed at the time by the conversation of other colleagues here on relevant matters. I understood Senator Macklin to ask me first whether his understanding of our amendment was correct in that it would preclude the Commissioner of Taxation acting on his own discretion as distinct from acting only in response to approaches. The answer to that question is yes. That is the intention of the amendment for reasons I have already stated but which I am prepared certainly to elaborate on at a later stage of the committee debate. Secondly, if I understood Senator Macklin's question correctly, he referred to the need at times for law enforcement agencies to have information available to them in an attempt to deal with a crime which they believe is about to be committed-`imminently' is I think the word he used. Senator Macklin is nodding; I appear to have understood him correctly. He indicated that he understood that our amendment would-again I am paraphrasing-provide a significant hindrance to that sense of urgency or imminence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is not quite such an easy question to respond to. If the law enforcement agency really believes that a crime is about to be committed it can go urgently to a Federal judge and urgently seek access to information. All those processes would probably take some hours more-perhaps a day longer in the worst case-than the more straightforward, if I can put it that way, but more objectionable bureaucratic procedure of information simply being passed. It is undoubtedly true that there would be some slight delay in those procedures. We have to accept that in any safeguards which one writes into legislation to protect the liberties of the citizens of this country there are bound to be some costs of that kind. Clearly if our only objective were to set up the most efficient police state we could devise in order to absolutely track down, locate, prosecute and put behind bars every criminal in this country, and we had no regard whatsoever for safeguards of civil liberties in the process, we could devise a much more efficient system for that purpose. Mr Temporary Chairman, through you I put to Senator Macklin that we recognise that there is a slight cost in that regard but see it as a totally appropriate cost to pay, given the objectives we seek to achieve. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a little more concern about the matter raised by Senator Macklin. It seems to me, as Senator Stone has said, that Senator Macklin's concerns related to the time frames, if there was an imminent-I think that was his word-possibility of a serious offence being committed. As I read the explanatory memorandum, on page 26 it specifically seems to exclude the very point that I think Senator Macklin was making. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Broadly, proposed section 3e provides the Commissioner of Taxation with a discretion to disclose taxation information to an authorised law enforcement agency officer. Such disclosure is conditional on the Commissioner being satisfied that the information is relevant to the investigation of a serious offence or post-conviction confiscation and restraining order proceedings. The information may be disclosed by the Commissioner of Taxation either on his own initiative or in response to a request by an authorised law enforcement agency officer. The Commissioner cannot be compelled to reveal information. Information disclosed under section 3e may only be used for investigation purposes except where it relates to confiscation and restraining order proceedings in relation to a person convicted of a serious offence. </PARA>
<PARA>The second half of that would not involve any urgency in the sense that it would relate to a serious offence. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Macklin intervenes, the bit that concerns him is that which says `may only be used for investigation purposes'. As I understood the investigation purposes proposition, the urgency related to that surely would be limited, if it is for investigation purposes, to a response presumably by the officer or crime agency involved. Is Senator Macklin expressing concern that the Commissioner on his own initiative would encourage investigation? I raise that because it seems to me that to add this to the Commissioner's many discretions raises serious problems indeed. It has already been alleged that the Commissioner has made threats to people in terms of coming to deals on taxation matters. It would really worry me if we were to give an added discretion to the Commissioner, to give him the power, if you like, to say, `Look, if you don't resolve this matter I will refer it to another body or to someone else and I will encourage investigation'. I think that there is a cost-benefit in this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not saying that the Commissioner will naturally behave disgracefully; all I am saying is that there may well be a temptation to whoever is the Commissioner to use this as an additional piece of clout in his relationship with the taxpayer who may well feel in these circumstances that he should give way to the Tax Commissioner's request, having been pressured like this. Frankly, I am concerned about giving the Tax Commissioner additional clout in this area. I clearly take the view that in any event for a large part of this activity there is no prospect of urgency. In respect of the part where it may only be used for investigation purposes, I would need to be convinced that an investigation would be dangerously inhibited by protecting the rights and secrecy of ordinary citizens of Australia, given the assertions by Senator Macklin and admissions by the Minister that the Taxation Office has abused the trust that has been put in it in terms of secrecy and that it has done so to a considerable extent. </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise that no-one is perfect and that prosecutions and all sorts of other activities may well proceed, but I do think that it is unreasonable to ask us to adopt a cost-benefit approach to this matter when we have yet to see the material that Senator Macklin called for and when, in fact, it seems to me that the sense of urgency may possibly apply only to a proportion of the information that the Commissioner may be inclined to reveal to other law enforcement agencies. Unless I was absolutely convinced that the cost-benefit lay totally and overwhelmingly with this proposed change in the law, I would need far more convincing arguments than I have heard today to go along with it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take Senator Michael Baume's point with regard to the second part of the proposition; that is, of a person who has been convicted. Fairly obviously, the only urgency that would be available in terms of the types of things I was saying, is in the investigatory role or what the Minister referred to as providing material with regard to intelligence about the possible commission of a crime. I will refer to the second point first: Senator Baume has expressed concern with regard to the additional power provided to the Taxation Commissioner. He was suggesting that there should be an additional lever when there was no cooperation from a particular person. I probably agree. While the intent of the legislation may not be that, I can foresee that powers, once given, tend to be used if they are available. Clause 3e (3) states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Where information is communicated to a person under subsection (1) or (2), the person:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) shall not voluntarily give the information in evidence in a proceeding before a court; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) shall not be required to divulge or communicate the information to a court. </PARA>
<PARA>That may put a significant bar on wanting to go down that track. We could end up jeopardising an otherwise decent case against a person. This is the trade-off which we discussed recently in regard to the corporations legislation and which applies to a whole range of similar areas. On almost every occasion that we lean towards providing information, the Parliament has said that that information cannot be used to get a conviction. Law enforcement agencies will have to weigh up the pros and cons of how they will use the information-but not information derived from obtaining it-because providing it may rule out the conviction of someone in a court. Clause 3e (3) might be a sufficient bar to the type of situation which Senator Michael Baume raised. I, too, am interested in the Minister's response. I think it is an important point. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Stone indicated that my interpretation of the Opposition amendments-that it is only a one-way street-was correct. That aspect of the Opposition's amendments concerns me. Essentially, it is a move away from the law enforcement agencies to the Taxation Commissioner. I have been concerned about that for a long time, particularly since serving on the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. The Authority has to know what information the Taxation Commissioner has before it can ask him for it. The Authority, under the current legislation, is not permitted to go on a fishing expedition-and quite rightly. The Opposition's amendments propose to maintain that regime. It seems to me that we are being unduly harsh on ourselves in the fight against crime. Where the Taxation Commissioner may have information, he ought to tell the law enforcement agencies that he believes that a crime is about to be committed. That is precisely what the legislation before us provides for. I have felt for a long time that that was needed. I have not yet heard a sufficient argument from the Opposition which would weigh against that. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable senators read the report of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority on its inquiry into drugs, crime and society-although probably not many have been able to do so because of the busy time we have had in the chamber-they will be only too aware that we are facing a most horrific battle against crime which is being funded by billions of dollars from the drug trade. I am cognisant of the matters raised by Senator Stone. I am as worried as he is about how far we should go. I agree totally with his point that we could establish a police state and probably pick up most criminals, but it would not be the type of state any of us would want to live in. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an area where we have to make very fine judgments. Unfortunately, the principles which are in conflict do not give us much of a lead. My experience from having served on the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority has led me to believe that a properly controlled exercise with regard to information held by the Taxation Commissioner could be of massive benefit to many of our law enforcement agencies. The Opposition has not agreed that the information should be so provided; we are just talking about what the proper controls should be. </PARA>
<PARA> I am still inclined to support the Government's proposition, not only for the reasons I have already outlined but also because, if the Privacy Commissioner's role can be enhanced by the actions of further legislation in this Parliament, it can become an extremely powerful office. If it is diluted by still keeping away from it a whole range of bits and pieces-and the Opposition's amendment still proposes to go down the court route rather than the Privacy Commissioner route-I am not sure that we will have a powerful Privacy Commissioner. I believe that in the Privacy Act, part of which I read out regarding the functions of the Commissioner, there are available significant and far-reaching powers which, because of the infancy of the Commission, have not yet been used. I am interested in a response from the Minister as to whether the Government has determined that the Privacy Commissioner, on a request by the Minister, will be able to involve himself in this exercise prior to any information being delivered, rather than waiting to use his other powers after a possible breach has occurred. </PARA>

That is what I take to be the thrust of the Opposition's amendment. I support the Opposition in that, but I think we need an answer before we can proceed. If the Government has not had a chance to get that-and I understand that the Minister at the table is acting for the Acting Treasurer, so there may be some difficulty in communication-I am quite happy to seek leave to put this matter aside until a later time in the committee considerations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Several matters have been raised by Senator Macklin. I need not go over the discussion that has taken place during the last quarter of an hour in the chamber. I have not grasped what Senator Macklin is looking for out of section 27 (1) (b). It provides, in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>when requested to do so by the Minister, to examine a proposed enactment . . .</PARA>
<PARA>If Senator Macklin is asking whether the Treasurer (Mr Keating) afforded to the Privacy Commissioner a copy of the Bill to seek advice on a proposed enactment, then the answer is no. No such request was made by the Treasurer of the Privacy Commissioner. Nevertheless, I believe it would be possible for the Privacy Commissioner to provide advice to a Minister or an agency on any matter relevant to the operation of this Act under, for example, section 27 (1) (f). The opportunity not having been taken under section 27 (1) (b), perhaps section 27 (1) (f) could provide a vehicle for the sort of consideration by the Privacy Commissioner of the way in which this particular amendment, if passed by the chamber and assented to, would operate in relation to the general privacy principles that are available--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am reading from the Privacy Act. I could informally give an indication that the Government would seek from the Privacy Commissioner under section 27 (1) (f)-if that proves to be the best vehicle-advice on the way in which this particular amendment ought to operate so as to maintain strict adherence by the Taxation Commissioner to the objectives of crime fighting, to which Senator Macklin has so eloquently spoken, and yet maintain a balance with the privacy and confidentiality considerations, which are so important, particularly when dealing with information given to the Australian Taxation Office. I give an informal undertaking to that effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the question of urgency and the initiative being taken by the Taxation Commissioner to provide information to law enforcement agencies, this is an important point. Despite what Senator Macklin thinks, it may be quite important in relation to proceeds of crime proceedings. It might, perhaps more commonly, turn out to be the case that the Taxation Commissioner has information that is more relevant to the hidden accumulation of assets and the very imminent attempt to dispose of those assets in relation to proceeds of crime proceedings than to some other more substantive criminal activity or serious offence. We might find that the Taxation Commissioner actually has more information and intelligence of use in relation to proceeds of crime legislation where the profits of unscrupulous criminals could otherwise be dissipated, and to make that available quickly and urgently, and in a timely fashion, to a law enforcement agency might be extremely useful. </PARA>
<PARA> But there is a trade-off, as Senator Macklin has pointed out. Apart from proceeds of crime proceedings and those matters relating to revenue raising-tax offences and the like-none of this information can be voluntarily disclosed to a court or compelled or coerced in a court proceeding. It cannot come out on the public record. It cannot be used as admissible evidence; it remains simply as information and intelligence which may be of use during the investigative phase leading up to the assembling of admissible evidence for presentation in the court proceeding. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am appalled at the situation. We have passed an Act in this place quite specifically with regard to the Commissioner of Taxation in which there is a provision which states, `when requested to do so by a Minister, to examine a proposed enactment'. This is a very serious enactment, and the Government does not even follow through on its own legislation. Now we are going to get an informal notice. I do not think that is good enough. There is no urgency on this piece of legislation, certainly not until next week. My proposal-and I want to test the chamber on this-is that we continue with the remainder of the committee stage of the Bill and, after reporting progress, bring the Bill back again on Tuesday, when the Government can provide us with the formal response it has sought and obtained from the Privacy Commissioner. The Government has not followed through on its own legislation before bringing this Bill into this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely; that is right, but I would not want that to be seen as a retreat from our position. I find it objectionable that we have provisions of this nature, which ought to stand alone, attached to a technical Bill almost as an addendum. When I was in my office Senator Macklin raised the question of the Opposition's position with respect to the Commissioner being able to initiate the provision of legislation as distinct from its being solicited from him, which is the essence of our amendment. Of course, that is the clear distinction between our position and that of the Government. Senator Macklin was quite right when he said that powers, once given, are not given in some sort of socially acceptable way; they are not used with some moral guideline weighing heavily upon the shoulders of the person who has the capacity to use the information. Once powers are given, they are invariably and inevitably used as a negotiating chip to the extremities of the interpretation of the powers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation has demonstrated that. The Rambo-type raids on merchant banks demonstrate that the Commissioner of Taxation will test his powers right to the very edges. Whilst I exclude Senator Macklin-and he will understand that-certain senators within this chamber very dearly hold unto themselves a reputation as being civil libertarians, but whenever they are confronted with situations such as this, they are the first to argue that the onus ought to be removed from the investigating officers and cast in the opposite direction. </PARA>
<PARA> On reading this Bill, I can see no distinct guidelines or parameters for the Commissioner of Taxation. It is based very much on a subjective judgment, a state of mind. The Commissioner of Taxation may receive evidence which may be peripheral, inconclusive and not substantial but which may lead him, in a subjective way, to conclude that his providing the information is relevant to establishing whether a serious offence has been or is being committed, or is relevant to a possible proceeds of crime order. These are very much matters in the mind of the Commissioner of Taxation simply on the basis of what evidence is incidentally available to him. One might ask: With what knowledge, with what judgment, and on what basis, would the Commissioner of Taxation draw the conclusion that information on his files is information which, if provided to a law enforcement agency, would establish whether a serious crime had been committed?</PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Stone has said, quite correctly, we could introduce into the Australian community a watchdog system which would no doubt dramatically reduce the levels of crime. But at what price? Banks and almost every government agency, as well as private institutions, would be able to provide information to law enforcement agencies. We could even take it a step further: we could compel them to provide information to the law enforcement agencies if that information led them subjectively to conclude that the commission of a serious offence may be established. We could make it compulsory-which is just a further step away. We have seen the price that some people have already had to pay in terms of inquiries based on very inadequate and poor information and as a result of subjectivity in drawing conclusions. On my reading of the Bill, the Taxation Ombudsman would be in no serious way a caveat upon the conduct of the Commissioner of Taxation, who could always retreat on the basis, in his mind, that information he had was relevant. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a very clear distinction between the Government's position and our view that there ought to be a reason for the information to be required by an authorised law enforcement agency, and that reason ought to be that information the agency has received causes it to seek information from the Commissioner of Taxation. Fundamentally, that is the very clear difference between the two of us. </PARA>

That is a gross invasion of privacy. I see the adviser frowning but that is the truth. The Government Statistician can demand to see someone's tax return. This is apart from all the other things he can do, such as see someone's bank manager, ask what collateral someone has and inquire into all sorts of personal financial areas that I consider to be an invasion of privacy. That is one of the reasons why I introduced the Census and Statistics Amendment (Voluntary Provision of Survey Information) Bill of 1988 into the Senate. I did so in order that this Parliament could exercise its power and disallow provisions that we considered too intrusive. That Bill was passed without dissent in this Senate and went to the other House. The other House debated it but did not vote on it on the instructions of the Treasurer (Mr Keating). I know why the Government wants the Statistician to collect all this information-it is purely for the purpose of social engineering. In the past it has been used for that purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I move my amendment, I refer the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) to the paragraph in the explanatory memorandum concerning minors in receipt of the child disability allowance. If one looks at the explanatory memorandum-I do not know whether too many people do-one sees that it states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Division 6aa does not apply to income received by a child in a year of income in respect of whom a handicapped child's allowance under the Social Security Act 1947 is payable in respect of a period that included the last day of the year of income and who is the subject of a medical certificate certifying the child to be a handicapped child, or a severely handicapped child, within the meaning of Part XII of that Act. </PARA>
<PARA>That is supposed to be an explanatory memorandum. I prefer the legislation, which is clearer. Many people other than lawyers have an interest in the enactments of this Parliament, and it would assist greatly if the explanatory memorandum could actually explain something and not make it more difficult to understand, particularly in matters such as those relating to handicapped children. A lot of parents would be interested in this legislation. Perhaps the Minister will say whether I am right or wrong in assuming that the movement we have made, whereby people are able to get acceptance through the Department of Social Security that their child is significantly handicapped and therefore will receive a handicapped child's allowance, means that that allowance will not be taxed. I presume that is what we are now doing. In fact we are going back to the beginning of that allowance so that it covers the years 1987-88 and onwards. Is that the import of that provision? If it is, I think it is an excellent idea and we should have picked it up when we passed the original legislation. </PARA>

<PARA>`` `(xcv) the Nursing Mothers' Association of Australia;'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>My amendment was previously circulated in regard to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2), but I have now moved it to this Bill because the Government has sought to amend that section with regard to two other items in this legislation. The Government is seeking to include two funds in the list of charities: first, the public fund for the Armenian earthquake victims, which will run only from the time the earthquake occurred until 1 July this year; and secondly, the Australian-Ireland Fund. The fact that my father is Irish leads me to support that provision. My amendment also seeks to include another organisation, the Nursing Mothers Association of Australia. As honourable senators would probably be aware, particularly the women in the chamber, this is the second largest women's organisation in this country. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the Country Women's Association. The Nursing Mothers Association now has more than 1,600 trained breastfeeding counsellors and I am informed that there are about 800 trainee counsellors currently undertaking training. There are nearly 600 groups around the country, and last year nearly a quarter of a million women were counselled on breastfeeding. That may not seem an important item to the Government, but when we look at the structure of our society, we find that when many women have their first and subsequent children, they have very little support. Previously the social structure was such that sisters, aunts or even mothers may have been available, but now there is very little support during what is a very difficult time for young mothers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Nursing Mothers Association provides not only information with regard to breast feeding but also that social support that is necessary. Indeed counsellors-I know this from personal experience as my wife has operated as a counsellor for some considerable time-have to deal not only with inquiries with regard to breastfeeding but often with much more difficult situations as well, particularly when a child may have been crying for 10 or 15 hours and the mother is at breaking point. Those are the types of social situations where child abuse can often occur. I think this is exacerbated by the isolation that mothers can feel within our community. </PARA>
<PARA> I now specifically direct my attention to the breastfeeding activities of the Association. The Government has been very supportive of the Association, at least in words, but its actions have been very detrimental to it. The working party that the Government established to implement the World Health Organisation's International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes, which reported in March 1985, said:</PARA>
<PARA>this organisation-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Nursing Mothers Association of Australia-</PARA>
<PARA>has had a major influence in reversing the trend of the 1960s and early 1970s away from breastfeeding. </PARA>
<PARA>This also may not seem to be terribly important to the Government, but the economic ramifications might be interesting to Senator Walsh. I have done some calculations of the number of counselling calls that have been undertaken by the Nursing Mothers Association. If the 1,500 voluntary counsellors, who do not cost the community a penny, were not there to give those counselling calls, and if only one in 10 of those women sought counselling from a doctor rather than the Nursing Mothers Association, the cost to Medicare would be $800,000. I am sure that neither of the two funds that the Government has included in the legislation can make that claim; in fact, they can claim only to cost money. But by including the Nursing Mothers Association, the Government would help to support an organisation which, if it were not there and only one in 10 of its clients went to doctors, would effectively mean a cost of $800,000 to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> More importantly, I think the whole notion of preventative medicine in Australia is extremely important. I do not intend to go through a long list-although I could if honourable senators wished me to do so-of the beneficial effects of breastfeeding. I am referring to a compilation of the information in all the latest medical journals from around the world which have shown, unequivocally, three major benefits. The first is improved health and reduced morbidity in breastfeeding infants. If that is not a major gain to the community, nothing else is. Secondly, there is reduced likelihood of numerous diseases and disorders in young children and of a later onset of those diseases and disorders. Thirdly, there are positive effects on mothers' reproductive systems with a lessening risk of later disorders. It seems to me that there is an overwhelming case for the promotion of breastfeeding. Indeed, the Government accepts that. </PARA>
<PARA> We are dealing with a voluntary organisation of women-an organisation which does not cost the taxpayer a penny because its last grant was withdrawn. That organisation is determined to continue its efforts in this regard, to expand and to continue its good work. What it is asking is that it merely be included as a charity so that its fundraising activities will be able to attract the same type of support that the Australian-Irish Association and the victims of the Armenian earthquake will receive as a result of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Association has been active for quite some time and I am surprised that it has not been included in the legislation. Requests have been made over a number of years for that to occur but no action has been taken. The Association should not have to wait any longer. The Government has withdrawn the last $70,000 which was being used for training women to give counselling. As I have said, over the years that has effected massive savings for Medicare. The least we can do is say to the association that we will treat it at least as seriously as the Australian-Irish Association and some of the other organisations that currently receive this advantage-for example, the Australian Administrative Staff College, the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, the Australiana Fund, the Herbert Evatt Memorial Foundation Fund, the Victorian Arts Centre Trust, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Fund, the Connellan Airways Trust, the national parks and the Work Skill Australia Foundation Inc. If it is worthwhile continuing to activate this part of the legislation-and the Government has seen that as being worthwhile-it is worthwhile activating it with regard to the Nursing Mothers Association. I hope that the amendment will have the support of all honourable senators, displaying from this chamber at least, and hopefully the Government, that we are very much appreciative of the enormous work being done by the second largest women's organisation in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I extend Senator Macklin's remarks in supporting the Nursing Mothers Association. There has been a great deal of talk, particularly in recent days, about level playing fields. When we consider the advantages of breastfeeding, we must observe that a number of the companies making artificial formulae have strongly promoted the advantages of their products for consumption by babies and young children. We have moved from a period in which breastfeeding fell into disfavour and, thankfully, we are moving back into a period where the enormous advantages of breastfeeding, which have been outlined briefly by Senator Macklin, are being more widely recognised. Breastfeeding is coming back into much wider practice. The Government has recognised its advantages. I recall statements by the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) extolling the virtues of breastfeeding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I merely draw attention to the fact that the manufacturers of artificial formulae can advertise those products and the cost of that advertising is tax deductable. The more they spend on advertising the greater the advantages they get through the tax system of being able to promote their version of what is best for babies and young children. Surely it is appropriate that a voluntary organisation that chooses not to further its own interests but rather to further the public interest, as expressed by the enormous advantages of breastfeeding, should obtain precisely the same sorts of tax advantages. For that reason the case for the Nursing Mothers Association to gain tax deductability status is absolutely incontrovertible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I support Senator Walters in acknowledging the work of the Nursing Mothers Association of Australia. I am also concerned that an amendment has been brought into the chamber at short notice regarding that organisation when there are many other anomalies in the taxation system for voluntary organisations. I refer particularly to the pony clubs of Australia. It is bizarre that the Australian Taxation Office sent a response to my saying, `You can have tax deductability for human organisations and animal organisations but we are awfully sorry, there is no clause that covers pony clubs because animals and humans are integral to each other in that association'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When such anomalies exist, I do not think that coming in here and accepting an amendment from the Democrats is the best way of going about this. What the Committee should be doing is looking at voluntary organisations, the role they play and their eligibility for tax deductability. Along with the Nursing Mothers Association go many voluntary organisations which make significant major contributions to our society but which have been ignored in the taxation system. To single out one on the run is probably not the most effective way to go. I am not in any way saying that the Nursing Mothers Association has not made a magnificent contribution. I have many friends who are members; I know of its work closely and, in fact, have spoken at a number of its meetings in my role as a psychologist and a person who is interested in child development and ageing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will not agree to the amendment for the sorts of reasons set out by Senator Patterson. I readily concede that there is an element of semi- or quasi-arbitrariness in the selection of charity lists which qualify for tax deductions. It is very difficult for anybody unequivocally to support or condemn any particular organisation's inclusion on the list. For a couple of years I have been lobbied by the Citizens Advice Bureau in Perth, which put a case that that organisation should be on the tax deductability list. It put up a plausible case. I have just referred it to the Treasurer (Mr Keating) without any endorsement from me. I am sure that if anybody who has been here for quite a while combed through his files he would find many such examples. The Government will consider the case that Senator Macklin put up, but we will not accept the amendment at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to Senator Walters's question, as I recall it-this is a recollection from a long-gone Cabinet meeting-the Treasurer has proposed an extension for the Australian-Ireland Fund. I think there was some linkage between the bicentennial year and some other activity the Irish Government was undertaking in Australia. I will not guarantee the accuracy of that, but as in all of these cases I readily concede that there is an element, at least at the margin, of arbitrary judgment about what should be in and what should be out. We will consider that in the future, but there are probably 50 other organisations for which an advocate could put up a plausible claim. </PARA>

If the Government or any Ministers of the Government are interested in the welfare of infants and their mothers, it should explain to the Committee why it has cut off the money to that organisation. It has been very well established that the work of the organisation is not only important in itself, by benefiting the nursing mothers and their infants, but in addition, it is of benefit to the taxpayers and the Government. The counselling and advice that is given by the representatives of the Nursing Mothers Association, the classes that are conducted and the individual attention that is given by members of that organisation, result in a saving to the Government. If this advice and counselling were not given through the Nursing Mothers Association, it would very often have to be sought elsewhere.

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I will respond to the question and the comment raised. First, Senator Patterson made the comment that this is a new item. She might be new here, but the item has been around for a long time. Requests have been made for a long time, and before the bicentennial year. Certainly it was in the pipeline prior to that. In the speech I made on the Australian Institute of Health Bill in 1987 I canvassed the issue and again nothing was done. It is not a new issue. It has been around for a long time. It has been on everybody's plate and nothing has happened. That is why it has been raised again, and in this chamber a couple of days ago I circulated an amendment to another Bill so that everyone had notice of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, I wish to address the question asked by Senator Walters, quite properly, with regard to costings. As far as I can ascertain, the lowest income within the accounting system which the Nursing Mothers Association of Australia uses is for a group which includes royalties, membership fees, grants and donations. An estimate has been given to me by the Association as to how much it would receive by way of donations. It is a very small amount-probably no more than $5,000 or $6,000. There are two factors to bear in mind with regard to that. The cost to the revenue is negligible. After all, the Australian Ireland Fund will cost $50,000, and the Nursing Mothers Association would not cost that much. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two other points concerning the costing which Senator Walters should bear in mind. The first is that now the Government grant which was being used to train people to give counselling has been removed, the organisation will have to find that money itself. The organisation is also seeking permanent headquarters in suburban Melbourne, particularly a permanent location for the lactation resource centre, which is now acknowledged around the world as having one of the best collections of information and data on this subject. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point, which I raised when I moved this amendment, is that, if this Association is unable to continue its work-and the Government, of course has removed any support that it gave-then, rather than it being a cost to the community, there would possibly be a lessening in the number of women who would be trained by the organisation. I made an estimate, which I mentioned before and which I now repeat because Senator Harradine raised the same issue. If one in 10 of those counselling activities was not able to be done by the Nursing Mothers Association and, instead, was done by a doctor-and I do not think that is an extravagant suggestion to make-it would cost nearly $800,000 in Medicare fees, based on the bulk billing rebate and not including any other fees which may be charged over and above that by a general practitioner. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not an issue which has just come up; it is a longstanding issue. As far as I can see, the work that this organisation is doing has the support of all senators. There is acknowledgment that the money has been removed and an acknowledgment that this organisation is a charity which is doing magnificent work in the community and should have been included in these provisions. Are we going to wait for the Government to take another two, three or four years to get its act in order, or are we going to act on behalf of the organisation? This is not an issue which has been sprung on honourable senators; everybody knows about this organisation, and honourable senators have probably come into contact with it themselves. I certainly know Senator Walters has because she has spoken in this place in support of it. She is very much aware of the organisation and is a great supporter of it. It is not a matter of not understanding what this organisation does; it is not a matter of not understanding that this is a problem which has existed for a long time; and it is not a matter of not believing that this is a worthwhile organisation which saves government money. I do not understand the Government's reluctance to include this organisation in these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to the last point that Senator Patterson raised-which was a good point-that there ought to be a general review of this legislation. Senator Patterson may be interested to know that before she took her seat in this place there was a debate on this topic-and I can give her the reference to it in Hansard-during which that suggestion was made. The Government accepted it and nothing happened. All the Government has done with this Bill is to bring in another two items. </PARA>

<PARA> Since the legislation will come into force at the time that is required by the Government, since the other place will undoubtedly support an amendment along these lines because of the very small amount of money which is initially involved and the very large amount of money which has been saved to the community, and since the organisation has a very beneficial effect throughout the community, it seems to me that this suggestion should not be put aside. It is an issue which has been going on for a long time. I think now is the time to come to grips with it and to force the issue. </PARA>

The amendment ensures that children who receive what is now called the disabled child allowance will not come within division 6aa, which imposes a higher rate of tax on the unearned income of minors, that being a provision which, I think, was introduced by the Fraser Government.

That is clearly evident in relation to artificial formulae for infant feeding. The companies which sell those products are promoting a view of what is desirable in relation to the nutrition of infants such that the consumption of their product is increased. Those companies promoting that view of the relationship between mother and child and infant nutrition receive tax deductable status for putting that point of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Organisations such as the Nursing Mothers Association are putting forward an alternative view that breastfeeding is desirable for children. They have nothing to gain personally from that. What they gain is their share of the common good; yet they are penalised because the donations they receive come from individuals who make those donations after tax has been charged on their income. So it is not a level playing field. I think the Government, in considering the review which has been suggested by Senator Patterson, should look to this matter and ask itself whether those bodies which are furthering the public interest should not get exactly the same tax deductable status as advertisers promoting a particular view of a particular lifestyle such that consumers increase their consumption of their products and they profit. Advertisers have a great deal to gain from putting that point of view. The Nursing Mothers Association has nothing to gain individually from putting its point of view other than the better health of the Australian community. That principle of the level playing field, to which so many people pay lip service, needs to be recognised in this area of tax deductability. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter which has been raised by the amendment moved by Senator Macklin relates to section 78 of the Income Tax Assessment Act-the deductability of gifts provision. For my sins, I have some knowledge of that provision. It has been one of the most contentious, time-consuming and difficult areas of the tax law for many years, probably ever since it was first put into the tax Act. Of course, there is no lack of good causes. We can all think of probably half a dozen bodies which we happen to think are excellent worthy bodies performing useful or vital public services. The Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh)-I do not always praise the Minister, but I do on this occasion-very fairly said that there is a degree of arbitrariness. I think that is acknowledged on all sides. It is certainly acknowledged by the beleaguered Treasury and Australian Taxation Office officials who have to preside over the administration of the tax law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the face of it, one might well ask: Why should the chamber not support the body to which Senator Macklin wishes to direct the bounty of the taxpayers of Australia? We should not neglect to understand that, when we provide for the deductability of gifts in the tax law, we are basically providing a concession to those who make those gifts, in terms of their taxpaying proclivities, at the expense of other taxpayers. We may be able to make out a perfectly good case for doing that in some cases but, if we are to have people such as Senator Coulter advancing the argument about a level playing field-I must confess that I could not quite follow his argument on that point-I think we need to go a bit more deeply into it than I suggest Senator Coulter did. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no good bringing up amendments of this kind at the last minute. I did hear Senator Macklin say that this amendment has been around for a month or so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may have been around for years in one sense of the term `been around'. But, having the responsibility for the handling of this legislation on behalf of the Opposition, I am concerned that this amendment arrived on my desk only yesterday. I hope that I will not be contradicted in that respect. At no time, either prior to that time or since, did Senator Macklin or any other member of the Australian Democrats speak to me about their intentions in this regard. Had they done so it might have been possible, in the limited time available, to give some consideration to it-although I rather doubt it because the time would have been too limited. It is no good the Democrats coming into this chamber and saying that something has been around for a month, a year, or whatever the time is supposed to be, when we have received a specific proposal only within the last 24 hours. If we are to have good government in this country we simply cannot handle matters of that kind on the run.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To make an obvious point, I do not imagine that the Minister has had time-in fact I am sure that he has not-to undertake the kinds of processes that he would have to undertake with his Cabinet colleagues, or at any rate a sufficiently senior group of them, to give him authority to agree to an amendment of this kind. I make that point only to draw the obvious parallel that the Opposition has not had sufficient time either. We have had no time to put a proposal of this kind to our shadow Cabinet. It would be the responsibility of the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), to do so anyway; it is not my responsibility. There is no time and there will not be an opportunity now, because the House of Representatives has risen, to have a party room discussion on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> We have here a classic example of the behaviour of the Australian Democrats on so many areas where it is a matter of all care and no responsibility. The Democrats come into this chamber time and again putting themselves forward as the caring representatives of the people. But the fact of the matter is that the Democrats have no responsibility for the government of this country. They will come into this chamber and support amendments twice a day every day of the week. This amendment happens to be a terribly minor one and I am not suggesting that it would ruin the country if it were to be incorporated into the tax law; of course it would not. Indeed, Democrat speakers would argue that it would be good for the country, and I am not denying that. They have a perfectly valid case in that respect. But it is not good enough for them to put themselves forward as a responsible political party, yet day after day, week after week, month after month and year after year wheel up to this chamber proposals to spend the taxpayers' money and, therefore, tax the taxpayers a lot more than they are presently taxed, in order to do all the things that the Democrats think should be done, or at least have put forward as things they think should be done, when they have no responsibility whatsoever for the consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> This afternoon we will be debating a matter of public importance, the terms of which I think have already been circulated, in which we will be talking about the disastrous impact of the Government's high interest rate policy on home buyers, small businesses and farmers. I do not want to get onto that matter; we will have something to say about that later today. I am simply making the point that this is a characteristic modus operandi on the part of the Australian Democrats. Frankly, I think it is time they grew up. </PARA>
<PARA> My senatorial colleague Senator Harradine has also supported the amendment. I am inclined to take Senator Harradine's remarks on these matters a good deal more seriously than I am often prepared to concede in the case of the Australian Democrats. But he said that all the Nursing Mothers Association of Australia is asking is to be registered as a charity, so to speak-I think I have quoted him correctly; I took down his words at the time-in order not to be subject to a double whammy. As has been pointed out by Senator Macklin and reiterated by Senator Harradine, the point about the double whammy arose from the fact that this group has been deprived by the Government of a previous grant-in-aid of $73,000. I have to say that the logic of that escapes me. One can argue about whether that grant should have been withdrawn. I think there is a prior question as to the level at which the Government should be making such grants to all these individual associations or organisations in Australia. I think the process of having everything happening from Canberra-all these great tentacles stretching out from Canberra with bits of money being dribbled out here, there and everywhere because some Commonwealth parliamentarian or Minister thinks he can pick up a vote or two in the process-is a recipe for fiscal disaster of the kind that we are now experiencing in this country. We would all be better employed if we put the responsibility for aid of this kind elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to debate the question of whether the association as such is a perfectly worthy object of such aid. It may well be; in fact, I am sure that in many ways it is. What I am saying is that there is a perfectly good case for saying that such aid should come from a State government, not the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the double whammy argument. Senator Harradine's argument is not correct. It is subject to a single whammy by withdrawal of the grant, but nothing else has happened. No double whammy is involved. I think we have to get our line of argument straight. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in the light of all considerations I mentioned earlier, we simply cannot handle matters of this kind in the manner in which the Australian Democrats would like us to. The Opposition will not be able to support this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The issue that I raised was a serious one, but Senator Stone, in his rather tedious way, has decided to make it a political one. It is rather fascinating that he wants to preach about the receipt of amendments, but he has no intention of abiding by those types of rules himself. I have in front of me a copy of amendments dated 8 June which stretch to seven pages. Were we given notice? No; we were asked to support seven pages of amendments on a complex issue with no notice. What is good for the goose is good for the gander, but not for Senator Stone. But everybody should know about the final bias he revealed. He was much more supportive of the comments that Senator Harradine made than of those I made, on the basis of his own personal prejudices. If he wants to conduct his response to legislation in that way, that is his prerogative. But the little preaching about holier than thou and who is giving who notice of amendments is a bit difficult to take when one receives seven pages of amendments on an issue that I took seriously, because I thought it was a serious proposition, and on which I sought an adjournment so that further consideration could be given. I do not know whether any honourable senators want to say that I did not take the issues that they raised seriously; I did. All I have been asking is that I might get in return a serious consideration, not a prejudiced consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is possible to consider these matters. As this has been going on for so long, I would have thought that the Opposition would have had a view about this particular matter. That particular amendment was sent to the Government and the Opposition three days ago as an amendment to a separate Bill. I explained that it was an amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2). It was far more appropriate to move that to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3). The advice I was given was that the amendment should relate to Bill No. 2. That advice turned out to be wrong; it should have been No. 3. The actual motion was there in people's hands. The Opposition expects us to respond to those types of propositions from it and we seek to do so. Whether the House of Representatives is here or not, this chamber is going to continue on with its legislation and, presumably, continue to consider possible amendments. All I am asking is that when we put up an amendment it be given due consideration. More time was available to consider a one-line amendment than we were given to consider seven pages of amendments. If I had not taken that seriously, I am quite sure that I would have been attacked by Senator Stone. All I am asking in this place is that we consider the propositions on the basis on which they are put forward and not on the basis of personal prejudices. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I make a procedural suggestion? We are, as I think has been previously agreed, deferring further consideration of a major matter on this Bill-namely, the Opposition's amendments to clause 28, I think it is-until next week so that the Government may give further consideration to the amendments the Opposition has moved in that area. I think it is not unfair to say that the Minister for Finance has a somewhat obstreperous attitude towards the questions being asked of him by my colleague Senator Walters which are perfectly proper questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Without in any way questioning the fact that this proposal for tax deductability for gifts to the Australian-Ireland Fund is in the Bill because the Government has taken the decision to put it in the Bill and because the Treasurer put a submission to Cabinet to obtain that purpose, nevertheless the question that Senator Walters is putting is: why is it that this fund which signifies an association with Australia of a foreign country-I am not sure I should call Ireland a foreign country-has been chosen when in fact there is no other comparable provision in section 78 of the gifts deductability provisions in the Principal Act. I think that is a perfectly proper question on Senator Walters's part. I suggest that this is a procedural matter. Speaking on behalf of the Opposition, I suggest to the Minister, through you, Mr Chairman, that when we come back we accept this procedure rather than continue what at the moment seems to be a somewhat fruitless exchange of views across the chamber. We will accept the Minister's assurance that when he comes back next week to discuss the Opposition amendment he will at that time provide an explanation in response to Senator Walters's question. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator STONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that. So that the Minister may, in a cooler frame of mind, reflect upon the position he has just put to the chamber, I simply want to say that the present position is quite unacceptable. If the Government is to legislate-and, after all, that is what it is doing in this provision of the Bill-to provide that gifts to this particular fund, the Australian Ireland Fund, should be deductable for taxpayers who make those gifts, that is a matter of interest to many people. In terms of magnitude, however, it is negligible-I think the estimate is $50,000 per annum. Nevertheless, it is a matter involving cost to the revenue, a matter on which I would have expected Senator Walsh in particular to express a keen interest and to regard as a matter of public interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put it to the Minister that, as a matter of public interest, it is entirely appropriate that the Government of the day and the responsible Minister, the Treasurer, should provide an explanation. I do not expect Senator Walsh to be able to answer this question, and that is why I think it is appropriate to give him until next week, since we are coming back to the Bill. I do not necessarily expect the advisers in the box beside him to know the answer either because they may not be the right people from the right areas of the bureaucracy to know. They may not have been privy to the Treasurer's Cabinet submission. But there must have been a reason in the submission the Treasurer put to his Cabinet colleagues. He did not just put in a submission saying, `I propose that we render this fund tax deductable'. Unless things have changed very much from procedures that I seem to recall only a few years ago, he must have given some reasons to his own colleagues for proposing what is in a sense a raid-I do not want to overstate that word-on the revenue. Of course there must be a reason and it is appropriate that that reason be stated. </PARA>
<PARA> When we come back to debate this matter next week I trust that the Minister, having had time to reflect upon the matter a little more judiciously than his previous reactions might indicate, will provide that explanation. Having said that, I now say, on behalf of the Opposition, that we will be quite prepared to postpone further discussion on this point until we come back to the Bill as a whole in Committee next week. </PARA>

I use the opportunity afforded by changes to the schedule of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) before us to establish a linkage with the question that I wish to put to the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh). Given the complexity and difficulty that the Government had in drafting the amendment to the tax laws superannuation package to accommodate the interests of the Australian Democrats, will the Government lay those amendments on the table of the Senate this day so that the Senate can verify the accuracy, scope and effect on superannuants, or is it the intention of the Government to present the amendments immediately before the debate recommences at the committee stage next Tuesday?</PARA></TALK.START>

I merely draw attention to the provisions in this amending Bill which go very much to the matter of recycling. They remove sales tax from bottles and kegs which are used repeatedly for beverages. I draw attention to the advantages which have been obtained by South Australia, which has had a deposit on such containers for a long time. This has led to an increase in recycling and also to an enormous reduction in the amount of litter lying along roadsides. One only needs to drive across any of the borders of South Australia into other States to see the remarkable effectiveness of that deposit legislation. I do not know whether an extension of the same sort of reasoning has led the Government to remove the sales tax from those containers which are used repeatedly for the sale of liquor, but I certainly commend the Government for moving in that direction. I merely draw the parallel with the desirability of removing sales tax on paper which is manufactured from recycled pulp. The amount of recycled paper in Australia is relatively small. About 30 per cent is recycled, but it goes into cardboard; it is not recycled into paper. There would be considerable environmental and economic advantages in increasing the level of recycling. I commend this amendment to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendment may well have some merit-I reserve judgment on that-but the Government will not accept it because, apart from the intrinsic merit it may have, when something such as this comes up quickly, there are often definitional problems in sales tax legislation. In this case it would be a definition of what is recycled pulp. I do not know whether there are technical problems with that aspect. It is something that should not be hastily rushed into. Prima facie, the proposition seems to have some merit although I am not necessarily endorsing it. I think I can guarantee that the Government will consider it over the next 12 months.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for putting those interjections on the record, although I was distressed to hear him say what he just said. As I pointed out in my speech on the second reading, this nation, like most industrial nations, does not put a capital value on assets in situ. It does not put a value on trees in the forest. If the Minister does his usual economic analysis he will probably find that it is of greater economic value to chop down trees than to recycle them. I would enjoin the Minister to do a much more comprehensive analysis and to take into account the value of the trees in the forests. There are mechanisms which can be used to do that and which have been worked out quite well. His colleague the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) is already attempting to go down that road.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As regards Senator Stone's assertion that there has not been enough time to consider this amendment, it has been circulated for about one week. The advantages of getting more recycled paper back into paper have been very broadly canvassed in a number of public fora for some months. So there has been more than adequate opportunity to consider the advantages of such a proposal. I do not think there are definitional problems hidden in this amendment. The statement is quite clear. There should be no problems in that area which has been raised by the Minister. Raising that issue in this debate is a red herring. </PARA>

Clearly, the statement on asthma sprays is one with which I have already expressed disagreement in this chamber.

The National Health and Medical Research Council was quite correct to raise its concerns. There is no doubt that the ACF document could lead some children to believe that, in order to do their bit to protect the environment, they should avoid the use of their inhalers, the most common one being ventolin. If that were to occur, their medical conditions could worsen. It is worth noting that the ACF's publication has now been altered and that sentence deleted. The ACF is sending out a revised text which I think overcomes the problem. Obviously, it regrets any inconvenience that the original publication may have caused.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, I am sure the Prime Minister said nothing about suffering from bungled economic policies. If Senator Crichton-Browne included that as part of a quotation, it is wrong. I did see the transcript of what the Prime Minister said in Bendigo and I thought it was excellent advice. It is impeccable advice. It is the sort of advice that has been given down the ages by people of prudent mind. In so far as savings are concerned, Senator Crichton-Brown, with his profound interest in macro-economic policy, will of course be aware that the aggregate level of savings in Australia at present is the most important issue. Whether they be public savings or private savings is not of great relevance to the macro-economic problems. Nonetheless, I imagine there are insufficient incentives in some areas of the private sector for individuals to save. The Prime Minister has said that this matter is undoubtedly being discussed publicly not only in the community but also by economic commentators. It is a matter on which work is being done by people in the financial community, academics and governments. I can take the answer no further than that at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3781" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="RESOURCES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I read in the `The Nation' column of yesterday's Australian Financial Review that the Queensland Minister for Mines, Energy and Northern Development had said that I was wrong when I described the Queensland State tax on goldmining production or profit as a tax. He said that it is not a tax, it is a royalty, and that I do not understand the difference between a tax and a royalty. He has raised a fascinating matter and a fascinating insight into the minds of members of the National Party of Australia and indeed, into the minds of members of the Opposition. I recall that recently Senator Chaney made a speech to the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association in which he distinguished himself by saying something like, `The Opposition would remove secondary taxation in favour of the introduction of a royalty system'. It seems that if one asks the question, `When is a tax not a tax?', members of the Opposition will say, `When you call it a royalty'. Then they can pretend that they are not taxing anyone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In order to make the position clear, let me state the following facts: the Commonwealth proposes to extend ordinary company taxation to gold mining companies which have been exempt from company tax. It is proposing to do that in 1991. The Queensland Government imposes a royalty on gold mining activity in Queensland, as does every State and Territory in Australia, with the exception of Victoria and Western Australia, and that is in the form of a secondary tax. The Queensland tax taxes what is the highest return-a tax on production or a tax on the profit of the company. To describe it as not being a tax would be interesting to gold mining companies, because the effect when they write out their cheques to pay the State Treasury is the same as paying a tax.</PARA>
<PARA> In order to define this matter I have looked at a couple of elementary references. I have before me the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Dictionary of Modern Economics, in which it says under the heading `Royalty':</PARA>
<PARA>This is a tax paid to the UK Government-</PARA>
<PARA>the reference is the United Kingdom-</PARA>
<PARA>by organisations exploiting minerals as all mineral rights are vested in the Crown.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to refer to a royalty as being a tax in that sense. I have another reference here in the Handbook of Public Economics, Volume 1, which is edited by two people, one from Harvard University and one from the University of Pennsylvania. On the subject of taxes they say, after a description:</PARA>
<PARA>These taxes include severance taxes based on output or gross revenue, sometimes called royalties, net profit taxes, licence fees and property taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>The truth is that taxes come in all forms, but they all belong to the generic bracket `tax'. Whether we call it a royalty or not does not mean to say that it is not a tax. In the case of Queensland, I have to say that Mr Martin Tenni should go back to his basic economics text and try to not confuse Queenslanders that a royalty is not a tax-it is. The impact on the gold mining industry is that of a tax. If Mr Tenni is calling on the Commonwealth Government not to extend company tax to gold mining companies-something that all other companies in Australia have to pay-and he thinks that is an inhibition on exploration, he ought to do something about his own tax. I am not counselling him to do that, but if he objects to the level of taxation, he has it within his power to reduce it.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, one of my objections to what the Queensland Government does is that it does not open itself or its accounts to public scrutiny. We do not know how much it collects from Queensland gold mining companies. We wish that an open and transparent operation existed in Queensland, as it ought to exist in all democracies, so that people could see from whence the taxes are exacted and how much is exacted. If Queensland conformed to that basic norm, we would know what the industry does pay.</PARA>

There are very few students from the People's Republic of China (PRC) studying in Australia who are supported financially by the Chinese Government. I think there are something like 10,000 in total, but very few are supported financially by the Chinese Government. There has been no indication to date that the PRC Government has withdrawn financial assistance from those students that it has been supporting. However, the Government is sensitive to the problems faced by PRC students in Australia as a result of the events in Beijing. Should any students who were previously sponsored by the Chinese Government find themselves in financial difficulties, the Government will consider those students' positions sympathetically on a case by case basis.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen such reports. I have also seen an overwhelming number of reports indicating support for the Government's plans in this area. These reports come not only from a wide range of commentators, community groups and members of the community, but also from members of the Opposition and the Australian Democrats, and even, this week, one conveying in-principle support for legislation to cover this area from one of the executive officers of the Credit Reference Association of Australia Ltd, Mr Andrew Woods. The reports that are critical have been based on an overreaction-something of a kneejerk response-and on a lack of objective assessment of what the Government is basically doing here. It should also be stated that the reports are based also on a lack of real appreciation of both the community's and this Parliament's concern for privacy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of points arise from the reports. The first is the need for legislation. It is clear that not only has there been community concern over a period about the need for legislation in this area-instanced also by an editorial in the Melbourne Age this week which said basically things to that effect-but also a joint select committee of this Parliament, in its consideration of the Australia Card, made much of the point that this particular area is one that governments should address in the short term. As I said, even the organisation involved pivotally in this area, the Credit Reference Association of Australia, is on record, together with other leaders of industry, saying that the legislation is essential.</PARA>
<PARA> A second point that has been made is that the Government is being coerced into a rushed decision. As I said, the matter has been under consideration for quite some time by members of both sides of the Parliament. It has been considered basically because of the fact that the current system to protect individuals and their privacy as well as the whole system has not worked. A report from the New South Wales Privacy Committee in 1983 concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>The kinds of credit reporting problems encountered by consumers are serious and persistent. The protection offered by the Agreement is piecemeal and unreliable.</PARA>
<PARA>The agreement it refers to there is a self-regulatory agreement which was in place in New South Wales. The report went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>Most notably the Agreement has failed as an example of self-regulation. Whether through ignorance, conscious determination, or lack of awareness of the Agreement's importance, credit grantors in large numbers are failing to comply with its terms.</PARA>
<PARA>It is fair to say that there has been quite a degree of community and parliamentary discussion about the need for action.</PARA>
<PARA> The third point that needs to be addressed is that the Government is not concerned only with privacy matters. There are privacy concerns relating to this particular issue. There are 4,500 members with almost 24,000 access points to a whole range of private information. This must be of concern to the Government, particularly when there is potential and actual damage to individuals by inaccuracy or unauthorised use of information. The point also needs to be made that there are substantial practical problems with one of the major concerns that have been expressed-the stopping of positive reporting. The basic practical concern is that the submission which has been put to Government means that only a small closed user group of credit providers would be able to have access to any expanded information on data bases. Of course, that would give competitive advantage to that particular group and it would also mean a need to amend the Trade Practices Act to accommodate this particular proposal. Also, there are particular practical problems with bank indemnities.</PARA>

First of all, I point out to the honourable senator that the female participation rate, although the highest recorded in these recently released figures, has been growing very strongly since 1983. That growth is largely reflected in expansion in those areas of the economy where women are largely employed, particularly the service sector. This is confirmed by the fact that at a time of strong growth in female employment, the unemployment rate for males has fallen from 10.3 per cent in May 1983 to 7 per cent in May 1989. I think it is unlikely that women's participation in the work force is expanding at the expense of the male participation because of the growth in service sector employment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Teague has clarified that he is attributing the charges, allegations and assertions to Professor Osborne. Whether he has correctly attributed them to Professor Osborne, I would not know. Certainly, I reject, from my own knowledge, some of them. The plain fact is that this Government has put very much more funding in real terms into higher education. It is true that science funding in tertiary institutions has been rearranged in a way that will require institutions to make applications for grants instead of receiving a certain amount of money more or less automatically as they did before. I will take this as subject to confirmation but I believe, when the effects of the Government's April statement on science are taken into account, that tertiary institutions will in fact be receiving more for research than they were previously. I will refer the other matters to Mr Dawkins to see whether there are any more definitive responses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The last point I wish to make is that Professor Osborne has apparently made some critical observations about the Government; other academics and vice-chancellors do from time to time, as do many other people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the article. This raises a very important question for politicians and, indeed, journalists because it would appear, on the basis of anecdotal evidence, that assertions are made about what the properties of drugs for treatment of serious medical illness are. There is always a fine line between publicly espousing those views and privately lobbying them within the Government. I do not hold Senator Knowles at all responsible for the way in which she is reported. That would be wrong, and indeed the reporting in the article is highly coloured. It is headed `A Plea from the Heart'; it then reports, `Patients want drug embargo relaxed'; and it is then subheaded, `Ailing Perth patients are lobbying the Federal Government to free up supplies of a miracle drug that supposedly cures heart attack victims'. That is journalese of the worst sort and I think it sets up anxiety in people with serious medical illness about the possibility of a miracle cure which may or may not be true. I think therefore that one ought to be very cautious in making assertions about the properties of specific drugs.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Another use is as treatment for some heavy metal poisonings. The Department of Community Services and Health permits its importation for these purposes. For a number of years it has been promoted by various doctors and others as chelation therapy, which is claimed to reverse the formation of atheroma or fatty plaques in artery walls. But the problem is that in 1983 the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee considered the use of chelation therapy and recommended against it. This view was endorsed by the National Health and Medical Research Council and by the National Heart Foundation. I am advised, as well, that the United States Food and Drug Administration does not approve of this `useful' therapy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Department can approve EDTA for use in chelation therapy only if a sponsor submits data which establishes the substance's quality, safety and efficacy for this purpose; that is to say, there has to be proper trialling by scientific method to establish whether or not the properties that are alleged to exist are in fact scientifically proven to exist against the standards we require. It is up to the sponsors of those drugs to take that action. If they do not take that action for the proper trialling, I do not make a judgment as to whether that proves or disproves the matter, but I just note for the record that they do not take that action and it is for them to decide whether or not they should. Claims which imply that EDTA has been administered in Western Australia in recent years without adverse affects cannot be accepted by the Department.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Foreman had indicated that he was going to ask a similar question, which I think is probably covered by this answer as well. I was asked whether it is the view of the Government that the Chinese Army has consolidated behind Prime Minister Li Peng. I understand that although the Embassy is closely monitoring the situation, it is too early to confirm that unequivocally. It does appear that the military is in firm control of the city and that some public transport is operating again. But I am unable-which really means that the Australian Embassy is unable-to substantiate media reports that a process of rounding up alleged dissidents is under way in China. Therefore, the answer to Senator Chaney's second point, whether the Government has information which suggests a purge of students and so on is going on by the Army, is that we do not know or, if you like, we have no information. At this stage we cannot confirm that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been asked a question about it and I will give an answer. There has been some highly innovative research in the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation over the past few years, opening up the first real prospects of developing a flu vaccine. A team led by Dr Peter Colman has worked on the vaccine proposal. Not so long ago a small Australian company, Biota Holdings Ltd, was formed by scientists, investors and others who could see the potential benefits of that research. Yesterday's announcement, which was the one that appeared in the Australian Financial Review, was of a development agreement between Biota and the giant British pharmaceutical company Glaxo to further develop and test the compounds which have been produced by Biota. The deal between Glaxo and that firm should provide early payments totalling around $10m to Biota and mean that Glaxo will spend potentially up to $200m in funding all future research and development in bringing the product to market. Glaxo is strongly committed to Australia. Its previously announced proposals for a substantial increase in Australian production and exports led it to be the first pharmaceutical company to benefit from the Government's factor F arrangements under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Glaxo intends to undertake all feasible development steps in Australia including the ultimate manufacture of the flu vaccine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Both Glaxo and Biota have independently informed the Government that its policies, particularly the extension of the 150 per cent tax deduction for research and development and the factor F arrangements under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, have been a major factor in bringing about this very important and successful partnership. I look forward to the continuing success of this project which is an excellent example of how good scientific research can lead to commercial prospects in line with the Government's policies on science and technology.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Social Security has received a number of representations on this matter, including from the Member for Denison, Duncan Kerr, MP.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Social Security makes heavy use of computing facilities and continually monitors developments in available technology. In accordance with the Government's endeavours to promote efficiency improvement, a review is currently being undertaken of whether any changes should be made to its computing infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department advises that the review is being conducted in two parts. The first is an investigation of technical options for computer centres, including the costs of each option associated with sites, hardware, software, maintenance etc. The second will assess the likely impact of each option on staffing and service quality and the participation of staff associations has been sought.</PARA>
<PARA> While the existing facilities in Tasmania have been examined as part of the whole, the review is still in its early stages (the first part is not complete) and it would not be appropriate to prejudge the options to be canvassed or the outcome which will involve management and Government responses. Any formal consultation with State Governments would depend on the results of the review and on these responses.</PARA>
<PARA> It is relevant to note, however, that in relatively recent times a major national social security function-the International Operations Branch-was re-located to Tasmania and is working effectively.</PARA>
<PARA> As with many other major ADP users, particularly in Government, DSS has experienced a rapid turnover of computer staff. The Department advises that turnover within computer centres tends to be of staff at the lower levels who do not wish to continue shift-work, and many others are attributed to normal promotions or transfers within the public service. However, it does regard rapid turnover as a problem and is taking steps to address this.</PARA>
<PARA> Staffing within the centres has recently been restructured to accommodate the progression to an online environment which will help the Department provide a higher level of service to social security recipients. This also should help reduce turnover since more attractive career paths are being established.</PARA>

<PARA> The answer to the third part of the question is no. At the time Mr Hickman left the Minister's office, no deliverables under the design development contract or the request for tender had been provided to the Department of Defence. It might be noted that detailed tender documentation of this kind has not been provided to the Minister for Defence or his office. Public Service procedures require Commonwealth officers in sensitive positions to seek assent before taking up outside employment. These procedures do not have application to ministerial staff. However, in Mr Hickman's case the general principles applied to public servants appear to have been followed. An officer is required to declare his interest in outside employment as soon as the possibility of employment which could give rise to an actual or apparent conflict of interest arises.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hickman went on recreation leave on 28 September 1988, immediately after he informed the Minister of his decision to take up outside employment, and remained on leave until his resignation took effect on 14 October 1988. He has had no preferential access to the Minister's office or the Department since leaving the Minister's office. Ministerial staff, unlike Service officers and public servants working in the Department of Defence, do not participate in commercial activities such as design specification and tender evaluation which could give rise to a conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not have the precise terms of Senator Newman's question before me, but the answer to the fourth part of it is that there is nothing improper in what has occurred. The answer to the fifth part of her question is yes. The answer to the sixth part of her question is also yes. After careful review of procedures and practices here and overseas, revisions to procedures are being made for civilian and Service officers of the Australian Department of Defence. They do not draw heavily on the recent United States procedures referred to by Senator Newman because they have been shown to be less than fully effective in recruiting and retaining good quality staff and in preventing fraud. The answer to the seventh part of Senator Newman's question is that the revised procedures have recently been reviewed by the Auditor-General after extensive review within the Defence Department, and they will be promulgated shortly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following the statement I made on 30 May 1989 relating to the privacy of meetings in committee rooms, I have now received a report from the Parliamentary Information Systems Office and the Usher of the Black Rod. I am advised that it has not been possible to prove that the sound system in House of Representatives Committee Room 8 was used to obtain information from a meeting held in the room on 24 May. However, the investigation revealed that the sound system could have been used for that purpose. I am assured that the staff of both Hansard and the Parliamentary Audio Visual Unit, who operate and maintain the equipment, follow strict operational procedures. These include the requirement to shut down and isolate the committee room systems and to lock control room doors at the conclusion of meetings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst the investigation has been inconclusive so far as events surrounding the meeting on 24 May are concerned, it has resulted in a number of recommendations for significant improvements to the security of the sound system in the committee rooms. The proposals include provision for illuminated signs in each committee room indicating to occupants of the room the exact condition of the sound system at any time. In addition, physical safeguards will further ensure that unauthorised people are unable to tamper with the system. I have discussed the recommendations with Madam Speaker and it is our intention that the works necessary to ensure the privacy of proceedings in the committee rooms should be in place by the beginning of the Budget sittings.</PARA>
<PARA> On a related issue, Senator Reid on Wednesday 31 May raised the matter of the in-house television system broadcasting pictures of senators in the chamber who were not speaking at the time. I have been advised that the computer system which controls the cameras failed during the evening of Tuesday, 30 May, and could not be repaired until midday of the following day. During that period the cameras were operated manually. Manual operation of the seven cameras is much more cumbersome. The camera operator must first identify the senator who has the call, then train the appropriate camera on the senator. In the meantime, the pictures broadcast through the building were of senators who were not speaking. Following the matter having been raised by Senator Reid, I have instructed that in the event of similar system failures in the future, the picture going to air should be that of the general view of the whole chamber until the appropriate camera can be manually trained on the senator who has the call.</PARA>

Before I deal with it I thank you, Mr President-I am certain on behalf of all senators-as one of the Presiding Officers, for giving approval for the ceremony to take place. The ceremony was attended by almost every senator and a capacity audience of mourners for the disaster that has taken place in China.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government, due to the collapse of its economic policies, has placed an excessive reliance on huge and rising interest rates to control the economy. This has resulted in an unfair concentration of the burden of reduced living standards on small businesses and farmers, both of whom have had to put up with interest rate rises of up to 50 per cent over the last year or so, and Australian families trying to pay off their own homes, who have had an increase in repayments on average mortgages of about $56 a week this financial year, or about three times the size of next month's tax cuts for an average worker and double the promised wage rise. We have a looming disaster for those people. Only a particular group of people in Australia is being called on to carry the whole burden of this Government's economic policy, as the whole burden of this Government's policy is directed at interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Not all Australians are suffering anything like the same burden from this policy. It is a very selective, discriminatory and disastrous policy which is aimed at those very sections of the community which Australia needs for its economic recovery or the maintenance of family life. It is young families who are hardest hit by mortgage interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us examine what is really happening to mortgage interest rates. In June and July of last year mortgage interest rates were 13.5 per cent. They are now 17 per cent and it is expected that they will go to 18 per cent. Mortgage rate increases for small businesses are between 4 and 6 per cent and similar increases have taken place for higher overdrafts. That affects those people in Australia who are borrowers and who are endeavouring to do what they can to stimulate this economy and house their families. </PARA>
<PARA> What does the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) tell us about the future? Just as he told us before the Western Australian election that there would be no rise in interest rates-and they have since gone up 2 per cent-once again he is saying the same sort of reckless nonsense. This morning, on the AM program, Mr Hawke was questioned on interest rates and is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>I don't believe there's any need for them to go any higher. I think with the tightness of monetary policy and wages policy and budget policy, it ought to be enough to slow the economy down, and I hope it will. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Peter Thompson then asked Mr Andrew Gilkes, the financial markets economist with Westpac Banking Corporation:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, those people holding mortgages are most concerned, naturally, with the mortgage interest rate-now at a record 17 per cent. Is it going to go higher?</PARA>
<PARA>Andrew Gilkes replied:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, I think, to be realistic, all the pressures are still probably upwards on interest rates. The best we could hope for, I think, is interest rates don't go any higher over the next six months. I think there's very little chance they'll be coming down, but still the risk is that they may need to move higher. </PARA>
<PARA>Peter Thompson said:</PARA>
<PARA>So they are going to stay at least at 17, and may still go to 17.5 or 18?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Gilkes replied:</PARA>
<PARA>Looking at the economic evidence to date, I mean, that's the only realistic conclusion we could draw. </PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting that the only realistic conclusion that one can draw, if one is actually in this market and if one knows what is going on, is exactly the contrary to the conclusion asserted by this Prime Minister, who has misled this nation consistently about the direction of interest rates. It is exactly the opposite to what the Prime Minister has said, because the Prime Minister has established an unbeatable record of deliberately setting out to mislead this nation on the matter of interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Geoff Kitney, in his column in today's Australian Financial Review, says that the interest rate problem is causing real problems within the Government. He states:</PARA>
<PARA> Monetary policy tightening, intended to slow business investment and reduce consumption, has pushed home mortgage rates to record levels and is taking a savage toll on young home buyers. But it still appears not to have achieved the Government's objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is the central issue. Mr Kitney goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>But reliance on monetary policy is increasingly being seen as economically inadequate as well as politically damaging. </PARA>
<PARA>It is that damage-not simply political but also personal and economic-that we wish to deal with in this matter of public importance. The collapse of the Government's economic policy, which the Opposition warned of for years but specifically after the last Budget when we announced the extent to which we believed that the Budget was wrong-and we have been proved totally right-will be dealt with by Senator Stone when he speaks on this matter subsequently. Senator Hill will deal with the consequences for Australian families, the hardships they are facing as a result of this failed economic policy, and the Government's concentration on the cruellest possible approach rather than a fair and equitable approach. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to concentrate most heavily on housing, which is clearly the biggest area where interest rates impact directly on ordinary Australian families trying to pay off their homes. One of the most depressing things is that high interest rates, and the increases that have taken place so far this financial year, have helped to increase the Government's tax revenues. Perhaps this Government feels that it has a vested interest in increasing interest rates for those people trying to pay off their own homes. Trading bank loans, or assets directly affected by the huge interest rate rises, appear to total about $150 billion. Higher interest rates mean a rise in taxable earnings on those deposits that have flowed into the loans, totalling about $6 billion or so a year, of which about $2.4 billion would probably go in extra tax one way or another. On savings bank and other home lending, totalling about $60 billion, about $20 billion is at fixed interest rates, and $40 billion would be subject to the huge rises forced by this Government on home mortgages. This would mean about an extra $1.4 billion a year in interest being charged, of which something like $500m will go to the Hawke Government in extra income tax. The Hawke Government is ripping something like $500m a year out of home buyers' mortgage interest repayments because of the huge rise in interest rates. I hope that people who are having to pay these enormous rises are well aware of that. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of that, there are all the other non-bank financial intermediaries, who have about $100 billion of assets out there on which high interest rates are being paid. These may well not be capable of being added on to the amount I have outlined. Some of it may be loans between these various financial intermediaries. But the simple fact is that this Government has a vested interest in high interest rates because of the massive increase in taxation that takes place on those higher interest rates, paid for in particular by Australian families struggling to meet their mortgage payments. </PARA>
<PARA> However, to a large extent, Australian families have been protected from the full cruelty of this Government's high interest rate policy. They are being protected by the actions of the banks and building societies themselves, to the extent that those actions have frustrated the Government's economic policy. They have not passed on the immediate impact on people's pockets of this high interest rate. What the banks and building societies have done in many instances is simply to extend the term of the loan rather than to increase the monthly repayment amount. </PARA>

It is a reality that people must face as sooner or later they will be called on to pay this bill which is hidden from them by the banks and building societies at the moment. These people will end up with a huge future bill unless interest rates come down quickly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Rather than pick someone else's situation I would like to let the Senate know how this really affects people in this situation and I am one in this situation. I have no embarrassment at all about revealing the extent to which this Government's policies has affected me. When one talks about interest rate matters in the Senate one should be prepared to admit that one is affected by them. To that extent I have to disclose an interest. I am concerned for my own benefit about the huge interest rate rise. There are very few Australians who are not affected because they are trying to pay off their own home, trying to run a farm, trying to run a small business. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what it means to someone who borrows money. I borrowed $125,000 to buy a Canberra townhouse at the beginning of last year. My monthly repayments were $1,480, which covered the interest cost of $1,400-odd, and I have paid close to $1,000 off the principal of the loan. But last month the interest bill alone had risen as a direct result of this Government's determined and deliberate policies to $1,665 a month, which is $185 a month more than my repayments of $1,480. The bank had very kindly said to me, `Yes, we're increasing interest rates but don't worry you don't have to increase your monthly repayments'. This month the latest one per cent rise to 17 per cent will lift the interest bill alone to $1,765. Every month I will go further and further into debt so that after I have paid almost $18,000 a year in mortgage repayments I will owe an extra $3,400 on my Canberra house. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not feeling the pain of Hawke's high interest rates now but I certainly will in the future. That goes for most Australian home owners. One of the problems is that banks and building societies have not drawn that money out of the community and will let people like me suffer in the future rather than in the present. It means that monetary policy has not worked. It means that consumer demand has not been reduced and, to an extent, by being kind to its customers the banks and building societies have frustrated the Government's economic policies. In other words this Government has wanted the people of Australia to suffer a darn sight more than they have so far. This Government has wanted the banks and the building societies to take that extra money out. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt the Reserve Bank of Australia will bring pressure to bear on the banks and building societies, particularly after the $5 billion so-called tax cuts take place next month. No doubt the Reserve Bank will be suggesting to the banks and the building societies that they should increase the monthly repayments because otherwise this Government's monetary policy, the only economic policy it has going for it, is being effectively frustrated. That is why it is such nonsense for so many people who do not understand what is happening in this world to take their criticism to the banks and say that it is the fault of the banks that there are high interest rates and that all of these problems are taking place. The banks have no option but to increase interest rates. Apart from anything else, it is impossible for them to try to offer lower interest rates when they have to compete against this Government itself in the marketplace for money. If the Government is offering an interest rate of 17.4 per cent-which it is on treasury notes, I think, at the moment-how can the banks possibly expect to be able to borrow money at a much lower rate and still lend it out at anything less than 17 per cent?</PARA>

As I said, existing home owners largely are being protected by the actions of the banks and building societies but I expect that their own cash flow needs will force them sooner or later to increase these repayments. Then the people of Australia will suffer much more severely than they are now and will know who to blame-the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon we are debating a matter of public importance which has been raised by Senator Michael Baume and which claims disastrous impacts of interest rates on home buyers, small business and farmers. I would like to remind Senator Baume about a few facts in debating this proposition here this afternoon. Under the coalition Government six years ago 105,000 new dwellings were commenced in Australia. This year, under a Labor Government, a forecast 168,000 dwellings will be started. In terms of real bricks and mortar activity there will be a 60 per cent increase this financial year in the number of dwelling starts in Australia compared with the number when the Opposition was last in power in this country. In the past 12 months private investment in dwellings has grown by 20 per cent, but six years ago under the Liberals dwelling investment fell by a massive 22 per cent. The national income figures are on the record and Senator Baume should know about them. After all, in 1982-83, when only 105,000 dwellings were started and when there was a massive 22 per cent reduction in new dwelling investment in Australia, Senator Baume, who has brought on this matter of public importance this afternoon, was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer in the Liberal Government. He should know those figures as he had access to the data. This matter of public importance is exposed as an exercise in hypocrisy. The Liberals assume that the public has a short memory. That is the way they operate; that is the way conservative politicians in this country do business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The tenor of Senator Baume's matter of public importance was interest rates allegedly hitting small business. According to the economic textbooks one barometer of interest rate activity in the business sector surely is the level of investment activity. Let us look at investment reality and the figures for the gross domestic product to March this year. The facts about investment in Australia are in black and white for all to see. These are results never achieved by the Liberals in government. In the 12 months to March this year the gross domestic product figures which relate to new investment activity in plant and equipment show a whopping increase of 25.2 per cent. In one financial year investment in plant and equipment by the business sector of the Australian economy has grown by over one-quarter, and that is growth ahead of the increase in costs. It is a real growth of 25 per cent in one financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> In bringing on this matter of public importance this afternoon, is Senator Baume claiming that none of this investment is by small business? Is he suggesting that perhaps corporate investment is rising but investment by small business is falling? Of course, he cannot argue that proposition. The increase in new business activity in plant and equipment of 25 per cent this financial year surely must be occurring in small business just as it is in the corporate sector. Is Senator Baume also suggesting that the farming sector-he referred explicitly to farmers-is not boosting its investment activity? As I have pointed out, overall this financial year plant and equipment investment has increased by a massive 25 per cent and that must have been contributed to by a range of business sectors. The farming sector must be increasing its investment, just as the small business sector must be, to achieve an overall figure of 25 per cent growth in new plant and equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Liberals, `Eat your heart out'. When in government they never achieved growth in plant and equipment investment by over one-quarter in real terms in a single financial year. I simply compare that figure with the last year that the Liberals were in power, when new investment in plant and equipment in the economy slumped by 16.1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Baume has debated interest rates this afternoon. Of course they are high. The Government is concerned for the plight of borrowers. This week the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) campaigned in Ballarat and Bendigo and made it abundantly clear that he is concerned about the impact of high interest rates. But he has also said time and time again, just as the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has said, that interest rates will come down as soon as is economically possible. Interest rates are not an end in themselves. The Government does not want high interest rates for their own sake. The fiction that those opposite are trying to create in the community is that high interest rates are an end in themselves and that this Government wants high interest rates per se. There is a key reason for using interest rate policy-the economy is growing too fast. That is something Liberal Party members cannot come to terms with. When they were on the treasury bench they drove the economy into the ground, through the floor. Now they cannot come to terms with the fact that Australia's economy is growing faster than the Government wants it to grow. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make a contrast. When in government, the Liberals had high interest rates and an economic recession. Our problem is high interest rates and record economic growth. The economy is growing too fast. Total spending in the economy is outstripping local production. That is the heart of our problem. Gross national expenditure grew by 11.3 per cent in real terms to March this year compared with production of 5.4 per cent as measured by gross domestic product. Supplies have to come from elsewhere if local production cannot keep up with spending power. That is why there is a growth in imports, and hence the balance of payments deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of these pressures, this financial year the balance of payments on current account-the overseas deficit on our external transactions-might account for about 5 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product, or our total national income. We have to keep these balance of payments figures in perspective. It is a matter of record that only six years ago, in 1981-82, the Liberal Party in government recorded a balance of payments on current account deficit of $9 billion-$9,000m. That deficit was equivalent to 6 per cent of gross domestic product. That was the former Government's record. At the very worst, the Government's deficit for this financial year might get to 5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberals' figure of 6 per cent of gross domestic product contributed by the current account deficit in today's economic values, in today's dollar terms, would be $19.5 billion. It is impossible. Not one person on the other side of the chamber, not one of the Liberal Party economic spokespersons, in his wildest dreams has been able to come up with a figure of $19.5 billion for this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition senators have speculated about figures. We know that, for the first 10 months of the year, the figure was $14 billion. But it is mathematically impossible to go from $14 billion in the first 10 months of this financial year to the equivalent of their deficit in government of $19.5 billion by the end of this financial year. As I pointed out, the former Government's deficit was 6 per cent of gross domestic product; ours might get to 5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons we are resorting to interest rate policies is that the other arms of government economic policy are very tight. We have a tight incomes policy, despite rapid economic growth. We are planning to keep wage growth in the community down to 6 1/2 per cent next financial year-a remarkable figure, given the strong situation in the labour market whereby we would expect rapid growth in wages. Our fiscal policy-that is, the balance between government spending and taxing-is tight. I reiterate our record in reducing government spending as a proportion of our national income, our gross domestic product. In 1982-83, the last year of the Liberal Government, Commonwealth Government spending contributed 29 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product. As a result of continued stringent fiscal policy, in this financial year Commonwealth Government spending will be 25.6 per cent of gross domestic product. We have seen a massive reduction in the share of government outlays in gross domestic product-a good measure of the stringency of fiscal policy as practised by the Federal Government. A result of that is the Budget surplus of over $5,000m this year. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be the first to admit that monetary policy is an imperfect weapon. It is a blunt instrument. It takes a very long time to work. It has very long time lags. When we unscrew monetary policy it takes a long time for the pressures in the Australian economy to reduce. Despite the matter of public importance brought forward this afternoon by Senator Baume, I ask what the Liberals would do in place of our policies. What would they do to cut imports? Would they slash production? After all, they did that in 1981. Would they slash employment, as they did in 1981? Would they drive the Australian economy into the ground? They are well practised at that. They did it once, and we cannot afford to let them do it again. </PARA>
<PARA> We are getting our economic conditions right under this Labor Government. After all, the inflation rate and the level of increases in prices are the important determinants of interest rates in the community. Let us look at the record on inflation rates. When the Liberal Party was in power the annual rate of increase in prices in the Australian economy, as measured by the consumer price index, was at double digit levels. Senator Baume knows that. As I pointed out earlier this afternoon, in 1982 and 1983 Senator Baume had access to all the secret data. He was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer in the Liberal Government. He knows what the figures were. He probably knows that absolutely everything I am saying is correct. We had 11.5 per cent inflation under the Liberals. We do not have 10 per cent inflation now, we do not have 9 per cent inflation now, we certainly do not have 8 per cent inflation now, and we do not have 7 per cent inflation now. The inflation rate is below 7 per cent. We wound back the inflationary cost forces in the Australian economy from 11.5 per cent, when Senator Baume was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and when Senator Stone, one of the next speakers in this debate, was the head of Treasury, to below 7 per cent. They are the facts; that is the reality. That is the Liberal Party's record in government-double digit inflation matched by double digit unemployment. No wonder the people threw it out in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to put on the record some further figures relating to the level of housing in Australia to give the lie to the matter of public importance brought forward by Senator Baume this afternoon. I wish to nail it right down, to show which party in government places real priority on housing. I pointed out at the beginning of my speech that in the last year the Liberals were in power 105,000 new dwellings were commenced. That is a fact. That figure comes not from this Government but from the Indicative Planning Council, an independent body which monitors the housing sector. Last year under this Labor Government many more houses than that were started, and we are looking at a figure of 168,000 for dwellings commenced in the current financial year. This is a 60 per cent rise over the record of the Liberals. Even with interest rates impacting on housing demand, of course, the figures will rise. I would be the first to admit that. But the Indicative Planning Council forecasts new dwelling commencements in the Australian community next financial year in the range of 140,000 to 144,000. These figures are one-third higher than the figure for what the Liberals did in their last year of government when they created 105,000 new residential dwellings. Next financial year, at the very worst this Government will be creating 140,000 new dwellings. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have no more Liberal Party fictions and distortions about which party is the best for housing in the Australian community. The reality is that the average number of new housing starts each year under this Labor Government is 140,000. That is the reality. It is on the public record. During the life of the previous Liberal Government the average figure for new housing starts was below 130,000. Here is one simple statistic: in an average year under this Hawke Labor Government, 10,000 more new dwellings are being started in the Australian community-real bricks and mortar are being used in the Australian economy-than was the case under the previous Liberal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> But the Commonwealth Government does not leave it there. We are taking real action in the housing sector. For example, as a result of the housing summit held on 3 March, we are focusing on some of the key supply problems in getting affordable housing to Australian people. The Commonwealth Government is making its surplus land available for new residential allotments. The best way to fix land prices for urban development in Australia is to work on the supply side, and that is what we are doing. We have announced that over the next five years we will release surplus Commonwealth land equivalent to 27,000 new housing allotments. I am delighted to note that just two days ago the Government announced that the first 8,000 allotments will be going onto the market in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth to reduce supply constraints on the price of new residential allotments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stone has made another of his irrelevancies about the economy in Australia. Let us look at this Government's policy on public housing-housing for low income and needy families. In the last five years under Labor, public housing funds have increased by 20 per cent in real terms. But in five years of Liberal Government, public housing funds were cut, not increased, by 34 per cent in real terms. Under the Liberal Government, 165,000 families were housed in public housing in five years. But under Labor 215,000 families have been housed in public housing in five years. That is a very stark comparison.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are entitled to ask: What exactly is the Liberal Party's housing policy? What would it do if, by some remote chance, it occupied the treasury bench in the House of Representatives? It has to announce its policies. It has to put up or shut up. Earlier this year, the previous housing spokesman for the Liberals, Mr Downer, really gave the game away in the Weekend Australian. When asked a number of categorical questions about Liberal Party policy on housing, he would not give a guarantee that a Liberal government would maintain total public housing allocations through the Federal Budget. Nor would he guarantee that Commonwealth public housing allocations, through State housing commissions, would be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> When in government the Liberals showed themselves to be economically, politically and ideologically incapable of providing sufficient housing for Australians. Despite the present economic difficulties, over 160,000 new dwellings are forecast for this year under Labor-a figure that the Liberals in government could never match. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the following matter of public importance put forward by the coalition Opposition:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The disastrous impact of the Government's high interest rate policy on homebuyers, small businesses and farmers. </PARA>
<PARA>There can be no doubt that high interest rates are crippling Australian home buyers, small businesses and farmers. One issue is: why has the Hawke Government botched the economy to the point at which the only arm of economic policy it is prepared to use is high interest rates? The other issue is: On what basis does the Opposition, consisting of the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia, claim to be able to solve this problem? If we examine what has caused the high interest rates, we discover that both the Hawke Government and the Liberal-National coalition are in fundamental agreement on the economic policies which have created high interest rates for home buyers, small businesses and farmers. Both have supported deregulation of the financial markets, which has given ultimate control of the Australian economy to international investors, banks and financiers. Interest rates are high because some Australians are borrowing too much overseas. As a result, we now have a net debt of over $103 billion. To service this debt we must export more, sell off more Australian assets to foreign investors, borrow more, or import less. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the option of exporting more. Although our primary producers are amongst the most efficient in the world, their produce is locked out of many markets because of the subsidisation policy of the European Community and the United States of America. Who among us can forget Vice-President Dan Quayle? Our allies prevent us from benefiting from the competitive advance of our rural producers. Our manufacturing industries have not yet shown a marked tendency to export more, despite the fact that wage costs in Australia are becoming relatively low by world standards, as Senator Maguire said, and the value of the Australian dollar has fallen since 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the option of selling off more assets to overseas investors. The increase in foreign investment in Australia has been welcomed by both the Hawke Government and the Liberal Party. With a lower currency, Australian farms, property and industry have become cheap by world standards. We are in danger of losing control of Australian industry and the economy. Yet the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal-National party coalition voted in this chamber against an Australian Democrat proposal to establish a register of foreign ownership, so that at least we would know what Australian assets were foreign owned. In debates on that matter, I have listed assets in Western Australia which have been sold to overseas interests. They include prawning operations, hotels, tourist developments and rural properties. The Australian Democrats believe that selling off Australian assets is not a viable long term policy, but that is what the Hawke Government is doing and the coalition would sell off more. They are converting our foreign debt problem into a foreign ownership problem. Future generations of Australians will be paying more in rent and dividends to the foreign owners of Australian assets. On the radio this morning I heard someone asking, `What will we do once we have sold off all the back paddocks?'. All that will be left will be the farmhouse itself. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the option of borrowing more from overseas lenders. While most Australians know that we need to export more and import less, few Australians realise the extent to which our balance of payments problem is caused by the interest payments we must meet on past borrowings. In 1988 Australia had to pay $9.7 billion in interest on its $121 billion gross foreign debt. Writing in the Australian Financial Review of 19 May, Michael Stutchbury comments on this problem. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>The economy is now trapped by a vicious cycle of debt accumulation. As the foreign debt has ballooned, the interest bill has become a driving force behind the worsening current account deficit-which then adds to the foreign debt, and in turn, to the debt-servicing bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The bigger the debt, the bigger the risk to lend to Australia and the higher interest rates must be in order to attract foreign borrowings. So we suffer high interest rates because someone has borrowed a lot of money overseas. Who is responsible for this debt? Is it those Australians who are struggling to buy their own homes and trying to meet their mortgage interest repayments? The private sector is responsible for--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Stone" NAMEID="LJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator Stone</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the Government's policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IH4">Senator JENKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes; nonetheless, the private sector is responsible for well over half of the foreign borrowings. At the end of last year, Australia's six largest corporate borrowers, Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, News Corporation Ltd, the Bond Corporation, Bell Resources, Industrial Equity Ltd, and the Elders group, owed $26 billion, or over 23 per cent of our gross foreign debt. So these mates of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party get to borrow money overseas at low interest rates. They also get a tax deduction on their foreign borrowings which costs revenue billions of dollars, yet Australians, who did not borrow overseas, are expected to carry the burden of repaying that debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We face the highest interest rates in the developed economies of the world. I will give the Senate some examples. The home interest rate in the United States is 13.75 per cent and, in some cases, 10 per cent for 30 years. In Great Britain it is 13.5 per cent; France, 5 per cent to 12 per cent; Italy 13 per cent to 24 per cent; Switzerland, 6.5 per cent; Canada, 14.9 per cent; West Germany, one per cent to 7 per cent; the Netherlands, 8.5 per cent; and Ireland, 9.5 per cent. Those percentages were quoted in the Sun-Herald on 4 June 1989. If the Government denied the tax deduction to companies which borrow overseas, we would reduce our foreign debt and increase government revenue immediately. According to a Sydney Morning Herald article last year, the Qintex Group, Adelaide Steamship Co. Ltd, Equitcorp Australia Ltd and the Bond Corporation all paid less than one per cent of their pre-tax profit as tax in 1988. Yet last year the Government cut the company tax rate from 49 per cent to 39 per cent at a cost to revenue of almost $2 billion. The Hawke Government and the Liberal-National coalition combined yet again to vote for this measure in this chamber and the Australian Democrats opposed it. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the topic of importing less. The Government and the Opposition argue that we are importing too much. Yet they will not consider the direct method of reducing imports. We could restrict imports through the use of quotas. We could increase taxes on selected luxury imports in order to reduce the import Bill. But the Government has chosen to reduce imports by raising interest rates to the point where many people have no money to spend on anything, including imports. I guess that is part and parcel of the whole idea. However, what is happening-and the messages coming through confirm this-is that because people do not want to lose their family home they are giving up spending on many of the basic essentials of life. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that families are going without food-this is happening in Western Australia, the Australian Capital Territory and, I am told, elsewhere-in order to make their mortgage repayments. This is a callous policy of squeezing home buyers, farmers and small businesses into bankruptcy so that Australia will import less. The Opposition would presumably continue this policy and/or impose new taxes such as a consumption tax to place new burdens on ordinary Australians so that the country would import less. </PARA>
<PARA> But the Opposition would ignore the real solution which would be to restrict imports and to take away the incentive for the biggest Australian companies to borrow overseas. In March this year, the Australian Democrats introduced into the Senate two Bills to encourage domestic savings, reduce interest rates to home buyers and provide a tax deduction on the interest payments of Australians who are living in the house they are buying. Both of the Bills were defeated by the combined vote of the Labor Party, the Liberal Party and the National Party. So Australian home buyers should note the attitude of the Government and of the Opposition in relation to giving tax assistance to people who live in the homes they are buying as opposed to giving tax assistance to property investors and foreign borrowers. Such are their priorities. Negative gearing applies if one is buying a house as an investment proposition, but there is no relief at all if one is buying a house to live in it. Yet, if we can believe the Sun-Herald of Sunday, 4 June, the Opposition has discovered the issue and Mr Peacock has said it will no doubt become an election issue. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>Opposition leader Andrew Peacock made it clear last night he would use housing as the key weapon in his attempt to topple the Hawke Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Not to ease the load on home buyers, but to `topple the Hawke Government'. The quote continues:</PARA>
<PARA>In his first major speech since taking over the leadership from John Howard, Mr Peacock said a coalition Government would restore home ownership as an achievable and affordable right for every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA>That sounds great, but if that is the case why can we not learn what those policies are right now? If they are policies which will help ordinary Australian home buyers to make those mortgage interest repayments and not be turned out of their own homes, then I can assure the Opposition that the Democrats will support such proposals. Home buyers are still being threatened with even higher interest rates. We see no sympathy at all-or very little sympathy-from the Australian banks. </PARA>
<PARA> We see no sympathy at all from National Australia Bank boss, Nobby Clark, who, as reported in the Perth Sunday Times on 28 May 1989, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . If the mortgage belt doesn't want to be the ball, they can get out of the game-that is the option they have. </PARA>
<PARA>When talking about bankers, Mr Clark said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Of course we're bastards, didn't you know?</PARA>
<PARA>Further on he said:</PARA>
<PARA> You can be a good guy or a bad guy but the pain is the same. My view is simply, for God's sake get it out of the way. Put interest rates up as high as they have to go to stop all the bloody demand. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a lot of sympathy there! After all, the mortgage interest rates in New Zealand reached 23 per cent before the economy was sufficiently restrained. Farmers and small businesses are also suffering high interest rates, with threats of further increase. Some rural producers, who are regarded as high risk, are paying interest rates of 25 per cent. Small businesses are paying around 20 per cent. Of course, many small business people are paying these high interest rates on their businesses as well as paying high home mortgage interest rates. As we know, at the moment home buyers, for the most part, are paying around 17 per cent. Yet Australia's biggest corporations borrow overseas for less than 10 per cent and get a tax deduction on top of that. Until we have a government that is prepared to address this problem, the interests of farmers, small business and home buyers will continue to be sacrificed to the interest of Australia's biggest companies, the banks, foreign investors and international financing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon we are debating a matter of public importance which has been put forward by my colleague Senator Michael Baume and which relates to the disastrous impact of the Government's high interest rate policy on home buyers, small businesses and farmers. Senator Baume, in his earlier remarks, has indicated in some detail what has happened to interest rates as a result of the Government's policies and the disastrous impact that that in turn has had on home buyers, in particular, on which he concentrated. I do not propose to say anything further on that matter, in the interests of economy. I am saving my words for some other areas on which the same disastrous impact has been applied, in particular small businesses and farmers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us be quite clear as to where the responsibility for the present level of interest rates lies. Some members of the Australian Labor Party want to blame the banks for this unfortunate state of affairs. Senator Jenkins appeared to go a little in the same direction in her remarks, although I thought she was a little ambivalent. In any case, sticking with the Government's view of these matters, what we are seeing at present is the usual desperate search for scapegoats. The Government is in deep trouble and wants to find somebody to blame-anybody but the Labor Party. From time to time the banks are trotted out as the scapegoats. From time to time the multinational corporations are trotted out as the scapegoats. Even some of our own major corporate borrowers have been trotted out from time to time although the Labor Party has to be a little careful there because the association of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) with most of the major leading figures concerned is well known and on the record. Name it-there is a scapegoat somewhere. But honourable senators can bet their lives that it is not the Labor Party! It happens to have been governing this country only for the last 6 1/2 years! In truth, it is the fault of none of those scapegoats; it is the fault of the Hawke-Keating Labor Government-that Government, and it alone. </PARA>
<PARA> Many points were made about borrowings being made by business corporations. Of course borrowings are made overseas by business corporations. They have to be because, under the policies of this Government, we have a deficit on the current account of our balance of payments-that is, we are importing more than we can afford. That has to be financed under the policies of this Government. If those corporations were not borrowing, somebody else would have to. In the end, if no private individual corporations borrowed, the Government would have to, or it would have to change its policies. Of course, that is what it should do; it should change its policies so as to remove the need for these borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday the Prime Minister, who has not yet reached the point of crying on television about this subject, although no doubt that too will happen in due course, was in Ballarat. An article in this morning's Australian Financial Review by Geoff Kitney has some interesting comments about that. Apparently Mr Hawke yesterday lunched with a struggling home-buying family in Ballarat. Imagine the pitiful scene of the Prime Minister lunching with a struggling home-buying family in Ballarat. That would be a sight to be seen. Mr Kitney was not very impressed by this piece of drama on the Prime Minister's part, because he begins his article, entitled `Hawke's ``hold on and hope'' strategy', by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>The Hawke Government is adrift. It is unsure what is happening to the Australian economy and uncertain how to respond to the economic and political challenges ahead. </PARA>
<PARA>We can say that in spades. Mr Kitney goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> The sense of drift was apparent in comments by the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, yesterday after he had lunched-</PARA>
<PARA>no doubt it was gruel-</PARA>
<PARA>with a struggling home-buying family in Ballarat. `I explained to them, and I think they understand, that we've just got to hold on for while until we get this level of activity down,' Mr Hawke said. `I just hope that we're going to see that before too long.'</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kitney went on to say that the Prime Minister's comments encapsulated the sense of frustration and doubt that has gripped the Government. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> The perception of the Government wringing its hands and hoping something will turn up is growing. There is mounting concern within the federal bureaucracy that this is indeed the reality. </PARA>
<PARA>Some senior bureaucrats believe the Government is dying. The only comment I would have about that perception on the part of the senior bureaucrats concerned is that I think the Government died at least two years ago. That is why there has been this increasing smell over the state of our economy-there are some dead governments around. Mr Kitney continued:</PARA>
<PARA> There is certainly an overwhelming case for the Government to be seen to be responding to the economic problems more decisively than indicated by Mr Hawke's comments yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA>Later on he said:</PARA>
<PARA> It cannot afford to be seen to be as paralysed by indecision and uncertainty. It must respond to these perceptions and show it still has a clear sense of purpose and direction. </PARA>
<PARA>Another one of Mr Hawke's more choice remarks yesterday was reported as follows by Mr Kitney:</PARA>
<PARA> `I'm not going to dodge the hard but right decisions for some perceived temporary political popularity,' Mr Hawke said yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA>I seem to have heard words of that kind before. I remember the Prime Minister addressing the nation on television on 11 June 1986 when he was trying to put down the unfortunate effects of the banana republic comments of the Treasurer (Mr Keating). On that occasion he finished his speech with a statement which I think-I have not had the time to compare it-was almost word for word with his speech yesterday. Three years later we are still getting the same literally tired rhetoric from our Prime Minister, so much so that the Australian newspaper this morning, which I do not think has been unfriendly to the Government, was moved to head its leading article with `Why does Bob feel so good about himself?'. It begins its comment upon yesterday's events by quoting from an interview which Mr Hawke gave to Mr Paul Kelly, the senior political correspondent of the Australian, and which was published in the Australian yesterday. Mr Hawke is quoted in that interview, and again in this leading article this morning, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> `We've been so successful in getting so much of macro-economic policy right,' the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, said in an interview with Paul Kelly in the Australian yesterday, `getting growth, getting jobs, getting restructuring . . .'</PARA>
<PARA>Then the writer of the leading article goes on to ask, not unnaturally, why, if everything is so right, Australia has `record foreign debt, record domestic interest rates and a continuing balance of payments near-crisis despite favourable terms of trade? If things are so good, why do they feel so bad?'. The leader writer drew the conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hawke is, in fact, displaying extraordinary and worrying complacency about the state of the nation. Self-congratulation seems to be his opiate and he is on the brink of sedating himself into total inertia. </PARA>
<PARA>He says finally:</PARA>
<PARA>Difficult times demand strong leaders not smug ones who have put their feet up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The leading article in this morning's Australian newspaper. Is there any hope for this Government? Is there any hope for Australia under this Government? In particular, is there any hope of lower interest rates under the present Government's policies? The answer to that question is: only if and when there occurs the recession to which the Government's policies are otherwise inevitably leading us. This is because for the past 12 months the Government has stuck stubbornly to the line that everything has been okay; nothing is wrong; all we need is another turn of the interest rate screw. The result has been that what began as an unbalanced set of policies is now a totally unbalanced set of policies: the Government's spending has not been cut; wages and salaries are set to rise by 7 1/2 or 8 per cent in the financial year just ahead of us; and there is not a particle of micro-economic reform, notwithstanding all the promises in the last week or so about reform at some time on the waterfront or in coastal shipping-none of which will do more than manage to keep us within sight of the rest of the world, which is disappearing over the horizon, beating us into the ground.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The effect of high interest rates on small businesses and farmers has been catastrophic. We are all very much aware, because it is a matter of much more popular comment, that housing loan rates have risen by 3 1/2 percentage points in the last 12 months-from 13 1/2 to 17 per cent. However, interest rates being paid by small businesses have risen by 7 or 7 1/2 percentage points during that time. Whether one looks at overdraft rates or bank bill rates, one finds that that has been roughly the magnitude of the rise-7 percentage points. Can one imagine the effect of that kind of increase in the cost of financing a small business-that includes farmers, who quintessentially are small businessmen for the most part-on its operations? Just imagine what that is now doing for the lifeblood of those businesses and farms. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the outlook? What hope can realistically be held out at present under the Government's policies? The latest issue of the Commonwealth Bank's economic newsletter was released to the media yesterday. That newsletter is written by the economics department of a major bank, a government-owned bank, and it is known for the sobriety and responsibility of its comments. It is not given to scare articles or anything of that kind. What has the Commonwealth Banking Corporation had to say through its own official channels? Among other things, it states:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia will be walking an economic tightrope in 1989/90. On one side is the risk that demand pressures will fail to ease sufficiently in the short-run to stabilize the current account deficit, eventually triggering a currency crisis that would guarantee a hard landing for the economy. On the other is the risk of interest rate `overkill'-the possibility that the further rise in interest rates over recent months will eventually tip the economy into recession. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to talk about the precarious outlook for the economy and about the policy response over the past 12 months. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The policy response has primarily centred on a painstakingly gradual tightening of monetary policy, the first moves in this direction having commenced well over 12 months ago. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The progressive rise in interest rates has to date had little impact on economic activity. </PARA>
<PARA>The newsletter then mentions the increasing urgency of the task on which the Government has embarked in this lame way. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The sharp rise in Australia's foreign debt over the past year has increased the urgency of the adjustment task . . . Policy is therefore likely to be tightened further, if unambiguous-</PARA>
<PARA>the Treasurer used that word at the Premiers Conference only a month ago-</PARA>
<PARA>signs of a slowing in domestic demand do not appear soon . . . At the very least, there will be no scope for any easing of policy for at least the balance of 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>A little further on the newsletter sets down the Commonwealth Banking Corporation's forecasts-the forecasts of its economic department-for this financial year, which is almost completed now of course, and for the next financial year, 1989-90. It is fascinating to see that, first of all, it forecasts a balance of payments current account deficit this year of $17.2 billion. The bank forecasts a deficit of $17.5 billion for next year also. There is no relief at all there. Some of the other figures are even more fascinating. It forecasts a rise in the consumer price index this year of 7.3 per cent. That should not come as any surprise, although it is higher than the 1987-88 figure, notwithstanding the Treasurer's promise to bring it down by 2 1/2 percentage points. For 1989-90 the bank forecasts another rise of 7.2 per cent. There are a number of other forecasts, including one for employment growth of 0.9 per cent. We all know that the Australian work force is growing much faster than that, so that is a forecast of developing unemployment in 1989-90. Indeed, the bank itself says:</PARA>
<PARA>For calendar year 1990-</PARA>
<PARA>which is six months further on still-</PARA>
<PARA>growth-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, growth in the domestic product-</PARA>
<PARA>is expected to be under 1% (the equivalent of a `growth-recession'). </PARA>
<PARA>A growth recession is one in which production is still rising somewhat, but not fast enough to absorb the increase in the work force. We have an economy which is out of control and which the Government is totally at a loss to know how to handle. It has locked itself into a high interest rate policy. It has no other response and the consequence is that we are heading into a recessionary phase which the Government is totally at a loss to know how to counteract. The effect of this on small businesses and farmers will be disastrous, and the effect on mortgagors has already been demonstrated at some length by my colleague Senator Michael Baume. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stone, as is usual, has given a very lucid account of his position and has asked: Is there any hope for this Government? At least that question can be asked about this Government. If the Opposition were in government, the country would have absolutely no hope. The terms of the matter of public importance are as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The disastrous impact of the Government's high interest rate policy on homebuyers, small businesses and farmers. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not say that the present interest rate has no effect on people-of course it has. Of course it is hurting people and of course it is hard for people buying homes. Of course it is hard for people borrowing money to have to pay the high interest rates that are presently operating. But that situation is this Government's answer to the needs of the economy at the moment. It has taken a responsible attitude. It has taken a line which, in spite of being electorally disadvantageous, is part of its overall policy of bringing this country, this economy, and its people into a happier time-certainly happier than that under the previous Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate for the country that today the Opposition has repeated its usual tactic in this chamber. Opposition members are mighty in rhetoric but very meek in action. Their rhetoric has pointed out all the hardships people are suffering and all the difficulties the country faces, but they never give an answer. This debate is a bit like the debate we had earlier in the week on the reform of the waterfront industries. Senator Chaney, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, said there was a drastic need for reform in areas such as the waterfront, coastal shipping and the operations of government enterprises. He said things were disastrous. He said there were scandals, but he never got around to giving us an answer. In a vague way, he said, `Well, we'll adopt what the Inter-State Commission says'. Reading his speech is like reading some sort of article which says, `See schedule 1 in some other document'. </PARA>
<PARA> We will never find the answer in the speeches from those opposite. All Opposition members do is point out the difficulty the country is in. That is not to be denied. Of course, it is in difficulty. What the Opposition should be doing in this chamber is giving answers. </PARA>
<PARA> What would the Opposition do? Would it fix interest rates if it came to power? Would it fix interest rates at 5 per cent, 10 per cent, 12.5 per cent or 13.5 per cent? Would it put quotas on imports? If so, at what level and on which imports would it put quotas? Would it fix exchange rates? Would it abolish the fringe benefits tax? Would it abolish the capital gains tax? Would it increase unemployment as a way out of the present difficulty? Would it lower social security benefits? Would it go to the wall with the unions? Would it lower wages? Would it introduce essential services legislation? Would it gaol people who would not work for low wages? What exactly would the Opposition do? We could have some great debates in this chamber if specific items were put up for debate. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A general statement of policies, plus some specific terms of those policies as to how they would operate. Unfortunately, we never get them, which makes it very difficult. It is always easy to condemn, to point out defects and say things are not going as well as they should be. It is a lot more helpful if specific proposals can be put which perhaps could be adopted by the Government or, at least, put to the people of Australia so that they would know what the situation is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to read an interview reported in the Australian Financial Review on Monday, 29 May 1989, with Dr Hewson, who is the shadow Treasurer. It is interesting to see the sorts of things he said about interest rates, for example. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>As a lot of what has happened on interest rates has been to bolster the confidence of foreigners in this country, then their attitudes would shift as well. You have the capacity for reasonably early reductions in interest rates as a result of that confidence. </PARA>
<PARA> We are debating a matter of public importance brought on today condemning the Government on interest rates, and what did the shadow Treasurer say on Monday, 29 May 1989? He did not say that he would reduce interest rates tomorrow, or next week. He said that, if things are put in place in a particular way, then there would be the capacity for a reasonably early reduction in interest rates as a result of increased confidence. The point I make is that, if Dr Hewson became Treasurer tomorrow, he would pursue the same policy on interest rates as this Government is pursuing now. That is what he said in that interview. He would hope, as this Government hopes, that there would be a reasonably early reduction in interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> When the members of the Opposition condemn this Government, as they are attempting to do in this debate, for the rates at which interest is charged in Australia at the moment, why do they not say, as their proposed Treasurer did in his interview on 29 May, that if they came to government they would maintain interest rates at the level they now are until a reasonably early time, they would hope, in the future? Dr Hewson goes on in the next paragraph to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I don't want to pretend, however, that there are any instantaneous solutions because there aren't. </PARA>
<PARA>In that interview on Monday, 29 May, reported in the Financial Review Dr Hewson, the shadow Treasurer, said that there are no instantaneous solutions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How can there be after six years of the policies of your Government, for goodness sake? One hundred and three billion dollars of debt. How can that possibly be instantaneously solved?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stone asked the reasonable question: What have we done in six years? Why are we in this position after six years, going on for seven, of this Government? The point is that had the Opposition been in government during that period, things would be absolutely disastrous. There would not have been wage restraints; there would not have been employment growth; there would not have been a reduction in the number of industrial disputes; there would not have been a reduction in unit labour costs of 9.2 per cent; there would not have been 1.3 million new jobs created; and there would not have been a growth rate twice that of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries and four times that achieved by the Liberals when they were in government. Neither would there have been a 60 per cent reduction in industrial disputes. Had the Liberal Party been in power over the last six years none of those things would have happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is absolutely undeniable that we are still in difficulties. There is a need for drastic solutions and that is what we aim for with the increased interest rates. But the interest rate increase is not necessarily as vicious and as draconian as it might otherwise have been had a Liberal-National Party government been in office for the last six years. Over the last six years this Government has reached a situation where at least there is light at the end of the tunnel. Had the situation been different there would have been no light at the end of the tunnel; in fact, the tunnel probably would have been blocked completely. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me go back to the article by Dr Hewson, his analysis of the economy and his solutions. He has said that, if the coalition came into Government:</PARA>
<PARA> A lot of things would happen simultaneously. It would be a co-ordinated group of ministers working. You'd have John Moore in a privatisation area . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I take it from that that the Opposition would privatise everything very quickly; in fact, it might even privatise the Senate and we would be paid-and this is what worries me-according to how we perform. That is something that honourable senators on both sides of the chamber would want to avoid, so we really have to be careful as to how far we take privatisation. What we could do is put advertisements on the backs of our seats so that when the cameras zoomed in on us people could see whatever we were advertising. Senator Hill could have on the back of his seat, `Senator Hill's hit men'--</PARA>

<PARA>Fred Chaney on the industrial relations side who'd move reasonably quickly with compliance and other legislation, giving people the option of either staying in the system or going out, and Andrew Peacock who has worked in all these areas. </PARA>
<PARA>Andrew Peacock, who was an outstanding shadow Treasurer, a man who is very learned in this area of economics, said, `If workers are to stay in the system, the arbitration rules should be changed so that the Industrial Relations Commission would be required to take account of productivity and the impact of international competitiveness'. Therefore, workers, wages, and people would have to give way to the rigours of international competition. It would not matter what they required to live a reasonable life; that would be irrelevant. Workers would be given $10 a week, if it was necessary, to enable companies to stay internationally competitive. The next part of Dr Hewson's statement is what really surprised me. Over the years, we have put the accord forward as the basis for the way we have acted. Again and again, the Opposition has said, `You've got to abandon the accord; the unions are irresponsible; it's a disastrous program; the unions have brought us to this pass'. This is what Dr Hewson had to say about this:</PARA>
<PARA>It's a different world, that's true, but that is not necessarily going to cause a wage explosion or an increase in interest rates, and I expect that the union movement would give us the same sort of break or their attitude will be as conciliatory as the business community was to Labor when they came in. </PARA>
<PARA> You won't have the unions going out the door on Day 1 and pulling a national strike. It is a different union movement today, they know their role, they know their limitations, they have learned from 1981 so you are dealing with a reasonably mature situation. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the sort of thing that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, would agree with. According to Dr Hewson, the trade union movement, in its mature way, has been the basis for what has occurred and will be the basis for the way Australia goes ahead in the future. In other words, what the Opposition is saying when it comes down to it is that if it gets into power it will adopt the very policies that we are putting forward now. It is not able to state alternative policies because it really has not got any--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a matter of public importance brought to it today by Senator Michael Baume in these terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The disastrous impact of the Government's high interest rate policy on home buyers, small businesses and farmers. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we are debating the disastrous impact of the Government's high interest rate policy and deliberate policy on three sectors of our community, that is, home buyers, small business people and farmers. I repeat the terms of that matter of public importance because, having just listened to Senator Cooney, one could have wondered whether that was the subject of the debate. Senator Cooney is always fun to listen to. He always makes a contribution which is amusing. But, unfortunately, in no way did he seek to wrestle with the matter that was before the Senate. The matter before the Senate is the Government's record, which is angering the Australian community, and very reasonably so, as we will demonstrate. </PARA>
<PARA> One would have thought that Senator Maguire, who spoke a little earlier, with his economic background, might have tried to address the issue. But, unfortunately, he resorted to his standard economic history lesson rather than try to address the Government's very dramatic failure in this area which is so critically affecting the Australian community. One might wonder how it has come about that honourable senators on the other side are unable to wrestle with the matter. It seems that a government in office too long loses touch with its grassroots. When one listened to Senator Maguire one could not help but think that what he said would not mean a thing to Australians listening to this debate who are paying 17 per cent on their housing interest bill and struggling or, alternatively, small businesses which are paying 22 or 23 per cent on their overdraft rates. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or farmers like the ones that I have on the west coast of South Australia, who had four years of drought and were paying not only an overdraft rate of 22 per cent but also, because they were all in default-not having had an income for four years-were having to pay a couple of extra per cent on top of it. They are not actually paying it at all because they have not got any money. It simply gets added to the bill so that when their property is ultimately sold from under them someone gets something out of it. These are the Australians who are being affected by this Government's deliberate policies. It is astonishing that this Government does not seem to understand that reality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When one looks at what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has said in the last day it becomes so dramatically illustrated. It was mentioned in earlier debate here today. It was certainly mentioned in Question Time when reference was made to the Prime Minister speaking in Bendigo, He said that the Australian community should use its yet to be received tax cuts to offset the burden of record interest rates, spend some and then save the rest. He said, `From your tax cuts you will be able to offset the Government's record interest rates. You will have some money left to spend and after that you will be able to make some savings'. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Crichton-Browne put to the Senate some figures on this particular matter in Question Time today. He pointed out that a single income earner supporting two children, earning $35,000 a year and paying off a mortgage of $40,000-that sounds to be a reasonably typical Australian; perhaps that person is earning a little more than a typical Australian-will receive a tax cut of $25.65. The increase in that family's mortgage will be $25.15. That family will have 50c from which the Prime Minister says, `Spend some and then save the rest'. As Senator Panizza will say if they go out and invest their 50c they will be paying 40 per cent of what they get in income in income tax. It is absolutely farcical. It shows a government out of touch with the Australian community and a Prime Minister out of touch. One can only presume that this has come about simply because the Government has been in office too long, spent too much time in the ivory tower and does not appreciate the consequences of its policies upon the average Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> What is so incredible in this whole exercise is that the policy to deliberately push up interest rates is a deliberate government policy. It has been adopted in an effort, we are told, to slow growth within the community. But that is not a growth that has been caused by the small consumers and the ordinary home owner who has to pay off a mortgage. It is a different cause altogether. That is why we have said before, and we repeat it, that this instrument of economic policy being used by the Government to remedy its own economic deficiencies is a blunt policy instrument which has been heartlessly wielded to hurt a mass of innocent Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Reid and I saw this in Canberra last week when we attended a meeting of one of the many consumer action groups which are springing up around Australia at the moment to protest against this Government's policy and attitude over interest rates. There were about 1,500 Canberra residents there. Most of them paid high interest. It was interest that they had agreed with their bank to pay in the range of about 13 1/2 per cent 12 months ago. They are now paying 17 per cent; but they cannot pay it. They cannot meet the difference. They did not expect the difference probably because they relied on the promises of this Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators that when the Western Australian election came around Prime Minister Hawke said, `Interest rates will come down'. That is probably technically true but he did not say when they were going to come down or that they would go up many percentage points in the meantime. They have not come down as he promised. In fact they have gone up and are continuing to go up. The average Australians whom we saw out in the suburbs of Canberra last week are struggling as a result of them. What was the reaction of the Australian home owners in Canberra? When speaking of this Government they chanted, `Out, out'. They are sick and tired of the fact that this Government does not appreciate that the deliberate policy it has adopted is forcing them out of their homes. They are unable to meet the payments upon the homes which are so critical to them and to the maintenance and sustainability of their families. </PARA>
<PARA> The nonsense goes on. We have had the Prime Minister, I gather in the last 24 hours, saying that he sees no need for interest rates to go higher. How many times have we heard that from him? Again in this chamber we have Senator Button saying something similar. My colleague Senator Reid asked why a Government member or a Government Minister would not turn up at that protest meeting in Canberra and face the 1,500 angry home owners and try to explain this deliberate high interest rate policy of the Government? Of course, the answer did not come. Senator Button, the Leader of the Government in this chamber, simply said that he could see no reason why a Labor member should attend and listen to those concerned. Mr Acting Deputy President, I would have thought that you would have attended. Surely you have some sensitivity towards people who are struggling and who are facing the prospect of being thrown out of their homes. But that is not the formal attitude of this Government; it says it is better to avoid facing up to that responsibility, to remain deaf, to close one's eyes rather than face the consequences of the Government's deliberate policy. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been drawn to my attention that the rally which took place in Canberra is now moving on to Tasmania. One person has had recorded in the Tasmanian press her personal position:</PARA>
<PARA>Single mother of two Cheryl Nebauer, of Hagley, works two jobs to repay her 17 per cent home loan. If it hits 18 per cent, as the banks are touting, she will be forced to sell her home. </PARA>
<PARA>She said:</PARA>
<PARA>I can't handle 17 per cent, let alone 18 per cent. It's heartbreaking to have put five years of my life into it and watch it go . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of person this arrogant Government ought to listen to. As the writer of the article said:</PARA>
<PARA>Cheryl is just one of hundreds of thousands of Australians now faced with selling personal possessions or foregoing life's necessities in order to meet home loan interest repayments. </PARA>
<PARA>What were her circumstances? She took out her loan at 14 per cent on the strength of a Hawke Government promise that home loan interest rates would not be increased. Yet they have been deliberately forced up by this Government. About 50 per cent of mortgages in Australia were taken out after April 1986, the time of deregulation. Rates are now up to 17 per cent and Australians cannot pay the difference. What will be the cost of this policy to Australian families?</PARA>
<PARA> If one reads the reports of the Australian Institute of Family Studies, the advice of the Economic Planning Advisory Council or the report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission on homeless kids, the message is the same: financial hardship will eventually break up families. Families will not be able to withstand ultimately the financial stress. It is not surprising that we see such a respected member of the community as the Bishop of Tasmania, the Right Reverend Phillip Newell, giving us the sort of reminder that this Government should be listening to. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Financial pressures were a major cause of marital breakdown in today's society, and as much as possible should be done to protect families from such pressures. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not the approach of this Government. In order to try to solve an economic problem it has made, it has adopted one lone blunt instrument of economic policy-driving up interest rates. In doing so it is affecting those who presumably it did not intend to affect-or perhaps it did; I do not know. </PARA>

We in the Opposition recognise that this country is in an economic mess. We recognise that drastic action is necessary. I am pleased that Senator Cooney said that we recognised that. With balance of payment figures this year showing about an $18 billion deficit and with the country over $100 billion in debt, we recognise that something has to be done. We also recognise that the Australian Democrats' answer of some sort of artificial cap is not going to be a satisfactory answer and will not provide a long-term solution. It will only provide another distortion and a prejudice against those who still have to rent. If interest rate deduction is allowed, how will we meet our responsibility to the 160,000 Australians who are on public housing waiting lists at the moment? That is a deplorable figure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The economy has to be got back in order. It has to become efficient again and become competitive. Incentives must be given to get it back in order. There must be proper restraint on public expenditure and reform to the barriers such as the transport industry and the waterfront.
