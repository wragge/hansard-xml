<TITLE>Company Tax Collection System</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's Budget decision to change the company tax collection system will be a crippling blow to many small businesses, already suffering as a direct result of the Hawke Labor Government's high interest rate policy.</PARA>
<PARA> The earlier remittance of company tax payments to the Government will substantially reduce the cash-flow position of thousands of small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA> Many small businesses will be driven under as a result of the Government's decision-unable to find funds for both tax commitments and new stock, only able to borrow at record high interest rates and unable to claim any tax relief on such borrowings to meet their tax commitment.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's proposed changes to the company tax collection system has only been introduced as a greedy grab for more tax revenue.</PARA>
<PARA> The small business community would prefer the Government to completely abandon the proposal rather than make only minor alterations to the original Budget decision, which are not likely to alleviate the situation to any significant extent.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Crimes (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Bill 1989 represents a further stage in this Government's strategy to deal effectively with the illicit trade in drugs. All honourable senators would have been repulsed by the images of renewed violence and mayhem emanating from the cities of Colombia over the past two months. All senators would agree with the messages of world-wide support that have been directed to the Colombian Government in their bid to rid their country of this insidious cancer which threatens the very existence of the oldest democracy in Latin America. However, such moral support is inadequate to deal with the international menace of drug trafficking. What is required is effective, coordinated international action. It is for this reason that the Government has over the past seven years placed the highest priority on providing and securing international co-operation in the fight against the illicit trade in drugs and organised crime which is dependent on it. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past seven years the Government has modernised Australia's extradition laws and negotiated and secured 28 modern extradition treaties. In this period, Australia has led the rest of the world in the development of modern arrangements for mutual assistance in criminal matters, thereby securing treaty backed obligations to assist in criminal investigations, prosecutions, the pursuit of the international criminal money trail and the confiscation of criminally obtained assets. Further, in the international arena Australian model extradition and mutual assistance treaties form the basis of model treaties being prepared by the United Nations Crime Prevention Committee for adoption by the 8th UN Crime Congress next year. </PARA>
<PARA> On the domestic legal front the Government's Cash Transaction Reports Act 1987 and the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 comprise one of the most comprehensive legislative packages for following the money trail in the world. Australia's achievements have been recognised in the international community, most recently by our inclusion in the Financial Act Task Force established by the Group of Seven major economic nations to advise on the prevention of money laundering. As the International Enforcement Law Reporter stated in its September edition `Australia's participation'-in the taskforce-`is significant because it has taken a leadership role in international criminal co-operation'. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of our commitment to international law enforcement co-operation we have played a prominent role in the development of the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. This new Convention embodies further measures for law enforcement and co-operation between international states. The Convention was concluded following calls from Latin American States through the 1984 Quito Declaration against Traffic in Narcotic Drugs; the 1985 Lima Declaration, and from Bolivia at the 36th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, for an effective international campaign against traffic in drugs. Some 79 States have signed the Convention, indicating the strong support in the international community for its intent and content. I am advised that, like ourselves, most signatory parties are proceeding to ratification of the Convention through their own constitutional procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation represents the first step in the process of Australia's ratification of the Convention. Ratification will achieve one of the aims of the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse, which has the support of all governments in Australia. The States have been aware of the proposed Convention and of the Commonwealth's wish to become a party to it from the beginning of the drafting process in 1985, and their views were sought at each stage of the negotiation process. I wish to emphasise, however, that this Convention reinforces only one strand in the international drug strategy, which, as the international community recognises, requires a multidisciplinary approach. The Declaration of the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking in Vienna in June 1987 designated four areas for future action:</PARA>
<PARA> prevention and reduction of demand;</PARA>
<PARA> control of supply-including programs for rural development involving crop eradication and substitution;</PARA>
<PARA> suppression of illicit trafficking; and</PARA>
<PARA> treatment and rehabilitation. </PARA>
<PARA>Although the Convention is, of course, directed at the illicit drug trade, it also touches upon these other important aspects of the problem of drug abuse. This too is consistent with the approach adopted in the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse. This Campaign also takes a multidisciplinary approach with a strong emphasis on education and prevention directed at vulnerable groups, and treatment and rehabilitation of regular users. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a degree of misunderstanding about the effect which ratification of the Convention will have on drugs policy. The Convention primarily addresses the question of trafficking in illicit drugs. It includes provisions relating to extradition, mutual assistance, confiscation of assets, following the money trail and questions of jurisdiction. It expressly provides that parties to the Convention will ensure that drug trafficking offences attract the strong criminal sanctions they deserve but distinguishes between possession of drugs for the purpose of trafficking and for personal use. It is in respect of the latter category that the Convention has been seriously misrepresented. Contrary to some views which have been expressed, the Convention does not preclude the re-examination of policy in relation to personal use of prohibited drugs. It is open to Governments, should they so decide, within the context of this Convention, to provide that possession which would otherwise be an offence will not be subject to criminal penalties where the possession is clearly for personal use only. Thus, the Convention specifically states that parties may, as an alternative to conviction or punishment in such cases, provide measures for the treatment, education, aftercare, rehabilitation or social reintegration of the offender. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, section 17a of the Crimes Act 1914, which provides that imprisonment should be imposed as a last resort, will apply to offences created under this Bill. As a result, when the courts are considering sentences to be imposed on persons convicted of offences in relation to cultivation or production for personal use, they will be required to give preference to alternative forms of sentences which could lawfully be imposed. Such alternatives could include programs of rehabilitation, treatment and education and the court would need to be satisfied that none of these options is appropriate before they impose a sentence of imprisonment. Thus, sentencing options already available in the case of Commonwealth offenders enable us to take full advantage of the alternatives to sentencing proposed in Article 3 of the Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the obligations created under the Convention which fall within areas of Commonwealth legislative responsibility are already covered by Commonwealth legislation such as the Customs Act 1901, the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987, the Extradition Act 1988 and the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987. Other obligations fall within areas of State responsibility, and consultations are under way with the States on action to be taken by them to ensure their laws are in accord with the terms of the Convention. The Commonwealth has been very much aware of the importance of not encroaching on areas of State jurisdiction in this field and fully supports the continuation of the co-operative approach to drug law enforcement with the State and Territory Governments and their law enforcement agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal area requiring legislation in the Commonwealth sphere relates to the need to create extra-territorial jurisdiction under article 4 of the Convention. The purpose of the jurisdictional changes envisaged by article 4 is to ensure that drug traffickers cannot escape justice by moving from one jurisdiction to another, for example, to a jurisdiction which for a valid reason is not prepared to surrender the person to the country the laws of which were infringed. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now outline the ways in which this Bill will extend Australia's extra-territorial jurisdiction. The first extension relates to Australian nationals who have engaged in conduct outside existing Australian jurisdiction which would constitute an article 3 offence if it had occurred in Australia and where extradition of such persons from Australia is not sought or, if sought, is not granted for reasons outside the scope of section 45 of the Extradition Act 1988. The Bill also establishes a second area of jurisdiction where a person who is not an Australian national has engaged in drug-related conduct outside Australia which constitutes an offence against the law of the country where it occurred and also against the law in force in an Australian State or Territory and the person is subsequently present in Australia; but Australia declines to extradite that person. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the Bill creates jurisdiction over persons who are outside Australia and engage in conduct with the view to the commission of a drug-related offence in Australia-for example, knowingly growing a crop for subsequent marketing in Australia. The Bill also creates offences arising out of drug-related conduct on Australian aircraft and provides for the exercise of Commonwealth jurisdiction on Australian ships in certain circumstances. Another provision creates a Federal offence which has the effect of applying, outside Australia, State and Territory offences of conspiring or attempting, aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the carrying out of drug-related conduct which is an offence against the law of a State or Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>I do not anticipate that the proposals put forward in this Bill will have a significant impact on Government expenditure in the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is the first step in the process of ratification of this most important United Nations Convention. Further action will be required by the States before ratification can take place. The Convention seeks to achieve concerted international action against those who, for their own gain and at great cost to the community, engage in illicit trafficking in drugs. The co-operative multidisciplinary approach of the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse recognises the need to address the problems of addiction with compassion and to offer treatment and rehabilitation to those suffering under all forms of drug addiction. In no way can it be argued that ratification will prevent a reasoned and complete debate on the merits of the present national approach to drug abuse. The Government welcomes such a debate but remains committed, along with our State and Territory counterparts, to the type of tough and thorough measures prescribed by the Convention in respect of illicit drug trafficking. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>On 28 February 1989 the Senate resolved to set up a joint select committee, to be known as the Joint Select Committee on Tenure of Appointees to Commonwealth Tribunals, to inquire into a number of matters related to the tenure of appointees to Commonwealth tribunals. On 1 March the House of Representatives agreed to the Senate's resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's inquiry dealt with a number of matters: the general nature and significance of tenure currently provided to appointees to Commonwealth tribunals; the adequacy of sections 24 and 28 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 in so far as it affected the tenure of presidential members and commissioners of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission; and, finally, a number of matters raised by the non-re-appointment of former Justice Staples to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, a matter which has been discussed at some length in this place and with which honourable senators are no doubt familiar. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to its advertisements and direct invitations to organisations and individuals believed to have an interest in this matter, the Committee received 33 submissions and numerous brief letters. The submissions are tabled with the report, along with the transcripts of the Committee's two public hearings. The Committee wishes to thank all those people who have assisted it in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> In the report, the Committee has reached a series of conclusions and made a number of recommendations. Those conclusions and recommendations are clearly set out in the front of the report. However, in the time available to me, I would like to highlight some of those conclusions and recommendations. The Committee concluded that, in order to perform their functions, tribunals need to be able to attract and have appointed to them people of superior talents and integrity. They also need to be able to ensure that appointees will not be influenced in their decision making by outside or irrelevant considerations. In particular, they should not be influenced by the government of the day or any alternative government. In order to give effect to these aims, the nature of the tenure provided to appointees must ensure the following: an adequate term of office; removal before expiration of term only for cause specified in the relevant legislation; adequate removal procedures; proper processes to establish grounds for removal; protection from pressure from Ministers, members of parliament and senior officials; a reasonable opportunity to perform their work, so long as they are able to do so; and appropriate salaries and conditions of service. For their part, members of tribunals should remain independent from party-political activity and should observe the same standards of decorum and behaviour that judges have traditionally followed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has concluded that the Parliament should not support a constitutional amendment to limit its power to abolish tribunals. However, the Committee has recommended that the following principles be borne in mind when the Parliament is considering the abolition of a tribunal, and I emphasise that we are talking about quasi-judicial tribunals: the abolition of a tribunal should not be used as a method of removing the holder of a quasi-judicial office; legislation to change the structure and jurisdiction of a tribunal should, if possible, refrain from abolishing the tribunal; when a tribunal is abolished and restructured, all existing members should be reappointed to its replacement; and, when a tribunal is abolished and not replaced, compensation should be paid to members of the tribunal who have lost their places and for whom no alternative positions can be found. The Committee has recommended that further consideration be given to embodying these principles in an Act of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was required to consider whether sections 24 and 28 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 provided proper and adequate tenure for presidential members and commissioners of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The Committee concluded that, subject to the recommendations that I have just outlined in relation to the abolition of tribunals, the provisions did provide proper and adequate tenure to those appointees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considered the difficult question of whether there was a right to perform work attached to the appointment to a particular office. The Committee recognised that the head of a tribunal should have the power to allocate work to tribunal members, but has indicated its belief that this power should not be exercised in such a way as to effect the de facto suspension of a tribunal member. The Committee concluded that when a tribunal member is deprived of work, he or she is entitled to receive reasons for this occurring from the president of the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> If the member does not accept the reasons the member should, in the first place, attempt to resolve the dispute with the tribunal president. If this does not work, the member should pursue whatever other legal avenues are available. The Committee concluded that there was no need for the establishment of a new body to deal with complaints against tribunal members, nor was it necessary for such a body to mediate between tribunal members and presiding officers. </PARA>
<PARA> In chapter 8 of the report the Committee deals with various issues raised by the case of former Justice Staples. I should mention that the Committee refers to the individual concerned as `former Justice Staples' on the basis that he was formerly a Justice of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The Committee does not wish to prejudge the current status of the individual, which the Committee understands to be a matter of some contention. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was unable to reach any conclusions on the relationship which developed between former Justice Staples, on the one hand, and Sir John Moore and Justice Maddern respectively, on the other-Sir John Moore being a former President and Justice Maddern the current President of the Industrial Relations Commission. While the Committee received a detailed submission from, and heard former Justice Staples at length in its public hearing, the Committee received no assistance from Sir John Moore or Justice Maddern on the difficult question of the relationship which developed between them and former Justice Staples. The Committee regretted this. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee concluded that it should not inquire further into the reasons why former Justice Staples was removed from active work, as to do so would have required a full-scale inquiry into the Staples case. This was clearly beyond the Committee's terms of reference. However, in the light of the Committee's recommendations contained in chapter 5 of the report, which addressed the question of what should happen when a tribunal is abolished, the Committee recommended that the Government should establish an inquiry to determine the issue of compensation to former Justice Staples, in view of his non-reappointment to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I need to raise one further matter in relation to this report. On 21 November 1989 the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives forwarded to the Committee a letter which each had received from former Justice Staples. The letter referred to three statements contained in an early draft of the Committee's report. Former Justice Staples complained to the Presiding Officers about the statements, alleging that they were untrue and seeking some redress in relation to them. Unfortunately, the key parts of these letters appeared in several newspapers on 21 November. These letters were available to the Committee at a scheduled meeting on the afternoon of 21 November. At that stage of its consideration of the draft report the Committee had not reached the sections of the report to which Staples had referred, but objection had already been raised to the accuracy of some of these statements, which were based on a written submission which had been received by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering these sections in the ordinary course of its consideration of the report, the Committee decided to delete them for reasons which had already been raised. Accordingly, the Committee was not influenced in its deliberations by the letter from former Justice Staples. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was concerned that the contents of some parts of a report had, without the authorisation of the Committee, become available to former Justice Staples, and that he had made use of the material by directing it to the Presiding Officers. The Committee was also concerned that some of the material contained in former Justice Staples's letters was obtained and published by newspapers. The Committee gave consideration to whether it should report these matters as a possible breach of privilege but has decided that, in the light of all the circumstances, it should not take the matter any further. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee would like to thank the staff of the Committee for their assistance, particularly Stephen Argument, who was brought to the task of Acting Secretary of the Committee at a late stage and did an excellent job in difficult circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall tell Senator Crichton-Browne why in a moment. I was in substantial agreement with the majority report, particularly with those chapters dealing with the general question of the tenure of appointees to Commonwealth tribunals. Indeed, I, and I presume Dr Klugman, support many of the findings of the chapter dealing specifically with Mr Justice Staples. Four of these paragraphs are of particular interest, and I would like to read them into the record. Paragraph 8.29 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>On the evidence before the Committee, former Justice Staples was at all times prepared to carry out the duties of his office but was prevented from doing so by decisions of the President of the day. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 8.32 states:</PARA>
<PARA>No evidence has been given to the Committee that former Justice Staples was guilty of any misbehaviour or suffered any incapacity which would have justified his dismissal. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 8.34 reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>In the light of the foregoing, the Committee is unable to reach any conclusion on the relationship which developed between former Justice Staples, on the one hand, and Sir John Moore and Justice Maddern, respectively, on the other. In failing to reach a conclusion on this question, the Committee regrets that it received no assistance on this matter from Sir John Moore or Justice Maddern. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, paragraph 8.36 states:</PARA>
<PARA>In view of the foregoing and following the Committee's recommendations in paragraph 5.27, the Committee recommends that the Government should establish an inquiry to determine the issue of compensation for former Justice Staples in view of his non re-appointment to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>In view of the finding of the Committee in an earlier chapter it was clearly a logical extension that there should be an inquiry to determine the issue of compensation for Mr Justice Staples. I think Senator Durack has already mentioned that section but, for the record, the Committee found as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>When a tribunal is abolished and not replaced, compensation should be paid to the members of the tribunal who have lost their positions and for whom no alternative position can be found. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is only five paragraphs. The less interference I have, the quicker I can get it done. Dr Klugman and I have said the following in our dissent:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>We the undersigned wish to dissent, as follows: There is no evidence that the then Mr Justice Staples made `no serious attempt . . . to resolve the problem'</PARA>
<PARA>After the appointment of Mr Justice Maddern it seems that there was no attempt to discuss the matter apart from the letter written in August 1986 by former Justice Staples to Justice Maddern. Reverting to our dissent, we stated:</PARA>
<PARA>He has in fact given evidence to the contrary and this has not been denied. In fact we-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Dr Klugman and I-</PARA>
<PARA>consider it very surprising that in reply to a request, Mr Justice Maddern emphasised the point, with the help of statutory declarations by his staff, that he made no attempt to contact Staples to discuss any problems. </PARA>
<PARA> We emphasise that a member of a tribunal who is deprived of work is entitled to receive reasons from the President of the tribunal for such a decision. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot accept the proposition that a tribunal member who can only be removed by the method and for the reasons outlined in section 72 of the Constitution can de facto be suspended arbitrarily by the senior tribunal member. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Justice Maddern dismissed Mr Justice Staples de facto without giving reasons. Neither the Government nor the Parliament would be able to do so. Such behaviour allows a President to act capriciously or to protect what has been alleged to be `The Industrial Relations Club'. </PARA>
<PARA>I felt that the majority report-I do not speak for Dr Klugman here-implies that Mr Justice Staples somehow collaborated in his own downfall. The dissent that I signed with Dr Klugman seeks to establish that he was primarily a victim. The original motion regarding Mr Justice Staples was put before the Senate in February 1989 by Senator Janine Haines. I supported the substance of her motion. However, an amended motion put forward by Senator Robert Hill for the Liberal Party of Australia omitted, and indeed evaded, any mention of the subject of Senator Haines's motion. It was accepted by the two major parties in the Senate and was therefore passed. This clear bipartisanship of interest between the two major political parties led to a deflection from the real subject, namely, Mr Justice Staples's effective dismissal from the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, and put the focus on the more general issue of appointees to Commonwealth tribunals, which is undoubtedly a subject deserving of inquiry by a joint select committee but nonetheless not what was really at issue in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee found that it could not avoid the real and immediate issue that was put before the Senate in Senator Haines's original motion. I hope that the Government will move quickly to effect the recommendation of the Committee for an inquiry into the matter of compensation for Mr Justice Staples. Unfortunately, the work at the end of the Committee was complicated by the extended absence of the Chairman of the Committee. I merely wish to support Senator Durack's comments about the cooperation of the staff and thank them for their efforts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the general thrust of the report of the Joint Select Committee on Tenure of Appointees to Commonwealth Tribunals, in particular the very important work that was done to establish the ground rules for the future in the way that tribunals should be run in terms of their independence from government. I believe that the ground rules are of value to all members of tribunals and to chairmen of tribunals and will be a guide to the conduct and the way they treat each other and relate to each other in the future, as well as the way in which they relate to government and to the interest groups in the community at large with whom they deal. That is of immense value, I believe, because for the first time at least it sets down ground rules that everyone will understand and upon which their actions and thoughts can be based in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I have dissented from the report in some very important areas. The first is in relation to what I call performance reviews of independent tribunals. It seems to me that without political interference it is very much the responsibility of the chairmen of tribunals to make sure that each person working on a tribunal performs-in other words, that they are not lazy or incapable. I am not referring to misdemeanours or misbehaviour; I am referring to people who, for example, do not perform according to the way that the community or the chairmen of tribunals believe that they should. </PARA>
<PARA> I have talked about the need for some form of review to be introduced into the process, that review to be subject to appeal by the peer groups within that particular area. I stress the point that at no stage should a government become involved in that process. That is simply accepting the reality that with the vast number of independent tribunals that are operating in this country, it is inevitable that some of those tribunal members will not be performing, and therefore should be subject to some sort of performance review conducted by their peer groups or the chairmen of the tribunals. </PARA>
<PARA> More importantly, I wish to raise the matter of why I am dissenting from the major thrust of the report, which I believe was tacked on at the end of it. That is the recommendation that there should be a further inquiry into the question of compensation for former Justice Staples. My views are based on four major reasons. The first is that the Senate specifically did not require the Committee to investigate the question of Mr Justice Staples and compensation for him. The Australian Democrats moved a motion in the Senate in which they tried to set the terms of reference, in which the case of former Justice Staples was to be examined in detail. That was specifically rejected by the Senate by 57 votes to eight votes. Another motion was accepted which then set the terms of reference. Those terms of reference were formulated to look at the general question of how tribunals should operate, how we can protect their independence and a number of other issues. It was not to be a Staples inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee examined the case of former Justice Staples, and we devoted a chapter in the report to it. My dissent is based upon the fact that this Committee recommends that we should have yet another inquiry. I believe that the Staples saga should be closed now. If former Justice Staples wishes to follow it through, I have indicated that he has redress through the civil courts. I believe that at some stage throughout this long saga he should have taken that opportunity; but he has not done so. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that the Senate, the House of Representatives or any committee which is established by this Parliament has the role or the function of setting itself up as judge and jury to decide on the relationships that have existed over the last six years or more between former Justice Staples and Presidents Maddern and Moore of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. As a parliament we are not in the position to act as a branch of the judiciary. We do not have proper rules for evidentiary operations and the protection of the rights of individuals who come before any committees of the Senate. I do not believe that we should be paying out public money in the way we did with one Privileges Committee operation, when $160,000 was spent on legal fees alone, to act, in a sense, as a judge and jury. There is a right and proper place for people to seek redress for personal injustice; that place is in the courts of law of this country, which are established with all the rules of evidence to protect the rights of all individuals involved. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Senate or any committee of the joint Houses decides to be judge and jury on an issue, we are really coming to the end of the line or the end of the doctrine of the separation of powers. We are then saying that the Senate ought to take over the role of the judiciary. There is a function for this House of Parliament in relation to, say, the judiciary and that is on the question of misbehaviour of judges. It is only right and proper that, at the end of the day, when a judge or a member of a judicial commission of some sort has misbehaved, his or her case should be judged here. But that is at the end of the day and is specifically provided for under the Constitution. However, on no other occasion do I believe that the Senate should act as a judge and jury in such cases. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also indicated within my dissenting report that Mr Justice Staples has been adequately compensated. According to my calculations, under the judges compensation legislation he is presently entitled to an annual salary of $58,708. That is 60 per cent of the amount he would have earned if he had remained a judge. It is equal to the appropriate pension that other judges receive. This amount will rise to $74,566 by the end of this year, subject to the Parliament's acceptance of the Remuneration Tribunal's recommendations. In addition, Mr Justice Staples is entitled to significant long service leave payments. </PARA>
<PARA> As we in this Parliament all know, we even brought in a deeming clause to deem former Justice Staples to be 60 years of age so that he could qualify for a judge's pension. He has been compensated in terms of finance. When I look at some of the other areas in this community where individuals have suffered at the hands of authority, the case of former Justice Staples seems to me to be very paltry indeed. Lindy Chamberlain spent 3 3/4 years behind bars. Her reputation and that of her family were absolutely ruined. There were leaks from the police and attempts by the Northern Territory Government to ignore the problem and, in some cases, simply to put her in her place-as they saw it, behind bars again. Lindy Chamberlain has not had an easy time. Similarly, former police sergeant Phil Arantz was dismissed by the Askin Government for releasing figures about the rising rate of crime in New South Wales. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I have, in appropriate forums. I have not heard Senator Dunn raise her voice about it here, yet she talks about Justice Staples. It seems to me that when we talk about justice we have to go for those areas where justice ought to be given, where this Senate can assist. To set ourselves up as judge and jury in an issue where we could not and did not call all the witnesses I believe is wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Dunn said, `The trouble with the Senate and the House of Representatives is that somehow or other they outvoted us and got the wrong idea about the terms of reference, but we'-meaning herself and Dr Klugman-`then set about fixing that up during our inquiry'. In other words, Senator Dunn said, `No matter what terms of reference this Parliament gave us, somehow or other we will set the record straight and we will call Maddern, Moore and Staples in'. Former Justice Staples had a very significant amount of time before our Committee. I think he appeared before us for about 2 3/4 hours. That is the longest time I have ever heard of for someone to sit there and tell us what he thinks. He was then allowed to appear again. I think that he was generously treated. I was one who objected to the idea that Justice Staples should criticise our draft report-presumably a copy of which was in his hands-before we had made our final decision. I do not like being pressured like that as a parliamentarian. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the principles on which I am dissenting. I am sorry to have to dissent because I believe that, for the most part, the Committee was very cooperative indeed; worked well together. I believe the report covers the ground rules for the future, which will be extremely valuable for the conduct of governments and members of tribunals. I hope that it may be a guide to those people who in the future may get themselves into the same sorts of difficulties as former Justice Staples and Presidents Maddern and Moore did. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that there is great value in what this Parliament did. In no way do I resile from the fact that the terms of reference given to the Committee were, in fact, appropriate; they were appropriate because we needed them. To try to push the case of Justice Staples to make it the Staples inquiry, I think, is inappropriate and a waste of the Senate's time, and I believe that we should be addressing ourselves to the issues that were raised in general about the question of the independence of tribunals, the way they operate and the question of freedom they have in relation to governments. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank those people who worked with the Committee, particularly our two secretaries, who had to work against all sorts of tight time schedules to have this report ready before the end of the year. I thank the other members of the Committee for their cooperation. As I indicated, my reluctant dissent is here in order that we get the real issues back on the table again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to deal with this matter I should state that both Dick Klugman and I have been personal friends of Jim Staples for 40 years. What I say, I imagine, should be seen in that context. I think that it is honest for me to say that I find Senator Aulich's contribution to this debate unfortunate. I think it does him no credit beyond the fact that he is clearly prepared to be loyal to the position that his Party has taken, whether that position is right or wrong. In fact, the position is morally indefensible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that this dispute between justices of the Industrial Relations Commission and Mr Justice Staples began under the Liberal Government, which did not take action, and properly did not take action, on this matter. Mr Justice Staples continued to be employed on various matters-not adequately, and not to his liking-while the Fraser Liberal Government was in power, but no action of an administrative nature by the Government was taken against him. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Government that Senator Aulich is defending used a device in order to exclude him from an office to which he was entitled. One can come to all sorts of views about the morality of that. I will simply say a few things on this score, particularly relating to Senator Aulich's objections. It is nonsense for Senator Aulich to say that Justice Staples has been `adequately compensated'. That man was entitled to a position in society which carries with it not only a professional accolade, but also a substantial salary. He has been deprived of both of those by an administrative device by this Government. It is nonsense for Senator Aulich to say that the Senate should not be judge and jury in this matter, and that the Joint Select Committee on the Tenure of Appointees to Commonwealth Tribunals has gone against the wishes of the Senate in devoting one chapter out of eight to the Staples matter. </PARA>
<PARA> In the first place, it is recognisable that, while the Senate rejected a specific motion limiting the matter to Mr Justice Staples, the replacement motion was an umbrella motion which covered the whole issue in general. In my view, there is no conflict in the specific matter of Justice Staples being dealt with under that general heading. For Senator Aulich to pretend that the Senate, by rejecting the limiting motion, therefore denied any right to the Committee to deal with the Staples matter is utter bunkum. </PARA>
<PARA> It is extraordinary for Senator Aulich to say that it would be wrong to set up an inquiry because the Senate should not be judge and jury. Let us see what paragraph 8.36 of the report signed by Senator Durack, as Deputy Chairman, actually says. It starts off, `In view of the foregoing'. What is `the foregoing'? That sentence dramatises that there is a reason, which did not exist at the time of the 28 February resolution, why the specific matter of Justice Staples should be investigated. That is not to say that the Senate should do it; it is just that the Committee recommends:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government should establish an inquiry to determine the issue of compensation for former Justice Staples, in view of his non re-appointment to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no suggestion that the Senate should be judge and jury in this matter. But it is the phrase `in view of the foregoing' that I think is absolutely vital, and that is what I want to concentrate on-as I have said, `the foregoing' being information that was not available to the Senate early on when it made its decision. I will deal now with that. I find it most unfortunate that, in a matter of such significance, Sir John Moore and Mr Justice Maddern did not avail themselves of the opportunity given to them to provide fulsome assistance to this Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that Jim Staples made uncomfortable decisions. They were decisions that, according to some people, often appeared unrelated to the evidence, and they have been attacked as being capricious. People did not know what the ground rules were when appearing before Justice Staples. The facts are that he has an imaginative approach; he is uncomfortable; and he challenges the basic beliefs, if you like, of the industrial relations club. But when we heard Senator Aulich talking about reasons why people should be got rid of, why there should be the capacity to remove people if they are lazy or incapable--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, after five years, as Senator Durack says. No-one has ever accused Mr Justice Staples of being lazy or incapable. Senator Aulich let the cat out of the bag in his approach because he wants whoever is in those positions to be acceptable to his peer group and to be subject to removal, apparently, if he offends his peer group. Naturally, someone like Mr Justice Staples, who has no time for the hypocrisy of the industrial relations club, would offend a peer group of that order. Many members of the coalition have very little time for the practices of the industrial relations club, which I believe have been one of the major reasons for the Australian economy suffering so badly in recent years. On those scores I find Senator Aulich's intervention extraordinary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I go back to the unfortunate situation where, in this general inquiry on this matter, Sir John Moore chose not to give any assistance to the Committee as to the basis of the exercise of his power to allocate the work of the Commission to include the removal of work-in other words, the question relating specifically to Mr Justice Staples but which could well establish a general precedent-Justice Maddern provided the Committee with a broad statement of the general areas of consideration that he regarded as relevant to his decision without advising the Committee in what areas he saw this as relevant to the removal of former Justice Staples from active work. The Committee concludes:</PARA>
<PARA> In view of the fact that it has not conducted an inquiry into the Staples case, the Committee believes that it would be unjustified for it to form an opinion on several of the matters asserted by former Justice Staples. </PARA>
<PARA> No evidence has been given to the Committee that former Justice Staples was guilty of any misbehaviour or suffered any incapacity that would have justified his dismissal. </PARA>
<PARA>This seems to me to be the crux of the matter. I believe that the Labor Government behaved dishonourably in dismissing him by a device; I believe that it is continuing to act dishonourably in not taking some appropriate action to recompense Justice Staples; and I strongly support the recommendation by the majority of the Committee that an inquiry be established. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to Senator Dunn, I agree with various elements of Dr Klugman's and her dissenting report. The fact that former Justice Staples gave evidence that he had made serious attempts to resolve the problem and that this had not been denied I think is fairly persuasive. The fact that Justices Maddern and Moore chose not to deal with the Committee does not give the Committee the right to say that therefore Justice Staples took no effective steps when he may well have, and Moore and Maddern could properly have sought to disprove that had they had a mind to do it. They did not have a mind to do it, and in those circumstances the burden of proof surely should be on someone else to disprove what Staples was saying. So I have that one reservation about the Committee's conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, I think it was improper for Justice Staples to be effectively dismissed without any reasons being given. I commend this report for raising this issue so sensibly and rationally and I strongly support its recommendation that the Government establish an inquiry to determine the issue of compensation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel that I cannot let this debate go without making some comment, since it was my original motion that led to the current inquiry of the Joint Select Committee on Tenure of Appointees to Commonwealth Tribunals. Admittedly, the terms of reference that finished up before this Committee bore very little relationship to the ones that we originally moved, and I think that is why this issue will not go away. There is no question in most people's minds but that the former Mr Justice Staples has been appallingly treated and that a device, which everyone recognises as a device, was used to deny him tenure. It was used to deny him tenure because he had become, I suppose, not to put too fine a point on it, a damned nuisance to this Government and to the previous Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are some facts that we raised in the original debate that I think are worth repeating. Like other judges, Jim Staples was appointed to the position that he had previously because at the time he was considered capable. One can only assume that that was the reason for his appointment. I would hate to think that we will ever get to a stage of putting people into these sorts of positions for political reasons or any reason other than simple merit and their capabilities to fulfil the function of their jobs. So let us assume that Jim Staples was originally appointed because he exhibited considerable capabilities in the area. </PARA>
<PARA> However, he was not the sort of person to sit back quietly and do precisely what he was told, to follow the system and not make waves. He was, I suppose, a pest in the eyes of some people because he challenged the system. He sent people off to negotiate in a more sensible way and he made a few public statements that perhaps a few people did not like. Because he occasionally bucked the nice, cosy little arrangement that was often entered into between employers and employees before they went to the then Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, he offended some people-including some of his colleagues-considerably. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, with section 72 (ii) of the Constitution worded in the way it is, it was practically impossible to remove him other than by the necessary address by both Houses of Parliament. So whether it was incidental, accidental, or deliberate, this device of getting rid of the old Commission, establishing a new Industrial Relations Commission and failing to appoint all the judges who were on the old Commission-in the only case of Mr Justice Staples-was implemented. From that time on Jim Staples has been seeking justice, and explanation and redress. The fact is that following this inquiry no justice has been done to Mr Staples. As I said, not only was my original motion amended to remove any need to address the Staples case, but he has achieved no compensation, no recompense, no apology, no explanation, no nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> I took some exception to the rather odd argument put forward by Senator Aulich that, just because some people have been badly treated in other areas of law in compensation, and so on, it is okay to mistreat Mr Justice Staples and to give him less than the justice that he deserves. That is an appalling statement. What we are really saying is, `Gosh, we accidentally, unfairly or incorrectly hanged a man, but let us use this as an example for unfairly and inappropriately hanging a few others. We have now set a precedent, so we might as well build up a whole body of these occurrences'. It is a bizarre argument to put that, simply because some other people have been badly treated and have had to fight for redress, compensation and justice, it is okay if we toss a few more people onto that particular heap and hope that they wear out, die, or go quietly away and leave us all alone. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a relationship between the Parliament and the judiciary, of which Mr Justice Staples was a member, regardless of the odd comments about the naming of people on the Commission. There is no justification for saying, `Well, it was only a nice title that we gave them to make them feel good. They were not really judges; they were not really justices; we just let them call themselves that'. If we were not going to treat them in that way, why allow them to use the title and expect to have the same benefits, the same protection and the same treatment as `really truly judges' under the Constitution. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Aulich's argument, that it was jolly nice of us to deem that he was actually older than he really was in order to give him compensation, is a little strange, too. It is as though contravening a law or a normal occurrence in order to avoid actually giving somebody proper justice is okay, and as though that is the answer to what we have done. It is not appropriate to say, `Aren't we good guys because we have given him a pension earlier than he was entitled to, by letting him behave as though he were 60 years old or by redefining him as being 60'. What sort of a ludicrous situation are we reaching when the Parliament, by ignoring its responsibilities under the Constitution, has to go through a whole lot of curly devices in order, firstly, to get rid of somebody who had tenure and, secondly, to pretend to be seen to be doing the decent thing by him. </PARA>
<PARA> Our original motion dealt with the major issue-and it is still the major issue; it has not gone away-the question of tenure of people on commissions of this kind and how governments can get rid of these annoying people without being challenged or being brought to answer questions by the incumbent that they have just got rid of. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague points out that the Parliament is a very important part of all this. The Parliament, of course, has nothing to be proud of. Having colluded in the original changing of the motion to try to get the Justice Staples issue out of all this, it has found that it has come full circle. It is impossible to deal with this issue without dealing with the question of Mr Justice Staples. He and his case were integral to the whole question that was before the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It now appears that the Committee has recognised this fact by recommending that an inquiry into the need for compensation for Mr Justice Staples go ahead. In many ways I see that as an admission of error on the part of those members of the Committee that originally supported the changes to the first motion proposed to this place so long ago. I hope that that recommendation from the Committee is accepted. If it is not picked up by the Government, if an inquiry into compensation for Mr Justice Staples does not go ahead, I venture to say that it will remain a stain on the good name of this place and, in particular, on the current Labor Government. It has shabbily treated a man who deserved justice. It cannot argue, as it so frequently does from its ideological point of view, against the unfair dismissal of ordinary workers and then be party to the engineering of such an unfair dismissal of a man who had been put on a commission because he was considered capable. He ruffled a few feathers and was summarily got rid of, but he refused to go away. If nothing else comes out of this sorry and ongoing mess, at the very least I hope we can look forward to a motion from this Government that a committee will be established, or some other form of inquiry will be set up, in order to look at compensation for a man who has been denied justice, denied tenure, and denied any opportunity to see fair play operate in an area of the judiciary which is intimately involved with seeing that fair play operates out in the work force. The Government cannot have it both ways. It cannot argue plaintively for fairness for the work force and then not extend it to the people whose job it is to ensure that that fairness is put into effect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is fair to say that I have had discussions with the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) as Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy with a view to expediting the procedure over the plans which he laid down last night. I want to ensure that I get some answers to questions I have put about a few areas in this portfolio. It is probably appropriate that I should beat the air for a moment or two rather than call a quorum. The issues that I still require specific information on are as follows: What are the main objectives of quarantine? I have always understood that maintaining health and preventing disease are the main objectives. How are the levels of acceptable risk fixed? Is it done by meetings of the Government, of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service or of the Ministerial Council of Health Ministers-the State health Ministers and the Federals? Is it fixed by consultation with the industries involved? Who determines what is a fair and reasonable risk in someone else's business?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By the same token, who determines when it is time to back off when it comes to the fear of accusations of non-tariff protection? How far do we go before we run the risk of having somebody accuse us of non-tariff protection? Is that done in consultation with the industries concerned or is it done by the Government or AQIS? I also want to know whether we have a transmisible gastroenteritis disaster plan. I have asked this question previously and could not get an answer. Is the risk factor one in 3.3 million? Is it one in 15,000, which is still an acceptable risk I am told? What is the acceptable risk at which we cut it off? Is it one in 5,000? Is it one in 500? It would be desirable if I were able to advise the people involved, whose industry we are talking about, as to what is the acceptable risk, who determines it and whether we have made any progress in endeavouring to determine whether the one in 3.3 million is closer or not as close as the one in 15,000. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to know that, as I would like to know whether it is appropriate to use mecadox and, if it is appropriate to use mecadox, in other people's industry, why it is not appropriate to use it in our industry, or vice versa. It should be all in or all out, in my opinion. The same thing applies with the nitrates question, which I have regularly raised. Clearly, an exporter certificate should be supplied with the product to say `This has been manufactured without the use of nitrates'. As far as listeria is concerned, every exported cheese that is likely to be subject to listeria should have a certificate to say that it has been inspected before it leaves the country and that it is free of the disease or of potential for the disease. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there is the fire blight question. What steps are to be taken as far as fire blight is concerned? Will it be a destruction of orchards? Will it be a destruction of host trees, or will it not? The enormous damage there could be from an outbreak, once it was established, would be impossible to eradicate. What are we doing about it? Who makes the decisions? What are the disaster plans? All these matters are of great importance. I note that the Minister has now entered the chamber. I have been waiting for his arrival. I have been giving notice of the issues that I trust he will be able to respond to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night I was concluding by saying that the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) as a regulatory authority has the difficulty of attracting public attention if there is a mistake but of being invisible when things are going well. I guess that is what one would expect from an organisation whose job it is to make sure that no disease gets into Australia which afflicts our horticultural or agricultural industries.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed; that is true. However, it is not a very rewarding occupation for AQIS people because they do not get any recognition for success. Their invisibility ensures that is the case. The Government commissioned a report to review quarantine policy in Australia. The report commenced under the chairmanship of Professor Lindsay, from the University of Western Australia, in 1987 and took 12 months. After considering the Lindsay report, the Government responded on 15 December 1988. If there are two organisations which could be characterised as protagonist organisations or, if you like, organisations which argue the toss with AQIS over judgments, those two organisations would be the National Farmers Federation and the Australian Veterinary Association. Both those organisations endorsed the findings of the Lindsay report and the response to it by government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Lindsay report did not, as is common abroad, change the fundamentals of quarantine policy. There was no change to a philosophy that has been characterised as `acceptable risk'. What the Lindsay report proposed, and what the Government has adopted, is to make more explicit what were the previously implied methods of assessing risk and to make more transparent, that is, to make more open and discoverable, the activities of AQIS so that in the context of our international standing in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade-our position in the world for free trade-it can be clearly seen that, on the one hand, AQIS is not a non-trade barrier, for which some countries would use their quarantine services, and, on the other hand, the guarantee of protection to the rural community and to the public at large is consistent with its record and objectives. I think there has been some misunderstanding on that point. There has been some misunderstanding that a sea change occurred in policy. What changed was the emphasis and explanation of the policy and the methodology employed to deal with acceptable risk. </PARA>
<PARA> I said at the beginning of my remarks that AQIS has the unfortunate problem of being noticeable only when there is a mistake and invisible when everything is going well. AQIS has attracted some attention in the media at present because, to use one example, of the importation into Australia of a partly contaminated container of nashi fruit. This has been hailed as a lack of efficiency or activity on the part of AQIS. It has been used as a criticism of AQIS. That is unfair. If one reflects on it, it can be seen to be unfair. It is a bit like criticising the police force every time there is a drug bust, saying `Hello, there are drugs available in the community!'. We have a quarantine service to protect us from those things. When it discovers an outbreak such as this, reports it and deals with it, to criticise it is totally unfair. If I can go back to the police analogy, we all know that crime exists, as we know disease exists, but to apply the same measure that is now being applied to AQIS to the police would bring the whole of the police force into disrepute for no gain in the community and for no real purpose and would be illogical, anyway. So I make that defence of AQIS. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to some of the points raised by Senator Archer. One of the points Senator Archer raised strongly last night when we were winding up our day's business was that not enough is known about AQIS and that information is hard to extract from that body. I am not endorsing it, but I think that was the direction of the honourable senator's remarks. I believe that AQIS has now answered all the questions put to it at the Estimates Committee and that AQIS is accessible to all the commodity organisations within the NFF and producer groups. Indeed, it is frequently invited to address their meetings. A recent example of that occurred about two or three weeks ago in Northam, Western Australia, when pig producers were concerned about the possible importation of transmissible gastroenteritis into Australia by virtue of uncooked Canadian pig meat being able to enter Australia. AQIS officers were invited, attended and explained the situation in relation to their assessment of that type of disease. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is a problem that attention is focused on a topic only when people become agitated. The Western Australian pig producers were kind enough to say that, when AQIS was going through the consultations in relation to transmissible gastroenteritis, they did not pay a great deal of attention and they said that in a flash of honesty, for which I do not condemn them. In fact I want to encourage this kind of interchange. It was only when the possibility arose in relation to signing a protocol to enable the pig meat to come into Australia and compete with their domestic product that they paid particular attention to the matter. They recognised that they had to undertake a degree of catching up on the information base that was available to the community in order that the inner issues could be debated. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of the way in which ordinary business is done in Australia, I think it is reasonable for me to observe that, in the throes of criticism, it does not mean to say that the information was not available; rather, at the time, because it was routine, boring and dull, people did not pay attention to it. I cite the example of the Western Australian pig producers in relation to that observation and they were honest enough to say that that was the case. However, AQIS will shortly announce the opening of a hot line for producers, which they can dial on an inward wide area telephone service number anywhere in Australia to inquire from AQIS as to what particular issues are current and to obtain information about possible disease, risk assessment and things of that nature. As an organisation, it can then be more accessible and producers can have direct access to case officers who are dealing with particular problems. </PARA>
<PARA> AQIS maintains a regular policy of consulting with the national organisations representing producers. As I will shortly demonstrate when I go to the substantive detail, it does that on every major issue, but a difficulty may sometimes arise in relation to what is conveyed-and it is sometimes complex information-at peak level. There may be some difficulty with that information washing through from national structures to State and regional organisations so that people on the ground who are affected by the problem are seized of all the information. That is a logistical organisational difficulty. All honourable senators are familiar with how national organisations work and we can understand that difficulty. In order to try to overcome the problem, AQIS will now pursue a policy, for want of a better description-and these are my words, not those of AQIS-of having a sort of open day when they will invite people in various centres to come and talk to them. Its transparency goal-that is, that people can understand how and why it acts and the principles it employs-will be met by that mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Archer endorsed-and I am pleased that he did-the fact that neither this Government nor any other government in Australia should use the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service as a non-tariff barrier. I believe that there is probably no better example of the allegation that it is a non-tariff barrier than in the case of Canadian pig meat. Australia is the only country in the world that maintains a quarantine ban on the importation of that pig meat. In terms of this current General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) round, the Canadians have lobbied hard to establish the reason why we maintain that ban when no other country takes the judgment that we have made on quarantine grounds. In addition, when we move to talk to the Americans about their export enhancement finance to wheat exporters so that they can compete on world wheat markets against our producers, who receive no subsidies and must compete against subsidised American wheat, and when we go to Washington and complain about that type of arrangement, they will say to us, `But you use non-tariff barriers: look at the Canadian pig meat example'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am reporting here; I am not editorialising. I am saying that this is what happens and occurs. The same thing will happen to whoever goes overseas to raise these matters. Should the Opposition wish to send a mission to Washington, it will receive this type of reply when it gets down to taws and debates these matters. I report that. However, I do not say that that is necessarily a reason-and I do not proffer it as such-why we should change our policy in relation to the importation into Australia of uncooked Canadian pig meat if we believe that, for quarantine reasons, it should not come here. Our standards may well differ from those of other countries and we have a right to establish our own standards and we shall defend them. However, that raises the veracity of those standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have undertaken a series of consultations, investigations, experiments and, as a result, further consultations, since 1985. This is not a new issue; it has been around for a long time. The central construct of the major part of our decision in this matter was based on experiments conducted by the Australian National Animal Health Laboratory. In relation to those laboratories, honourable senators must bear in mind that we import muscle tissue and cuts of meat-we are not importing the hearts, the lungs or the tonsils which, it can be argued, are product that could contain transmissible gastroenteritis. There is scientific evidence to suggest that that is the case. But there is no scientific evidence to suggest that muscle tissue would contain the disease. However, as soon as this meat is cooked, it then kills the possibility of transmissible gastroenteritis, so we are dealing with that very fine area of probability. Neither the Government nor AQIS wanted to make this judgment, but the Australian Veterinary Association (AVA) conducted its own assessment of the possible introduction of transmissible gastroenteritis and came up with the risk figure of one in 3.3 million in relation to each item. I would not like to have those odds quoted to me in any contest, but that was its independent assessment, which was uninvited by us. </PARA>
<PARA> The AVA's pig veterinarians also conducted their own assessment and came up with a figure of one in 15,500. Those figures are not the foundation upon which we make our decision, but they constitute part of the information base for decision-making. We base our primary decision-making on the Australian National Animal Health Laboratory experiments and what we know as a result of what has happened in parts of the United States of America and other places in the world. We can cull scientific information bases from looking at journals from those places and talking to those people who perform the experiments. We can also examine the case examples. We then come to a conclusion that, in this case, there is no reason why we should not sign the protocol. That is the basis for that decision. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that there is then some anxiety as to whether or not that is true. At the present time, we are engaging in further discussions with the Pig Producers Association of Australia, which recognises that the anxiety is driven by concern about the impact on the Christmas trade of Canadian hams competing in the market here. I think that is still the engine of anxiety. The way in which that anxiety is expressed is through quarantine. I believe that we are in one of those classic cases where the real problem is not the issue that is being put forward as the solution. </PARA>

<PARA> I now turn to the matter of fire blight which was discussed at a public meeting in and around the Orange-Bathurst area last night. What are the facts in the case of this disease? Of course, it would be disastrous if there were an outbreak of fire blight in Australia as far as our fruit crops are concerned. AQIS has produced a discussion paper on the possible importation of apples from New Zealand into Australia from an area identified not simply by our scientists who have responsibility for this type of commodity but by others as being free from this disease. It has been declared an area freedom region without fire blight. Just as we have been able to obtain recognition, for example, in Japan that Tasmania is free of certain diseases that occur on the mainland and we are able to export from Tasmania to Japan because that country recognises the area freedom concept, we have recognised the area freedom concept in a certain area of New Zealand and apples are exported only from this area where the disease is non-existent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am explaining the concept of area freedom. If we can identify an area as disease free, or free of a particular disease, and quarantine that area so that it is protected and so that that disease will not penetrate, it is reasonable to say that we can import from that area-or, indeed, in the case of Tasmania, export from that area-in the knowledge that the disease is not transmissible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to fire blight, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has published a discussion paper on the area freedom concept and on the concept as it applies in New Zealand to apples. It is now in the midst of extensive consultation with industry groups about that matter. At this point no decision has been taken-and I underline those words `no decision has been taken'. A decision will not be made until after the consultations have been properly conducted and concluded and until after conclusions have been reached and recommendations formed on the basis of that and on the basis of our best scientific knowledge. In terms of fire blight, the consultation clock is now ticking and, following the conclusion of that process, the Government will make a decision. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat, though, that the Government cannot make a decision based on what might be producer pressure. We have to make a decision as a government based on the scientific argument. I might add that the producer groups are attending to the responsibility of making decisions on scientific grounds, rather than bringing vulgar pressure to apply because of what might be perceived as problems. These are difficult areas, and they involve careful judgment. It is not surprising that in this period of consultation there is anxiety and worry about what the implications might be. But we are a government committed to full and proper consultation. That is our record; we intend to keep it, and we will follow it through here. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Archer referred to the listeria organism and said that there was contamination in 3 per cent of a year's shipment of cheese. I have a number of notes, which I will seek leave to table, which will amplify the details that I will now provide. I feel bound, while I am on my feet, to say a few words about listeria, as the honourable senator has raised this as a serious question. I think the point of the honourable senator's question was: why do we not stop the importation of cheese contaminated by listeria at the point of origin rather than apply our detective specialities in stopping it here? The problem with listeria is that the longer the particular cheese, the host for the listeria, is left in refrigeration or storage the more any manifestations of listeria that might exist will occur. We certainly inspect at the point of origin. But we have our strongest inspection deployment here. So, we reserve cheeses which have a record of containing listeria for even longer in storage so that we can be sure that they do not contain this very dangerous disease. I think the record of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service in this area is a good one. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator next raised the question of nitrates in cheese. He said that other countries put nitrates in cheese and asked why our domestic producers cannot. That is not a decision for the quarantine service. What can be done domestically is a decision for the National Health and Medical Research Council. I am advised now that the relevant committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council has decided to permit nitrates, within limits, to be put in cheese manufactured in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> I conclude by referring to the other matter that was mentioned, namely, toxic dinoflagellates in ballast water in ships. The problem for Australia is that we are a bulk exporter of commodities, such as iron ore, coal, woodchips. There is nothing to backload those vessels with and they return to Australia in ballast. They take on seawater as ballast in Japan or at some other market and discharge it here. This is a problem if the water these ships take on contains organisms which may be exotic or foreign to Australia and which might give rise to disease. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say that we have done considerable work on this problem in concert with major exporters. The Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, for example, lent us one of its vessels to use as a moving test laboratory on these problems. We are defining the problem and we are, I think, close to a solution. But we have a problem that the international shipping agencies and their associates are complaining about having to do special investigation and sampling work to assist our monitoring. One of the papers that I wish to table gives details about ballast water discharge. </PARA>
<PARA> I have taken some time over this matter, but Senator Archer has raised some detailed and important questions. I have tried to answer them as fulsomely as I can orally. I now seek leave to table documents concerning the following matters: controls on shipping ballast water discharge; mecadox residues in Canadian pig meat, a matter that I did not refer to; importation of bison from North America, a matter that I think Senator Archer raised at one time; the emergency response to a possible transmissible gastroenteritis outbreak; estimates of probability of entry of transmissible gastroenteritis in Canadian pig meat; and listeria in cheese. If I can table those documents it may help overcome some of the problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have only a brief comment to make. During his answer, the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) mentioned the fire blight situation. Earlier in the week, in answer to a question he became a little excited and accused the Opposition of trying to stir up and be critical of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. I have no argument with the quarantine service at all. I would just like to pass on to the Minister that, in Tasmania, I have had many fruit growers come to me and call me about their concern about fire blight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister referred to the area freedom in Tasmania. I know the work that has gone on in Tasmania trying to convince the Japanese that we do not have a fruit fly problem. In fact, I believe there will be a good market in Japan once this is proved up. I can pass on to the Minister that the growers are very concerned about fire blight coming into Tasmania because, if it does, we immediately lose our area freedom, as it is called, thereby undoing all the good work that has been done with regard to the fruit fly. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I want to say that the problems and the fears that the coalition and I have about fire blight are not raised to be critical of the quarantine service but because there is a genuine concern about the matter in fruit growing areas. I was a fruit grower myself in earlier days, and I am quite well aware of what has happened with different insects and pests that have been imported into this country over the years. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier in the week, on another matter, in answer to a user friendly question by Senator McMullan, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) tried to put the Government's case on the Moscow Circus coming to Australia. I was talking to some circus people this morning and they raised with me the question why it is when they import animals from overseas they have to be in quarantine for such a long time. Can the Minister for Resources say what, if any, special arrangements were made with the Moscow Circus for the importation of animals? I believe that these animals will be going to 23 major country areas, and it therefore raises a little query about some disease perhaps being imported into Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the first point, I thank the honourable senator for offering me the advice he offered me. I appreciate that there is a degree of anxiety out there. Whatever philosophic base we work on as a government and honourable senators opposite work on as an opposition, we are about changing things and, hopefully, from our own philosophical perspectives, improving things. The art of managing change is not an art that has been properly debated or indeed given enough public scrutiny. I recognise that as soon as we talk about change to longstanding arrangements people become anxious, not being certain about what their role in the future will be or how well they will fare in the face of that change. So I believe that we have to spend a great deal of painstaking time in explanation so that those anxieties are, as far as they can be, quelled. I appreciate the advice the honourable senator gave me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the circus, we have a series of requirements about circuses and what the quarantine arrangements are. No relaxation of those quarantine arrangements occurs for particular circuses, but circuses from some parts of the world, I understand, would not be acceptable because of disease in those areas. A circus such as the Moscow Circus would be required to observe our special quarantine requirements, which are rigid and which mean that in some cases travelling international circuses do not bring their full range of animals on a tour of Australia; they concentrate on some other part of their circus offering. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) back to the earlier inquiries before the Estimates committees about the export of merino semen. At the time, I asked a question about rams going to New Zealand and about whether, with the trade arrangement we have with New Zealand, it was possible that semen or, indeed, live rams were going on from New Zealand. At that time, with regard to my query about semen, I was not given any definite assurance that that was not happening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia has a quota of 900 rams that we can sell from the auction system to overseas buyers. That was quite a reasonable sort of quota but the technology of getting semen and exporting it has virtually increased one hundredfold the availability of genetic material overseas. My main worry at present is to know exactly what is happening in New Zealand and whether our rams going to New Zealand can bypass the system, with no redress on that at all. As I said, I did not get any great assurance, as the Hansard report shows, that that was not happening. </PARA>

I turn now to the wheat industry. At the Estimates committee stage, I asked a question about how such an exact figure for the wheat industry levy is arrived at. The Minister said where it would be distributed. I also asked at that time how well the Australian wheat crop was being estimated. Since then, we have had a further deterioration in wheat production in Australia. I know that the figure in Western Australia is up slightly on what was anticipated, but in the east the position has turned into a reasonable sort of disaster.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I now move to the deregulated system and the inspection of the grain that is traded. I know that 80 per cent of our production will still be going overseas. It will be controlled by quarantine inspection and that sort of thing, so I am not worried about that. But the 20 per cent that will remain in Australia will be much more freely traded if the deregulated Wheat Marketing Act works as this Government expects it to. The free market will probably not build up much in the first year, but in time it will.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am worried about the hygiene aspects of the wheat being traded without going through one of the bulk handling authorities. I know that it will be separated from the main bulk of the wheat for the export market and from the wheat for the internal market that is handled by the authorities. However, there is the matter of contamination and that sort of thing. Whereas at present bulk handling facilities are not too far apart, under the deregulated system in certain areas private bulk handling facilities may be erected on a railhead within 300, 400 or 500 metres of the bulk handling authority in each State. If the private facility does not keep up its inspection for and control of insects, it could eventually affect the other one. Also, a breed of weevil may become resistant to known chemicals and make the chemicals redundant. I wonder what the Department is doing about this. I know we were told at the Estimates hearings that no extra effort would be involved, but I still express fears that that situation could lead to a general downgrading in the standard of hygiene in the bulk handling of wheat around Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will allay Senator Panizza's fears as best I can. He is right-and I think it is common ground between us across the chamber-that the 80 per cent of the Australian wheat crop that is exported is protected in the highest possible way by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, and that will remain the case. As for wheat that might be traded outside the bulk handling facilities in Australia-I think that is the area which the honourable senator identified as a potential area for problems of infection-I do not think he ought to be particularly agitated. What will operate in that market, I believe-and there are signs that this will be the case-is a concern by the consumers of that component of the wheat crop to ensure the quality of the wheat they purchase for domestic needs, such as bread manufacturing, as, indeed, there will be a concern by farmers to trade wheat to them of a high standard. The marketplace to some extent can be relied on to guarantee that but we will, of course, maintain an ever-vigilant eye on that development.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I entirely agree with the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) when it comes to the wheat that goes to the mills for flour making, because it is to the absolute advantage of farmers that the wheat is kept clean. I am more worried about the wheat that will be used for stockfeed. Even though, as the Minister correctly pointed out, about 80 per cent will still be exported and roughly 20 per cent used in Australia, there is nothing to say that some of the wheat set aside for the domestic market will not find its way onto the export market. Wheat can be delivered to the pool up to 30 October. It can be kept in on-farm storage, or a private buyer may buy a large quantity of wheat and store it in a city or country silo he has put up himself. If he has taken a punt that he will make a dollar on it and finds that he cannot sell it, it will go back into the pool. I know that if it goes back into the pool it has to meet the standards of the Australian Wheat Board for delivery from day one, but the point is that if hygiene measures are not taken in those private facilities there is more of a chance of contamination getting past the sampling ramp. If the wheat goes straight from the paddock to the bulk handling authority at the siding, there is a very minimal chance of contamination. One would have to be unlucky to get a weevil in it-it might have landed on the load on its way through. But if the grain is stored in a not so modern facility within 200 metres of a bulk handling authority and is not properly kept, there is a chance that, on delivery back to the pool, contaminated wheat might get past the sampling ramp. After all, the sample that comes from any load-whether it is five tonnes or 30 tonnes-is half a hectolitre. I would like to hear what the Minister has to say on that point.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Senator Panizza has raised many of the concerns that were raised during the debate on wheat and its deregulation. As the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) said he would keep a vigilant eye on the concerns raised by Senator Panizza, I would also like to signal a matter to the Minister, and I hope he will keep a vigilant eye on it as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Minister is aware, one of the main concerns of those who were against the deregulation of the wheat industry was that it will simply open the market to two or three large grain merchants, who will have the potential to cartel the market, and that was not seen to be very efficient economics. It has been said that that will affect only the domestic market-20 per cent of the market-and the other 80 per cent of the market will still be controlled by the Australian Wheat Board for export purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Can the Minister keep a vigilant eye on this? What checks and balances does he have in place to prevent these large grain merchants from snookering the export market? By that, I mean that they can simply buy up as much wheat as they like on the domestic market, thus affecting the export supplies. It may be that they will buy so much wheat in one year that they will have a surplus the next. That will affect domestic market prices for the next year and grain merchants will be able to hold large supplies and be in a better bargaining position against the farmers in the domestic market. They could then go running to the Government saying. `We have these huge surpluses. We overbought last year. Allow us to export this year'. That would be the thin end of the wedge. That is the first point: how do we prevent them from snookering the market in that way?</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, in one year they may buy huge surpluses, which they are free to do. Then, when the Wheat Board tries to meet its export contracts, it finds that there is no grain in the domestic market for it to buy up; it has been beaten to the punch. So it then has to buy from these grain merchants-at a premium price-to meet its export contracts. In those two ways the grain merchants can snooker the export market by simply having access to the domestic market and being able to buy as much as they like. We should not think that they cannot do that. Heaven knows, Elders IXL Ltd is a billion dollar company and can go into the market and buy up. I signal those two concerns to the Minister. Are there existing checks and balances to prevent that or will he keep a vigilant eye on the matter?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have one final question. I reiterate the concerns that I expressed at the Estimates Committee F hearings about the collection of the wheat levy, which is on a purely voluntary system. I know that already in practice the new buyers in the deregulated market are discounting what they pay to the growers by 2 1/2 per cent, so each grower is paying it anyway. I would prefer the levy to go into the research fund than anywhere else. Even though the Minister assured me at the Estimates Committee hearings that the Government has good measures in place to ensure that this levy is collected from the buyers, I still have strong doubts that the Government will collect anywhere near the correct amount. I asked whether the Government will do as it does with other levies around Australia and use the Australian Taxation Office to collect it. I was advised that the Government had thought of using the Taxation Office but either chose not to or did not think it was necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As this is only the first year of deregulation, I ask the Government to implement measures to ensure that the levy is collected. The growers are paying the levy. In the final analysis, they negotiate a price with the buyers and the buyers then simply say, `Of course, we have to take off the wheat levy'. The growers then say, `But I thought you were responsible for that' and the buyers say, `No, we have to take it off'. As far as I am concerned, the levy should go into the fund. I would like a proper mechanism put in place to make sure that it gets there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While the advisers are changing, I will sketch in the background to the matter that I wish to raise with the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), and why I wish to raise this matter. The Senate will recall-I think it was in the appropriations debate last year-that I raised, under the appropriations for the Department of Community Services and Health, the phenomenon of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and the need to research it and come to grips with its dimensions and implications for the Australian community. A number of professionals are doing research in this area. I refer specifically to Dr Mark Donohoe and Dr Joachim Fluhrer, whose work has been extensively publicised. From their work in Australia it is apparent that we may have a problem of massive proportions resulting from the uses and abuses of chemicals of various types in the agricultural and secondary industrial context, and also in the domestic context.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask the question: To what extent are these problems addressed, and to what extent has the need to research them and to place funds in the appropriate quarters for them to be researched been acknowledged in the appropriations? In speaking to that question, I draw the attention of the Minister to an article headed `Shock poison levels in our blood', which he may have already seen, which appeared in the Sun-Herald on 5 November this year. It reported the work of Dr Mark Donohoe and Dr Joachim Fluhrer in relation to 300 CFS sufferers, the results of samples of their blood which were analysed in the United States, and the quite extraordinary implications of these results for the Australian medical profession and, most definitely, for the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I also draw the Minister's attention to an article which appeared in the Oregonian, which is a newspaper published in Oregon in the United States, on 3 November 1989. It reports the case of the Supreme Court of the United States upholding a judgment and awarding damages of $1.5m in the case of a forest service employee who died of cancer. The court upheld that he died of Hodgkin's disease attributed to exposure to 2,4-D-an extremely widely used chemical in Australia and one which has been widely used for many years. I am citing this case to point out what I think is one of the great sleeping questions of Australian health. I am framing the question to establish the Government's posture and readiness to address the issue of CFS and the extent to which it is acknowledged in the appropriations. </PARA>
<PARA> The article in the Sun-Herald to which I referred reports the work of Mark Donohoe and Joachim Fluhrer. Mark Donohoe is a friend of mine and he lives in my own community on the central coast of New South Wales. He has specialised in chronic fatigue syndrome and I am citing his work for two reasons, both of which are already known to the Minister and the Senate; but I think it is worth citing now in the light of this question. Mark Donohoe's research is significant because he has attempted to carry it out in general practice, and in doing so has bumped up against what I might term the obstinancy of the system. To use his term, his practice was targeted-I agree that it is a targeted practice-as one which used pathology excessively. Many of the claims of the patients to whom he was trying to render medical service have been rejected. In a boxed side article next to the main article in the Sun-Herald of 5 November, the case of the Humphries family in Manly is cited. This family is caught in the trap of chronic fatigue syndrome. Their circumstances are extraordinary but, of course, it is estimated that about 15,000 Australians may be suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome. I am simply saying that, if it is of that magnitude or greater, some of these people are making claims for medical reimbursement which are not being met, that the refusals are on a random basis, and that there is a bureaucratic and medical problem here which the system is simply not responding to or acknowledging adequately. </PARA>
<PARA> The work of Donohoe and Fluhrer suggests that poisons may be occurring in Australian communities at 10 times the level occurring in similar communities-in other words, urban city communities-in the United States of America. The chemicals which they cite are generally referred to as HCB, DDT, DDE, dieldrin, dichloromethane, chloroform, trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene. They indicate the incidence and level of these chemicals in Australian blood samples as opposed to American blood samples. In some instances it is up to 100 times greater than it is in samples taken from people living in similar American urban environments. They go further and say that these levels are probably causal to the chronic fatigue syndrome. They state:</PARA>
<PARA>Chronic fatigue syndrome has been dubbed the Yuppie Flu because it usually strikes young, hard-working, active individuals with white collar jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> They may start out being allergic to certain substances or food but gradually, their immune systems start to fail them, and they suffer almost constant feelings of fatigue and `unwell-ness'. </PARA>
<PARA>Hence, this is dubbed the chronic fatigue syndrome. Dr Fluhrer likens the people who have become ill to the budgies that were taken down into the mines to test the safety of the atmosphere. If the budgie died the conclusion was arrived at that the mining environment was unsafe and that everybody else should stay out. He is drawing an analogy between the sufferers. He says that what these people on the forward edge of this phenomenon are telling us is that we have a major problem and that we must address it, and that to do that we must direct resources to it. </PARA>
<PARA> I will very briefly describe the circumstances of Enid Humphries and her family, to whom I referred earlier. An article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Enid Humphries dreads going to bed at night for fear that her children will be dead in the morning. </PARA>
<PARA> `You live for the moment,' she said from her Manly flat. You just don't know how long you've got.'</PARA>
<PARA> Enid, 48, her three children and her husband Jim suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome, caused they believe, by chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> They have moved from Parkes in the country because `the country air is deadly' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It really is extraordinary and alarming when a family find that country air for them is deadly. In quite real terms the family have had to relocate. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>and have combed Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales in vain search for a safe place to live. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, people who suffer from this syndrome are really in most extraordinary circumstances. If we accept the findings of Donohoe and Fluhrer that we have a major problem and that we are on the forward edge of a major problem, if we accept the rulings of the Supreme Court of Oregon, which sustained an award of damages of $1.5m against the Dow Chemical Co., and if we accept the ruling of the medical experts who gave evidence in that Supreme Court ruling that the Hodgkin's lymphoma disease was attributable to 2,4-D, which, for heaven's sake, as a keen gardener I have used over and over again to kill the weeds in my lawn, and have been doing so for years-and I doubt whether Senator Stone accepts these findings-we have a problem that hopefully the Department of Community Services and Health is addressing. </PARA>
<PARA> We hope that it is funding, supporting and showing interest in the research which Donohoe and Fluhrer are conducting and will begin to acknowledge that people in general practice, or general practitioners, who are attempting to address and wrestle with these syndromes and diseases in the community are now being targeted as overprescribers of pathology. Hopefully, it will acknowledge the fact that some people, in good faith, present to those doctors and then find their medical benefits claims rejected on a random sampling basis. Hopefully, it will acknowledge these as serious problems. Hopefully, those problems are acknowledged in the appropriations for the Department of Community Services and Health-the dollars and cents that will be approved this morning, in a few minutes from now hopefully there will be, somewhere, an acknowledgment of the need to expand upon the work of Donohoe and Fluhrer, to parallel them and to pursue these phenomena in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I put that as a broad question to the Minister. I hope that the answer I get in these appropriations is more satisfactory than the answer I got a year ago. In other words, my question is: Have we moved forward? Is that progress acknowledged in the appropriations?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should start by acknowledging Senator McLean's interest in this subject. It is correct, as he has said, that a year ago he raised matters concerning the chronic fatigue syndrome. At that time I said that I too was well aware of this problem, as a friend of mine has contracted the disease. A vibrant, energetic, enthusiastic individual now lacks the energy to do menial household chores. It is shocking to see the decline. I fervently hope that she and her family can find a cure for it, as do her family. I have to admit, though, that at the moment I do not have an adviser who can give me a detailed breakdown on what the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) might be funding on research into this area. On that basis, I wonder whether the honourable senator will enable me to take on notice his question on the actual provision within the appropriations, or the relationship with this syndrome. I will reply to him in detail on that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator McLean has raised another matter. It concerned the use of chemicals that we, come into contact with in our daily lives. He cited a relationship that Mark Donohoe had found in his investigations between those chemicals and possibly the chronic fatigue syndrome. He referred to the forest service employee exposed to 2,4-D in Oregon. On the question of household chemicals and the claims of cancer risk, the Government and the National Health and Medical Research Council are, as we would expect, aware of the community interest in and concern about chemicals in the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> On 2 November the NHMRC met in Canberra and endorsed a uniform code of practice for the safe use of organochlorin termiticides. It is also proposing a new program for the training of pest control operators. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), in his science and technology statement in May this year, also announced the establishment of a special environmental toxicology unit which will further increase the capacity of the NHMRC to do research into environmental toxicology. Specifically, it will provide basic and applied research in public health toxicology, training of toxicologists at the post-graduate level, continuing education for relevant professionals, an information service, and an environmental health consulting service. That may take the answer as far as I can along the track of the concerns the honourable senator has raised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I asked the Department of Community Services and Health a number of questions which I placed on notice. I appreciate the long and detailed answers that I was given but I have two very short questions to ask. I asked a question about the number of hostel beds planned and the number of actual hostel beds. The answer I got included:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>However, recently enacted amendments to the relevant legislation will allow detailed quantification of approved and operational hostel beds . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It does not seem to me that the Department has been able to give me the number of actual beds. I would have thought-and I may be wrong-that this could have been worked out from the grants that are given to hostel residents. We ought to be able to know the number of actual beds in each State. Can the Minister answer that question? Is there a problem in being able to provide the number of actual hostel beds?</PARA>

The Department is unable to be certain about the number of beds being used by residents, the number of beds that might be used by staff, and how those interchange. However, we are in the throes of preparing legislation which will enable us to say specifically the number of beds being used by residents and we will be able to put a figure on that because it will provide a limitation. In order to try to give the honourable senator the best available information, I have asked the Department to give the honourable senator an approximate figure, rather than a hard figure, of the normal ratio or breakup-through general experience-of resident beds and staff beds. I am not sure whether the Department can do that, but it will look at that in a minute and I will supply the honourable senator with that information when it comes to hand.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think staff attract a subsidy from the Government for their beds. I think it is appalling that we do not know how many government-funded hostel beds there are. My second question to the Department was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Can the Department justify-</PARA>
<PARA>maybe I should have asked `Can the Government justify', but that would have been a political question-</PARA>
<PARA>the fact that older people in a small rural bush nursing home attract no subsidy at all. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask this question now of the Minister because the answer I received was:</PARA>
<PARA>Residents of small rural bush nursing homes do receive Commonwealth nursing home benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the second occasion on which the Department has taken me literally. Once before I asked a question and I got some figures on the day I asked the question; I did not get the up-to-date figures. Obviously, members of the Department took me literally here and I can understand that. Perhaps I should have said `small rural bush hospitals', as there is a difference. </PARA>
<PARA> I went to Merino, a small town in Victoria, where over 70 per cent of the population is over 65. They are serviced there by a small bush nursing hospital and eight people in that hospital receive the equivalent of nursing home care. They are subsidised there by their medical benefits fund. They are not acute hospital patients; they are long term patients. I think it is absolutely atrocious that old people in this area do not attract government subsidies. If they lived 20 or 50 miles down the road in a nursing home they would get that subsidy. They are not receiving the sort of care they should be, given that they have paid taxes all their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> Can the Minister tell me why the Minister for Housing and Aged Care, Mr Staples, cannot work out a creative way in which to fund those small bush nursing hospitals that are looking after long term patients? I know that we now have multipurpose centres but there will be only 14 in Australia and I bet my bottom dollar that that will not include the Merino Bush Nursing Hospital. The departmental officers should go and have a look at those patients who are being cared for there and they should look at the people who are receiving meals on wheels from that small bush nursing hospital. If the hospital closes they will receive their meals from the local pub but they will not get the same sort of attention, despite the publican's concern for them. When they suddenly look ill the nursing sister from the hospital goes down to visit them. A 92-year-old lady in that area goes in once a week for her meals on wheels; she has a spa; she is looked at by the nurse; she has an ulcer fixed up; and she has done whatever else might need to be done. I am sure from my visit that she is being kept out of a nursing home as a result of that care. </PARA>
<PARA> I really cannot understand why we cannot get our act together. Because Victoria has these small bush nursing hospitals that do not exist in other States we have a formula that does not fix this problem for those people. I would really like to know whether the Minister has any answers and whether we can have a more flexible system to deal with that issue. </PARA>

As a consequence, the Commonwealth is not directly involved in allocations to individual small bush nursing hospitals; that is a matter for each of the States to decide. Given the closeness to the ground of the departments of health in the States, I think that is an understandable provision. However, the honourable senator raised the matter of the multipurpose centres.

Does the Minister think it is fair and reasonable for elderly people in a small town like Merino to be deprived of a government subsidy for care which is adequate, appropriate and, I believe, of the same standard as nursing homes within the State and maybe have to move quite a long way from their own environment in order to receive a government subsidy? They will no longer be able to stay in their own community. Is that the sort of policy that this Government wants to pursue?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have only one question in this area. I was a member of Estimates Committee F and we had some complicated areas to handle but we did this all in committee. We wound it all up as satisfactorily as we could. My worry at the moment concerns the strategy proposal for the management of the pharmaceutical benefits program. We were unable to deal with this matter at the time of the Estimates hearings because we were unaware of it. The proposal, sent to all chemists by the Health Insurance Commission on 30 October, is to put computer hardware and software in all the dispensing chemists around Australia, the hardware being capable of taking magnetic tape cards for the purpose of monitoring patients' prescription entitlements. Apparently, this is a response to the Auditor-General's report which indicated an error rate of 40 per cent in determining entitlements to prescriptions. The Government's response to this is to institute a computerised checking system. I doubt very much whether there would be an error rate of 40 per cent in the present system. There may be quite a few clerical errors in the transcribing of numbers, for example, but that does not necessarily mean that people are not entitled to the benefits. If there were any cause for errors it could be delays in the Department of Social Security in the notification, for example, of dates for unemployment benefits stopping and starting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The black box, as it is called in the proposal that was sent around, to be installed as part of the existing chemists' computer set-up will be able to take the magnetic cards. This will lock the chemists into whatever system of administration the Government wants for its pharmaceutical benefits in the future-as though the Government has not enough problems with the chemists at the moment. The chemists will virtually have to act as a police force for the Government. They will have to verify the patient's identity and the patient's entitlement, and that verification will be checked with the central computer in Canberra. The system is not only for items on the pharmaceutical benefits list but also for items below $11, because they are involved in the safety net provisions of the administration of the pharmaceutical benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Although only about 10 per cent of the people are in requirement of medication at any one time, if we go for long enough we will eventually have everybody involved in this system, so an identity card is inevitable once the system gets under way. The important thing about it is that it is to be administered by the Health Insurance Commission. It was proposed that the Health Insurance Commission, which administers the Medicare card, should also administer the Australia Card when it was introduced. Of course, the Health Insurance Commission already has computer linkages to the Department of Social Security and, through the Department of Social Security, to the Australian Taxation Office. Many people, including me, see this as ominous. As the Committee knows, a double dissolution was called over the issue of the Australia Card. </PARA>
<PARA> I am aware that the Minister answered a question yesterday about the pharmaceutical benefits card being the Australia Card by the back door. He responded in high dudgeon, saying that no such thought had entered the Government's mind. But when we put the whole picture together we can see that the Minister may have protested too much. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of the invasion of privacy must be considered with this sort of thing because the Government will have on its central books a medication history of all of us. It will show not only a list of patients but also the prescribing pattern of all the prescribers and the medication pattern of all of the prescribees, which will, of course, give people in head office an opportunity to examine patterns. As has happened in other countries, if a doctor's figures are too high, if he is prescribing too many medications or prescribing medications that are too expensive according to the bureaucracy, he can be put on what is called a prescriber's budget. That is, if he prescribes more than a certain amount a month, the Government will not honour the prescriptions. If I were such a doctor's patient I would want to get in early in the month before he hit the limit of his prescriber's budget. This, of course, would decrease the quality of care. </PARA>
<PARA> I am apprehensive about the implementation of this strategy proposal for the management of the pharmaceutical benefits program simply because it involves a computer link from all the chemists shops throughout Australia to a central computer in Canberra. The new card will have a magnetic tape on it to which a lot of other information can be attached. Ostensibly, it is to be able to eradicate faults and errors in the system, but I think it is quite possible to eliminate errors with the current system. I do not think there is a 40 per cent error rate in that system. The Health Insurance Commission must have reacted with some glee to this Auditor-General's report, because it has given it the opportunity to bring in a computer system which is much like the Medicare card system and the previously proposed Australia Card system that would suit the purposes of the control of the pharmacists very well. As I said, when it is introduced it will lock the pharmacists into the Government's program and into any future alterations in the Government's proposal. I see it as a retrograde step. I ask the Minister to expand on the answer that he gave yesterday, without taking umbrage at the question. I ask him to explain why this is not the Australia Card through the back door. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will accept Senator Sheil's invitation. Before I turn to that matter, I acknowledge the remarks that Senator Peter Baume made before he left the chamber. I respect his point that the fact he is not pursuing questions in the Committee of the Whole does not mean that he does not have questions but he thinks it is appropriate to deal with them in the Estimates hearings. On that score I anticipate that in the next Estimates hearing, one of the issues that will be pursued will be the question of performance indicators, and the Department should be well and truly aware of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now turn to Senator Sheil's question. As honourable senators know, the question asked of me yesterday was asked by Senator Calvert. I promised Senator Calvert a fuller answer to the specific detail in his question. I am in a position now to give some detail, which may duplicate my answer to Senator Calvert. Nonetheless, I will keep my promise to Senator Calvert and give him the answer in due course. </PARA>
<PARA> The first point to make is that the Government rejects the idea that this is the Australia Card revisited, by the back door or whatever other categorisation people wish to put on it. It is true that there is an argument between the Government and the pharmacists about the level of pharmacy fees. That is notorious. It is in our newspapers daily and on our airwaves daily. It would be a pity though, when the Government is pursuing other efficiency changes in a related field, if the issue of dispute between the Government and the pharmacists were expanded to encompass that field when the intentions in that other field are innocent and, in fact, are complementary to the needs of pharmacists and assist with the requirements on government to act in this area. It is in that category, in the heat and dint of battle, that things are seized upon and used as arguments when in the cold, clear light of day they may not be. If there were no battle raging between the Government and pharmacists at this time, I suspect that this issue would not be alive. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a detailed brief on this matter, selected parts of which I will read. The Health Insurance Commission is not looking at an Australia Card but at redesigning processing systems for pharmaceutical claims to overcome, as Senator Sheil has rightly described them, inefficiencies identified by the Auditor-General. So it is in reaction to the Auditor-General's findings that action is occurring. He stimulated the initiation of this process. Pharmacists have always submitted details of scripts filled as part of the claiming process. Over 50 per cent of claims are now submitted in computer form with the full cooperation of the Pharmacy Guild as well as the provision of hard copies of all scripts. It is difficult to see how pharmacists could expect to be paid for dispensing without providing those details for the Commonwealth-axiomatic, I would have thought. All the Health Insurance Commission is doing is looking at how to improve the efficiency of that process. Indeed, one of the advantages is that it would facilitate prompter payment to pharmacists. </PARA>
<PARA> The HIC is holding discussions with the Guild on the proposed new system. The Government has made no decision on the proposals. It is waiting to look at the outcome of the consultations with the Guild before considering the proposal. While that process is going on the HIC has invited tenders on the basis of the proposal, which is subject to ministerial approval in the end. That does not in any way diminish the Government's commitment to conclude those consultations with the pharmacists properly. The present argument is one of the things that are pushing this off the agenda and preventing those consultations from being realised in the normal way. Tenders have been sought. That will enable, when we have an idea of the range of services that are available and the costs that might be involved, a ministerial decision to be made about the proposal in the light of all the information that can be garnered and that is necessary for a decision. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also not proposed to issue a card that contains the person's date of birth or sex for people who have paid for more than 25 prescriptions. A card is currently issued to persons who reach the maximum number of scripts so that they may obtain medicines free of charge for the remainder of the year. That procedure, I am advised, will continue. The application form for the card requires information such as name, date of birth and sex so as to appropriately identify the persons in respect of whom the entitlement is intended to apply. I think that may answer many of the concerns that Senator Sheil has, but if there are other matters I invite him to raise them or advise me of them and I will obtain information on them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister very much for his answer. It all sounds very innocuous. He explains that the scheme is in the process of implementation. But the instructions are that there will be no manually processed claims after January 1991. So the Government is moving ahead at quite a sharp clip with the implementation of this scheme. The scheme will be implemented as per this document that has been circulated. Although the Minister refers to negotiations with the chemists, the ones who have spoken to me about this matter are saying that it is a very one-sided negotiation and that they are more or less being told what they have to do to implement the Government's plan. Although the card has a magnetic tape on it and it is proposed to put only basic information on the tape, the capacity remains for other information to go on the tape.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> An enormous cost is involved in the hardware and software-an ongoing cost which the Government will pay-to install this material in the pharmacies. This shows a certain amount of keenness on the Government's part to get this system up and running. The danger remains that further information can be stored on the magnetic tape. There are connections between the Health Insurance Commission, the Department of Social Security and the Australian Taxation Office via computer linkages already. So my fears about the matter are not allayed by the Minister's explanation simply because the scheme is being introduced in this most innocuous manner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand Senator Sheil's sentiments. We are between a rock and a hard place with this matter. If we are dilatory in implementing the recommendations of the Auditor-General we get criticised for failing to perform properly. If we are not dilatory we are sometimes accused-as we are in this general public debate-of acting too hastily. It is a matter of judgment as to whether we have acted correctly. I concede that but I underline the fact that we are not proposing under this system to change the basis of the information that is sought. We are seeking the same information as was sought under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme which has operated for 30 years, and the Pharmpay system. It in no way alters the responsibility of the pharmacists under section 87 (3) (a) of the National Health Act to satisfy themselves that persons are entitled to pensioner or concessional status before supplying a benefit and so on. So in that sense it is a matter of efficiency. I guess that in modern debate, with ever improving and rapidly, exponentially expanding technology, the idea that a computer might be used rather than a more inefficient way is sometimes threatening to people, but this system is simply meant to be a more efficient way of doing things, according to the Auditor-General's report.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I place on record my acknowledgment of the efficiency with which the Department of Community Services and Health has responded to all but a few of the questions that I asked. As you know, Mr Temporary Chairman, having been Chairman of Estimates Committee F for some time, that has not always been the case. Answers have not always been readily forthcoming and have had to be re-asked of the Department. But on this occasion I feel that an acknowledgment of the efficiency of the Department should be placed on record. Whether that has been the result of a combination of the efforts of the Department and the efforts of the Minister for Resources and Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health (Senator Cook), or whether it is because of your weight as Chairman of Estimates Committee F, Mr Temporary Chairman, I do not know. Whatever the case, there has been a combination of factors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All is not totally well because a number of matters relating to the narrow area of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) have not been adequately answered. Frankly, the responses from the Department of Community Services and Health have not been adequate. The Committee secretariat had to wait an inordinate length of time before the list of the NHMRC recommended grants for 1990 was made available. The Budget contains millions and millions of dollars for NHMRC grants. This document came into my proud possession only very recently and that situation occurs almost every year. I do not think it appropriate that we should blindly endorse the global figure for expenditure under the medical research scheme without being informed as to who will receive the grants and what the grants are all about. </PARA>
<PARA> Policy decisions have obviously been taken by the NHMRC in respect of certain grants. Those policy issues relate to a number of areas, including the question of human embryo experimentation. This chamber established a Senate select committee on that subject that recommended that there be no destructive experiments on human embryos. This document appears to contain certain grants which, in the end, would lead to experimentation on human embryos. I might say that the Department, and presumably the NHMRC, failed to answer my question relevant to the Singer-Kuhre-Gase grant. I wanted to know whether the Department considered that the NHMRC funding of papers primarily intended to criticise the findings of the Senate Select Committee on Human Embryo Experimentation was appropriate expenditure of funds which were scarce in the medical research area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department also failed to inform the Committee of the number of unsuccessful applications for NHMRC grants. The excuse was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister has not been informed by the Council-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the NHMRC-</PARA>
<PARA>of how many projects considered worthy of support were unsuccessful in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not an adequate answer and the Minister for Resources knows that as well as I do. Parliament should be given the number of unsuccessful worthy applicants in 1990 so that it can make a judgment about appropriateness or whether sufficient funds were going to these researchers. There are two ways that we can do this. I suppose that I could spend half a day, which I do not want to, going through this matter and asking the Minister questions about various details. The other way to go about it is to ask the Minister whether he will give an undertaking to the Committee-I have done this on a previous occasion, so I am not doing anything new-that the questions I asked about the details of the applications and their evaluation and the two questions to which I referred just a moment ago can be responded to very quickly. </PARA>

Recently I had the good fortune to attend, as a representative of my Party, a meeting in Geneva, the principal subject matter of which was a discussion about the developments in eastern Europe. In the course of that meeting I had the opportunity to have discussions with people from Hungary and from the German Democratic Republic who have been involved with the movements for democracy there and in endeavouring to form social democratic parties to contest the free and fair elections which we all hope are forthcoming.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While I welcome the changes that have occurred in those countries in eastern Europe and have some optimism that they will continue, I want to refer to some of the consequential questions. I, like everybody in the Senate, support the moves that are being initiated for economic assistance to smooth the transition to democracy in those countries. It is quite clear that in those countries, as elsewhere, economics has been driving politics. One of the significant issues is the extent to which Mr Gorbachev has understood that point and Deng Xiaoping has not. The point I want to make is a very important one. It was raised several times at the meeting which I attended-particularly by representatives of Third World countries, but not only by them-that it is very important that, in looking at the question of providing economic assistance for the development of those countries and their economies, the money is not diverted from what would otherwise be the aid budget provided to developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Willy Brandt, who chaired the meeting which I attended, raised the matter. It was also raised, I noticed recently, by Russell Rollason, the General Secretary of the Australian Council for Overseas Aid. Willy Brandt said at that meeting-and I think he was correct-that the poorest people in the world should not fund the transition to democracy in eastern Europe. If financial assistance has to be supplied, it should not be at the expense of the poorest people in the poorest countries. It is important that that assistance is provided, and Australia has a very small part to play in that. I do not want to exaggerate our role. We have a very small economy and we are a long way from Europe and we have many other commitments, but we have made some small and appropriate commitments. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not a time to be mean spirited. It is obvious that there are limits to the amount of financial assistance any country can give and the extent to which that can be additional to its other financial commitments. But I am very satisfied with the initiatives that the Australian Government has announced so far. We are not the first on the list of those who should contribute. I welcome the fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) is proposing to visit those countries. I also welcome the statements made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). But I want to put the matter in context: there are other vital transitions to democracy going on around the world. Media coverage in Australia, and in Europe when I visited it, is very Eurocentric. There is not the same amount of interest taken in the fact that there is a fundamental transition to democracy taking place in Chile this year and that its economy will need a lot of assistance if that democracy is to continue. Because it is not next door to Europe and does not get easy access to all the major European news networks, it is not a big issue, either in Australia or in Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> In our region, I refer to the economic changes in Vietnam and the optimism we have for potential change in Cambodia. I am not talking about any particular proposal, or the current disagreement that might exist between the parties in this chamber about the best thing we can do in the short term to assist. But those movements for change are under way and we must keep the matter in perspective. If Burma-or Myanmar, as it is now known-were on the border of Austria or West Germany instead of being where it is, it would have made the front pages instead of Prague. I think Australia has to keep a sense of perspective about the importance of the change in eastern Europe. I do not mean in any way to downplay it; there is no more important change going on anywhere in the world, and I welcome it with enthusiasm. </PARA>

As Senator Calvert said, democracy is spreading to a number of countries in which it has been denied for a very long time, and we should all welcome that. The people trying to introduce it often need our assistance. It is a time for generosity. I simply reiterate that that generosity should not be at the expense of the poorest of the poor-the poorest people in the poorest countries. It should not be at the expense of the already stretched aid budgets in Australia and in other countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It should not be the responsibility of the poor people in Asia and Africa to smooth the transition to democracy. They are paying the economic price; they do not have the political benefit. If we feel that that assistance should be provided, it is up to us to put the argument to our taxpayers and for the countries of western Europe and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development to put the arguments to their taxpayers as to why it should be done. I believe they would respond favourably because they appreciate the importance of what is happening. I simply want to put on the record something that I think has not been addressed sufficiently in this country-that is, assistance should be provided but not at the expense of the very important contributions that we and others need to make to the economic development of other countries and in some instances their struggle for or transition to democracy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly about a matter raised with me this morning by Mr Robert Perry, the proprietor of one of the eight privately owned family circuses in Australia. By way of background, they employ about 3,000 people and have been part of our culture in Australia for many years. They have, as my colleague Senator Bjelke-Petersen would know, provided family entertainment around Australia, including in our remote country areas, for many years. I inform the Senate, as President of the Royal Agricultural Society of Tasmania, that the Royal Hobart Show has recently concluded. At that show, one of the attractions was a family circus which was free of charge for the people of Hobart. It was very well received and many young people, and old people too, gained a lot of enjoyment from it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I noted on Tuesday of this week that the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray), in reply to a user-friendly question from Senator McMullan, who has just left the chamber, made some comments about the proposed visit to Australia by the Moscow Circus. The Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Department has decided to grant visas for the tour and I see no reason to interfere with that decision. </PARA>
<PARA>On that same day, in Melbourne, I believe, Mr Hoffman from the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs met with representatives of the circuses, Mr Michael Edgley, the Director of Michael Edgley International, the Showman's Guild of Australasia and Actors Equity. The reason for that meeting, of course, was to raise concerns as to the effect that the visit of the Moscow Circus to major country centres may have on the eight family circuses which currently service these areas in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to put on record straight away that I have no argument with the Moscow Circus; in fact, I agree with what Senator Ray said about it. I think it will be wonderful for the people of Australia to be able to visit the Moscow Circus and see its wonderful performers. I quote what the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>People in country areas will be thrilled to hear that they will see these internationally renowned performers. The capital cities loss, in fact, will be the country cities gain. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not argue with that, nor do I argue with the following comment by the Minister:</PARA>
<PARA> It will bring joy to hundreds of thousands of Australians in provincial areas. In the long run I doubt that it will do any damage to the Australian circus industry. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that is the case, because I am concerned about the effect it may have on the viability of Australian circuses. I am already led to believe that, as a result of the fact that people know that the Moscow Circus will visit some of these provincial towns, one circus that is currently in north Queensland has suffered a 30 per cent loss of patronage because people are holding back, knowing that the Moscow Circus is coming. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier today I raised with Senator Cook whether any special quarantine deals had been done with the Moscow Circus. I am pleased to say that he assured me that no favoured treatment would be given to the Moscow Circus and no quarantine laws would be breached. That was one of the concerns that were raised with me by the circus people. I do find it unusual that visas were granted on Tuesday, I believe. They may have been granted last week, but the Minister made note of it on Tuesday. I have been told that Michael Edgley's company has spent about $4m on advertising and has already sold 50,000 seats. It begs the question as to whether Michael Edgley may have been given assurances from the Immigration Department beforehand. I find it rather unusual, to say the least, that a person with his business acumen would spend $4m and sell 50,000 seats before he had obtained visas from the Department. I will be asking the Minister at a future date whether the Government did give a favourable nod to Michael Edgley International with regard to the arrival of this circus. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that at the meeting that was held with the different parties a slight concession was made in an effort to allay the fears of the circuses. The slight concession made was that two shows have been dropped-one in Mount Isa and one in Darwin. I do not wish to be cynical, but one would have to say that that was a very slight concession. I also note that, as a result of that meeting, Senator Ray stated that Mr Edgley had agreed to share costs with Australian circuses of a research study into the impact of the Moscow Circus on the local circus industry. What happens if that study proves that there has been a significant financial impact on Australian circuses? It will be too late at that stage. Who will pay the wages? It is feared that some of these Australian circuses will go to the wall, thus denying the remote areas of Australia entertainment which perhaps is not up to the standard of the Moscow Circus, but which nevertheless has formed a very important part of our cultural heritage over many years. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that I have raised these concerns today because I believe it should be put on the record that eight family circuses could be forced into unusual financial circumstances because of a lack of consultation at an early date prior to the visit by the Moscow Circus. I hope, like many others, that I will be able to visit this wonderful circus, the Moscow Circus. However, I hope that its visit will not have any detrimental effect on existing circuses in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the last parliamentary recess it was my pleasure to be part of a parliamentary delegation to Canada. I wish to give a short report on that visit. Canadian parliamentarians have made two visits to Australia, the last being when they came to present the Speaker's chair for the House of Representatives in our new Parliament House. A report from the High Commissioner's office in Ottawa stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The visit to Canada of an Australian parliamentary delegation from November 1-12 was seen to be an unqualified success. The effort and generosity expended by the Canadian hosts ensured a smooth programme which allowed for an enhanced understanding of the range of issues currently dominating the Canadian political agenda. </PARA>
<PARA>The delegation comprised four members of the House of Representatives and me as the only senator and the only woman member of the delegation. The leader of the delegation was the Hon. Barry Cohen, the Labor member for Robertson in New South Wales, and the deputy leader was Mr James Porter, the Liberal member for Barker in South Australia. Mr John Mountford, the Labor member for Banks in New South Wales, Mr Warwick Smith, the Liberal member for Bass in Tasmania, and me, as the Senate representative-National Party, Queensland-were the other delegates. Despite our differing political opinions in the Australian Parliament, we worked together very harmoniously to represent Australia to our Canadian hosts. </PARA>
<PARA> The delegation had the opportunity to observe Canadian political processes at work in both the Federal and the provincial political arenas. The visit occasioned a fruitful exchange of views and experiences across a wide range of subjects. The most prominent topics were constitutional reform in Canada, the environment, native affairs, trade and economic policies, and budget issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Our visit commenced in British Columbia. We visited the seat of government in Victoria, the capital of that province, and met with members of the provincial parliament. We were informed that the British Columbia economy is in great shape, with a balanced budget. However, they felt that their most important issue was that of the environment and the problems cause by oil spills. Another important factor mentioned by the British Columbia politicians was their distance from the heart of Federal Government, in Ottawa. However, they would not be further from their national capital than our Western Australian members and senators are from Canberra, and I suppose the same would apply to our representatives from the Northern Territory and, indeed, north Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA> The delegation noticed many similarities between Australia and Canada, one of which is the vastness of our two countries. However, where ours in many places is dry and arid, Canada is in a cold region, with many parts of the land being frozen wastes, particularly in winter time. We saw plenty of snow when we visited Banff National Park during the first weekend of our visit, but as it was November, that was to be expected. The area of the Banff National Park is 22,000 square kilometres and there are 2,000 elk and 100 grizzly bears in the area. We saw plenty of elk but missed out on the grizzly bears; perhaps that was just as well. Tourism is worth $625m to the Province of Alberta, in which Banff National Park is situated. </PARA>
<PARA> Alberta Province is most anxious to see a different method of senator appointment. At present, Canadian senators are selected from all provinces by the Prime Minister after the provinces provide a list of names. Until recently, if one were fortunate enough to be selected as a senator in Canada, one could rest assured that one had a job for life. However, the age limit has now been brought back to 75 years-which, of course, in some cases might be a job for life. However, Alberta and some of the other provinces believe that senators should be elected and not selected. They talk about the EEE option: elected, equal, and effective. Alberta Province maintains that there should be an equal voice for all the provinces at the national level. </PARA>
<PARA> I told the Speaker's luncheon in Ottawa that in Australia our senators are elected on an equal, State basis, but that it is up to the electors of Australia to decide how effective they are. I guess we will know about that after the next election. In Canada equal representation seems to be a sticking point because of the maritime provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and particularly Prince Edward Island, which have small populations. Many people believe that it is hard to justify representation for these provinces being equal to that of the larger provinces of Quebec and Ontario. Perhaps we could apply that same system in Australia. Some people do. In fact, a member of our delegation said very strongly that he did not believe that the smaller States should have Senate representation which is equal to that of the larger States. </PARA>
<PARA> We spent three days in Ottawa meeting with Federal members and, whilst we were there, the House of Commons was sitting. We were able to sit in during Question Time and our leader was recognised by the Speaker and applauded. Members used to bang on their desks in the Canadian Parliament to signify approval of what had been said but, with the advent of television, applause to signify approval has taken over. `Hear, hear' seems to be the best sign of approval that we can muster in our Australian Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The proceedings of Parliament in Canada are televised for general viewing. The cost is $1.4m per year. All the sittings of the House of Commons are televised, not only Question Time. Television coverage is used to provide an electronic Hansard. However, I point out that the proceedings of the Canadian Senate are not televised. The Canadian Privileges Committee is looking at opening up the guidelines for television. It is looking at extending the televising of the work of committees-which is already televised within Parliament House-to general television. Members of the committees, of course, think this is a wonderful idea but the Cabinet Ministers are not quite so sure about the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The participation of the delegation in a public meeting of the House of Commons Standing Committee on the Environment proved to be an almost textbook example of the useful exchange of information facilitated by such parliamentary visits. Members of the Committee evinced strong interest in Australian environmental protection strategies. Of particular note was the enthusiasm expressed by some members of the Committee for the Australian initiative on the protection of Antarctica. I mention also that quite a number of children from a nearby college had come in to listen to the public meeting of the House of Commons Committee on the Environment. I think it was probably quite a useful discussion from their point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> The delegation paid a visit to Quebec and also called on the Lieutenant Governor of the Province. He told us much of the history of the Province of Quebec, which was settled in 1608 by the French. Australia, of course, was settled some years after that. However, in 1759 General Wolfe and the English Army defeated the French General Montcalm and his men. However, the Lieutenant Governor pointed out that in 1812 the French and English combined to defeat the Americans, so Quebec remained part of the British possession of Canada. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a great debate going on at present in Quebec about the use of French as the main language, even to the extent of having all road signs in French only. Back in 1792 there was a debate about the language to be used in Quebec, as the people of French ancestry believed that French should be the language of the province. There is no doubt that Quebec is a very historical city, and province, and the Moech Lake accord at present being discussed by the Premiers of all the provinces is centred around the desire of the French to have their language recognised, but to still be an integral part of the country of Canada. The more objective English speaking Canadians have no objection to the French Canadians desiring to preserve their language, culture and identity, but urge that English speaking Canadians seek to defend and preserve their heritage. </PARA>
<PARA> The delegation also visited Toronto, the provincial capital of Ontario, a city of four million people. We called on the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario whose headquarters are in Parliament House. The proceedings of the Parliament of Ontario are also televised, so that people in the Province of Ontario can choose to view the Federal or the provincial parliaments on television-perhaps they choose neither. Cable channels take the television broadcasts and during the evening Question Time is replayed on various television channels. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the many discussions taking place in Canada is about a proposed goods and services tax. While I was there the Prime Minister, Mr Brian Mulroney, and the Premiers of all the provinces met in Ottawa for an economic conference. The Prime Minister has proposed that a 9 per cent goods and services tax be introduced in 1991. Apparently, the Premiers of the provinces do not like the Prime Minister's idea at all. A newspaper article stated that the Premiers, at least publicly, were opposed to this goods and services tax and to high interest rates. It sounds a bit like the debate in Australia at present. They urged the Government to get its own spending in order before taking it out of the pockets of Canadians. </PARA>

<PARA>I think that a message like that should be sent to the Government that is in power in Canberra at present.

But it has 10 provinces and a territory, compared to Australia's six States and two Territories.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an omnibus Bill designed to correct deficiencies due to lack of foresight and sloppy drafting. It contains amendments to correct a major blunder in the drafting of the Australian Industry Development Corporation Amendment Bill which created the company known as AIDC Ltd. There is an amendment to the Bounty (Ships) Act, and minor amendments to the Designs Act and the Trade Marks Act, and amendments to some administrative provisions of the Patents Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is very interesting, in relation to the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC), that this was the Government's first tentative step into privatisation. Senator Button, who regularly gives industry a serve for its failure to be sufficiently efficient, et cetera, and who was given a decent serve on the front page of the Australian today, and yesterday in the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) reports, is responsible for this failure to be efficient in relation to the floating of AIDC Ltd. As a result of not getting it right, a prospectus was issued for the float of AIDC Ltd which, under the legislation that then existed, was wrong. This legislation attempts to correct that deficiency. The float has not been a success. The shares were placed at $2 each and since then their value has dropped to about $1.75 to $1.80. </PARA>
<PARA> What went wrong was that there was a most peculiar provision whereby there was the creation of what were called `non-transferring assets and liabilities'. The proposal was that although they would remain in the ownership of the Corporation-if I can call it that, as opposed to the new company-these assets and liabilities would be transferred to the subsidiary public company for tax purposes. In other words, the Corporation would continue to own the assets but they would be treated as assets of the new company for tax purposes. The only trouble was that it seems that the Government forgot about the tax Act and, as a result, what was proposed did not work. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones), who introduced this Bill into the House of Representatives, skated over this total blunder by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>It has now become apparent that the earlier amendments to the AIDC Act fell short of achieving the result. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a nice, euphemistically worded manner of excusing a blunder. The bungle did not end there. The Corporation's staff were transferred to AIDC Ltd, but not the powers of the Chief Executive or, indeed, the government guarantee. What is proposed is that while the subsidiary company-the public company, AIDC Ltd-is not guaranteed, the original corporation, the AIDC itself, will act as the borrowing vehicle for the company. The Government has decided to continue the Commonwealth guarantee of AIDC until 1 July 1994 to avoid uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at that muck-up, one cannot help but realise why our policy to privatise the AIDC totally is the only way to go. Of course, the Government has gone through this nonsense because of the power of its back bench to prevent the Government implementing reasonable policies in this area. We had another example of that this week. The Government has clearly reached the stage where it is no longer making decisions to govern this country; it can only make decisions subject to the power of its own back bench, which has been given a veto right in certain areas. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the amendment to the Bounty (Ships) Act, this amendment will expand the maximum size limit of bountiable vessels from 10,000 gross construction tonnes to 20,000 gross construction tonnes. Once again, the Minister skated over the reason for this amendment. The Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The reason for the proposed amendment is that conditions for shipbuilders have changed rapidly in the recent past with an improvement in the competitive position of local builders. There is now evidence that certain shipbuilders can be competitive in the international market in the size range of 15,000 gct to 20,000 gct with bounty at the rate of 15 per cent of construction costs. </PARA>
<PARA>That is another example of this Government trying to pick winners. The IAC, in its reports presented yesterday-which, as I say, gave Senator Button a decent serve-was quoted on the front page of today's Australian, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Positive assistance measures which have flourished under the Minister for Industry, Senator Button, should be thoroughly reviewed from an industry-wide perspective. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Government: Why is it raising the level to just 20,000 gross construction tonnes? I do not think there is much chance of an Australian shipbuilder building a ship larger than 20,000 gross construction tonnes, but if it has this bounty, why bother to put an upper limit on it? If some shipbuilder in Australia could manage to get a contract for a 25,000 or 30,000 gross construction tonnes vessel, is this Government saying that it would not give that company a bounty?' Of course it would. If it is prepared to give Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd a $36m grant, why would it not give a bounty to any company which could build a ship larger than 20,000 tonnes? It is nonsense to impose an upper limit. Once again, it demonstrates that this Government under Minister Button is involved in picking winners. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some minor amendments to the Designs Act and the Trade Marks Act. I will talk about one of those amendments in the committee stage, because I will move an amendment, which the Government accepts, in relation to the use of the words `Designs Office'. I will also ask the Government-I hope the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) has been briefed-about the two matters raised by the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, which raised two concerns about the Designs Act. </PARA>

<PARA> Page 6, clause 19, proposed subsection 11 (2), line 7, leave out `` `Designs Office' or''. </PARA>
<PARA>My amendment deletes the words `Designs Office' from subclause (2) of clause 11 of the Bill. The reason for the deletion is that, if this amendment were not carried, someone who placed on their office building or door the words, `Designs Office', would be committing a criminal offence. I can understand that the Government would object to someone having on their office door or building the words, `Office for registering designs'. That seems to me to be clearly an offence. But when the Government-or, I suspect, the draftsman-says, `People cannot have the words ``Designs Office'' on their doors', that is a case of trying to limit ordinary English usage to some special government purpose. Shipyards, architects' offices, engineering offices, fashion houses-all sorts of offices-could have an area designated as a designs office. It is my view that, under the legislation as it stands, they would be committing an offence. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, of course, got its usual advice from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. It fascinates me that these people say, `Don't worry about that; no-one would prosecute someone for putting these words on the door of their office unless they were attempting to do something wrong in relation to the patents office'. Mr McKenzie, the Senior Assistant Parliamentary Counsel, has said:</PARA>
<PARA> In my opinion, the new section 11 would not prevent a person from describing an office where designs are produced within his or her factory or other business as a Designs Office. </PARA>
<PARA> He then says in effect that the person, in any event, if he or she were charged, would be able to bring forward a successful defence. I suggest to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and to the Government that that is not the way to go about enacting laws in this country. The Government should not create a situation where people who do something which is quite common and which in no way contains any criminal connotation commit a criminal offence under an Act of parliament. The only advice the Government can get is, `You don't need to worry about that because they probably wouldn't be prosecuted anyway. If they were prosecuted, they would have a defence that they could raise before the court'. I put it to the Committee that that is a most improper way of legislating in Australia. It is for that reason that I press my amendment to delete these words from the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill principally amends the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, the Family Law Act 1975 and the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976. The purpose of the amendments is to remove the control of the administration of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), the Federal Court and the Family Court from the Attorney-General's Department and make the Tribunal and the two courts responsible for their own administration, in much the same way as the High Court has been managing its own day-to-day affairs for some years. The Opposition supports the Bill as it will contribute to efficient resource management and flexibility in the administration of these bodies. We note that the President of the AAT and the chief judges of both courts support the proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the provisions of the Bill the President of the Tribunal and the chief judges of the courts will be responsible for administration. They will have a wide range of powers in relation to the administration of their respective bodies, including the power to enter into contracts up to $250,000 in value without the Minister's consent. They will also be responsible for ensuring that proper records are kept. They will be assisted, in the case of the AAT and the Federal Court, by a registrar. In the Family Court the equivalent position will be that of chief executive officer, as the court already has registrars and deputy registrars who fulfil quasi-judicial functions. The registrars and the chief executive officer will have similar powers and duties except that the chief executive officer will not have functions or powers in relation to proceedings before the court. </PARA>
<PARA> The registrars and chief executive officer will be statutory officers appointed by the Governor-General. The equivalent positions are currently Public Service ones but it is felt that making them statutory officers will enhance the independent nature of the bodies. We concur with that view. The term of appointment will be five years. The registrars and the chief executive officer will have significant powers and duties, such as the power to engage consultants. In effect, they will have the same relationship with the staff of the court who remain Commonwealth public servants as the departmental secretary does with departmental staff. The senior and responsible nature of the job is underlined by several provisions in the Bill, for example, those which prevent these officeholders from engaging in outside paid employment without the consent of the Chief Judge or the President of the Tribunal, and those requiring the disclosure of pecuniary interests. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of financial accountability is addressed by the introduction of reporting requirements similar to those applying to the High Court under the High Court of Australia Act. The AAT and the courts will have to submit a report on the management of their administrative affairs and also financial statements which must have been inspected by the Auditor-General. The Attorney-General is to table the annual report in both Houses of Parliament. Estimates of proposed expenditure must be approved by the Minister and no expenditure is to be made except in accordance with the approved estimates. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also makes various consequential amendments such as an amendment to the Australian Security Intelligence Act so that the registrar of the AAT will be among the eligible classes of persons who can be appointed registrar of the Security Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> We welcome this Bill as a timely effort to improve the efficiency of the operations of the AAT, the Federal Court and the Family Court. Australians are becoming increasingly concerned about delays in the court process and the critical effect that these delays can have on the administration of justice, although I think it can fairly be said that delays in the State courts have more severely plagued the administration of justice than in Federal courts. This Bill is also timely in the sense that the Senate is currently inquiring into the costs of justice. It is becoming increasingly apparent that the courts are accessible only to the very rich and the very poor and are simply out of reach for the vast majority of ordinary Australians. It is to be hoped that the measures such as are contained in this Bill, with its emphasis on accountability and efficient management, will help to ameliorate the situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lewis has quoted from some passage in the IAC report on international trade in services and, of course, he has chosen the passage which says that the Government initiatives are too modest. One might put that another way by saying `too slow'. The first point I want to make is that this Government has taken initiatives which were never taken by conservative governments in their 27 years in government and the absence of any initiatives taken by conservative governments has led to vastly increased pressure for micro-economic reform at the present time. The fact that initiatives have been taken is very important. I concede the point that might well be made in a supplementary question that a country like Australia has to measure itself against competitive pressures generated by trading partners, and so on, and not measure itself solely against the past. If one measured oneselves solely against the past, when we had 27 years of Liberal government, we would be doomed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the attention of the Minister for Resources been drawn to an advertisement by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) in yesterday's Canberra Times condemning mortality rates amongst sheep involved in the live sheep trade with Saudi Arabia?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that it gives me no joy to criticise an organisation as respected as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. That organisation rightly enjoys a high level of public esteem. However, yesterday it placed an advertisement in the Canberra Times headed `Export Trade in Live Sheep Condemned'. The first error in the advertisement was to say that figures had been obtained from my office, with such figures being used to justify some of the copy set out later in the advertisement. The RSPCA did not obtain any information from my office, and there is no record of anyone from that organisation even making an inquiry about those figures. The second error in the advertisement is that it says that there is a 6.55 per cent death rate for sheep in the trade, relating to mortalities at sea only. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Transportation from farm to ship, loading and unloading deaths have not been included.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that it is not the national body but the Australian Capital Territory body; I was going to make that point in a minute. The voyage mortalities were less than 2 per cent. The actual figure was 1.87 per cent, not 6.55 per cent as alleged. That is at about or slightly below the average for voyage mortalities in this trade. Circumstances where a higher number of sheep than usual died arose because, after the rejection of the carriers, there was a need to discharge and to transit between various ports in the Persian Gulf. Because of that extended and longer period and the interference in the normally expected flow of trade, there was a higher death rate. I might say that the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has advised, and maintains a requirement, that ships sailing to the Gulf with live sheep should carry with them extra water and feed in case there are any obstacles in unloading the sheep.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the reasons why the Government has suspended the trade to the Persian Gulf is our concern about the possibility of sheep dying and our having regard to the question of the natural protection of the rights of sheep. That is one of the key reasons why the Government moved early on to suspend the trade. It is regrettable that the RSPCA did not check with me, and it is regrettable that this appears to be the effort of just the local group. I understand that the national body of the RSPCA is involved in discussions with the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation. I hope those discussions produce a result which enables the issue to be cleared up, with the RSPCA's rightful and legitimate concerns about cruelty to animals protected. I think in this case there has been an oversimplification, an over-reaction, which does not reflect a great deal of credit on the people who presented the advertisement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications. I refer to yesterday's scathing condemnation by the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) of the pace of micro-economic reform in the telecommunications arena. Does the Government agree that the areas of monopoly reserved services for Telecom Australia, particularly its infamous first phone monopoly, `appear to extend beyond those basic areas of service required to meet the social policy objective'? Does the Government agree with the IAC that `the extra cost of domestic telecommunications arising through its regulation will be built into the cost structure of virtually every Australian activity, both services and goods, whether internationally traded or not' and that `ultimately the competitiveness of virtually every Australian industry will be adversely affected'? In view of the dramatic urgency spelt out so clearly by the IAC, when will the Government stop pandering to the anti-competition forces in Caucus and release the study by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics, which the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Willis, in typical form, has been sitting on for almost three months?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have noted the IAC report and will bear its conclusions with such fortitude as we can command, as we have often had to do in the past. The IAC has drawn conclusions of various kinds about the pace of micro-economic reform. We are conscious of the need for that. In May 1988, when I was Minister, we made the most sweeping and comprehensive collections of reforms in the telecommunications industry that this country has seen. With Austel as an independent regulator coming into existence in recent months, we have the machinery through which there can be continued careful and assiduous attention paid on the basis of proper analytical inquiry to such further reform as proves to be justified in the future. The particular question of the study on community service obligations is under close current consideration by the Government and I have no doubt that Mr Willis will be making an appropriate statement in due course.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator REYNOLDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Giles for her question, which gives me the opportunity to comment on the great success with which the Affirmative Action Agency has been able to work with private sector companies over the last two years. It also gives me an opportunity to make some positive statements and to name companies in a positive light in this chamber. We know that there was publicity last week about those companies that had not complied. Of course, media attention was given to that negative aspect of the failure to meet the requirements of the affirmative action legislation. Today, I want to turn the argument around and to focus on and name companies that are making very good progress, particularly in relation to child-care. This matter is very topical and very much of interest to many, many Australians, men and women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Twenty-one reports have been identified as having mentioned child-care and they fall loosely into four categories. First, there are reports which say that consultation on child-care has occurred and will continue or that research has been or will be conducted. These companies include the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, Utah Minerals, Woodside Petroleum, Uncle Bens, Digital, Ansett Transport Industries, McCain Foods, Berrivale Orchards, Arthur Young, Peat Marwick Hungerfords, and the Capita Financial Group. Then there are companies which have done more extensive work in terms of examining the feasibility of setting up child-care facilities-that is, they are just on the brink of establishing their facilities-and this group includes Johnson and Johnson. I would like to take the time of the Senate to read the following comment from Johnson and Johnson's report:</PARA>
<PARA> In 1989 a report was completed on child-minding facilities for the company showing us the options open to us when moving in this direction. The result of the report was to establish a resource file for each of our sites, of the child-mining facilities available in the local area. During 1989 the Personnel Department at each site is required to look at the option of establishing a child-care facility either by ourselves or in partnership with other companies or community groups. The results of this survey will be included in our 1990 report.</PARA>
<PARA>Then there are companies, including Nippondenso and Northern Star Holdings, that have actually decided to set up a child-care centre. Finally, there are companies which mention that they have already set up child-care facilities. Those companies include Ford Australia and Lend Lease.</PARA>
<PARA> While the emphasis in relation to affirmative action implementation has been to focus on companies that have not complied, I think it is very important to take whatever opportunity we can to commend the overwhelming majority of companies that are doing so. Attitudes are changing and these companies are considering a whole range of options including, as I have identified here today, child-care. We look forward to more companies taking the lead from these companies that have shown the way.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator for drawing attention to the article in the trade journal Paper concerning the company called ANKAL Pty setting up a kenaf pulp mill in Texas. Since I have been Minister, numerous proposals to set up kenaf mills in Australia have floated by me. All of them, I am sure, were about the market potential of their product and all of them were only sure about one thing-that they would need substantial government assistance to set them up. I was aware that this company was looking at the possibility of setting up a mill in the United States. I was certainly not aware that any final decision had been made about that. The same company had looked at the possibility of establishing a facility in the Burdekin area of north Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Sanders asked me what process the plant will use. The article to which he referred mentioned that the soda or soda anthraquinone process is to be used. I am unable to say any more than is stated in the article to which the honourable senator referred. With regard to the question about assistance from government, of course, I am unable to say whether this company has had any assistance from other government instrumentalities in any way, but it certainly has not had any from my portfolio. I make the point that Senator Sanders referred in his question to the fact that the Government is currently drawing up guidelines for bleached eucalypt kraft mills. These mills will provide an opportunity to add value to wood chips currently being exported. The kraft process was identified by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) as the appropriate technology for producing pulp from mature eucalypt chips. The guidelines, which will be coming before the Government soon, will be very stringent and, when the Government has considered them, an announcement will be made about them.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as the other aspects of the question are concerned regarding the company Ankal, I am unable to add any further information. In relation to its report on kraft mills, CSIRO has indicated that when efficiently operated they will result in no significant short term ecological impact, but that is a matter which can be discussed when the guidelines are brought down.</PARA>

I refer to various media reports about the establishment by the Australian Telecommunications Authority (Austel) of a register of people who do not want to continue to receive junk advertising. I note that in its report Junk Fax Austel calls on advertisers voluntarily to consult the register to avoid sending messages to those who do not want to receive them.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The background to this matter is that, in view of the rising concern over the transmission of unsolicited facsimile material, Mrs Kelly requested Austel to undertake an investigation to determine the full extent of the problem and its implications. She announced the outcome of the investigation by Austel into junk fax-or unsolicited facsimile messages-on 26 November. That report concludes that the cost and inconvenience of junk fax is not a significant problem at this stage, but has the potential to develop into a real problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report recommends that Austel establish and promote a voluntary register of persons not wishing to receive junk fax, that an advertiser should voluntarily consult that register with a view to avoiding sending messages to those who do not want to receive them and that advertisers using facsimiles be encouraged to voluntarily limit advertisements to one A4 size page, if necessary inviting the recipient to solicit further information. Further, it recommends that Austel monitor the incidence of junk fax and report by 15 November 1991 whether any, and if so what, further control is required.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has accepted all these recommendations and has asked Austel to implement them as soon as possible. Both Austel and the Government expect that the majority of advertisers will comply with the requirement that they consult the register of persons not wishing to receive junk fax to avoid sending messages to people who do not wish to receive them. The Government will review the appropriateness of these controls when Austel reports to it again in November 1991.</PARA>

Is the Minister aware that the report of the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) on government (non-tax) charges released yesterday finds that Queensland has achieved the most consistent productivity growth in its electricity generation industry during the period 1975-76 to 1987-88 among all the States, particularly in the period following the famous South East Queensland Electricity Board dispute, when the then Government of Queensland turned on the lights which the trade union associates of Mr Goss in that State had been trying to turn off? Is he further aware that the IAC attributes this superior performance largely to changes in management practices including, particularly, the level of manning at all levels of the industry, and the increasing use of contract labour to carry out repairs?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am generally familiar with the report of the IAC on government (non-tax) charges in the sense that I have read a brief summary of it, but that brief summary has not taken me to the particular question of the South East Queensland Electricity Board. However, one thing that is certain is that if the productivity of the Queensland electricity board has improved-and one must welcome that-it stands out like a glowing beacon in that morass of government confusion and corruption which exists in Queensland. There is always an exception which proves the rule and perhaps the Queensland electricity board is the exception.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For example, I know that levels of investment in Queensland are lower than in any other State. Levels of investment in Queensland are lower than in any other State because people have to put something into a brown paper bag to get the approval of Government Ministers in order to make an appropriate investment in that State. The whole ethos of government in Queensland has been so low that people are prepared to put their money where their mouths are. The only people who have put their money there are those who have invested in the tourist industry on which even the Queensland Government of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen and others could not put the sun out. That investment followed more from the weather conditions in Queensland than from the Government. If the Queensland Government has to have an obituary written about it, which it will have soon, there will be one chapter in that obituary-if the information in Senator Stone's question is correct-which says, `In spite of all these other chapters, the Government did well in this little area'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a supplementary question, Mr President. In view of the Minister's rhetoric, can I ask him how he explains the fact that, in the last 12 months, Queensland has displayed the fastest rate of job growth in any State in the Commonwealth with, in the last financial year, the rate of immigration into Queensland to take up these jobs amounting to 45,300 people, most of whom were fleeing Victoria and New South Wales?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I do not believe what Senator Stone says is correct. I do not believe that Queensland has the highest record for job growth in the past 12 months. I think that is quite incorrect. Senator Stone will probably find that the highest record for job growth has occurred in South Australia, strangely enough. One must ask what that job growth means in terms of the base from which it is projected, even if it has taken place to some degree in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Stone also suggested that people are fleeing the harsh, tyrannical regimes which exist in New South Wales and Victoria, up to Queensland for a whiff of enlightenment and freedom under the National Party Government. I do not believe that is so at all. I believe the largest influx of people into Queensland comprises retirees-people going up there to retire for precisely the reason which I suggested in my earlier answer. They are going up there to retire in order to enjoy Queensland's sunshine and, hopefully, forget about the Queensland Government which will give them all nightmares.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Has the Minister seen media reports that Ethiopia is facing a disastrous drought placing millions of people under the threat of a catastrophic famine? Is the Minister also aware of the impact of various wars being fought between the Ethiopian Government and the independence forces in the Eritrea, Tigrey, Oguden and Oznol areas of Ethiopia?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the past Australia has played a major role in trying to assist with the catastrophic famine conditions that have existed in Ethiopia, contributing not only very large sums of money and aid in the mid-1980s, but also in a bad drought year two years ago more than $13m. We have been examining the situation and trying to work out what will be required and what we might be able to contribute in the next year to alleviate the situation that is emerging, again in a rather horrific and tragic way. The reports that have emerged recently from the World Food Program and other sources suggest that in the northern provinces of Ethiopia up to four million people will be affected by total or partial failures of their harvests as a result of drought and that the food aid volume requirements will be about 500,000 tonnes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The provinces of Eritrea, where approximately one and a half million people are affected, and Tigre, where it is likely that approximately 2.2 million people will be affected, are the worst hit. Of course, they are the provinces where civil war is effectively being waged at the moment and where the existence of that war, and as a result the inability or unwillingness of the Government of Ethiopia to assist in food distribution programs and delivery in that area, will make things very much more complex and difficult than they might otherwise be.</PARA>
<PARA> An Australian team from the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau has very recently visited the region. In the course of this visit, they examined the most effective means of responding to the situation. I hope that it will be possible for us to make an early decision on the provision of Australian assistance in the light of this examination. In the context of the problems in Eritrea and Tigre, the Australian position has been one of support for a negotiated settlement of those internal conflicts.</PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the negotiating processes that have now commenced, particularly in relation to Eritrea, represent positive developments. Regrettably, at the moment the situation in Tigre is much less optimistic, but it is hoped that a further meeting that will take place following one recently in Rome between the Government of Ethiopia and the Tigrean liberation movement will advance the prospects for a cease-fire. Although the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) proposed at the recent Atlanta talks that Australia participate as an observer at future rounds of those talks, it now appears that the national observers will all be African. However, the Australian Government remains ready to consider carefully any proposal that may be agreed between the Government of Ethiopia and the EPLF for Australia to play a role in the peace process. However, I emphasise that we do not see this as an area of the globe where we have any kind of major diplomatic role to play. Our major responsibility, in common with other civilised and richer nations around the world, is to contribute as best we can to the very distressing drought and famine situation that is now emerging.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague Senator Ray just remarked to me, `Hold the front page for this one'. I very much appreciate Senator Maguire's ongoing interest in the matter of the standardisation of the Melbourne to Adelaide rail link, an interest that I think it would be fair to say he has demonstrated in this place on innumerable occasions. In addition to being of non-standard gauge, the Melbourne to Adelaide rail link suffers severe curvature, gradient and clearance problems which make it seriously uncompetitive with the freeway-standard road link between the two cities. The standardisation project appears to have merit and studies indicate that the project could offer positive economic returns. Australian National (AN) has now completed an engineering feasibility and costing study of an alternative alignment which would overcome these problems. The cost of this upgraded and standardised link has been estimated at $516m in June 1989 values. There are no immediate plans to commence the project. However, AN is installing a small number of gauge-convertible concrete sleepers in the section of the Melbourne-Adelaide railway east of Tailem Bend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics is also assessing the major interstate corridors with the aim of identifying the right mix of infrastructure development and investment requirements as part of the Federal Government's approach to integrated land transport development. The Government recently announced that it would join with the States, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the private sector in carrying out a feasibility study into the establishment of a national rail freight organisation which, if established, will manage intersystem operations and make commercial judgments about investment requirements. The Railway Industry Council is also due to report shortly on its views and measures required for improving the performance of our national rail network. Senator Maguire can accordingly remain assured that corridor developments such as this are matters of very considerable interest to the Federal Government and areas in which we are very actively engaged in finding effective and economically valuable solutions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. Is the Minister aware of the media reports this morning from independent sources that Federal Government inaction-the media reports describe it as `the Federal Government dragging its feet'-is placing the Cape York space port proposal under threat? Can the Minister say why the Federal Government is apparently setting out to sabotage this project in Queensland? Is there any connection between the Federal Government's apparent lack of action or support for this important national project in Queensland and the fact that there is a State election in Queensland on Saturday?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3673" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no connection at all. Firstly, I should say that the Cape York space port-I must attribute the first political support for the Cape York space port to Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen-was seen by the Queensland government of the day as a very simple matter which involved getting investors together to develop a commercial space port. From the beginning the Commonwealth took the view that the project should be the subject of a feasibility study and the Queensland Government subsequently agreed with that view. However, earlier on, the Queensland Government had taken the view that the space port had nothing to do with the Commonwealth Government and that it could go its own way in developing it. Sadly, that view was incorrect and it was recognised as incorrect by Queensland Premier Ahern. I do not know what Premier Cooper's attitude to it is; I do not think he has pronounced on the space port at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The development of a commercial space port at Cape York is a very complex issue because there are all sorts of powers exercised by the Commonwealth in relation to foreign affairs, the environment, treaty obligations, the use of space, defence powers and so on which have to be taken into account first of all in assessing whether the space port could appropriately go ahead. There is also the question of negotiations with foreign governments. For example, there would have to be negotiations with the Chinese Government, the Japanese Government, particularly the United States Government, and to some extent with space authorities in the Soviet Union, in order to establish the questions of viability and a range of other issues which are important to the international space community. These things have taken time. For example, they have not been resolved in the United States yet. There are still further negotiations to take place there before a final decision about the space port can be made.</PARA>
<PARA> It is a complex issue. There has been no dragging of feet by the Commonwealth in respect of this matter. As to the Federal Government inaction allegation, which the honourable senator says came from an independent source, I have a pretty good idea where it came from: the current Queensland Government is desperate to grab on to any issue in order to garner a little support for Saturday's election. I think I have answered the honourable senator's question. It is not a simple issue. It was approached simplistically by the Queensland Government initially. Under Premier Ahern I think a lot of progress was made, but Premier Ahern has sadly gone now and there is somebody else in this place. I do not think much progress has been made since then, but the Commonwealth has not been dragging its feet as suggested.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3673" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report that Senator Crowley refers to was commissioned by the Minister for Social Security as part of the Australian Institute of Family Studies evaluation of the child support scheme, stage one. The report demonstrates yet again the importance of a well researched and comprehensive approach to social policy formulation. We all know that has been made more necessary because we are talking about an area where prejudice and ignorance have often prevailed, especially in terms of some of the utterings from the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is an instructive and informative report. It analyses the circumstances of women who separated in 1981 and 1983 and tracks their circumstances over a period. Its key findings totally reject the policies based on prejudice and ignorance, which I mentioned earlier. Its usefulness is that it provides a basis for action for the future. In essence, its key findings are fourfold: firstly, paid work at the time of separation is a key to later economic self-efficiency; secondly, quite clearly, once in employment, sole mothers are more likely to remain in employment than other women; thirdly-this point should be taken heed of by those on the Opposition benches-only 8 per cent of those surveyed had not had any paid employment six years after separation; and, fourthly, the sole parent pension is an important bridge between separation and economic self-sufficiency.</PARA>
<PARA> The report is clearly an endorsement of the direction of well researched policies that have been adopted by this Government. We have developed and implemented policies that have done a number of things: firstly, they have assisted sole mothers to overcome barriers to work force participation, particularly through education, training, child-care and other support services. Secondly, we have helped balance caring for children and employment for sole parents. Thirdly, and most importantly, we have maintained the adequacy of the sole parent pension so that it can act as a bridge to self-sufficiency. The policies have been well targeted and they have been successful. I think the evidence speaks very much for itself.</PARA>
<PARA> It is illustrative to note that, in 1979, 43.4 per cent of sole mothers were employed. By 1983 this had fallen to 38.8 per cent. Under Labor, and with important programs such as the jobs, education and training programs, the proportion has now risen to 51.9 per cent. The proportion of those who relied also on the maximum rate pension in 1979 was 45 per cent. It is interesting to note that by early 1983 it had risen to 65 per cent and that in 1989 it is back to 45 per cent. These are two important indicators to show that well researched and targeted policies in this area are working. They are working because they have as their basis the criterion of adequacy. Those who rely on full pension and benefits have a guarantee of adequate support. In constant dollars, a sole parent with two children who received $196.50 in 1977 was receiving $182.80 in 1982. That same sole parent will now receive $205.50 in 1990 in constant dollar terms.</PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the outset, the report is a useful document as it does two things: firstly, it makes it very clear that the Government's policies of targeting and providing adequately for those people in real need are working; and, secondly, it rejects those policies, espoused quite often on the Opposition benches, that are based on prejudice and ignorance.</PARA>

I am aware of reports that Aussat is testing a satellite-based vehicle position determination system which will allow vehicle progress and speed to be assessed. The tests are part of a current evaluation by Aussat of its Mobilesat service, which is to be introduced in 1991-92 following the launch of its second generation of satellites. They are Australia's first land vehicle speed and position tests via satellite. The Inmarsat system, which will be used by Aussat from mid-1990 for early commencement of the Mobilesat service, is being used for the current exercise. Both the early entry service using Inmarsat and the full Mobilesat service will operate in conjunction with Navstar, which is a high precision United States navigational satellite system, to provide these speed and position determination services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, mobile speed and position reporting will have many applications in a nation as vast as Australia. Within two years organisations such as emergency services and trucking fleet operators will be able to manage vehicle movements effectively over a wide area and to monitor arrival times, departures and progress between centres, regardless of location. Again, the movement of a high value and hazardous cargo can also be managed on a real time basis from the depot with drivers being advised en route of any changes. While services will be able to report on speed, I should say that Aussat's Mobilesat is not primarily designed for this purpose; it is a management tool for businesses in the transport industry. All in all, Mobilesat is a fascinating development which is likely to have some very useful applications in the road transport industry of the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They do not have any basis in fact at all, which is the galling aspect of the matter. A report which appeared in yesterday's News headed `Hawke fails Murray plan' gave a quotation from a Mr Camac, who is styled as the President of the Murray Valley League. Nothing is further from the truth. I am at an absolute loss to know how anyone heading an organisation of this sort could have had any basis for making such an allegation. Since the Prime Minister's environment statement in July this year, more Commonwealth funds have been available for natural resource issues in Australia than ever before and, given that the Murray-Darling Basin is one of the areas of greatest need, more funds have been attracted to that region than ever before. So the circumstances are indeed surprising.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Something else that annoys me is that reporters would actually report a story such as this without even seeking any verification of the allegation from the Commonwealth. We are at least entitled to respond. No effort was made to get a response from us, or from the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, which would equally have scotched this sort of allegation. Instead a newspaper report appeared.</PARA>
<PARA> The Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council met in April this year. Under the natural resources management strategy to address degradation in the basin, an indicative three-year budget of $45.2m was drawn up. Ministers then sought agreement to that budget from their respective governments. The Commonwealth Government, through the environment statement, put down a major package of initiatives in July which addressed many aspects of land and water degradation in the Murray-Darling Basin and, on top of that, in this year's Budget specifically allocated other funds as well.</PARA>
<PARA> We are allocating $49m over the next two years as part of a national soil conservation program. Should the Murray-Darling Basin attract the same percentage of our total fund allocation as it has in the past when those funds are disbursed, it will get an additional $20m that it did not actually count on. As part of a broadly based package, the Commonwealth has agreed to provide additional funds to the natural resource management strategy for the Murray-Darling Basin amounting to $3m in 1989-90 and $5m in 1990-91. The sum of $12.6m will be supplied for 1989-90 as well under the salinity and drainage strategy-an amount contributed to by the Commonwealth and the States. Decisions for 1991-92 have not yet been taken but Senator Richardson and I have sought triennial funding for the natural resource management strategy for the Murray-Darling Basin.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that any suggestion that we are cutting back our support for activities in the area is unfounded; the obverse is true. In fact, we have allocated more funds than ever before under a myriad of newer programs better targeted specifically to deal with the natural resource problems of the basin.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>This report presents the findings of the Committee's inquiry into the engagement of external consultants by Commonwealth departments. As a result of adverse comments made by the Auditor-General in relation to several instances of poor management of external consultancies by some departments, the Committee resolved to investigate whether the processes involved in the selection, monitoring and assessment of the cost-effectiveness of consultants were adequate and accountable. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, the evidence taken by the Committee has revealed that the situation with respect to consultants is confused and inconsistent across the public sector. One particular concern of the Committee is that, although service-wide guidelines for the engagement of consultants have been available for some time, scant attention has been paid to them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee does not have an obsession with detailed adherence to a set of guidelines in the form of a manual of procedure. Certain aspects of the guidelines for the engagement of consultants, however, ought to be mandatory in the sense that if they are not followed poor management practices are likely to lead to waste of public moneys and failure to achieve desired results from the use of consultants. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that such an obvious principle as evaluation is not mandatory-as admitted by the Department of Administrative Services-makes an absolute mockery of them. Surely a major objective must be the development and implementation of monitoring and accountability mechanisms both for departments' own purposes and to assure the public that funds were not being wasted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee found, however, that there are no consistent mechanisms in place which ensure accountability for the use of consultants. While on the one hand consultants are regarded as merely another input to a program, on the other hand, little progress has been made on the development of performance indicators to assess the cost-effectiveness of the inclusion of the services of consultants in government programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, the Committee found that there are no procedures in place to ensure that consultants who perform poorly in one department will not be engaged by another. We have recommended, therefore, that post-performance reviews be required for consultancies. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other aspects of the guidelines that ought also to be complied with as a matter of course including compliance with any legal requirement. The fact that the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories admitted that the law had not been complied with in respect of the former Finance Regulation 52aa (2)-which exempted certain kinds of supplies from the requirement to go to tender-was of concern to the Committee. Evidence was given that this practice had continued for 15 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The nature of consultancies varies considerably from major long term contracts such as environmental impact studies costing millions of dollars to short term engagements which address, for example, issues of occupational health or skills enhancement. The Committee recognises, therefore, that different methods of procurement may be justified. However, notwithstanding the differences of magnitude of engagements nor the variety of procurement procedures, the Committee is concerned to ensure that the use of consultants by Commonwealth departments is at all times accountable. </PARA>
<PARA> Recognising that situations will continue to arise in which skills required are not available within a particular department or agency, the Committee sees merit in developing a public sector management consultancy within the Public Service. Specifically, the Committee considers that there would be value in expanding The Development Consultants, an agency within the Pubic Service Commission specialising in human resource development issues, into a broad-ranging management consultancy bureau, along the lines of the Canadian Bureau of Management Consultancy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has also recommended that consultancy units be established to assist in the selection of specialist consultants from outside the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of pubic servants leaving the Service to join or establish consultancies was raised during the course of the inquiry. These situations are colloquially referred to as the `revolving door' and `Friday-to-Monday' syndromes. There is no legislation in place, however, which prevents a Public Service employee from resigning a position only to return as a consultant to do precisely the same tasks at a significantly higher fee. The Committee has recommended that the Public Service Commission review issues concerning post-separation employment, with a view to introducing legislation should this be warranted. </PARA>
<PARA> Since this inquiry was commenced in April 1988 major changes have been promulgated in the sphere of Commonwealth purchasing procedures and practices which have implications for the engagement of consultants. The Committee notes that the reforms are in part dependent for their success on a high level of visibility and provision of public information on government contracts and therefore stresses the importance of the Committee's recommendations in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I must emphasise that neither the Joint Committee of Public Accounts nor the Auditor-General has ongoing responsibility for monitoring the use of consultants and ensuring accountability and probity. The resources necessary to do this are clearly not available. It is the responsibility of program managers and the departmental organisation to ensure visibility, probity, accountability and the effective use of consultants. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to thank all members of the Committee and the vast number of people who have provided us with both written and oral evidence. I thank the staff who, under considerable difficulties, especially in the last stages of the report, gave us an enormous amount of time and effort in order to get the report tabled by the end of this session. I commend the report to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These reports have been produced by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts for tabling before the end of the House of Representatives session in order that they may be before the Parliament. There are two things that are important to say about this report on consultants. The first is that it in no way looked at consultants as used by Ministers. We looked only at consultants as used by departments. It is important to point out that the cost of consultants to ministerial staff is in the vicinity, I believe, of $2m. It is also interesting to note that many former members of parliament are used as consultants in Ministers' offices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point that is important to make is that the task of gathering hard evidence as to abuses of the system was difficult for the Committee. Indeed, the concrete evidence that was furnished by way of a consultant being a Friday to, in fact, Tuesday case-the example of Dr Thistlewaite is used in the report was gathered in the Estimates committees where there was an opportunity to set out the particulars of this consultant who had been a public servant with the Parliamentary Information Systems Office and with whom I dealt with in the report of Estimates Committee A to the Parliament following the Committee's hearings and the bringing down of the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of consultants and how they are properly to be dealt with in accordance with the guidelines is a particularly perplexing one, as there is no hard and fast rule, as perhaps the United States has with regard to its Defense Department, where somebody who has been a public service employee is prohibited by law for two years from becoming a consultant. </PARA>
<PARA> The other interesting fact that turned up in information supplied by way of questions in Estimates was that one firm which supplies a lot of consultants to various government departments had, in fact, supplied 13 consultants to one particular department who were former public servants. It is useful for us to know the particulars and background of those public servants and to know whether or not their becoming consultants is a bona fide exercise or whether indeed it is simply a device to up their salary, as happened in the case of Dr Thistlewaite, who went from being on $46,000 to receiving $101,000 in an eleven-month period. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the tabling statement in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority has the duty under section 55 of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 to monitor and to review the performance by the National Crime Authority of its functions and to report to both houses of the Parliament on any matter connected with the performance of the authority's functions to which, in the opinion of the committee, the attention of the Parliament should be directed. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee fulfils its monitoring and reviewing function by keeping a watch on what the authority is doing and examining suggestions that the authority has not been performing its statutory functions or that it has abused its powers. At the committee's regular meetings with the authority the committee is briefed on matters such as the authority's staff and resources, legislative and other constraints impacting upon the authority's ability to perform its functions effectively, the authority's relations with other agencies, its strategic planning and procedures, completed investigations and operations which have entered the public domain. The committee is not, however, briefed on matters which the authority considers to be operationally sensitive. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee's regular meetings with the authority also provide a forum for the committee to raise with the authority matters of concern in relation to the authority's performance of its functions, thus the committee has sought explanations in relation to prosecutions arising out of the authority's investigations which have failed at the committal stage of proceedings, allegations of interference in the authority's operations by politicians or officers of other law enforcement agencies and suggestions of inadequacies in the authority's arrangements for the protection of witnesses. In addition to the oral briefing provided at its regular meetings with the authority, the committee also receives written briefing material from the authority including detailed briefs of each of the authority's investigations. The committee has also sought and received from the authority specific documents to supplement material provided by way of oral briefing and explanation. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee has presented two previous reports to the Parliament pursuant to its monitoring and reviewing function, the first report in November 1985 and the second report in November 1986. In May 1988 the committee tabled a report entitled The National Crime Authority-An Initial Evaluation in which it supported the passage of legislation repealing the `sunset clause' in the National Crime Authority Act 1984 which would otherwise have resulted in the authority ceasing to exist on 30 June 1989. However the committee considered that it was only possible to make an initial evaluation of the authority's performance at that time since many of the authority's investigations were not completed and legal proceedings were before the courts or pending in a number of matters arising out of the authority's investigations. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee therefore recommended that a more comprehensive evaluation of the authority's work, and of the success of the law enforcement strategy underpinning the establishment of the authority, be undertaken after the authority had been in existence for seven years. That recommendation did not mean, however, that the committee did not intend to continue to fulfil its duty of monitoring and reviewing the performance by the authority of its functions in the meanwhile and it is pursuant to that duty that the committee presents this, its third report to the Parliament. Its purpose is to report on matters connected with the authority's performance of its functions during the period since the committee presented its second report and, in particular, to report on the committee's examination of some of the authority's investigations which may have given rise to public concern that the authority was not performing its functions properly. </PARA>
<PARA> The report examines in some detail two of five cases arising out of investigations by the authority which failed at the committal stage and proceedings in the course of the past year. The Committee had intended to deal with all five of the cases but three of them remain before the courts. The Committee is satisfied that the authority took action in the two cases dealt with in the report only after careful investigation and after receiving advice from counsel that prima facie cases against the accused existed. The authority cannot be blamed for the fact that other factors, such as new evidence, arose which resulted in the charges being dismissed or withdrawn. The committee is confident that the authority carried out its statutory responsibilities correctly in assembling admissible evidence in relation to these matters and in forwarding that evidence to the responsible prosecuting agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> The report touches on a number of other matters, including the need for the authority to be sensitive to the demands it places on individual witnesses appearing before it, the costs of the present system for Telecommunications interception and the authority's resources. It also contains detailed statistics on the authority's investigations, bringing up to date similar tables which appeared in the Committee's initial evaluation report. </PARA>
<PARA> The period covered by the report saw the end of Mr Justice Stewart's term as the chairman of the authority and it is appropriate to remark that, as the foundation chairman of the authority, Mr Justice Stewart deserves much of the credit for establishing as a working reality what was a unique and novel concept in law enforcement. This comment is not intended to discount the very significant contribution made by the other members of the authority over the past five years nor the dedication and hard work of the many members of staff who have helped over that time to build the reputation of the authority as an effective element of this country's law enforcement machinery. However nobody can deny that the authority in its first five years bore the stamp of Mr Justice Stewart's personality nor that in significant respects it reflected his experience as a Royal Commissioner inquiring into the `Mr Asia' Drug Syndicate, the Nugan Hand Bank and the illegal interception of telephone calls by the New South Wales police. </PARA>
<PARA> The task that Mr Justice Stewart was set as the foundation chairman of the authority was a difficult one. Not only was he required to build a new agency the very existence of which was fiercely resented by many within the existing law enforcement structure of the country but the legislation also contained a `Sunset Clause' which would have resulted in the authority ceasing to exist after a period of five years unless the Parliament passed a further law to the contrary. The authority was thus under pressure to prove itself and to do so quickly even though the investigation of organised crime is a lengthy process and it takes even longer for the result of investigations to be processed by our Criminal Justice System. As the Committee commented in its initial evaluation, there was an expectation on the part of the Parliament in establishing the authority that it would get results: that it would put important or significant criminals behind bars. This the authority under Mr Justice Stewart did. </PARA>
<PARA>To mention but one investigation, the authority's operation ILIAD concerns the illegal importation and distribution of drugs, especially heroin, by persons of Chinese origin and their associates, and the financing of the importation and distribution of such drugs. The Australian Federal Police had initiated a similar investigation but had met with little success. At the time the investigation was taken over by the authority (at the request of the Australian Federal Police) some targets had been identified but no substantive police investigation of them had been undertaken. The authority's investigation has so far resulted in the charging of 93 people on a total of 198 charges. Sixty-seven prosecutions have been completed, resulting in 39 convictions and 15 deportations. The significance of this investigation is reflected in the amount of heroin seized-almost 60 kilograms-and the severity of the sentences imposed on those persons who have been convicted. </PARA>
<PARA> The measure of the authority's success lies not only in the number of convictions of significant criminals arising from its investigations but also in the fact that it is unlikely that many of these convictions would have occurred without the authority. Other agencies had already attempted investigations in some of the cases and had been unable to launch prosecutions, while in the case of former Chief Inspector Barry Moyse in South Australia, for example, it was acknowledged that the offences might not have been uncovered but for the intervention of the authority. Moreover in some areas it appears that the authority has not only broken new ground but that it has stimulated other law enforcement agencies to follow it. The committee understands that the authority was the first law enforcement agency in Australia to employ Chinese-speaking officers from Hong Kong to assist in the investigation of criminal activity among Chinese elements in Australia. Now the Australian Federal Police are also experiencing some success in this area in co-operation with the authorities in Hong Kong. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Committee considers that the complete change in the membership of the authority-apart from the member in charge of the Adelaide Office, Mr Le Grand-which took place in July 1989 was undesirable from the point of view of continuity in the authority's investigations, it has undoubtedly given the new chairman, Mr Peter Faris, QC, the opportunity to place his stamp on the authority in turn. The Committee looks forward to a continuation of the authority's record of success under its new chairman. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The third report of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority is a particularly important one because it is tabled at a time when there has been a sufficient opportunity to evaluate the work of the National Crime Authority (NCA). Clearly, the judgment on both sides of the Parliament has to be that the exercise has been a considerable success. Nonetheless, there have been attempts in the media, particularly in the Sydney Morning Herald from time to time, to suggest that somehow there is not a sufficient level of accountability and that the Committee and the National Crime Authority should be much more forthcoming. I think that approach betrays a misunderstanding of the very sensitive nature of the material and the heavy obligation imposed upon members of parliament to ensure that the discussions remain confidential and that they do not prejudice any law enforcement activities. It is a tribute to the members of the Committee on all sides of the House that confidentiality has been maintained. Considerable pressures are brought to bear from time to time. There are certainly demarcation disputes between various police forces and in many ways there are a number of people anxious to discredit the work of the NCA. Every time a prosecution fails, it is very quickly suggested that somehow it must have been a half-baked investigation or that it was the fault of the ineptitude of the NCA officers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my judgment, there has been an ongoing difficulty about the ultimate responsibility for the handling of prosecutions because the client is the NCA but the prosecuting authority is the Director of Public Prosecutions. There needs to be more acceptance of the involvement of the NCA in the course of the prosecutions so that it can be ultimately held responsible if there are shortcomings in the legal process. Generally speaking, the cases that we have examined where prosecutions have failed have not brought to light any serious evidence of incompetence. In most instances, there has been very strong justification for bringing the matters to court. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the appointment of Mr Justice Stewart's successor, Mr Peter Faris-someone I have known from the Victorian Bar for many years. I have every confidence that he will prove to be a very effective chairman. The circumstances of his appointment were, nonetheless, regrettable in that there was a series of leaks in the media-for which I think the Minister for Justice (Mr Tate) ought to be held primarily responsible-which led to enormous speculation about who Mr Justice Stewart's successor would be. There were various people to whom the job was supposedly offered. Ultimately, there was something a little short of a fiasco whereby it was reported that Mr Faris had been approached thinking he was being offered the top job when all he was being offered was membership of the Authority. The result of that particular episode was that there was a complete changeover of personnel and Mr Faris was ultimately offered the chairmanship, which he accepted. The end result has been a satisfactory one. But there was certainly a great deal of insensitivity and incompetence on the part of those responsible for the appointments in the early stages. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the work of the National Crime Authority. It is doing its best under very difficult circumstances. It will continue to have a fair number of critics, most of whom have vested interests in discrediting its activities. At the end of the day, if parliamentarians take the work as seriously as they have to date, we will find that the body will have the resources and the legislative power to carry out its very important task. There is no doubt that the stakes are getting higher, especially in the drug arena. I am confident that the NCA will prove to be a very effective body in combating that very great number of diseases that seem to inflict not just the community but, indeed, sometimes the law enforcement agencies. I have pleasure in tabling the third report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The third report of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, of which I am a member, is a useful report from a number of points of view. For example, the two appendices provide a great deal of information for those people who are interested in the operation of the Authority. Appendix I, for example, has a summary of the Authority's major successes and failures to date. Appendix II includes a whole range of statistics provided by the National Crime Authority to the Committee that give an idea of the scope and work that the Authority has necessarily had to undertake in its task of attempting to combat crime at a high level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not wish to canvass all the issues that are obviously dealt with in detail in the report; or even the dissent of Senator Cooney, who I understand will speak later. However, I wish to draw the Senate's attention to the section relating to the Authority's resources, because I believe it is particularly important that honourable senators have an understanding of this problem, especially at this time when we are debating the Budget. We must be mindful of the fact that the fight against crime is not cheap-it is a very expensive consumer of the community's resources. In order to enable the Authority to undertake its work properly, it may well be that, in the very short order, there will have to be significant augmentation of its budget. For example, if one wishes to have regard to an item on which the Committee has previously provided a report-our report on witness protection-this report states:</PARA>
<PARA>More recent discussions with the Authority concerning its resources have highlighted the problems the Authority is having with the very substantial costs of witness protection. The cost of protecting a single witness for a year can run as high as $900,000 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That may seem a staggering amount but, depending on the value of the evidence that the witness might be able to give, that evidence could well be the linchpin in successful prosecutions of senior figures in various crime rackets in Australia. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The Authority cannot predict with any certainty what demands will be made upon it for the protection of witnesses nor can it seriously contemplate saying to an important witness who walks through its doors: `No, we are sorry, we do not have the funds to pay for your protection. Try again in six month's time'. </PARA>
<PARA>In those circumstances, it is fairly obvious that the person who required the protection would not be around in six months time to apply for the protection. That is an area, in some ways open ended, that in the next financial year Parliament and the Government will have to come to grips with far more seriously than they have done to date. </PARA>
<PARA> This year's augmentation of the Authority's budget by $600,000 was necessary and desirable. However, in the situation I have just outlined, in which there is an attempt to get a supplementary budget of $600,000 while there may be a shortfall of $900,000 with regard to even one witness, the Government may be looking at amounts that are likely to fall far short of the mark. It may very well be that the Government, relying on what it believes to be the community's perception of the needs of the Authority so that it can carry out its task, does not believe that there needs to be a significant increase. If there is an increase, there will have to be decreases elsewhere or an increase in taxes. However, I believe that some wider community debate needs to be undertaken about the issue of the resources that go not only to the National Crime Authority but also to the Australian Federal Police, to the court systems, and to the other law enforcement agencies. It is not good enough simply to say that this or that ought to happen. The effectiveness of these organisations is not totally a function of the resources, but certainly sufficient funds need to be available for them to carry out even an adequate task and to do what seemingly the Authority is doing, at least from our reports to date, that is, to successfully disturb the structure of crime in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an element not sufficiently taken into account that these bodies exist not only to solve crimes that have been committed, but also, hopefully, to prevent crimes being committed. The destabilisation of criminal organisations is a vital element of the Authority's work. The value of that element will probably never be able to be gauged in terms of dollars and cents or even toted up in appendices of statistics, but I believe that ultimately it will be the most effective element of the Authority's work. Because of that fact, I believe that, in terms of any evaluation of the Authority, we must be very careful not to reduce our evaluation to a pure totting up of court success and failures. There must be a far broader and more understanding evaluation of the role and work of the Authority, of the successes that it has already achieved to date in destabilising the organised crime syndicates, and of its provision, along with several other authorities, of an intelligence base from which we are then able to wage a successful-hopefully, increasingly successful-fight against crime. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I begin what I hope to be a short speech by referring to a remark made by Senator Alston when he referred to the appointment of Peter Faris, QC, as Chairman of the National Crime Authority (NCA). He said that at that time there was considerable speculation as to who would be the Chairperson of the NCA. In fact, I think that one person was named in the newspapers and that caused some confusion at the time. All that was true. He then threw in the line that the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) was mainly liable for that situation. That is another unfortunate example of the extraordinary tendency of parliamentarians to cast aspersions using what appears to be a most flimsy basis. I do not know, and nor will the people who might read Hansard know, the basis for the honourable senator's statement. It is simply an aspersion cast on the character of a person who has the respect of both sides of the chamber, but he has been gratuitously demeaned by a throwaway statement. The reason, the evidence and basis for the statement have not been explained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was a dissenting voice in relation to the third report of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. I did not dissent on the basis that the National Crime Authority is not a worthy organisation-it is a commendable organisation which is led by a fine lawyer and an outstanding human being, Peter Faris. I also did not dissent because the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority is not a good committee. Indeed, it is a good and conscientious committee which is very ably led by Mr Peter Cleeland, the member for McEwen. Rather, my dissent related to the fact that we must look at the nature of the Authority and of the report. The Authority is an investigative body clothed with powers which, up until this decade, would have been regarded as extraordinary. The Authority has-and will do so over the coming years-subjected many citizens to scrutiny, which until the 1980s would have been exceptional. The scrutiny is not confined to those suspected of crime but embraces people who the Authority considers might be able to give evidence implicating others. It can, for example, compel people to give evidence on oath and to produce documents which the ordinary policing authorities do not have the power to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Crime Authority is one of a quite amazing number of investigative bodies that have grown up during this decade. Mr Mark Weinberg, QC, made the following comments in a speech in August this year:</PARA>
<PARA> In recent years there has been an explosion of quasi-judicial bodies established by Governments to perform investigative tasks. To name but a few, there have been assorted Royal Commissions, sundry Special Prosecutors, the National Crime Authority, the National Companies and Securities Commission (now the Australian Securities Commission), the New South Wales State Drugs Crime Commission, the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption, its new Western Australian variant, the State Corporate Affairs Commissions, and the Commonwealth Special Investigations Unit. In addition to these permanent investigative bodies, one finds specific investigative units within such agencies as the Australian Taxation Office, the Australian Customs Service, the Health Insurance Commission, the Department of Social Security, the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, the Trade Practices Commission, and at State levels, various Consumer Affairs Bureaux, Accident Compensation Commissions, and Coronial Inquests (some of which seem to have taken on the role of roving Commissions of Inquiry). Allegations of criminality have also been investigated by, among others, Parliamentary Commissions of Inquiry, Parliamentary Inquiries, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, and the Human Rights Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, the investigation of crime has very much become a growth industry in the 1980s. It is as though crime never existed in the past-which is quite wrong. The number of people throughout history who have been tortured, imprisoned and executed for crimes they have committed is clear evidence that crime is not new. As there has been a growth in the number of investigative bodies and the extraordinary powers given to them in the interests of a humane, just, democratic and free society, some balance must be struck. One of the ways that a balance can be struck is to allow some criticism of those authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely a body as robust as the National Crime Authority should be able to withstand some criticism. A high proportion of the content of the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority-a hard-working, well led committee-is concerned with defending the National Crime Authority. It seems to me that a parliamentary committee should not readily rush to the large scale defence of some criticism of the Authority when that process might lead to the scotching of criticism which, when properly made, is a very useful tool in a democratic and free society. The Committee cannot scotch from its bosom all delinquency without searing those qualities it relies upon to remain a just and benign body. </PARA>
<PARA> That was the first view that I took. I now quickly want to touch on the second one. The report recommends that the Authority be given money to enable it to play a large part in who shall appear to prosecute cases that it has prepared. In my view, an investigative body should stay separate from the body that is going to prosecute the case that it puts together. In my dissent I quoted the following sentence which appears in the majority report:</PARA>
<PARA>If the Authority had in essence a right of veto over counsel it would be as well placed as it could expect to be if it prosecuted its own cases. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not for an investigative body, whether it be the police or one of these various bodies that Mr Weinberg has referred to, to prosecute. Those bodies are there to provide the evidence, and it is for the prosecutorial organ to prosecute, to choose what counsel will do the prosecuting and to present the case as it sees fit. For an investigative body to want to do more than investigate creates dangerous trends for a free and democratic society. </PARA>
<PARA> My last point of dissent was on the issue of who should carry out interception of telecommunications. That is presently in the keeping of the Australian Federal Police. I remember that when the Bill was being prepared it was a matter of high principle that the interception of telecommunications should be confined as much as possible and that any move from that position would be a dangerous one. </PARA>
<PARA> To sum up: I have high respect for the National Crime Authority and for the person heading it. However, like any body of its nature in the sort of society we want, it must be continually scrutinised. A committee such as a parliamentary committee should defend it when the criticism of it becomes unwarranted and of such a nature that somehow it is going to be dangerously prejudiced. However, the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, which is a monitor and a reviewer, should not rush in to become an advocate for the National Crime Authority. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make one or two comments on the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. I listened with great interest to the comments made by my colleague Senator Cooney. The general comments I want to make relate to the ability of the Committee to report to the Parliament. I believe that the reporting function of the Joint Committee is very important because it needs to keep a strict and proper record of the National Crime Authority. It also needs to create a great deal of confidence amongst the community in the National Crime Authority and the work that it is undertaking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Cooney said that if the National Crime Authority needs to be criticised the Committee should do it. I do not think there would be any doubt that the Committee would do it. I think Senator Cooney said in his minority report that we were being apologetic and apologists for the National Crime Authority. When one reads in isolation the chapter that Senator Cooney referred to, it might appear that way. But taking the report in total, I think it lays out very clearly the position of the National Crime Authority. It outlines statistics in relation to the Authority's work. It also lists successes and failures in relation to investigations undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point that needs to be made is that, when the parliamentary committee reports, I think it has a duty not only to report on the facts as it knows them from the National Crime Authority but also to report and comment on any undue criticism of the National Crime Authority. I think Senator Alston said that the media had written a number of stories that were not based on fact. The importance of our report is that it will be worthwhile if media correspondents read the report and have available to them the facts contained in it, as they are known to the parliamentary committee. In addition, I believe that the parliamentary committee itself will take up any criticism about the Authority that needs to be taken up. After all, it is the job of the parliamentary Committee to see that the Authority performs as it should and in a way that allows some protection of the community generally. </PARA>
<PARA> I have great pleasure in recommending the Committee's report to other honourable senators and to members of the House of Representatives. To go further, I believe that members of the media should closely examine the report so that they will have available to them the facts as outlined by the parliamentary Committee, which has covered the activities of the National Crime Authority. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief. I just want to remind the Senate that the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority had been publicly criticised for not fully analysing criticisms that had been made of the National Crime Authority (NCA) in relation to a number of prosecutions, principally one prosecution concerning Mr Grassby, and two prosecutions concerning Mr Harvey. The Senate might remember that other honourable senators and I, the members of this Committee, undertook that the Committee would complete a proper examination within its area of responsibility, which is not to second-guess the NCA but nevertheless to see that it has properly met its responsibility in relation to any matter as set out in the Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the time of the criticism, the Committee was unable to do that because the matters involved had not been completed. The Grassby matter has still not been completed and is therefore not specifically dealt with in this report. However, the report does examine the conduct and handling of the Harvey prosecution by the NCA, both the prosecution of Harvey, Douglas and Wilenski and the prosecution of Harvey, Willis, Knox, Hilton and George. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to deal with the detail of that review, because it is contained in the third report, which is the subject of this debate. Nevertheless, I thought it worthwhile to point out, particularly to those who had argued previously that the monitoring committee was not meeting its responsibility, that they now have the examination by the Committee of these particular matters on the public record. No doubt those who were critical in that way in the past will have an opportunity now to satisfy themselves or otherwise about the way in which the NCA conducted itself in relation to those two prosecutions. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>I present the 305th report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts: Review of the Finance Minute on Report 270-Implementation of the Offsets Program. The Committee's report 270, presented in April 1987, found significant inadequacies in Australia's offsets program. That report made serious criticisms of the program and sought to encourage a general increase in the visibility of the program's administration. </PARA>
<PARA> The departments involved were urged to present the program as a single program, present an annual report to the responsible Minister and publish more information on outstanding obligations and acquittal plans. I might point out that at that stage I was not in the Parliament and have come to this inquiry subsequent to that report having been published. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the production of the annual report only a partial cost-benefit analysis of the offsets program has ever been undertaken; there are still no proper notification procedures; no definitive procedures manual; no proper procedures to ensure objective valuation of offsets proposals; and no penalities for non-compliance with offsets agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has made new recommendations which are intended to ensure consistency and equity in the application of the offsets policy amongst both overseas and local participants, to minimise administrative discretion in valuation procedures and particularly to open up the information process so as to improve the program's visibility and accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> Some work has been done to monitor the costs and benefits of the offsets program. The Bureau of Industry Economics has undertaken the first stage of a three-stage study. The major problem for the study was the lack of adequate information databases. The recommendations of the study call for additional database fields. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was perturbed to find that in some areas corrective action either has not been implemented or has not been completed, despite the fact that criticisms in those areas have been raised several times over the last few years by the Auditor-General in 1984, by the Inglis Committee of Review of Offsets also in 1984, and the Public Accounts Committee itself in a report tabled in April 1987. An example of this departmental failure is the continuing lack of a procedures manual for staff working on the program. </PARA>
<PARA> A further concern of the Committee goes to the very heart of the civil offsets program in that the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce can still not be certain that it is aware of all Commonwealth purchases to which the offsets program applies. The Committee was further concerned about the apparent low level of awareness of senior officers of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce about industry policies of major comparable countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee received a submission from the Department of Finance which stated:</PARA>
<PARA>it is questionable whether offsets, with their lack of transparency, uneven application and administrative overheads constitute an efficient instrument; industries deemed to be worthy of assistance could well be much better assisted by bounties (such as presently exists for the computer industry) or even tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee believes it is regrettable that after nearly 20 years of operation of the program there is no clear evidence that the offsets program was achieving its policy objectives. The Committee has therefore called for an independent full scale assessment of the national significance of the offsets policy. In that regard, I think of interest is a report published in October 1989 concerning offsets in Australia. It has been researched and prepared by the United States and Foreign Commercial Service in Australia. At page 26 of that report, the observations are made and several conclusions drawn that I think are pertinent. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government market is extremely important in Australia and no company, domestic or foreign, can afford to ignore the Government sector in such a small market, which is so geographically isolated. Information technology companies earn on average between 20 and 40 per cent of their Australian revenue from sales to government. </PARA>
<PARA>There are two main perceptions of offsets that are of interest, and then a final conclusion is drawn that there is an amount of window-dressing and bean counting in the offsets program which has not been useful in assisting the objects of the program and has disadvantaged companies involved in it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has produced detailed recommendations to address these concerns and I look forward to a thorough consideration of those recommendations and a response from the highest levels of the Department and the Government. In conclusion, I want to thank all members of the Committee who have worked on this report. In particular, I know that other members of the Committee would join me in thanking Julia van der Heide for her considerable efforts and professionalism in assisting the Committee with this report. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> Members will be aware that the Public Accounts Committee has a duty to follow-up issues raised by the Auditor-General which have serious efficiency and effectiveness implications for the management of Commonwealth programs or policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Report 300 outlines the issues which have concerned the Auditor-General in his two reports of 1988 and his April 1989 report. </PARA>
<PARA> Arising out of an examination of these reports, the Committee will monitor developments in nine areas of Commonwealth administration. These areas are:</PARA>
<PARA>revenue leasing arrangements affecting Commonwealth property that is temporarily surplus to requirements</PARA>
<PARA>management of Aboriginal student assistance schemes</PARA>
<PARA>management of the Jobstart and Skillshare programs</PARA>
<PARA>administration of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</PARA>

<PARA>effectiveness of fraud control measures in departments and agencies</PARA>
<PARA>the development of appropriate performance measures in cases where grants are made to States</PARA>
<PARA>asset management by the Department of Defence. </PARA>
<PARA> By listing these areas of ongoing concern, the Committee is alerting public service managers to likely future areas of inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA>administration of quarantine services</PARA>
<PARA>management of Commonwealth properties</PARA>
<PARA>administration of capital grants to non-government schools</PARA>
<PARA>management of Repatriation Hospitals</PARA>
<PARA>review of the Commonwealth's responsibilities in the area of therapeutic goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Members will be aware that Finance Minutes contain the formal response of Government departments and agencies to recommendations of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that these Finance Minutes should be made available to Parliament and the public in order to facilitate discussion of the issues raised in the Committee's reports. </PARA>
<PARA> The process of accountability is assisted by early release of the Finance Minutes, and to this end the Committee has decided to table future Finance Minutes as soon as practicable after they are received by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the importance of the Finance Minute process, the Committee has recommended that in the future each Finance Minute be signed by the relevant departmental head. </PARA>
<PARA> Finance Minutes are an integral part of the Committee's activities and represent an essential step in the Committee's oversight of Government program administration. </PARA>

<PARA>REPORT No. 303-SAFETY PRINCIPLES FOR EXPLOSIVES</PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I present the 303rd Report of the Committee entitled Review of Auditor-General's Efficiency Audits-Department of Defence: Safety principles for explosives and RAAF explosive ordnance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Report presents the Committee's findings in respect of its Inquiry into the Department of Defence's administration of its procedures for the safe storage and handling of explosives. It reviews two efficiency audit reports by the Auditor-General on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> In the first efficiency audit report, the Department of Defence: safety principles for explosives, the Committee was most concerned at a number of matters that arose. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Inquiry progressed it became obvious to the Committee that Defence's management of the implementation of the NATO Safety Principles left a great deal to be desired, with significant administrative weaknesses being found. Among the Committee's major findings were that:</PARA>
<PARA>The Department experienced great difficulty in complying with the NATO Safety Principles since the Department first adopted them in 1981;</PARA>
<PARA>The decision to adopt the Principles in 1981 was ill-conceived, in that there was little consideration of the costs, operational effects and legal liability that would be involved;</PARA>
<PARA>The level and extent of liaison with landholders and local councils around defence establishments containing stored explosives was less than satisfactory;</PARA>
<PARA>Although in 1983 the Department had adopted a policy of distributing to local councils safeguarding maps showing land that would be affected in the event of an accidental explosion, some six years later no maps had been distributed; and</PARA>
<PARA>The Department took more than two years to rewrite two instructions which the Auditor-General had extensively criticised. </PARA>
<PARA> ``A major finding of the Auditor-General confirmed by the Committee was that successive Defence Ministers had not been fully briefed on important matters relevant to the NATO Safety Principles''. </PARA>
<PARA> ``These instances began as early as 1981 when the Department failed to obtain the Minister's approval to adopt the Safety Principles, despite having received advice that such approval should be sought''. </PARA>
<PARA> ``Further instances of failure to adequately brief Ministers were identified in subsequent years. The Committee concluded that the explanations offered by the Department of Defence for these failures were unacceptable''. </PARA>
<PARA> ``The Committee was dismayed to find that after a mandatory Defence Instruction was issued requiring Ministerial approval for explosive operations that could not comply with the NATO Safety Principles and which involved some risk to the public should an accident occur, operations were allowed to continue without explicit Ministerial approval''. </PARA>
<PARA> ``The committee took an extremely dim view of senior unelected officials of the Department of Defence making decisions to allow the non-compliant storage of explosives when, according to their own Departmental Instruction, such decisions should have been made by the Minister''. </PARA>
<PARA> ``The Committee noted that all such instances now have the Minister's approval. The Committee has made recommendations designed to ensure that in the future the Minister's approval is sought in a much more timely manner. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considers the findings of this Report have ramifications for all departments in their relationships with the Executive. It should serve as a reminder to all departmental secretaries of the need to ensure that Ministers are adequately briefed and kept informed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee concluded that the management of the application of the NATO safety principles had been less than satisfactory since 1981. It noted that the revised Instruction on the safety principles for explosives had recently been issued after a long delay, as well as the recent decision to create the position of an Assistant Chief of Logistics to oversee its implementation. These measures, together with the recommendations contained in this Report, will, it is hoped, markedly improve the management of safety principles for explosives. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the second efficiency audit report, on RAAF explosive ordnance, the Committee was not able to fully examine many of the issues because the Department of Defence would not allow the Committee access to the restricted version of the report which was not tabled in Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is concerned that, where the Auditor-General is critical of matters of public administration that involve national security, the Parliament is being denied the opportunity to consider those issues under the current provisions of the Audit Act. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended in its Report procedures that will allow the Committee to consider future restricted reports of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Report to the House. </PARA>
<PARA>REPORT NO. 304-</PARA>
<PARA>GUIDELINES FOR DEPARTMENTAL ANNUAL REPORTS</PARA>
<PARA> During 1989 both the Public Accounts Committee and Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration completed inquiries into aspects of departmental annual reporting. Both committees found extensive non-compliance with the Guidelines for the Preparation of Departmental Annual Reports. The Senate Committee and some witnesses to the Public Accounts Committee advocated a review of the Guidelines by the Public Accounts Committee and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee resolved on 4 September 1989 to conduct an inquiry with a view to determining the extent and nature of any revision to the Guidelines which was found to be required. The Committee decided to conduct an initial review before draft Guidelines were prepared by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. It was intended by this means to ensure that any basic issues which arose could be considered in the drafting of the Guidelines, rather than only when the Committee considers a completed draft for approval under sub-section 25 (7) of the Public Service Act 1922. </PARA>
<PARA>In the conduct of this Inquiry two issues arose which provide the key recommendations of the report. These issues are the reporting of program performance and an extension of Parliamentary review of departments by the Standing Committees of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA>Reporting of Program Performance</PARA>
<PARA> The most significant change required in the content of annual reports is an increased emphasis on program performance. This change flows directly from and is a necessary element of, recent managerial reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> The increased emphasis requires:</PARA>
<PARA>reporting performance at the sub-program level;</PARA>
<PARA>including a statement of the performance which had been anticipated for the year; and</PARA>
<PARA>including a statement of the performance anticipated for the following year. </PARA>
<PARA>These reforms would ensure that annual reports facilitate and encourage the assessment of departments on the basis of their performance rather than merely on the level of activity or on compliance with a decreasing body of centrally mandated processes. In encouraging assessment of departments on the basis of performance, such annual reports would help to bring external perceptions of departments more closely into line with the performance oriented managerial concepts which are being adopted by departments. </PARA>
<PARA>In adopting this recommendation the Committee believes that it will significantly increase the focus of parliament and the public on departmental performance rather than on inputs and processes and therefore believes that the adoption of this recommendation is fundamental. </PARA>
<PARA>Parliamentary Scrutiny of Performance</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee can see scope for benefit through a complementary reform of Parliamentary scrutiny introducing reviews based directly on departmental annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA> It is vital to emphasise that while Senators focus on concerns of performance and results in the course of Senate Estimates hearings, two thirds of members of Commonwealth Parliament who are members of the House of Representatives do not have access to a parliamentary review system which could enable systematic review of performance of departments. This gap in the parliamentary scrutiny regime needs to be addressed and therefore issues of performance reporting in annual reports need to be considered in conjunction with proposals for expanded parliamentary scrutiny of annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA> To remedy this situation and to make Parliamentary use of annual reports more visible the Committee recommends that the Standing Committees of the House of Representatives be assigned the ongoing role of conducting reviews of departmental operations based upon the annual reports of departments. This recommendation is in line with the recommendation of the House of Representatives Procedure Committee in its report tabled in the House today. </PARA>
<PARA> The increase in visible use of reports by the parliament should provide an incentive for improved reporting. The Committee, in addition, has made a considerable number of recommendations relating to the content and presentation of annual reports and to the presentation of the Guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> The intention of the Committee has been to allow this report to be considered by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in drafting revised guidelines. To achieve this objective it was necessary for the Inquiry to be conducted in a tight timeframe. The Committee sought the view of parliamentarians, Commonwealth departments and the public but did not hold public hearings. The timeframe for the Inquiry was reflected in many of the deadlines set for individuals and organisations contributing to the Inquiry. The Committee thanks contributors for their efforts to meet those deadlines. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee wishes to place on record its appreciation to Mr Bert Johnston for his contribution to this report. </PARA>
<PARA> Annual reports are fundamental to the increased accountability regime proposed by the Committee in its work during the 35th Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that the critical focus of this report on annual report performance reporting by departments and intensified parliamentary scrutiny deserve the support of all members of the House and of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the report to the House. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT GUIDELINES FOR OFFICIAL WITNESSES BEFORE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES AND RELATED MATTERS</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President</PARA>
<PARA> For the information of Honourable Senators I table the revised Government Guidelines for Official Witnesses before Parliamentary Committees and Related Matters, and seek leave to have them incorporated in Hansard. I seek leave to make a statement about the guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Senate will recall, guidelines on these matters have been tabled in the Parliament for many years now, by the previous Government and by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Broadly speaking, the basic principles of the guidelines have remained unchanged throughout this period, and the Government is not proposing any fundamental change in this new version. </PARA>
<PARA> The revised guidelines take account, first, of the Senate's resolutions on parliamentary privilege of 25 February 1988 and, secondly, of experience in recent years in the interpretation and application of the guidelines when official witnesses appear before parliamentary committees. </PARA>
<PARA>This latter consideration has led to the objective of making the guidelines a simpler and clearer exposition, for both officials and the Parliament, of the responsibilities and rights of officials providing evidence to parliamentary committees, party committees and other inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I draw the attention of the Senate in particular to the first paragraph of the guidelines which refers to the fundamental issue of accountability. Indeed, since the concept of accountability provides the philosophical underpinning for these guidelines, as it has with their predecessors, I read that paragraph in full. </PARA>
<PARA>It states as follows:-</PARA>
<PARA>``1.1 In the Australian system of parliamentary government, and consistent with the traditional understanding of ministerial responsibility, the public and parliamentary advocacy and defence of government policies and administration has traditionally been, and should remain, the preserve of Ministers, not officials. The duty of the public servant is to assist Ministers to fulfil their accountability obligations by providing full and accurate information to the Parliament about the factual and technical background to policies and their administration. The guidelines are therefore aimed at encouraging the freest possible flow of such information between the public service, the Parliament and the public,''</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise here that the Government is fully committed to the objective just enunciated of encouraging as free as possible a flow of factual and technical information between the Public Service and the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe, however, that all members of Parliament will accept-as they have in the past-that a basic underlying premise of our system of government is that Ministers should be accountable to the Parliament for the administration of their Departments and for their ministerial conduct, and in particular that it is Ministers and not officials who are responsible for public promotion or defence of government policies. </PARA>
<PARA>While these basic concepts can be stated relatively simply, putting them into practice in modern government is not nearly as simple as it used to be, principally because the size and complexity of government has grown so much. </PARA>
<PARA>The legitimate role of the Parliament in scrutinising the activities of the executive has also become more demanding and more complex, and part of the response has been to expand the structure and functions of parliamentary committees. </PARA>
<PARA> Inevitably, also, there has been a significantly growing requirement for officials to be involved in parliamentary committee processes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government welcomes these developments which it regards as both proper and inevitable. </PARA>
<PARA> I note here, however, that it is often the case, when officials appear before parliamentary committees, that parliamentarians seek to gain political advantage from their interactions with officials by seeking to draw them into policy debate or otherwise seeking to elicit comment from them which goes beyond the bounds of their role of providing factual and technical information. </PARA>
<PARA> When this occurs, it can place officials in an invidious position. Clearly, they have a duty, as set out in these guidelines, to be helpful to the committee and provide as much relevant information as is available. but at the same time departmental officials are, rightly, aware of the established position of law and principle that their primary obligation is to the Minister and Government of the day-whatever its political complexion. </PARA>
<PARA> What these revised guidelines seek to do, against that background, is to provide clear and unequivocal guidance as to the respective roles of Ministers and officials in their relationships with parliamentary committees. They seek to explain, as simply as possible, the practical implications of the basic concept of accountability which I referred to at the outset. </PARA>
<PARA> I am, of course, conscious of the growing interest in the Parliament-and particularly in some of its committees-in seeking ways to improve the processes of scrutiny of the executive and to give more practical meaning to the concept of accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has, from the very beginning of its period of office, taken very seriously its responsibilities and accountability to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the reforms which it has introduced in public sector management have been designed in a way which increases the amount of information available to the Parliament-and to the public-of relevance to the establishment of an effective scrutiny process. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, I draw attention to the innovations of the Government in publishing forward estimates of expenditure and in moving progressively towards the provision of far more comprehensive material on the outcomes of government activity. This enables, of course, better assessment of the effectiveness of government activity where such material is added to the material traditionally available on inputs. </PARA>
<PARA> Also of particular importance have been the increasing moves towards taking authority from central agencies and placing it in operating Departments, both in relation to financial management and general management responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government acknowledges, however, that some of these reforms, including those just referred to, have made it necessary to reconsider the most effective approach to scrutiny, and to consider how best to clarify the practical application of the established principles of accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, against that background, I am confident that these guidelines provide both the Parliament and officials with a sound basis for a continuing productive relationship which, amongst other things, will encourage proper consideration of the issues just referred to. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the outset, the Government is determined that the Parliament and its committees should have full and proper access to the factual and technical material that officials are able to provide. </PARA>
<PARA> For their part, Senators and Members should be conscious in their dealings with officials that the Commonwealth is fortunate to have a Public Service that is apolitical in the best sense of the word. </PARA>
<PARA> Ultimately, that is what the guidelines seek to preserve and protect. </PARA>
<PARA> That protection will be the greater if all participants in the process understand and support by their actions the underlying principles which the guidelines espouse. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the guidelines to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>GOVERNMENT GUIDELINES FOR OFFICIAL WITNESSES BEFORE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES AND RELATED MATTERS</PARA>
<PARA>INTRODUCTION</PARA>
<PARA>Accountability</PARA>
<PARA>1.1 In the Australian system of parliamentary government, and consistent with the traditional understanding of ministerial responsibility, the public and parliamentary advocacy and defence of government policies and administration has traditionally been, and should remain, the preserve of Ministers, not officials. The duty of the public servant is to assist ministers to fulfil their accountability obligations by providing full and accurate information to the Parliament about the factual and technical background to policies and their administration. The guidelines are therefore aimed at encouraging the freest possible flow of such information between the public service, the Parliament and the public. </PARA>
<PARA>Scope of guidelines</PARA>
<PARA>1.2 The guidelines apply primarily to the preparation of submissions and the giving of evidence to parliamentary committees by officials, although sections 3-6 also discuss their relevance to contexts outside parliamentary committees, including party committees, Royal Commissions, individual Members of Parliament, speeches, public inquiries and court appearances. </PARA>
<PARA>1.3 The previous version of the guidelines was tabled in the Parliament in August 1984. Changes have been made to take account of the Senate Parliamentary Privilege Resolutions of 25 February 1988 (see Appendix) and recent experience with the appearance of witnesses before parliamentary committees. </PARA>
<PARA>PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES</PARA>
<PARA>Application of Guidelines</PARA>
<PARA>2.1 This section is designed to assist departmental officials, statutory office holders and the staff of statutory authorities appearing before parliamentary committees, by informing them of the principles they are required by the Government to follow. It is recognised, however, that the role and nature of some statutory authorities will require the selective application of these guidelines (see paragraph 2.49). </PARA>
<PARA>Parliamentary rules of procedure</PARA>
<PARA>2.2 This section also takes into account the Senate Parliamentary Privilege Resolutions of 25 February 1988 which include procedures to be observed by Senate committees in their dealings with witnesses. (References to the Senate resolutions in these guidelines appear as r.1.1; r.1.6 etc.) At the time of tabling these guidelines, the House of Representatives had not dealt with the committee procedures which have been proposed by the Standing Committee on Procedure. These are broadly similar, with some additions, to the procedures adopted by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>2.3 These guidelines should, nonetheless, be read in conjunction with the Senate Parliamentary Privilege Resolutions, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure's Report on Committee Procedures for Dealing with Witnesses dated 4 April 1989 and the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987, particularly sections 13 and 16. </PARA>
<PARA>Inquiries into administrative matters</PARA>
<PARA>2.4 Where a committee's inquiry is directed towards the examination of departmental administration and practice, it is for the departmental Secretary, with the general consent of the relevant Minister, to use his or her discretion as to the extent to which aspects of these guidelines, such as the clearing of written evidence and the selection of witnesses, are to be followed. In this context a witness should also be aware of the provisions of s.12 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act (see para 2.40). </PARA>
<PARA>Committees dealing with individual conduct</PARA>
<PARA>2.5 Where a committee is inquiring into the personal actions of a Minister (or official) and seeks information from officials, there may be circumstances where it is not appropriate for the requirements set out in para 2.14 for clearance of evidence to be followed. (Note also that the Senate resolutions provide that a witness may apply to have assistance from counsel during the course of a hearing (r.1.14 and r.1.15). See para 2.42. </PARA>
<PARA>Joint Statutory Committees</PARA>
<PARA>2.6 The Public Works Committee Act 1969, the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951 and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 provide for the summoning of witnesses and raise some special considerations. For example, s.23 of the Public Works Committee Act makes special provision for hearing of evidence on confidential matters and the Public Accounts Committee Act and the Public Works Committee Act have special provisions relating, among other things, to self-incriminating evidence (see ss.19 and 25, respectively). In these and similar cases, the special provisions of the relevant Acts take precedence. </PARA>
<PARA>PRELIMINARIES TO AN INQUIRY</PARA>
<PARA>Requests for attendance</PARA>
<PARA>2.7 Generally requests for an official to attend a committee hearing in an official capacity, or to provide material to it, are made through the relevant Minister. There are, however, exceptions-for example the Estimates Committees and the Public Accounts Committee (see para 2.4). (Note also that the Senate resolutions provide that a witness will be invited to give evidence or produce documents, but may be summoned to do so if circumstances warrant such an order (r.1.1 and r.1.2).)</PARA>
<PARA>Choice of witnesses</PARA>
<PARA>2.8 A Minister may delegate to the departmental Secretary the responsibility of deciding the official(s) most appropriate to provide the information sought by the committee. It is essential that the official(s) selected should have sufficient responsibility or be sufficiently close to the particular work area to be able to satisfy the committee's requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>Preparation of witnesses</PARA>
<PARA>2.9 It is also essential that all witnesses are thoroughly prepared for hearings. Such preparation should include ensuring familiarity with probable lines of questioning, either by discussion with the committee secretariat or, in the case of Estimates and similar inquiries, by ascertaining from the committee secretary or from Hansard and other sources the issues that are likely to be of interest to committee members. Officers who have not previously attended committee hearings should receive briefing on the requirements, and senior officers should satisfy themselves, so far as possible, that all witnesses are capable of giving evidence creditably. </PARA>
<PARA>Consultation with Ministers</PARA>
<PARA>2.10 As appropriate, witnesses should consult the Minister before a hearing and, if required, the Minister representing in the other House. Examples of the need for such consultation would be in relation to possible claims that it would be in the public interest to withhold certain documents or oral evidence, or requests for the hearing of evidence in camera (see paras 2.22 to 2.38). </PARA>
<PARA>Senate resolutions</PARA>
<PARA>2.11 Officers appearing before Senate Committees should also make themselves aware of the Senate resolutions relating to the rights of witnesses (r.1.1-r.1.18) and matters which may be treated as a contempt of the Parliament (r.3 and r.6.1-r.6.16)</PARA>
<PARA>Preparation of written material</PARA>
<PARA>2.12 In the normal course, departments should provide a written statement on which subsequent oral evidence will be based (see r.1.4). In addition, where a committee asks written questions, written replies should be provided. All written material (authorised in accordance with these guidelines) should be sent to the committee secretary. </PARA>
<PARA>2.13 When the interests of several departments are involved, adequate consultation is to take place in preparing material and making arrangements for witnesses to attend. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearance with Minister</PARA>
<PARA>2.14 Submissions should be cleared to appropriate levels within the department, and normally with the Minister, in accordance with arrangements approved by the Minister(s) concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>Matters of policy</PARA>
<PARA>2.15 Such submissions:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) should not advocate, defend or canvass the merits of government policies (including policies of previous Commonwealth Governments, or State or foreign governments);</PARA>
<PARA>(b) may describe those policies and the administrative arrangements and procedures involved in implementing them;</PARA>
<PARA>(c) should not identify considerations leading to government decisions or possible decisions, in areas of any sensitivity, unless those considerations have already been made public or the Minister authorises the department to identify them; and</PARA>
<PARA>(d) may, after consultation with the Minister, and especially when the Government is encouraging public discussion of issues, set our policy options and list the main advantages and disadvantages, but should not reflect on the merits of any judgment the Government may have made on those options or otherwise promote a particular policy viewpoint. </PARA>
<PARA>2.16 In relation to the matters in para 2.15 (a) above, the proper course is for Ministers to make written submissions, to appear personally, to arrange for Ministers representing them to appear personally, or to invite committees to submit questions on policy issues in writing. </PARA>
<PARA>2.17 In relation to para 2.15 (c), the normal course is for Ministers to canvass the material in these categories, but if departments are to canvass such material, they should clearly bring it to the Minister's attention when seeking clearance for the submission. </PARA>
<PARA>Requests for more time to prepare evidence</PARA>
<PARA>2.18 The Minister (or the department on his or her behalf) may ask the committee for more time to prepare evidence, if the notice is considered insufficient. The Senate resolutions provide for a witness to be given reasonable notice and an indication of the matters expected to be dealt with (r. 1.3). </PARA>
<PARA>CONDUCT DURING HEARINGS</PARA>
<PARA>General Principles</PARA>
<PARA>2.19 As described above (para 1.1), it is intended, subject to the application of certain necessary principles, that there be the freest possible flow of information between the public service, the Parliament and the public. To this end, officials should be open with committees and if unable or unwilling to answer questions or provide information should say so, and give reasons. It is also, of course, incumbent on officials to maintain the highest standards of courtesy in their dealings with parliamentary committees. </PARA>
<PARA>2.20 These guidelines, and particularly paras 2.15 and 2.32-2.36, should be read in the context of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (the FOI Act). The Act establishes minimum standards of disclosure of documents held by the Commonwealth. It is not, however, a code governing release of documents or information generally as there are many other means of obtaining information from Government (e.g. press releases, annual reports, etc.). Any material which would not be exempt under this legislation should (with the knowledge of the Minister in sensitive cases or where the Minister has a particular interest or has been involved) be produced or given, on request, to a parliamentary committee. Moreover, it may be in the public interest to provide to the committee a document or information for which exemption would normally be claimed under the Act. The exemptions in the Act should therefore be viewed from the perspective of the proper role and functions of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>2.21 So far as relevant, the guidelines in paras 2.12-2.18 above relating to written material apply also to oral evidence. </PARA>
<PARA>Limitations upon officials' evidence</PARA>
<PARA>2.22 There are three main areas in which officials need to be alert to the possibility that they may not be able to provide committees with all the information they seek, or may need to request restrictions on the provision of such information. These are:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) matters of policy;</PARA>
<PARA>(b) public interest immunity; and</PARA>
<PARA>(c) confidential material where in camera evidence is desirable. </PARA>
<PARA>The conduct of official witnesses in relation to these areas is described in detail below (paras 2.25-2.38). </PARA>
<PARA>Clarification or amplification of evidence</PARA>
<PARA>2.23 In addition, committees may occasionally seek information which may properly be given, but where officials are unsure of the facts, or do not have the information to hand. In such cases witnesses should qualify their answers as necessary so as to avoid misleading the committee, and, if appropriate, should give undertakings to provide further clarifying information. It is particularly important to submit such further material without delay. </PARA>
<PARA>Questions about other departments' responsibilities</PARA>
<PARA>2.24 It is also important that witnesses should take care not to intrude into responsibilities of other departments and agencies (see also para 2.13). Where a question falls within the administration of another department or agency, an official witness may request that it be directed to that department or agency or be deferred until that department or agency is consulted. </PARA>
<PARA>Matters of policy</PARA>
<PARA>2.25 The role of an official witness is not to comment on policy but to speak to any statement provided to the committee and to provide factual and background material to assist understanding of the issues involved. The detailed rules applying to written submissions (para 2.15) also apply to oral evidence. Note, however, that such restrictions do not necessarily apply to statutory officers (see para 2.49). </PARA>
<PARA>2.26 The Senate resolutions provide that ``An officer of a department of the Commonwealth or of a State shall not be asked to give opinions on matters of policy, and shall be given reasonable opportunity to refer questions asked of the officer to superior officers or to a Minister'' (r.1.16). The resolutions also prescribe the procedure by which a witness may object to answering ``any question put to the witness'' on ``any ground'' (r.1.10). This would include the ground that the question requires the witness to give an opinion on a matter of policy contrary to r.1.16. In such a situation an officer may ask the person chairing the committee to consider whether questions which fall within the parameters of policy positions (outlined in para 2.15) are in order. Moreover, the resolutions provide scope for a witness to make a statement about matters of concern to the witness in pre-hearing discussions before appearing at the committee hearing (r.1.5). </PARA>
<PARA>2.27 If an official witness is directed to answer a ``policy'' question, and has not (in line with para 2.17) previously cleared the matter with the Minister, the officer should ask to be allowed to defer the answer until such clearance is obtained. Alternatively, it may be appropriate for the witness to refer to the written material provided to the committee and offer, if the committee wishes, to seek elaboration from the Minister; or to request that the answer to a particular question be reserved for submission in writing. </PARA>
<PARA>PUBLIC INTEREST IMMUNITY</PARA>
<PARA>Claims to be made by Ministers</PARA>
<PARA>2.28 Claims that information should be withheld from disclosure on grounds of public interest (public interest immunity) should only be made by Ministers (normally the responsible Minister in consultation with the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister). </PARA>
<PARA>2.29 As far as practicable, decisions to claim public interest immunity should take place before hearings, so that the necessary documentation can be produced at the time. The normal means of claiming public interest immunity is by way of a letter from the Minister to the committee chairman. The Attorney-General's Department should be consulted on appropriateness of the claim in the particular circumstances and the method of making the claim. </PARA>
<PARA>2.30 As a matter of practice, before making a claim of public interest immunity, a Minister might explore with a committee the possibility of providing the information in a form or under conditions which would not give rise to a need for the claim (including on a confidential basis or in camera, see paras 2.35-2.36). </PARA>
<PARA>Matters arising during hearing</PARA>
<PARA>2.31 If an official witness, when giving evidence to a committee, believes that circumstances have arisen to justify a claim of public interest immunity, the official should request a postponement of the evidence, or of the relevant part of the evidence, until the Minister can be consulted. </PARA>
<PARA>Scope of public interest immunity</PARA>
<PARA>2.32 Documents-or oral evidence-which could form the basis of a claim of public interest immunity may include matters falling into the following categories that coincide with some exemption provisions of the FOI Act:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) material the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to cause damage to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) national security, defence, or international relations; or</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) relations with the States;</PARA>
<PARA> including disclosure of documents or information obtained in confidence from other governments;</PARA>
<PARA>(b) material disclosing any deliberation or decision of the Cabinet, other than a decision that has been officially published, or purely factual material the disclosure of which would not reveal a decision or deliberation not officially published;</PARA>
<PARA>(c) material disclosing any deliberation of or advice to the Executive Council, other than a document by which an act of the Governor-General in Council was officially published;</PARA>
<PARA>(d) material disclosing matters in the nature of, or relating to, opinion, advice or recommendation obtained, prepared or recorded, or consultation or deliberation that has taken place in the course of, or for the purpose of, the deliberative processes involved in the functions of the Government where disclosure would be contrary to the public interest;</PARA>
<PARA>(e) material relating to law enforcement or protection of public safety which would, or could reasonably be expected to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) prejudice the investigation of a possible breach of the law or the enforcement of the law in a particular instance;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) disclose, or enable a person to ascertain the existence or identity of a confidential source of information, in relation to the enforcement or administration of the law;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) endanger the life or physical safety of any person;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) prejudice the fair trial of a person or the impartial adjudication of a particular case;</PARA>
<PARA> (v) disclose lawful methods or procedures for preventing, detecting, investigating, or dealing with matters arising out of, breaches or evasions of the law the disclosure of which would, or would be reasonably likely to, prejudice the effectiveness of those methods or procedures; or</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) prejudice the maintenance or enforcement of lawful methods for the protection of public safety; and</PARA>
<PARA>(f) material subject to legal professional privilege. </PARA>
<PARA>It must be emphasised that the provisions of the FOI Act have no actual application as such to parliamentary inquiries, but are merely a general guide to the grounds on which a parliamentary inquiry may be asked not to press for particular information, and that the public interest in providing information to a parliamentary inquiry may override any particular ground for not disclosing information. For a more detailed understanding of the above exemption provisions, reference should be made to the FOI Act and to separate guidelines on its operation issued by the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA>2.33 In addition the following considerations may affect a decision whether to make documents or information available:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) secrecy provisions of Acts: Attorney-General's Department should be consulted when occasions involving such provisions arise; and</PARA>
<PARA>(b) court orders or sub judice issues: where the provision of information would appear to be restricted by a court order, or where the question of possible prejudice to court proceedings could arise, the Attorney-General's Department should be consulted although decisions on the application of the subjudice rule are for the committee to determine, not witnesses. </PARA>
<PARA>Classified documents</PARA>
<PARA>2.34 Documents, and oral information relating to documents, having a national security classification of `confidential', `secret' or `top secret' would normally be within one of the categories in para 2.32, particularly para 2.32 (a). Before producing a document bearing such a classification, an official witness should seek declassification of the document. (Note that it does not follow that documents without a formal security classification may not be the subject of a claim of immunity. Nor does it follow that classified documents may not in any circumstances be produced. Each document should be considered on its merits and where classified, in consultation with the originator.)</PARA>
<PARA>In camera evidence</PARA>
<PARA>2.35 There may be occasions when a Minister (or, on his or her behalf, the departmental Secretary) would wish, on balancing the public interests involved, to raise with the committee the possibility of an official producing documents or giving oral evidence in camera, and on the basis that the information be not disclosed or published except with the Minister's consent (see r.1.7, r.1.8 and r.2.7). It should be noted that Estimates Committees have no power to take evidence in camera or to treat documents submitted to them as in camera evidence. </PARA>
<PARA>Matters arising during hearing</PARA>
<PARA>2.36 If, when giving evidence to a committee, an official witness believes that circumstances have arisen to justify requesting that evidence be heard in camera, the official should make such a request if the possibility has been foreshadowed with the Minister or should ask for the postponement of the evidence or the relevant part of the evidence until the Minister can be consulted. (The Senate resolutions provide that ``A witness shall be offered, before giving evidence, the opportunity to make application, before or during the hearing of the witness's evidence, for any or all of the witness's evidence to be heard in private session, and shall be invited to give reasons for any such application. If the application is not granted, the witness shall be notified of reasons for the decision.'' (See r.1.7 and also r.1.8 relating to the publication of evidence given in camera.)</PARA>
<PARA>2.37 These circumstances might include cases where:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) although a claim of public interest immunity could be justified, the Minister considers that the balance of public interest lies in making information available to the committee;</PARA>
<PARA>(b) while a claim of immunity may not be appropriate, other social considerations justify the committee being asked to take evidence privately. Examples, which parallel other exemption provisions in Part IV of the FOI Act, are evidence the public disclosure of which would:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) affect law enforcement or protection of public safety;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) have a substantial adverse effect on financial or property interests of the Commonwealth;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) prejudice the attainment of the objects or effectiveness of procedures or methods for the conduct of tests, examinations or audits of a Commonwealth agency;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) have a substantial adverse effect on the management or assessment of personnel, or on the proper and efficient conduct of the operations of a Commonwealth agency including the conduct by the Commonwealth of industrial relations;</PARA>
<PARA> (v) unreasonably disclose information relating to the personal affairs of any person. Note also that the Senate resolutions provide that a committee may consider taking in camera evidence reflecting adversely on a person (see r.1.11-r.1.13, r.2.1-r.2.3). The Privacy Act 1988, in particular Part III which explains Information Privacy Principles, is also relevant;</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) reveal business affairs, including trade secrets or other commercially sensitive information;</PARA>
<PARA> (vii) reasonably be expected to have a substantial adverse effect on the management of the economy or on the conduct of business generally; or</PARA>
<PARA> (viii) disclose material obtained in confidence;</PARA>
<PARA>(c) similar or identical evidence has been previously given in camera to other hearings of the committee or other committees of the Parliament and has not been made public. </PARA>
<PARA>Committee requests for evidence off the record</PARA>
<PARA>2.38 An official who is asked by a committee to give evidence `off the record', unless this refers to evidence given in camera or evidence of which there is to be no transcript taken, should appreciate that technically there is no such category as `off the record' evidence which has any special protection or status. In the event an official is asked to give evidence `off the record', however, he/she should request a postponement until the Minister can be consulted, unless the possibility has been clearly foreshadowed with the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>Protection of submissions and witnesses</PARA>
<PARA>Parliamentary privilege</PARA>
<PARA>2.39 The act of submitting a document to a parliamentary committee is protected by parliamentary privilege: Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987, paragraph 16 (2) (b). Any publication of the submission other than to the committee, however, is protected by parliamentary privilege only if that publication takes place by or pursuant to the order of the committee, in which case the content of the document is also protected: paragraph 16 (2) (d) of the Act. The protection of parliamentary privilege means that a person cannot be sued or prosecuted in respect of the act or the material protected, nor can that act or material be used against a person in legal proceedings. The unauthorised disclosure of a document or evidence submitted to a parliamentary committee, that is, a disclosure not authorised by the committee or the House concerned, may be treated as a criminal offence under section 13 of the Act or as a contempt (r.6.16). </PARA>
<PARA>Contempt of the Parliament</PARA>
<PARA>2.40 It is an offence against s.12 (1) of the Parliamentary Privileges Act for a person, by fraud, intimidation, force or threat, by the offer or promise of any inducement or benefit, or by other improper means, to influence another person in respect of any evidence given or to be given before a House of the Parliament or a committee, or to induce another person to refrain from giving any such evidence. It is also an offence, under s.12 (2) of that Act, for a person to inflict any penalty or injury upon, or deprive another person of any benefit, any person on account of the giving or proposed giving of any evidence, or of any evidence given or to be given, before a House or a Committee. It should be noted that the existence of s.12 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act does not prevent imposition by a House of a penalty (see s.12 (3)). In particular, those kinds of conduct are also punishable as a contempt by the Senate (r.6.10 and r.6.11 respectively) or the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA>Self incrimination</PARA>
<PARA>2.41 In general a witness cannot refuse to answer a question or produce documents on the ground that the answer to the question or the production of documents might incriminate the witness. The exceptions to this are witnesses appearing before the Public Accounts Committee or the Public Works Committee (see s.19 of the Public Accounts Committee Act, s.25 of the Public Works Committee Act and para 2.6). In such cases parliamentary privileges protects a witness against only that evidence itself being used against the witness outside the Parliament; (for example, as evidence in proceedings before the courts). A witness may request the committee to take the evidence in camera in those circumstances (see r.1.7 and r.1.8). The Senate resolutions also outline a procedure for considering claims by a witness that he or she not answer a question on grounds of self-incrimination (r.1.10 and r.2.5). </PARA>
<PARA>Access to counsel</PARA>
<PARA>2.42 A witness may apply to have assistance from counsel in the course of a hearing. In considering such an application, a committee shall have regard to the need for the witness to be accompanied by counsel to ensure the proper protection of the witness. If an application is not granted, the witness shall be notified of reasons for that decision (see r.1.14). If an application is granted, the witness shall be given reasonable opportunity to consult general counsel during a committee hearing (see r.1.15). </PARA>
<PARA>2.43 In normal circumstances officials should not need counsel when appearing before parliamentary committees. Should the need arise, however, the Attorney-General's Department should be consulted. </PARA>
<PARA>Correction of Evidence</PARA>
<PARA>2.44 After perusing the record of their evidence, official witnesses should propose for the committee's consideration any necessary corrections for incorporation or noting in the published record. Where these affect the substance of evidence previously given, it may be necessary to seek the agreement of the committee on the way in which the correction should be made, e.g. by tendering a subsequent statement. The Senate resolutions provide that ``Reasonable opportunity shall be afforded to witnesses to make corrections of errors of transcription in the transcript of their evidence and to put before a committee additional material supplementary to their evidence'' (r.1.17). </PARA>
<PARA>2.45 Also, if a witness believes, after perusing the record, that he or she has omitted some relevant evidence, the witness should, having consulted with the Minister (or departmental Secretary), seek leave of the committee to lodge a supplementary statement or to give further oral evidence. All supplementary written material (authorised in accordance with these guidelines) should be forwarded to the committee secretary. </PARA>
<PARA>Publication of evidence</PARA>
<PARA>2.46 Evidence provided to committees in a public hearing is normally published in the form of a Hansard record. </PARA>
<PARA>2.47 Authority for the publication of evidence, whether taken in public or in camera, is vested in Parliamentary committees by virtue of s.2 (2) of the Parliamentary Papers Act 1908. Evidence taken in camera is confidential and its publications without a committee's consent constitutes a contempt (see s.13 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1947 and r.6.16). Note, too, that s.46 of the FOI Act provides for documents to be exempt if disclosure would infringe parliamentary privilege. </PARA>
<PARA>Proposals to publish in camera evidence</PARA>
<PARA>2.48 If a committee seeks an official witness's concurrence to publish the witness's in camera evidence, he or she should ask the committee to delay the decision to enable the witness to consult the Minister or the departmental Secretary. A committee will not normally authorise the publication of in camera evidence without the concurrence of the witness, although such concurrence is not a binding requirement (see r.1.8). </PARA>
<PARA>Official witnesses from statutory authorities</PARA>
<PARA>2.49 Members of authorities which have statutory public information and education roles clearly are able to express views on the policy responsibilities of their authorities. However, care should be taken to avoid taking partisan positions on matters of political controversy. In other respects these guidelines should be followed as far as is relevant including in relation to claims of public interest immunity (see para 2.28). </PARA>
<PARA>Appearance in a `personal' capacity</PARA>
<PARA>2.50 There is no intention for there to be any restriction on officers appearing before parliamentary committees in their `personal' capacity. An officer so called, however, should pay heed to the guidelines relating to public comment contained in the Guidelines on Official Conduct of Commonwealth Public Servants (July 1987). As the guidelines emphasise, it is particularly important for senior officials to give careful consideration to the impact, by virtue of their positions, of any comment they might make. Indeed heads of agencies and other very senior officers need to consider carefully whether, in particular cases, it is possible for them realistically to claim to appear in a `personal' rather than an `official' capacity, particularly if they are likely to be asked to comment on matters which fall within or impinge on their area of responsibility. An officer who is appearing before a committee in a personal capacity should make it clear to the committee that the officer's appearance is not in an official capacity. </PARA>
<PARA>Party Committees</PARA>
<PARA>3.1 It is quite appropriate for officials, subject to ministerial authorisation, to make themselves available to brief party committees to assist them in understanding the technical and factual background to government policies and proposals, including details and/or explanations of proposed legislation. Departmental officials will not be expected, or authorised, to express opinions on matters of a policy or party political nature (see paras 2.15 and 2.25). The guidelines for submissions to and appearances before parliamentary committees apply to briefing of party committees, subject to paras 3.2-3.7 below. </PARA>
<PARA>3.2 Committee requests for such briefing should be directed to the Minister concerned. It will also be open to Ministers to initiate proposals for briefing of committees, where they consider this to be desirable. </PARA>
<PARA>3.3 Where considered appropriate or desirable, Ministers may elect to be present at discussions with Government party committees, to deal with questions of a policy or party political nature. </PARA>
<PARA>3.4 Where the Minister does not attend the committee proceedings, officials should keep the Minister informed of the nature of the discussions and of any matters the officials could not resolve to the committee's satisfaction. </PARA>
<PARA>3.5 Party committees do not have the powers or privileges of parliamentary committees. Consequently officials appearing before them do not have the protection afforded to witnesses appearing before parliamentary committees (see paras 2.39 and 2.41). Party committee hearings, however, are not generally held in public. </PARA>
<PARA>Individual members of Parliament</PARA>
<PARA>4.1 Members of Parliament usually request information through the responsible Minister, but direct approaches to officials for routine factual information, particularly on constituency matters, are also traditional and appropriate. When a request amounts to no more than a request for readily available factual information, the information should obviously be provided, although depending on the nature or significance of a request, an official may judge it appropriate to inform the departmental Secretary of the request and response. Ministers should be informed of any matter which is likely to involve them. </PARA>
<PARA>4.2 There may be other occasions where a Member of Parliament's request raises sensitive issues. For example, where expressions of opinion are sought on government policies or alternative policies, as distinct from explanation of existing policies. Officials will not be expected or authorised to express opinions on government policies, policy options or matters of a party political nature. Information provided may, however, include details of administrative arrangements and procedures involved in the implementation of approved policies or legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>4.3 If a Member of Parliament seeks expressions of opinion on government policies or policy options, it would be appropriate to suggest that the Member pursue the matter with the Minister. Similar action would be appropriate if a request raised other issues of a sensitive nature, or where the answering of a request would necessitate the use of substantial resources of the department or authority. </PARA>
<PARA>4.4 Care should be taken to avoid unauthorised disclosure of classified or otherwise confidential information-for example, where a breach of personal or commercial privacy could be involved. </PARA>
<PARA>4.5 Where an official considers that the terms of a request would require going beyond the authorised scope of the above arrangements, the official should so indicate to the Member, and would be at liberty to raise the matter with the departmental Secretary and the Minister and, if desired, with the Public Service Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>Special arrangements for pre-election consultation with officials by the Opposition</PARA>
<PARA>4.6 On 5 June 1987 the Government tabled in the Parliament specific guidelines relating to consultation by the Opposition with officials during the pre-election period. These guidelines, which are almost identical with guidelines first tabled on 9 December 1976, are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) The pre-election period is to date from three months prior to the expiry of the House of Representatives or the date of announcement of the House of Representatives election, whichever date comes first. It does not apply in respect of Senate elections only. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Under the special arrangement, shadow Ministers may be given approval to have discussions with appropriate officials of government departments. Party leaders may have other Members of Parliament or their staff members present. A departmental Secretary may have other officials present. </PARA>
<PARA> (iii) The procedure will be initiated by the relevant Opposition spokesperson making a request of the Minister concerned who is to notify the Prime Minister of the request and whether it has been agreed. </PARA>
<PARA> (iv) The discussions will be at the initiative of the non-government parties, not officials. Officials will inform their Ministers when the discussions are taking place. </PARA>
<PARA> (v) Officials will not be authorised to discuss government policies or to give opinions on matters of a party political nature. The subject matter of the discussions would relate to the machinery of government and administration. The discussions may include the administrative and technical practicalities and procedures involved in implementation of policies proposed by the non-government parties. If the Opposition representatives raised matters which, in the judgment of the officials, sought information on government policies or sought expressions of opinion on alternative policies, the officials would suggest that the matter be raised with the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> (vi) The detailed substance of the discussions will be confidential but Ministers will be entitled to seek from officials general information on whether the discussions kept within the agreed purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>Appearances before the Bar of a House of the Parliament</PARA>
<PARA>5.1 It would be only in exceptional circumstances that an official would be summoned to the bar of a House of the Parliament and each case would need individual consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>5.2 As a general rule, it would be appropriate for these guidelines to be followed in so far as they apply to the particular circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>Non-Parliamentary Public Inquiries (including Royal Commissions) and speeches</PARA>
<PARA>6.1 The guidelines for submissions to and appearances before parliamentary committees generally apply to submissions to and appearances before other public inquiries, and to the preparation and presentation of speeches by officials in their official capacity. </PARA>
<PARA>Speeches</PARA>
<PARA>6.2 Subject to these guidelines, officers, other than those employed in areas where national security or other reasons demand confidentiality, should be prepared to make themselves available to attend and address conferences in their areas of professional expertise. Speeches in such circumstances should aim to provide the necessary factual information and analytical material to promote informed public discussion. Such activities should be regarded as part of the normal interchange of information between government and community groups. </PARA>
<PARA>6.3 The Minister may decide to authorise the departmental Secretary to clear material for speeches. Subject to ministerial guidance, the Secretary is responsible for instituting appropriate departmental rules. Officials will often also find it necessary to speak in their official capacity without having the opportunity to clear the substance of their comments (for example, in open discussions at public seminars). In such cases officials should heed the rules laid down by the departmental Secretary and the Guidelines on Official Conduct of Commonwealth Public Servants concerning public comment by public servants. In particular, they should avoid taking partisan positions on policy issues or matters of public controversy. </PARA>
<PARA>Foreign Service</PARA>
<PARA>6.4 Heads of Australian diplomatic or consular posts and senior officials serving abroad have the responsibility in countries to which they are accredited to explain, advocate or defend the Government's international and domestic policies through public speeches, conferences, media enquiries, appearances before host government parliamentary committees, etc. It may not always be possible for officers to obtain ministerial or departmental clearance. It is expected, however, that public comment will be consistent with authorised policies in all respects. </PARA>
<PARA>Royal Commissions and bodies with Royal Commission powers</PARA>
<PARA>6.5 Officials appearing before Royal Commissions established by the Commonwealth should take note of the provisions of the Royal Commissions Act 1902. The categories of evidence enumerated in para 2.32 above are also appropriate to claims of public interest immunity before a Commonwealth Royal Commission. The circumstances in which the Commission might be asked to hear evidence in camera are also likely to be the same as those listed at para 2.37 above. </PARA>
<PARA>6.6. An official appearing before a Commonwealth Royal Commission or similar body may not refuse to answer a question (or to produce a document or other item) on the ground that the giving of the answer or the production of the document or item might tend to be self-incriminatory. This rule does not apply where an official has been charged with an offence and the charge has not been officially dealt with by a court or otherwise disposed of. </PARA>
<PARA>6.7 Where guidance is required regarding counsel for officials-including about legal aid-advice should be sought from the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA>State inquiries (parliamentary and other)</PARA>
<PARA>6.8 Where additional guidance is required regarding appearances before State inquiries, advice should be sought from the Attorney-General's Department. Such advice should also be sought where a claim of public interest immunity may be under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>Courts and tribunals</PARA>
<PARA>6.9 Where officials require further guidance or counsel in respect of their appearance before and giving evidence to courts of law and tribunals-particularly concerning possible claims of public interest immunity-advice should be sought from the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement and paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not intend to deal with the matter in any depth today but I think it does require a few comments. Parliamentary accountability is in our view vitally important and I think it is fair to say that it is this chamber which is responsible for most parliamentary accountability within this building. We are obviously interested in the new guidelines for official witnesses appearing before parliamentary committees, as they have been tabled by the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) today. </PARA>
<PARA> The importance of these guidelines relates to our observation that the business of government is now so complicated that it is practically impossible to have reasonable parliamentary accountability without an information base that needs to be provided from time to time by officials. However, we recognise that in doing this-and recognising the Government's willingness to allow officials to appear to provide that information base to committees, which is a flow-on from a policy that we adopted in government in the past-there are, nevertheless, some areas of difficulty. Those areas particularly relate to questions concerning policy, when it might seem that an official is being asked to contribute knowledge that covers an area of policy rather than an area of information. We respect that difficulty and we seek not to cross that line, although we recognise that from time to time it is a difficult line to draw. </PARA>
<PARA> We also, of course, look for the cooperation of Ministers in this regard because it is a two-way street. Ministers who are not prepared to be cooperative with parliamentary committees-and we have had a few examples in recent times-do not do the parliamentary process any good. They do not facilitate proper parliamentary responsibility-their responsibility to the Parliament. If they thwart that pillar of democracy, in the long term they will not be serving this institution in a way that they should see as their responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> We welcome the new guidelines. We recognise that they are largely unchanged from those put down in the past, except that they have been updated to recognise a few changes that have occurred, such as Senate resolutions in relation to parliamentary privilege. We recognise and accept the restatement of the philosophy behind the parliamentary accountability system and the way in which this Government, following our last government, continues to make public servants available on this basis. In this contribution we do not say that we are wedded to all of the detail that this Government has set down. We reserve our right to vary the conditions when we come to government and we will certainly do so if we think that it is in the best interests of parliamentary responsibility. The practice of putting down these guidelines and the practice of government and Ministers allowing their public servants to appear before committees and to provide information to parliamentary committees is a practice which we applaud and which we will certainly continue in government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a couple of remarks about the revised guidelines tabled by the Government. The first point is that it is noted in the guidelines, and I think it is a matter of some regret that the House of Representatives has not followed the Senate's lead with regard to a detailed motion of the rights of witnesses appearing before committees. I understand that a committee has recommended to the House of Representatives that it should adopt such guidelines, but at the moment such guidelines have not been adopted by the House. Hence the detailed guidelines that the Senate has with regard to witnesses appearing before its committees have been almost de facto adopted within these guidelines by the Government as accepted by the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The media seems to be somewhat confused about, and keeps writing about, the Parliament finishing its deliberations tomorrow. It seems to be unable to distinguish between the House of Representatives and the Parliament. The Government here seems unable to distinguish between the Parliament and the Senate. I would have hoped that in the time that was available to the Government this week-there does not seem to be much business being processed in the House of Representatives at the moment-and as the Government saw fit to table such a document, the Government would have also seen fit to adopt the types of resolutions adopted by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point that I wish to raise is raised on page 4. It is not a matter of methodology, but rather a matter of principle. I refer to the paragraph which discusses the fact that some politicians may seek to make political advantage in their interaction with officials. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>When this occurs, it can place officials in an invidious position. Clearly, they have a duty as set out in these guidelines, to be helpful to the committee and provide as much relevant information as is available. But at the same time departmental officials are, rightly, aware of the established position of law and principle that their primary obligation is to the Minister and Government of the day-whatever its political complexion. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that glosses over a very important debate that has occurred, not only in Australia, but also in Britain and in other countries that operate according to the Westminster system. That debate concerns whether or not the primary obligation of an official is in fact to the government or to the country. I remind the Senate of the Belgrano incident in the House of Commons when the Prime Minister, Mrs Thatcher, undoubtedly lied to the Parliament. In doing that, an officer who knew that she had lied was then placed in a position to have to make a judgment whether or not to provide the information to the public or to go along with this principle. When the matter finally came before the court that person was vindicated. In other words, within at least one jurisdiction when this was tested finally, the principle of the primary obligation of an official being to the Minister and the government of the day was not upheld. What was upheld was the primary obligation to the country. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is a pity that we simply rehearse this. The Government may wish to reassert the particular position indicated on page 4, but the fact that it does so without any reference to that very interesting debate leaves aside the difficulty that arose specifically in that case in Britain, and that could arise here, with regard to whether or not an official has an obligation to the country if he or she is asked on a matter of fact, not on a matter of policy, to simply reinforce a lie that may have been made to parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In accepting those guidelines, I for one would not want to be seen to be endorsing that particular position. In fact, I reject that position. I think that in those circumstances, and possibly others, the obligation of the public servant is clear. It is not to reinforce the Government's mistake; it is to clearly state the opposite. My view and that of my Party may not be supported by everybody in this place, and I accept that. I do not wish to canvass or try to bring to any conclusion that particular debate. However, I wish to say that I think it is a pity that, in 1989, in reworking these guidelines the Government has not seen fit even to allude to that problem and that difficult issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point that I wish to raise relates to the guidelines. I say in passing that these guidelines do not refer only to the appearance of people before committees. If one reads the guidelines one will find that in fact they refer to a whole host of other items. For example, page 15 refers to party committees and page 16 refers to representations or information being sought by individual members of parliament from bureaucrats. It also reiterates the established arrangements with regard to consultation by Opposition shadow Ministers prior to elections. A number of other items are also discussed. I think that there is a misnomer in terms of the original item and I think it is a pity in some ways. However, I do not wish to raise so much that matter. A comment I wish to make is with regard to the reliance upon the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act as a methodology to deal with a number of items before committees. There is a caveat at the end of that whole discussion that the FOI Act does not in any way bind a parliamentary committee. However, if one reads the document oneself, one does not come to the caveat until later and I believe that many public servants could well be led to believe that the Freedom of Information Act and its exclusion clauses in some way apply to the committees of the Parliament. Of course it is obvious that they do not. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus it is with those severe reservations that I welcome the Government's document. I think it is, on the whole, a fair and reasonable way of dealing with this matter. I think it is extremely useful that detailed guidelines such as these are available so that everybody is clearly aware of the ground on which they stand with regard to committee inquiries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I table and seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard, on behalf of the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe), a statement on disability reform which outlines the Government's strategy to assist people with disabilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This statement provides an outline of the Government's forward-looking, comprehensive and integrated agenda of reform of disability measures. It emphasises our commitment to enabling policies that will assist people with disabilities to maximise their work force potential and participate more fully in Australian social and economic life. It brings into sharp focus the contrast between our approach and the hastily assembled and ill considered savings measures on disability outlined in the Opposition's recent statement. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is committed to social reform. As a result of the Social Security Review process and as part of its social justice strategy, the Government has already undertaken far-reaching reforms to assist families, sole parents, young people, older people and long-term unemployed people. These reforms have resulted in social security clients no longer being passive recipients of income support payments. Instead they have been provided with opportunities to achieve financial independence and to improve their employment prospects. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now undertaking another major element of social policy reform: the development of more active income support, rehabilitation and labour market policies for people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Since coming to office in 1983 the Government has continually demonstrated its commitment to improving the quality of life for people with disabilities. Following extensive consultations in 1983 and 1984 and the release of the report ``New Directions'' in 1985, the Government comprehensively reviewed the services available for people with disabilities. In 1986 the Government introduced the Disability Services Act and the related Statement of Principles and Objectives. These provided the framework for developing a range of services to enable people with disabilities to achieve increased independence, greater employment opportunities and fuller integration into community activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The next stage of the Government's reform of disability programs involves income support arrangements and their links with rehabilitation and labour market programs. This stage follows from the work of the Social Security Review, headed by Professor Bettina Cass, and its comprehensive Issues Paper Number 5 ``Towards Enabling Policies: Income Support for People with Disabilities''. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the early 1970s there has been a significant increase in the level of dependence on invalid pensions and sickness benefits, which are the major forms of income support for people with disabilities. The numbers receiving these payments are now greater than the numbers in receipt of unemployment benefit and the cost is in excess of $3 billion a year. There has been no fundamental review of the eligibility criteria for these payments since their introduction-1910 for invalid pension and 1944 for sickness benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The increases in numbers cannot be accounted for simply by changes in the incidence of disability. In fact it appears that many people receiving these payments have been cast adrift by structural changes in the labour market. Typically, they are older males who have been employed in manual occupations and have few skills. In many cases, they are of non-English speaking backgrounds and do not have a good command of English. </PARA>
<PARA> At the other end of the spectrum there is a significant number of young people receiving invalid pension. Under current arrangements, the overwhelming majority of these will spend the rest of their lives dependent on income support. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the major problems with the current income support system for people with disabilities is that once they are on invalid pension, it is very difficult for them to move off this form of economic dependence. Each year less than 2 per cent of invalid pensioners actually move from income support into employment. I do not believe that all of those remaining are incapable of working, at least on a part-time basis. Rather it would appear that up until now we have taken the easy way out. We have judged these people to be unemployable and have therefore ignored their needs and capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> However, development of effective policies and strategies in such a complex area requires taking careful steps, gathering additional information and trialling different approaches. The Government therefore announced in the 1989-90 Budget a series of pilots and research projects which will provide us with the necessary information to make firm decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition proposes to introduce punitive and discriminatory review measures on the pretence that these would magically reduce the numbers of people on invalid pension and sickness benefit. They are proposing even more insensitive and counter-productive changes for unemployment beneficiaries, many of whom also have disabilities as well as other labour market disadvantages. We do not believe that this is either a sensible or effective approach. In contrast, the Government is looking at positive and more sophisticated ways to assist people with disabilities to improve their work force potential. We are examining:</PARA>
<PARA>the appropriateness of the assessment basis and income test for invalid pension to encourage greater labour market participation;</PARA>
<PARA>the scope for improvements to the delivery of services, particularly labour market and rehabilitation programs;</PARA>
<PARA>the issue of costs of disability; and</PARA>
<PARA>strategies to assist people with low levels of disability but other labour market disadvantages to undertake education, training and employment. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, we recognise that there will always be people with disabilities who, for lengthy periods, if not their lifetime, cannot participate in the mainstream labour market. The Government is sensitive to the fact that these people need a secure income support system which provides them with adequate incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> To achieve reform will require fundamental changes in attitudes. Employers, employees, the community generally and some people with disabilities themselves need to change their attitudes from focusing on disabilities to focusing on abilities-on what people with disabilities can achieve and on how independent, rather than dependent, they can be. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government intends to lead the way in changing attitudes by ensuring that people with disabilities have proper access to employment and opportunities for advancement within the Australian Public Service. We therefore provided additional resources in the 1989-90 Budget to foster the employment of people with disabilities within the Government sector. These included:</PARA>
<PARA> additional resources for the Selective Placement Officers in the Department of Employment, Education and Training;</PARA>
<PARA>funding for community agencies to enable access to the Australian Public Service for people with intellectual disabilities; and</PARA>
<PARA>funds for promoting employment of people with disabilities among public service managers. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, the Government is committed to improving access to rehabilitation services. We will provide 21,000 places in 1990-91; 23,500 places in 1991-92 and 27,000 in 1992-93. This represents growth of 9,000 new places over the triennium or a total of 17,500 additional services. This will be a continuation of the already strong growth in places which we have seen over the past three years. </PARA>
<PARA>As we move into the 1990s, the challenge is for all Australians to shed their prejudices and change their restricted thinking so that we can share a vision which will provide real choices for people with disabilities. These people have a right to make choices to enable them to fully develop their potential and this Government is committed to providing the opportunities for them to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>We are at another important milestone on the road towards a new system. The vision is of a new system which more actively encourages independence for people with disabilities; a more humane system with better community understanding of basic human rights which apply equally to people with disabilities; a system with integrity, providing comprehensive assistance; a system built from cooperative balance among agencies addressing the individual needs of clients. </PARA>

<PARA>STATEMENT ON DISABILITY REFORM BY THE MINISTER FOR SOCIAL SECURITY, NOVEMBER 1989</PARA>
<PARA>Introduction</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's highly successful Social Security Review, which began around four years ago, identified the needs of the most disadvantaged groups in our society and proposed far sighted but realistic policies to assist them. As a result of the review process, and as part of its social justice strategy, the Government has already undertaken major structural reforms to assist families (including sole parent families), young people, older people and long-term unemployed people. The reforms have resulted in social security clients no longer being passive recipients of income support payments. The Government has a continuing and firm commitment to raising the living standards of the most disadvantaged groups in our society by providing both better incomes and improved services. It has sought to encourage independence and provide better opportunities for disadvantaged people by closer integration of social security provisions with employment opportunities and labour market programs. At the same time a key focus of the Government's reforms has been the implementation of new measures to enhance the integrity and accountability of the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is at the forefront of social policy reform. We are in the process of undertaking another major element of that reform: the development of more active income support and labour market policies for people with disabilities so that they can participate more fully in Australian economic and social life. These policies will seek to maintain the integrity of the welfare system and reduce welfare dependency. </PARA>
<PARA> This Statement outlines the Government's philosophy for change to improve the quality of life for people with disabilities and identifies the key issues which need to be resolved if successful change is to occur. Perhaps the most important precondition for change is a much greater recognition by all sectors of the community of the abilities and unused potential of those Australians who have some form of physical, sensory, intellectual or psychiatric disability. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's Record</PARA>
<PARA> Since it came to office in 1983, the Government has demonstrated its commitment to improving the quality of life for people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Following extensive consultations in 1983 and 1984 and the release of the report ``New Directions'' in 1985, the Government comprehensively reviewed the services available for people with disabilities. Subsequently, the Government introduced in 1986 the Disability Services Act and a related Statement of Principles and Objectives. This Act was an historic first step in the process of addressing long-standing barriers faced by Australians with disabilities. It provided a new framework for developing a range of services including employment, training, rehabilitation, advocacy, information and accommodation and set the scene for the achievement of increased independence, greater employment opportunities and fuller integration into community activities for people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Together with the Disability Services Act, the Government endorsed in 1986 a Statement of Principles and Objectives for the development and delivery of all Commonwealth programs for people with disabilities. That Statement emphasised the need for assistance to be integrated with mainstream programs and for the delivery of services to enhance the rights, choices and skills of recipients. </PARA>
<PARA> These principles and objectives provide some of the central premises on which future reforms will be based. The following three principles are ones people without disabilities take so much for granted:</PARA>
<PARA>people with disabilities are individuals who have the inherent right to respect for their human worth and dignity;</PARA>
<PARA>people with disabilities, whatever the origin, nature, type and degree of disability, have the same fundamental rights as all members of Australian society; and</PARA>
<PARA>every person with a disability has the same rights as other members of Australian society to realise his or her individual capacity for physical, social, emotional and intellectual development. </PARA>
<PARA> These principles are in accordance with the principles outlined in the Government's Social Justice Strategy. They are about the basic right of people with disabilities to participate fully in social and economic life to a level they choose; about the basic right to have real choices. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the objectives incorporated in the Disability Services Act would be the normal expectation of most of us:</PARA>
<PARA>that services for people with disabilities should ensure that the conditions of the everyday life of people with disabilities are the same as, or as close as possible to, norms and patterns which are valued in the community;</PARA>
<PARA>that programs and services should promote a competent and positive image of people with disabilities;</PARA>
<PARA>that programs and services should promote participation of people with disabilities in the life of the local community through maximum physical and social integration; and</PARA>
<PARA>that programs and services should provide opportunities for people with disabilities to reach goals and enjoy lifestyles which are valued by the community at large and are appropriate to their chronological age. </PARA>
<PARA> And yet so many people with disabilities have their self-confidence undermined by others who doubt their abilities and hence who exclude them from activities that are taken for granted by other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is determined to ensure that these social justice principles and objectives apply equally to people with disabilities as to people without. The 1986 Statement of Principles and Objectives has provided the basis for the Federal Government to make organisations funded by it accountable for the quality and content of the services they offer. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some heartening success stories resulting from these recent initiatives. One example is a program called Jobsupport which has been operating in Sydney for the past three years and which has successfully placed people with intellectual disabilities in full or part-time jobs of their choice and on wage levels much higher than they could have expected a few years ago. In fact a number of those employees have won workplace awards and are working in businesses such as Grace Bros, McDonalds, Woolworths and Target. </PARA>
<PARA> A similar success story could be told in the expansion of accommodation options for people with severe disabilities who may otherwise have been left in nursing homes or large institutions. Over 700 people have moved from institutional settings to housing in the community and 100 new places have been designated for use by people with a disability under the revised Commonwealth State Housing Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> In its own arena, the Government has started to provide employment opportunities in the Australian Public Service to people with intellectual disabilities through the Intellectual Disability Access Program. </PARA>
<PARA> Reform of service delivery has been the first phase of the Government's new deal for people with disabilities and an integral part of its social justice strategy. The further reforms now under development are another important element of the Government's commitment to social justice. </PARA>
<PARA>Current Concerns with Income Support Arrangements</PARA>
<PARA>Trends and Characteristics</PARA>
<PARA> The main forms of income support arrangements available to people with disabilities are invalid pension and sickness benefit, although it needs to be remembered that many of Australia's long term unemployment beneficiaries also suffer disabilities of various kinds. The basic eligibility criteria for these payments have remained largely unchanged since their introduction-invalid pension was introduced in the first decade of this century and unemployment and sickness benefit in 1944. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988 the Social Security Review, headed by Professor Bettina Cass, produced a comprehensive issues paper entitled `Towards Enabling Policies: Income Support for People with Disabilities'. The Social Security Review produced a paper in 1988 entitled `People with Disabilities: Towards Enabling Policies'. The Review raised a number of important concerns about the current income support arrangements for people with disabilities. Like the Handicapped Programs Review which preceded it a few years earlier, it challenged many widely held community views about people with disabilities and their capabilities. Specifically, it identified the following key concerns:</PARA>
<PARA>increasing levels of dependence on invalid pension and sickness benefit;</PARA>
<PARA>inequities in the treatment of groups of people who are in essentially similar circumstances;</PARA>
<PARA>the often inappropriate and complex nature of the existing invalid pension eligibility criteria; and</PARA>
<PARA>disincentives in current pension and benefit arrangements which discourage people from taking steps to increase their economic independence and participate more fully in community life. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the early 1970s, there has been a dramatic increase in the level of dependence on invalid pension and sickness benefit. Over the period 1970-71 to 1988-89, the number of people in receipt of invalid pension (including sheltered employment allowance and rehabilitation allowance) increased from 134,900 to 320,000; some 137 per cent. Over the same period the number of sickness benefit recipients increased from 10,500 to 79,000; an increase of 652 per cent. There are now more people receiving invalid pension and sickness benefit (about 400,000) than receive unemployment benefit (some 355,000). The cost of paying invalid pension and sickness benefit is now $3 billion a year. </PARA>
<PARA>The significant increases in numbers of people with disabilities receiving income support payments cannot be accounted for simply by changes in the incidence of disability. It is clear that a significant proportion of those receiving invalid pension in fact are people who have been cast adrift by structural changes in the Australian labour market. These people are typically middle-aged or older, ex-blue collar workers with few skills, who have varying types of medical problems and disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the most significant characteristics in the recent growth in invalid pension numbers is that it has been largely the consequence of growth in the number of male invalid pensioners. Males aged over 50 account for approximately 60 per cent of the total invalid pension population. A jobless man aged 50-64 is three times more likely to be receiving invalid pension than unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA>Sickness benefit has also increasingly become a long term form of income support for people leaving the labour force. Currently over one third of sickness beneficiaries have been receiving the payment for a year or more. Recent research shows that there are strong similarities between the older group of invalid pensioners and long-term sickness beneficiaries. In particular, there are strong similarities in the age and sex of recipients and in the prevalence of various medical conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>Part of the increase in both invalid pension and sickness benefit recipients has been due to the growth in numbers of people from non-English speaking backgrounds receiving these payments. This group now represents approximately 25 per cent of invalid pensioners and 22 per cent of sickness beneficiaries whereas it represents only 15 per cent of the overall population of working age. </PARA>
<PARA>The increase is due to a complex but clear inter-relationship between disability and other factors such as the types of employment these people can undertake, their levels of job qualifications, their advancing age as well as their reduced fluency in English. This group also represents a disproportionate number of those employed in high risk occupations. Many of these people came to Australia during the 1950s to work in the manufacturing and construction industries. They are now in their late 50s or early 60s, have some disability or illness and have been retrenched because of the restructuring of industry. These people have significant difficulties in finding alternative employment. </PARA>
<PARA>The picture being sketched is of a group of people who have multiple labour force disadvantages including significant health problems. However, they are not people that the community has traditionally viewed as being handicapped or disabled. </PARA>
<PARA>At the other end of the age spectrum there is a substantial number of young people receiving the invalid pension. </PARA>
<PARA>In the twelve months to June 1989 there were over 4,000 grants of invalid pension to people aged under 20 and around 8,000 to people under 25. Commonly these young people have an intellectual disability (about 55 per cent) or a congenital physical disability. </PARA>
<PARA>At an age when most young people are looking forward to independence, a career and a future, this group moves on to invalid pension and reaches a dead end. The overwhelming majority of these young people will spend the rest of their lives in total or substantial dependence on the pension. </PARA>
<PARA>These facts raise doubts about the effectiveness of the current income support framework in providing incentives for people with disabilities to develop their full potential. </PARA>
<PARA>Outmoded Assumptions</PARA>
<PARA>The most serious problem with the current income support system for people with disabilities is that once they are on invalid pension, it is very difficult for them to get off and to move out of that economic dependence. Less than 2 per cent of invalid pensioners actually move on from invalid pension to a job. Invalid pension has become a very passive form of income support where the needs and potential of many recipients have been ignored. It has been easier to put people there than to identify their abilities and assist them to participate more fully in economic and social life. </PARA>
<PARA> These problems were clearly identified by the Social Security Review which suggested that the eligibility criteria are complex, unclear and outdated for the purpose of determining who does and who does not receive invalid pension. </PARA>
<PARA> The invalid pension eligibility criteria and associated administrative arrangements have discouraged many people from exploring their potential for employment on either a part-time or full-time basis. Under current arrangements a person's entitlement to invalid pension is subject to medical review when earnings exceed $50 a week as there is an assumption that this level of earning capacity may not be consistent with the statutory eligibility criterion of ``85 per cent permanent incapacity for work''. </PARA>
<PARA> Any fair and effective disability payment system has to ensure that people with high levels of disability and with very restricted employment options are provided with adequate and secure income support. However, such a system also needs to avoid the situation whereby people, especially young people, can, on grant of invalid pension, be left with few opportunities to participate in employment and achieve some level of independence. These people should not be left with a long life of dependence on income support. It is the need to avoid situations such as these that the Government is now addressing in the next stage of its reform of programs for people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>Critical Policy Issues</PARA>
<PARA> In the extensive consultations following the Social Security Review report, some issues were raised repeatedly, the most important of which were:</PARA>
<PARA>inequities and disincentives arising from income support arrangements;</PARA>
<PARA>insufficient provision of appropriate services and particularly lack of labour market and rehabilitation assistance;</PARA>
<PARA>the high costs of aids and appliances and of costs related to pursuing employment; and</PARA>
<PARA>discriminatory practices and adverse attitudes in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also concern at the growth in long term dependency on disability payments. </PARA>
<PARA> These issues require resolution before a comprehensive set of policies can be formulated to meet the needs of people with disabilities and improve their quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the report of the Social Security Review and the consultations on the report, the Government set up a Task Force of officials to consider disability issues and make suggestions for reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the issues pose difficult and complex questions which require careful consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> Development of effective policies and strategies in such a complex area requires taking careful steps, gathering of additional information and testing in specific areas before bringing in new policies. In the 1989-90 Budget we announced that a series of pilots and research projects would be undertaken to provide a firm basis for Government decisions for a better income support system for people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>Income Support Issues</PARA>
<PARA> Current income support arrangements require a fundamental re-examination. A critical question is how to provide for the economic security of people who cannot work without creating a system which would penalise people with disabilities who are capable of working. </PARA>
<PARA> The key issue is what criteria should determine eligibility for a disability payment? Who should be eligible and for what reason? In other words, what should be the determinants of the threshold level of eligibility? How is that threshold to be measured?</PARA>
<PARA> If the threshold is set at a relatively high level, large numbers of people qualifying under current criteria would be excluded who would, nevertheless, be in need of some form of assistance. If, on the other hand, the threshold is set at a relatively low level, large numbers would become eligible with consequent high cost implications as well as possible disincentives for labour market participation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are related issues of the extent to which non-medical factors such as age, education levels and other socio-economic factors should be used in determining levels of disability. It is clear that in many cases disability combines with factors such as these to cause labour force disadvantage and that, in turn, some of these factors stem from the disability in the first place: for example, education and training opportunities have often been denied to people with some level of disability. </PARA>
<PARA> A related and exceedingly complex issue is how the payment can be structured so that a person with a disability is not required to demonstrate permanent inability to work. While it would be fairly easy to devise changes to income support arrangements which would encourage labour market activities more than the current system does, attention also needs to be given to the availability of resources and, if necessary, to the staging of reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> Further work is required to assist the Government in reaching conclusions on these complex issues. It is for this reason that the Government proposes to undertake a number of trials and pilots relating to invalid pension eligibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The most significant of these, which is based on a rehabilitation assessment tool, is called the `Australian Functional Ability Measure'. This method was chosen because it has the potential to relate labour force disadvantage to levels of disability. </PARA>
<PARA> A second trial takes a less radical approach involving modification of the existing invalid pension assessment procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> These trials will provide information to assist the Government in coming to final conclusions on these issues. Without such trials the Government would not be in a sufficiently informed position to make judgments on appropriate changes to income support arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> A further issue is income support arrangements for people whose disabilities are lower than the level chosen for entry into a specific disability-based program. Currently it appears these people are spread across a wide range of programs. A recent study of older long-term sickness and unemployment beneficiaries found that in many respects the populations on these two benefits were indistinguishable. There are also some people with similar characteristics on invalid pension and special benefit. A significant amount of time and effort goes into placing them in different categories, while little work is done to address their real problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people in these categories have multiple labour force disadvantages including age, disability, low skills, low literacy and low self-esteem. For one of these groups, long-term unemployment beneficiaries, Newstart is already providing some hope. It is now time to examine effective forms of assistance for the remaining categories. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, therefore, has also funded a research project focusing on the needs of people with relatively low levels of disability who have other labour force disadvantages. Lack of skills, limited education, language problems or a restricted work history can compound even a low level of disability, thus increasing the difficulty of finding work. This research will provide information to assist in developing strategies to assist these people. </PARA>
<PARA> An increasingly important issue is the relationship between Federally-provided income support and other Government or private provision, such as compensation or insurance payments. There are already Commonwealth legislative arrangements to prevent an individual from ``double-dipping''. However, there is still a question of achieving a fair balance between the social security system and compensation systems (including common law). The Government is, therefore, looking to examine the complex inter-relationships between these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who care for people with disabilities should also be considered in any reform. Income support and services provided to these people can make the difference between care at home by a family member or close friend and possibly inappropriate care in an institution. It is essential that the work of caring for people with disabilities be recognised by adequate income support for those who accept that task. </PARA>
<PARA> Under current arrangements the ``caring'' role is recognised through the income security system and through payments by the Department of Community Services and Health. These payments have different purposes but may be paid to overlapping client groups. An important consideration is to ensure that they are targeted effectively and that they provide the most suitable form of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>Labour Market Issues and Rehabilitation</PARA>
<PARA> The under-representation of people with disabilities in the labour force and the considerable recent growth in their reliance on income support contrast sharply with increasing community recognition of both the rights and capacities of people with disabilities to take part in the life of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> If people with disabilities are to live with the maximum possible independence and to take part in employment, education, training and the other major activities of adult life, then they must have access to effective support services. </PARA>
<PARA> A major problem in developing co-ordinated labour market and training services, accessible to people with disabilities, is the lack of explicit linkages between income support programs and rehabilitation services, labour market programs and supported employment services. This has contributed to the labour force marginalisation of people who have, or could develop, employment potential. Development of links between programs which encourage and support access to employment should reduce reliance on income support and would acknowledge the rights and capacities of all people with disabilities to take part in the mainstream of community life. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to the Review of Client Services and Regional Structures (the Halton Review), the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) is improving its service delivery to disadvantaged clients, including people with disabilities, by:</PARA>
<PARA>establishing Job Seeker Specialist Services Units to provide a caseload-based, in-depth counselling, assessment and referral service to clients and developing a support infrastructure for disadvantaged clients within the local community;</PARA>
<PARA>integrating existing CES labour market programs to better target the specific needs of people with disabilities; and</PARA>
<PARA>increasing the number of staff servicing clients with labour market disadvantages, including disabilities, and training staff in specialist counselling skills and knowledge of programs and services available through CES and other government and community agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> A more responsive approach to people with disabilities by the CES through the provision of more intensive procedures will be important in placing those people whose needs are unlikely to be met by standard procedures. In this regard, two trials will be undertaken in CES offices to test measures to improve early identification of people with disabilities. Furthermore, the Departments of Social Security, Community Services and Health and Employment, Education and Training are testing ways to improve access for people with disabilities to labour market, training and rehabilitation services. The models being tested are:</PARA>
<PARA>interdepartmental teams, consisting of representatives from the three Departments;</PARA>
<PARA>departmental brokers from the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service (CRS) or the CES; and</PARA>
<PARA>community brokers attached to community organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> Clients will be interviewed by a team or a broker who will assess their situation and develop and implement an action plan in consultation with the client, based on labour market, training or rehabilitation services available from the Departments or from local community organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> Teams and brokers will provide a single contact point where a client can be provided with information on, and referral to, the most suitable assistance available from the participating Departments and local community organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> Early intervention by the CRS for Social Security recipients has the potential to shorten the period that people with treatable disabilities spend on income support before returning to work. This rationale is in line with the recent changes in the compensation laws which have provided improved access to rehabilitation to injured workers in the recognition that early intervention encourages these people to remain in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> There is scope to make existing links more effective and currently the Department of Social Security is testing a means of improving the rehabilitation referral process by systematically identifying clients who could return to work via CRS rehabilitation. The effectiveness of early rehabilitation will be assessed by an exit survey of this group. </PARA>
<PARA> The CRS provides a wide range of social and vocational rehabilitation to people with disabilities. The value of offering rehabilitation programs to appropriate pensioners and beneficiaries is recognised not only in economic but also in social justice terms. A recent independent study of the CRS demonstrated that clients completing programs substantially increased their time in the work force and were less dependent on others. It found that for every $1 expended, a CRS program returned an economic benefit of $6 to the individual and $2.25 to the Government through reduced income support and increased taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there are groups of clients who are perceived as not capable of achieving substantial gain including those with low motivation, acute psychiatric conditions and drug and alcohol dependence. These people are often labelled unemployable because of their multiple labour force disadvantages. We need to address whether specialist rehabilitation services would deal more effectively with these groups. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of access to appropriate rehabilitation and labour market services is particularly relevant for women with disabilities. The National Agenda for Women noted that about one-third of women with disabilities are in paid employment compared with 50 per cent of men and that rehabilitation services are under-utilised by women. The reform process outlined in this Statement links in with the National Agenda action plan for women with disabilities. The action plan emphasises the need for social security assistance to minimise disincentives to labour force participation and for better access to and co-ordination of training, labour market and rehabilitation services. </PARA>
<PARA> Another issue of significance is the Sheltered Employment Allowance. Consistent with the principles of the Disability Services Act, a progressive changeover of sheltered workshops to supported employment services and competitive employment training placement services is taking place. Supported employment services are designed to support the paid employment of people with disabilities who would otherwise be unlikely to be employed in the open labour market and who need ongoing support to continue to work. There are currently 320 people in supported employment and a further 1,100 in competitive open employment. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes make necessary a review of the Sheltered Employment Allowance, which is paid to those entitled to it indirectly through the management of the sheltered workshop. This can disguise the very low rates of pay being received by some workers in sheltered workshops. There is a strong argument that income support should be paid directly to those eligible to receive it who are in supported employment, rather than to the organisations providing these services to pass on to recipients. </PARA>
<PARA> This also raises the issue of productivity based wages and slow worker permits. The Government is investigating ways of improving access by people with disabilities to part-time work and to work for productivity based wages under award conditions. The Minister for Community Services and Health has approved a consultancy arranged by his Department to examine in detail the issues associated with the determination of appropriate wage payments people with severe disabilities who may be working alongside workers who are not disabled in an integrated work place. The consultancy will also examine the issues of union membership and the legal protection of workers' rights, particularly protection against discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA>Cost Issues</PARA>
<PARA> It is widely recognised that people with disabilities incur financial disadvantages and must bear extra costs which people without disabilities do not have. One of the most frequently raised issues in the consultations following the release of the Social Security Review Issues Paper on disabilities was that of additional costs, particularly for those seeking or in employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Transport costs for people with a disability may cause substantial barriers to participation in the work force, education and training programs. The ABS 1988 Aged and Disabled Persons Survey pointed out that, of those who have a severe disability, those with a severe mobility disability were least likely to be in employment. </PARA>
<PARA> To minimise disincentives and maximise opportunities for people with disabilities to take part in employment and training activities and to reduce the costs incurred in participating in the work force, accessible and affordable transport is vital. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the costs of transport, however, the cost of medication and the high costs of aids and appliances for people with disabilities are of concern. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a range of existing provisions to assist in meeting these costs such as a mobility allowance for those engaged in gainful employment or vocational training; the attendant care scheme; and sales tax exemptions. In addition, there is a wide range of concessions relating to transport, medication and aids and appliances available to people who qualify for a Pensioner Health Benefit Card. However, there are concerns with these arrangements. For example, pensioners who undertake employment lose eligibility for fringe benefits and the associated concessions; mobility allowance provides only limited assistance for a small group of people; while sales tax exemptions are available only to those who can afford a new car. The existing arrangements need examination. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer recently announced that the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) is to provide him with a report, by July next year, on the costs of imported aids and appliances. The inquiry is to examine the effects of tariffs and other measures on the availability and costs of aids and appliances used by people with disabilities and the reasons for any high costs of imported aids and appliances. </PARA>
<PARA> The IAC has begun its inquiries and will be holding public hearings in December this year. Following a draft report next March, it will receive further submissions and hold further hearings with the intent of presenting its final report and recommendations by July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of cost is closely related to the objective of achieving economic security. Studies are required to provide more information on these costs, in particular the extent to which there are extra costs as people with disabilities seek to engage in training or employment, and under what circumstances those extra costs are incurred. </PARA>
<PARA> There are then subsequent issues to be resolved about what, if any, additional income support should be provided. If additional support is warranted should it be as an addition to the basic pension? As a once only employment entry payment? As a mobility allowance? As a tax concession or in the form of direct service provision? If there was some acknow- ledgment within the income support structure of the extra costs of disability, and assuming that payment was confined to those seeking employment, should it be confined only to those with a severe disability or should it be more widely available? These questions indicate the difficulty of the income support issues relating to the costs of disability. </PARA>
<PARA> To assist in addressing these issues, research will be undertaken on the financial barriers people with disabilities face when they move from income support to employment. </PARA>
<PARA>Attitudinal Change</PARA>
<PARA> The greatest single barrier preventing an improvement in the quality of life for Australians with disabilities is the attitudes of Australians: attitudes of employers, of workers (including those employed in government agencies), community attitudes generally and the attitudes of some people with disabilities themselves. Fundamental attitudinal changes are required away from a focus on people's disabilities toward a focus on what they can do. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people who have disabilities are not waiting for community attitudes to change but are forging ahead the hard way. They are pushing out the expected boundaries of what they are capable of, challenging the stereotypes and fighting to make decisions about their lives. Others, however, are doubting their own capacities and are forced into exclusion from mainstream activities because of the attitudes of their fellow Australians, attitudes which define and confine their capabilities to the detriment of us all. </PARA>
<PARA> As we move into the 1990s, the challenge ahead is to shed our old prejudices and jolt ourselves out of restricted thinking so that we share a vision of an Australia which can provide real choices for people with disabilities to enable them to develop their potential fully. </PARA>
<PARA> There are encouraging signs of change. For example, employers are responding positively to recent Government initiatives to assist sole parents and long-term unemployed people back into employment. Many people who are benefiting from the Jobs, Education and Training (JET) program for sole parents and the Newstart program for long-term unemployment beneficiaries do in fact have multiple disadvantages, often including an actual physical impairment as well as disadvantages such as age, lack of skills or a low level of literacy. Employers are finding that programs such as JET and NEWSTART, which are tailored to the needs of the individual, produce productive members of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> The philosophical basis of JET and Newstart is to enhance the sense of self worth and dignity of participants as well as their level of skills and to encourage employers to see their true worth. The same principles can be applied to assist people with disabilities to develop their potential. </PARA>
<PARA> It is readily understood, however, that an employer could hardly be expected to take on a person with a disability if that person has been put on an invalid pension because of a ``permanent incapacity''. The ambivalence of our attitudes is reflected in this eligibility criterion combined with general community concern for the growth in the numbers of people who move onto invalid pension but who never come off. </PARA>
<PARA> For too long we have considered individuals with a disability or multiple disadvantages too hard to help. So often this becomes a tragically self-fulfilling prophecy. Yet, because so many people currently on a pension or benefit do have a capacity to get into some form of labour market activity with assistance, it makes economic sense to provide that assistance. This is especially so for the young. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a hard task ahead to turn around deeply ingrained attitudes. We must get rid of the preconceptions which have prevented people realising their full capacities. The ability of people with some disabilities often equals the ability of others without disabilities. Legislation and educative methods will need to be used to combat discrimination and facilitate the process of reform. The Government will consider, in consultation with employers, unions and community groups, an Australia-wide education campaign on the employment potential of many people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>The Way Ahead</PARA>
<PARA>Activities Over the Next Year</PARA>
<PARA> This Statement has identified the concerns with the current income support and related arrangements for people with disabilities and the critical policy issues which are being addressed through the pilots and research projects. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has directed the Task Force of officials to oversee the projects and to give advice on specific policies based on their outcomes in time for Budget deliberations next year. Further, in the process, the Government will liaise with the Disability Advisory Council of Australia and seek advice from the Social Security Advisory Council which, in turn, will develop mechanisms for carrying out consultations, including hearing the views of representatives of people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> It will also ensure that consultations will be undertaken with major ethnic organisations in the course of developing assistance for people from non-English speaking backgrounds. Aboriginal people also have special needs in this area and the Government will be looking closely at ways of improving their access to income support and rehabilitation and training programs. </PARA>
<PARA> In recognition of the value of rehabilitation in getting people back to work, the Government has increased the number of rehabilitation places in the CRS from 15,260 in 1988-89 to 18,000 in this financial year-an increase of some 2,740 or 18 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is committed to increasing the number of rehabilitation places in the CRS over the next three years. We propose to provide 21,000 places in 1990-91, 23,500 places in 1991-92 and 27,000 places in 1992-93. This represents growth of 9,000 new places over the triennium or a total of 17,500 additional services. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also intends to ensure that people with disabilities have proper access to Australian Public Service employment. They must also have the chance for proper advancement. The Government has long had a commitment to equal employment opportunities for people with disabilities. Unfortunately, statistics show that further efforts are required to ensure that the vision becomes a reality. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government made additional resources available in the Budget for a number of measures to foster the employment of people with disabilities in the Australian Public Service (APS). These included:</PARA>
<PARA>additional resources for the Selective Placement Officers in the Department of Employment, Education and Training;</PARA>
<PARA>funding for community agencies to enable access to the APS for people with intellectual disabilities; and</PARA>
<PARA>funds for promoting employment of people with disabilities among APS managers.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Employment, Education and Training is also promoting its programs of assistance for people with disabilities seeking APS employment. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures are seen as important next steps in ensuring equitable employment for people with disabilities in the Government's own work force. We must lead by example. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs is currently enquiring into both employment and housing issues for people with disabilities and plans to report in March 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Employers of people with a disability who are appropriately placed and trained on the job are enthusiastic about their commitment and high standard of work. Even in areas of high unemployment employers are looking for more places because of their satisfaction with the reliability and competence of these workers. </PARA>
<PARA> In recognition of the advances that have been made in securing open employment for people with disabilities, the Prime Minister has agreed to sponsor the ``Prime Minister's Employer of the Year Award'' to go to an employer who has a record of excellence in employing people with disabilities. The first award will be made early next year. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the next year the Government will also benefit from the work of consultants to the Department of Community Services and Health who will advise on key disability work force issues. </PARA>
<PARA> There are no well developed overseas models for reform in this area which are applicable in the Australian context. This is despite the fact that other industrialised countries are experiencing problems similar to our own and have similar concerns with their disability related income support payments. In many ways, therefore, Australia is blazing a new trail. </PARA>
<PARA> Precise details of reforms must await the outcomes of the pilots and research projects. However, the Government is giving consideration to a number of crucial areas of concern to people with disabilities. These are:</PARA>
<PARA>the appropriateness of the assessment basis and income test for invalid pension to encourage greater labour market participation;</PARA>
<PARA>the scope for improvements to the delivery of services, particularly rehabilitation and labour market programs;</PARA>
<PARA>the issue of the costs of disability; and</PARA>
<PARA>the scope for strategies to assist people with low levels of disability but other labour market disadvantages to undertake education, training and employment. </PARA>
<PARA>Toward a Better System</PARA>
<PARA> Change is on its way. In the 1990-91 Budget the Government will be deciding on the first stage of a two to three year program for a new deal for people with disabilities. To facilitate transition to work within the social security system will not be an easy task, particularly because of the potential resource implications. Resource constraints may, therefore, require a staged approach to reform. </PARA>
<PARA> There will always be people with disabilities who, for lengthy periods, if not their lifetime, cannot participate in the mainstream labour market. The Government is sensitive to the fact that these people need a secure income support system which provides them with adequate income. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there are also many people with disabilities who do have some capacity for employment and want to participate. These people must be given access to the types of assistance which are available to other disadvantaged job seekers to help them obtain either part or full time participation in the workforce. </PARA>
<PARA> A new deal for people with disabilities must focus on opportunities for rehabilitation, training and employment. Particular attention must be given to integrating disability-related income support payments and rehabilitation and labour market programs. While existing arrangements may appear to provide some security for people with disabilities, the cost of that security is very high if it means a lifetime of dependence. A system of income security which provides real options and real opportunities is the aim of our reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> There are strong arguments that young people with disabilities should be a priority group for more active forms of assistance. The reality is that there are substantial social and economic implications which give a 16 year old no option but to go on a pension. We must provide opportunities for these young people to explore their potential for obtaining some independence and for participating in the mainstream of our society. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will pursue its reforms with sensitivity. It will be essential to have the active support of employers and the trade union movement. The Government has committed itself to wide consultation throughout the policy development process since resolution of the issues will involve all community groups. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important to emphasise that current invalid pension arrangements will continue while these policies are being developed. Existing pensioners can be assured that changes will be undertaken with care and compassion. However, they too should have the opportunity to share in any improvements in access to labour market and rehabilitation programs. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to get complex reform right. The aim is to achieve a much improved quality of life for Australians with disabilities and their families; to ensure fairness, opportunity and security for everyone in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We are at another important milestone on the road towards a new system. The vision is of a new system which more actively encourages independence for people with disabilities; a more humane system with better community understanding of basic human rights which apply equally to people with disabilities; a system with integrity and accountability that reduces welfare dependency but provides comprehensive assistance; a system based on the co-operative effort of relevant agencies to address the individual needs of clients. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition welcomes the fact that the Government has made a statement on disability reform. We think that the fact that the statement is made is an acknowledgment of the point which has been made by the Opposition for some time now that we are very concerned at the provisions for disabled Australians and believe that the Government does need to give attention to this matter, as indeed the Opposition has given attention to it. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that two aspects of the Government's administration of programs relating to the disabled are currently under examination by a Senate committee at the suggestion of the Opposition. Those aspects are the employment of the disabled and accommodation for the disabled. With respect to the reference on employment of the disabled, I must say that my own attention was drawn to serious deficiencies during the 1987 election campaign in what can only be described as a non-campaign mode period when, in a country town of New South Wales, a constituent of yours, Mr Acting Deputy President, proceeded to enlighten me on the enormous difficulties which face many disabled Australians in obtaining satisfactory employment. I am very hopeful that the Senate committee inquiry will produce some useful recommendations for both the Government and the Opposition. However, unlike the Government, the Opposition has not merely identified this as a problem and been prepared to do nothing about it. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Economic Action Plan which was released by Mr Peacock on behalf of the Opposition last month, in October this year, the Opposition made it clear that it thought a number of changes were required. We made changes which involved both, I suppose one could say, positives and negatives, although we would see both the expenditure reduction exercise that is part of that program and the expenditure increase as being positive from the point of view of individuals who are disabled. I do not think many Australians understand just how many people are on disability pensions in Australia. The numbers are in the hundreds of thousands, and it is a $2 billion program. Indeed, the statement of the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) which has been tabled today deals with some of the difficulties in this area, which arise from the very large numbers, and the difficult policy issues which arise. For example, the Minister says:</PARA>
<PARA>There is also concern at the long term dependency on disability payments. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a problem which is identified by the Government in this statement. Under the heading `Income Support Issues' the Government identifies some of the sorts of dilemmas that face policymakers in this area. For example, on page 7 of the statement, talking about the threshold of eligibility-in other words, just how disabled people should be before they are entitled to a disability pension-the Minister states:</PARA>
<PARA> If the threshold is set at a relatively high level, large numbers of people qualifying under current criteria would be excluded who would, nevertheless, be in need of some form of assistance. If, on the other hand, the threshold is set at a relatively low level, large numbers would become eligible with consequent high cost implications as well as possible disincentives for labour market participation. </PARA>
<PARA>Those last words mean that, if we allow very easy access to an invalid pension, that impacts upon the attempts that some disabled people will make to enter the work force. That can be a very great negative for those people, because being part of the normal working life of Australia can be an important part of ensuring that one identifies as a member of the community in a full sense. </PARA>
<PARA> There are quite difficult policy decisions to be made and they are not helped when they are made the subject of political point scoring and abuse. There is in this area, as in other areas, a tendency on the part of politicians generally, but I would say on the part of Labor politicians in this present Government in particular, to reduce any discussion of these serious issues and any proposals about these issues to a pretty low form of political debate. For example, the statement that the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) has incorporated states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition proposes to introduce punitive and discriminatory review measures on the pretence that these would magically reduce the numbers of people on invalid pension and sickness benefit. </PARA>
<PARA>I simply reject that proposition. As I say, it is an example of political point scoring. If honourable senators look at the last Budget Papers they will find $270m worth of expenditure reductions in social security brought about by a series of measures undertaken by this Government to reduce the costs of social security by reducing abuse or changing and refining programs, and so on. I think it is silly and, indeed, rather base of the Government simply to focus on anything which is put forward by the Opposition in the terms that it does. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Opposition is actually proposing is that individuals who are subject to or are receiving invalid pensions should be encouraged to seek rehabilitation for re-entry into the work force. It is proposed in a positive sense that greater access to rehabilitation and labour market programs, tailored to meet the special needs of the disabled people, will be provided. I would have thought that was something that would be warmly welcomed by the Government. Indeed, our announcement of a month ago has now been, in a paler sense, reflected in this statement, where the Government has agreed to give some increase to the rehabilitation services which will be made available to disabled Australians. I welcome that. I make the point very gently that what is proposed by the Government is considerably less than what was put forward by the Opposition some weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA> It is absurd to try to categorise the changes which are advocated by the Opposition as being some form of punitive attack on the disabled. What is being referred to is the simple proposal that people who are on sickness benefit should be subject to a monthly check by a Commonwealth medical officer, and some invalid pensioners should be subject to an annual check of the same nature. The Government in its own statement draws attention to the fact that there is a real problem. One of the problems which the Government identifies is the question-and I use the Government's words-of `the growth in long term dependency on disability benefits'. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Opposition's response? It is to say that on the one hand we need a more careful monitoring of the hundreds of thousands of people involved, some of whom are not severely disabled. We are not suggesting that people who are clearly, obviously and permanently disabled require this, but people who are on the margin should be subject to at least an annual check and they should have access to increased services to assist them to return to the work force. In those ways we are seeking to contribute to an improvement in the situation of the people who are the subject of this statement from the Government today. </PARA>
<PARA> I also draw attention to the fact that much of what is in this statement is a repeat of what was already announced in the Budget. The rest of it seems to be statements of intention about matters which will be inquired into and investigated. I do not despise the idea that there are ongoing inquiries and investigations as to how we should improve the lot of disabled Australians. Indeed, the Opposition is currently putting forward proposals for public consideration. A Bill was introduced into the other place today by Mr Ray Braithwaite, the shadow Minister for community services-essentially a tabled draft Bill which is to be a vehicle to enable people who are concerned with the Government's administration of the Disability Services Act to come forward with suggestions as to change. </PARA>
<PARA> The concerns that have been raised frequently with the Opposition, and certainly frequently with me personally, are concerns about the overly doctrinaire and bureaucratic way in which the Disability Services Act is being administered by the Government. This is a matter which I have taken up directly with the Minister and with some of his officials. The complaints are legion. The complaints are not about the directions that the Government set with the new disability services legislation. Those directions have received broad support, including from the Opposition. The problems which arise are problems which are almost automatically present in the administration of programs of this sort. We have on the one hand people who are theoretically involved, such as researchers and administrators-in a broad sense, people who are looking at how to change services for the better. On the other hand, we have people in the field who, on a daily, hourly, and minute by minute basis are grappling with the real on-the-ground problems of disabled people. And, of course, we have the disabled people themselves who are operating on the same hour by hour, minute by minute basis. </PARA>
<PARA> There properly is a creative tension between those who are devising new approaches and those who are administering services or are the subject of services which are provided. On the one hand, there is a natural conservatism in people; there is a natural desire to enhance security by making sure that things are predictable and stable. On the other hand, one can point to the real changes that have been made that have enabled many disabled Australians to go from positions of real dependency to positions of full or near full independence. That applies to people with mental disabilities and to people with severe physical disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, some wonderful and inspiring things are being done in Australia. I agree with Ray Braithwaite who said in the Parliament today that Australia is seen as a world leader in some of these fields. Some great efforts are being made in Australia to improve the quality of life which is available to people with disabilities. The problem is that some of those who are enthusiastic for change sometimes forget the practical realities which are faced by those who are actually benefiting from the programs. In putting forward a private member's Bill we are suggesting that, in particular with respect to people who have mental disabilities, there needs to be some parliamentary check on the procedures which are being followed by the Government. The Act leaves too much to administrative discretion, too much to rule-making by the Minister. We are looking to greater parliamentary supervision of the principles which are applied in the administration of the disability services program. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose the basic point that I want to make is that this is a field where political involvement is actually very important. I think the role of the politician, and the role of the Minister in particular, is to act as a monitor and a check on that process of dialogue and change which is occurring. It is vital that the Minister is personally involved and personally cognisant of the real difficulties that face people on the ground and in the field. I think it is equally vital that this Parliament-which is full of the elected representatives of the people, many of whom have direct contact with their disabled constituents and with the organisations which provide services for them-plays a role in making sure that this whole thing does not get of hand and become doctrinaire, ideological and impractical. My experience as a Minister in the previous Government was that, with the best intentions in the world, there was often a need to moderate the ideological bent of people who had power over organisations and individuals through the administration of programs. </PARA>
<PARA> In speaking to this paper, I say: yes, the Opposition welcomes it; yes, we agree that there is a need for further reform and progress in this area. We have specific proposals which we believe will advance the interests of disabled Australians. But my personal plea in all this would be for the political involvement to be, as far as possible, of a non-partisan character. I do not believe that any party has a mortgage on wisdom in this area. I think we need to act as the umpires in a situation where sometimes the creative tension can spill over and become quite destructive. I commend to the public the legislation which we have introduced in the House of Representatives today. I do so for the express purpose of inviting people with expertise, including those people most fundamentally involved, the disabled themselves, to make their views known and to come forward with suggestions on how the many difficulties, which are currently being raised, can best be met. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there has been no aspect of administration in which I have been involved from which I have learned more than in the area of working with the disabled. One learns it from the disabled themselves as well as from those who quite often devote a lifetime to advancing their interests. It is an area which is full of hope because of the amount of progress that has been made over recent years. But we, as members of the Australian Parliament, must make sure that that progress continues. I hope that this statement will be a step in the right direction. As Senator Macklin wishes to speak in this debate, I will not seek leave to continue my remarks, but I hope that there will be another opportunity to debate this statement further. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also welcome the statement put down by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) in this very important area. I agree with quite a number of the latter comments that Senator Chaney made, particularly with regard to the way in which the Disability Services Act is being implemented. I, too, have had a lot to do with people working in this area. I agree with the analysis that Senator Chaney made that there may well be a clash between people working on the continuing services that are necessary and people in the community who are devising new modes and ways of doing it. This is what is really causing the difficulty. I have not yet met anybody who really wants the Act changed, but I have certainly met hundreds of people who want the administration of the Act altered dramatically and radically. I have made a plea before in this chamber and I thought I had had a sympathetic response from the Minister. However, there seems to have been very little movement at the peripheries where the work is actually happening. That same rigid attitude still exists and, unfortunately, is causing massive problems to those people who have to do the work on the ground.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The guts of the statement that the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) has put down is to be found in the following words on page 17:</PARA>
<PARA> A new deal for people with disabilities must focus on opportunities for rehabilitation, training and employment. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is the essence of what we have to be about, but how we go about it is also vitally important. Within the last four or five weeks, on a study tour to the United States of America, I had the opportunity to spend some considerable time specifically dealing with the issue of new technology as it applies to people with disabilities. It is really quite amazing what is available in the world at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is that, in Australia, we have not seen fit to get a clear model of what we want to operate. If we read this statement carefully we see an oscillation between the old mode-that is, that we are all going out there to help somebody-and the new way of doing it, which is providing opportunities for people with disabilities to help themselves. Quite frankly, it is the latter mode that has to be taken up. Increasingly, those groups representative of people with a variety of disabilities are becoming frustrated, annoyed and angry at the patronising attitude taken by people working under the old mode. Unfortunately, it is obvious that this statement has not been written by a single person. If it has, that person is schizophrenic in his attitude to this matter as the statement moves backwards and forwards between those two modes. I do not think we have the opportunity to adopt both modes any longer. </PARA>
<PARA> What is available is exciting and dramatic. One of the people working in this area, with whom I worked for some time in the States, said to me, `We are not about weaving baskets any longer'. I spent an inspiring afternoon with a totally blind person who is a computer programmer. People who have any understanding of the difficulties of computer programming for anyone with sight would be amazed. This person is working on developing computer programs for satellite technology-an incredibly complex and difficult area. On the side, this person runs his own computer consultancy. Of course, since most of his business is done over the phone, he retailed to me that generally, when he arrives with his white cane and dark glasses, people are shocked and really quite taken aback. I think that is an interesting example of how one can have the wrong impression. But, when one questions why, one realises it is because one has in one's head a model which leads one to say, `This is not possible'. We carry those limitations. Those of us who do not suffer from mental or physical disabilities to any great extent carry around in our heads a model which limits other people. The problem of disabilities in our community ultimately is not one for the people with disabilities; it is for the people with abilities. It is they who are causing the problems. The people with disabilities are quite happy to get up and go but, often, they are restricted and encompassed by a mind set that does not allow them to do that, that says, `No, you will not'. To have a policy directed by people with disabilities seems still far away. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember very clearly and vividly an impassioned speech given in this chamber quite some years ago by former Senator Grimes, who was responsible, as Minister for Social Security, for taking very large steps in this area. Unfortunately, with former Senator Grimes's movement out of the Parliament much of that energy and thrust dissipated. What is needed is not new, nicely worded statements; we need that type of energy that former Senator Grimes gave to this area. He had a very clear and concise view of what should happen and that was that the policy directions for people with disabilities should be driven essentially by the people themselves, not by others. It is said on page 17 of the statement that a new deal for people with disabilities must focus on the three elements of rehabilitation, training and employment. Let it not be done in such a way as to continue to push on to people with disabilities what we believe they should be doing.

<PARA> That, noting the continued international concern about the fate of Swedish diplomat, Raoul Wallenberg, who disappeared into Soviet hands in January 1945 following the defeat of Nazi forces in Budapest, and (b) recent discussions between Soviet authorities and Raoul Wallenberg's family about his fate, the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) affirms its admiration for the selfless and heroic work of Raoul Wallenberg in saving the lives of tens of thousands of potential victims, both Jewish and non-Jewish, of Nazi terror during the Second World War;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) urges all interested parties to continue to co-operate in a comprehensive and conclusive examination of the circumstances relating to the detention of Raoul Wallenberg by Soviet authorities from 1945 onwards; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) resolves through its own work on human rights issues, to continue to apply the universal principles of freedom, justice and humanity that so vividly manifest themselves in Raoul Wallenberg's work. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate a statement relating to this motion in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Next January will mark the forty fifth anniversary of the date of Raoul Wallenberg's disappearance. </PARA>
<PARA> He was by all accounts a truly remarkable man. </PARA>
<PARA> His actions during the Second World War against appalling odds and possibly at the cost of his own life were simply heroic. </PARA>
<PARA> Raoul Wallenberg's example shows the power that lies within us all to rally in defiance and eventually to triumph over depravity and intolerance. </PARA>
<PARA> He personally saved the lives of tens of thousands of people who would otherwise have fallen victims to Nazi butchery: ordinary people-workers, mothers and grandmothers, school children-all marked for execution through the frightening and perverse twist of Hitler's call for a Final Solution. </PARA>
<PARA> But tragically, having survived and helped so many others to survive the Nazi occupation of Budapest, Raoul Wallenberg was himself swallowed up by the bloody creation of another dictator: lost into the clutches of Stalin's NKVD whence he was never to emerge. </PARA>
<PARA>Raoul Gustav Wallenberg was born on 4 August 1912 into a distinguished Swedish family. </PARA>
<PARA>After studying architecture in the United States he embarked on various commercial ventures, and through his business activities came to learn of developments in Nazi-occupied Europe. </PARA>
<PARA>By 1944, Allied leaders could no longer ignore the horrible fact of Hitler's Final Solution and tentative international moves were started to save Jews and other potential victims in Nazi-occupied territories from death camps. </PARA>
<PARA>President Roosevelt set up a War Refugee Board for precisely this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>Attention focused on Hungary, which had at the start of the Second World War a Jewish population of 750,000. </PARA>
<PARA>Discussions took place between the War Refugee Board and the Swedish government to expand Swedish diplomatic and consular representation in Hungary to work to save human lives. </PARA>
<PARA>It was in these circumstances that Raoul Wallenberg was appointed to the Swedish Legation in Budapest. </PARA>
<PARA>In the period from his arrival in Budapest on 9 July 1944 to his disappearance at the hands of the Red Army on 17 January 1945, Raoul Wallenberg and his colleagues in the Swedish legation saved perhaps one hundred thousand people from certain death. </PARA>
<PARA>They did so through mustering every resource they had at their disposal; sheer energy, tact, determination, forgery, bluff, and bribery. Ever vigilant, ever present, they were ready to issue Swedish identity papers and passports to anyone under threat. </PARA>
<PARA>Joni Moser, who worked in running errands for Wallenberg, describes one incident when Wallenberg learned that eight hundred Jewish labour service men were being marched to the Gestapo concentration camp at Mauthausen. </PARA>
<PARA>Moser and Wallenberg drove to the Hungarian frontier and caught up with the column. </PARA>
<PARA>Wallenberg asked that those with Swedish protective passports should raise their hand. </PARA>
<PARA> On Wallenburg's order, Moser ran between the ranks, telling everyone to do so, whether they had a passport or not. </PARA>
<PARA>Moser explains:</PARA>
<PARA>``[Wallenberg] then claimed custody of all who raised their hands and such was his bearing that none of the Hungarian guards opposed him. The extraordinary thing was the absolutely convincing power of his behaviour.''</PARA>
<PARA>In his work, Wallenberg was pitted against the ruthless killing machines of the Gestapo and the dreaded SS. </PARA>
<PARA> His antagonists included the infamous war criminal Adolf Eichmann. </PARA>
<PARA> At the very end of the Nazi occupation of Budapest, when he learned of Eichmann's plan for a total massacre of the 69,000 or so Jews who were still alive in the so-called General Ghetto, Wallenberg intervened in a final flourish of threats and brinkmanship to prevent the order being carried out. </PARA>
<PARA> When Soviet forces took control of Budapest some few days later, they found some 120,000 Jews who had survived the Final Solution-the only substantial Jewish community left in Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> Tragically, within a week, Wallenberg himself had disappeared. </PARA>
<PARA> He had devised a relief plan for the Hungarian Jewish community, and was on his way to present his ideas to Marshal Malinovsky, the Soviet commander, and the provisional Government. </PARA>
<PARA> His colleagues last saw him in the side-car of a Red Army motorcycle, on his way to discharge this mission. </PARA>
<PARA> What happened to Wallenberg after this still lacks satisfactory explanation. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been much speculation about Raoul Wallenberg's fate, with some-including, importantly, his family and his close colleague from Budapest days, Per Anger-believing that he may still be alive. </PARA>
<PARA> Soviet authorities, however, have maintained that Wallenberg died of a heart attack in 1947 at the NKVD's Lubyanka prison in Moscow. </PARA>
<PARA> Only last month, Raoul Wallenberg's family went to Moscow to get to the bottom of his disappearance. </PARA>
<PARA> They were given a small box containing his belongings-a blue passport embossed with the Swedish crown, some old currency notes and yellowed note pads-together with a reiteration of previous claims about his fate. </PARA>
<PARA> Sadly, despite the new openness and willingness on the part of the Soviet authorities to discuss the case, the examination of the circumstances relating to Raoul Wallenberg's disappearance is still not conclusive. </PARA>
<PARA> I for one believe that forty-five years after the disappearance of this remarkable man, efforts should continue to be made to clear up this matter once and for all. </PARA>
<PARA> But what then does Raoul Wallenberg's story mean for contemporary Australia, so far removed in time and distance?</PARA>
<PARA> In the first place, he and his colleagues from the Swedish Legation in Budapest saved the lives of many people who subsequently made their homes amongst us. </PARA>
<PARA> One such person was a 19-year-old woman, Anna Boskovitz, who had recently married. </PARA>
<PARA> After being arrested in the middle of the day on the streets of Budapest for ``looking Jewish'', she found herself released from detention by the Hungarian fascists into the hands of a stranger from the Swedish legation. </PARA>
<PARA> That stranger extended her the protection of his Government-protection that literally saved her life and allowed her subsequently to establish a new life in Australia. Not only does Anna Boskovitz owe her life to Raoul Wallenberg, Australia is a better place for having her and many like her among us. I understand that she is watching a debate on this resolution in the House of Representatives today. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the story of Raoul Wallenberg also serves to remind us of humanity's capacity for cruelty on the one hand and its resources for compassion on the other. </PARA>
<PARA> In the words of one person who was saved by him, ``Raoul Wallenberg symbolises the ideal that one person can make a difference''. </PARA>
<PARA> At a time in human history when there is so much cause for optimism, so much evidence of change, Raoul Wallenberg's legacy demands that we not be complacent. </PARA>
<PARA> The violation of human rights internationally is still, sadly, a daily occurrence. </PARA>
<PARA> In too many countries we see daily evidence of suffering and oppression. </PARA>
<PARA> In many parts of the world we continue to witness unlawful detention, torture, starvation and poverty, the displacement of large groups of people and refugees. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be easy to turn our backs on these problems. </PARA>
<PARA> It could be as easy as flicking a television switch. </PARA>
<PARA> But to do so in the fact of Raoul Wallenberg's example would be to betray the legacy he left us. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same Budapest that formed the backdrop for Raoul Wallenberg's heroism, we have this very year seen the determination of ordinary people to turn back the tide of totalitarianism. </PARA>
<PARA> And as in Budapest, so too in Warsaw and Berlin and Prague. </PARA>
<PARA> The universal principles of freedom, justice and humanity that so vividly manifest themselves in Raoul Wallenberg's work still fire the spirit of humanity today, just as the dark forces he worked to counter still have still to be eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this year the Prime Minister presided over a tree naming ceremony here in Parliament House in Raoul Wallenberg's honour. </PARA>
<PARA> He also paid homage to this remarkable man in July this year in Budapest, when he laid a wreath at a memorial erected to his memory by the people of Hungary. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, I am pleased to commend this motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We support the motion that has been moved by the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus). The life and work of Raoul Wallenberg, his courage, inspiration and determination are a lesson to us all. He reminds us that in the horror of man's inhumanity to man there is always something that each and every individual can do to combat such horror. What Wallenberg did has become legendary. He saved in Hungary perhaps 100,000 men, women and children from Hitler's final solution. He put his own life at risk every day working in appalling conditions. His reward in the end was that he himself became a victim of Stalin's Russia, another horrific totalitarian regime. His family and, in fact, the whole world community are still entitled to a proper investigation of his disappearance. In part, that is what this motion calls for. It is the very least that we owe to his memory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We also, of course, must never forget the atrocities of Nazi Germany and the lessons learnt from that awful experience. Wallenberg's memory helps remind us of those awful events. We must also remember that atrocities are still occurring daily around the world. Wallenberg reminds us, as I said earlier, that there is always something that each and every individual can do. It is not someone else's responsibility to combat the horrors that we witness throughout the world each day; it is the responsibility of each of us. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an occasion to remember that the weapons of one man's fight against arbitrary violence were idealism, courage and compassion. If I might use the words that were used in the House of Representatives on our side in a much more full contribution to this debate, it is an opportunity for us to re-dedicate ourselves to the advancement of individual human rights and freedoms, which he so bravely defended and which have always been at the heart of our beliefs. We support the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of my colleagues I wish to express our wholehearted support of this motion. The speech that has been incorporated by Senator Bolkus expresses in a very powerful way the reasons this motion ought to be supported. I take up a point that Senator Hill raised-in respecting and honouring the memory of a person who had undertaken such deeds, we ourselves should be mindful of the fact that it is necessary for everybody to at least attempt to have the courage to undertake such deeds when one's fellow human beings are put under such suffering and, in this case, where one's fellow human beings were threatened with total annihilation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The stories that have been written about Wallenberg's work are many. The one that has been reiterated in the statement expresses very clearly, I think, the essence of the person. When many Jewish men and women were lined up to be taken off to a concentration camp, he arrived on a motorbike and simply demanded that all those people with Swedish passports hold up their hands. He then had someone go through the crowd and tell everybody to put up their hands, which they did. He simply took them all away. The fact that he was able to do that suggests a person with incredible personal charisma and power. </PARA>
<PARA> It is one of the ironies of fate, as Senator Hill has said, that a person who devoted himself so marvellously to his fellow human beings should himself have suffered at the hands of a tyrant. He seemingly died not knowing that his memory and his work were so honoured around the world. It is with very great pride that my colleagues and I support the motion before the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is not impressed with the reasons given by the House of Representatives in transmitting its message No. 577. The House of Representatives, in rejecting the Senate's amendment to the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill has put forward five points. In disagreeing with the Senate's amendment the Government has said that the amendment would reduce the effectiveness of the 1989-90 Budget measures seeking to overcome the deferral of tax payments. In response to that, I remind the Senate that the reduction in revenue has been estimated by the Government at $50m. While this is a deemed loss to the Government, it is an imposition of $50m on public hospitals, benevolent institutions-perhaps only one would qualify; the Australian Red Cross-and public universities. Interestingly, the Government talks about a loss to its revenue but later, in its fifth reason, it shows its inconsistency. It says that government assistance to public benevolent institutions, hospitals and universities is provided for by means of outlay measures which are subject to review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Can the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) convince us that that $50m has been given back, by virtue of payments to the States and others, to public hospitals, benevolent institutions and universities? If so, we would be quite happy to allow this amendment to lapse. But he cannot. The Government is trying to claw back, by a backdoor method, revenue to these vital institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> We will make another deal with the Government. If it is prepared to review the financial situation of these institutions and to provide supplementary finance to them via their intermediaries, we will withdraw our amendment. But what we are not prepared to do is, by a backdoor method, have these people pay additional costs. It is just not on. In pious reasoning it was put to us that it was wrong for government revenue-in other words, tax instalment deductions-to be kept by the employer body, be it a hospital or any other employer, for up to a month. Therefore, bodies that have group remittances in excess of $5m under this legislation have to make two remittances a month. So there is not only the direct cost to universities and public hospitals but also the extra administrative costs of handling it. </PARA>
<PARA> So, as I mentioned earlier when the Minister was not listening, or when he was on the telephone, we would be only too happy, as would the public hospitals, to drop this amendment if the Government could guarantee either of the following: firstly, that as a result of this legislation being passed it will immediately review the financial situation of those public hospitals, universities and benevolent institutions affected and offer funds to cover any shortfalls experienced as a result of the legislation. That is quite reasonable. Or, secondly, that all costs incurred by public hospitals, universities and benevolent institutions are fully covered by government outlays to them. That is not unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Government cannot guarantee either of these options. If Senator Richardson can guarantee these options, we will withdraw the amendment forthwith. That is not unreasonable. As there is no provision in the Bill to reassess the funding to public hospitals, universities and benevolent institutions once this Bill has been enacted, I do not see how the Government can put forward reason No. 5 as a reason for disagreeing with our amendment. It has no basis in logic or fact. It is a concoction, in other words, to get the Government off the hook. There would not be one public hospital of the 70 which will be affected by this Bill which has all its costs fully covered by government outlays. That is the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> These public hospitals, universities and benevolent institutions are not for the benefit of private enterprise but, rather, they are for the benefit of the public and community. All these institutions and bodies have special recognition and status in the Income Tax Assessment Act. So, we are not including all public bodies across the board, because these are specially recognised under section 78 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. We are not asking for something that is unreasonable; rather, we are asking that the Government fund these bodies adequately and that it does not claw the funds back through the back door. </PARA>
<PARA> These bodies, particularly public hospitals, operate on deficit finance or overdraft arrangements; they are nearly always in the red, with their funding from the public purse in arrears rather than in advance. Therefore, most are faced with making interest payments on their overdraft; so the Government's interest gained is their interest lost and that is what we must recognise. Those interest payments are currently at rates of between 20 and 25 per cent. Should they now be expected to make twice-monthly remittances of pay as you earn tax, this will disrupt their planned cash flows and place them further in debt. </PARA>
<PARA> In many instances, it will not be possible just to transfer this debt to the public funding body; rather, it will have to be covered by the institution itself. So, what will happen? These bodies-the public hospitals, public universities and benevolent institutions-also rely very heavily on donations and bequests from individuals, particularly for capital works and equipment purchase projects. So, what will happen? People donate money to the Melbourne Royal Children's Hospital for beds and redecorating children's wards but, in the future, as a result of this legislation, some of that money will be used to pay the debt interest. What will people do? Potential donors will say, `No, I'm not going to donate money just to pay interest'. </PARA>
<PARA> People will not donate money to Senator Richardson's Australian Labor Party just to pay its debts. They will pay to win an election, but they will not give donations to pay off a debt or to pay off interest. The same thing will happen to these public hospitals. So the losers will be the kids and the facilities that are provided. This money will have to be transferred into the other account because the Government will not give us a guarantee that it provided adequate funding in its last Budget to meet this debt. It will not provide a guarantee that it will make a supplementary payment to cover this debt, so it is not unreasonable that the Australian Democrats should join with us in knocking back this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This type of legislation is not the humanitarian sort of thing which governments should be involved in. I believe it is disgraceful. It will not be possible to transfer debt to a public funding body. The other donations account will be heavily drawn on. An instance has been relayed to me where in one public hospital government funding covers only a quarter of the money required for equipment replacement and it does not supply funds towards refurbishment, so in that case my argument applies 100 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, hospitals make up the shortfall from donations and bequests and utilise the interest on these funds to purchase vital items of equipment and, as I said, to refurbish hospital wards. Our proposed amendment, which has been rejected by the other place for what I believe to be inadequate and insufficient reasons, has not come back to us. The Minister at the table says that the Government does not agree with our amendment and that the position in the other place should stand. It is disgraceful. It will impose costs which will be detrimental to the financial welfare of these institutions and to the welfare of the people whom they serve. This legislation will deprive those institutions of this finance and it will make them less viable. The number of services available will be reduced. I ask the Minister to give us a guarantee that he has either already covered it or will cover it. If he does, we will withdraw the amendment, but otherwise it stands. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stone said that I am ever the optimist, but I thought that Senator Richardson would find something to say in response to Senator Watson's comments on this legislation. The Australian Democrats supported Senator Watson's amendment when it was introduced early in November and will continue to support it for the very reasons just outlined by my Liberal Party of Australia colleague. All sorts of assurances can be-and are frequently-given by governments that we know can be withdrawn at the whim of either the same government or a future government. That is one of the reasons why I do not trust governments that say that they want to introduce a broad-based consumption tax and that they will offset that with personal tax cuts and will provide a safety net for those who are on low incomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those sorts of matters can be eroded in a variety of ways and can be taken away by a government that is under some sort of economic pressure. It was shortsighted on the part of the Government in the first instance to include in this legislation organisations such as universities, public hospitals, benevolent institutions, et cetera. It is now arrogant pigheadedness for it to continue with its position. The Government cannot ensure for all time that the guarantees of protection that it has apparently promised with regard to funding will continue and remain as an obligation in future years of either this Government or another government. </PARA>
<PARA> We must remember that, of all the organisations affected by this legislation, groups such as universities, public hospitals and so on are, in the main, deficit funded. In any event, their main source of finance is from Federal Government grants, capital works grants and so on, which we all know are subject to negotiation at Premiers conferences, to say nothing of the fact that they are likely to be reduced if the Government wants to increase its surplus or to reduce its deficit at some later stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The next favoured move by this Government when it wants to get a little more money in its coffers is to change the amount of grants to these sorts of instrumentalities and to cut expenditure on welfare and so on. As a result, most honourable senators are very reluctant to accept any sort of assurance from this Government that all will be well if only we trusted it. Over the past few years it has lost any chance it had to be regarded as trustworthy. </PARA>
<PARA> As was pointed out by Senator Watson, those organisations that do not receive sufficient funding from the Federal Government find it necessary to raise money through fund raising ventures, or by way of donations or bequests from people who may not, as the honourable senator said, be too happy about providing that sort of money, simply because the Government has decided to bring forward payments in this way. I think it is bizarre for the Government to compound the problems of funding and of meeting the financial obligations that are already faced by organisations like Australia's major hospitals, the universities, benevolent organisations and so on, by requiring pay as you earn tax payments to be made fortnightly instead of monthly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government states that a revenue issue is involved and that it will be in receipt of, I think, $50m in one shot and that this will boost the surplus for this year and, presumably, make it look better in the eyes of Moody's Investor Service Inc. and Standard and Poor's, or some other organisation that from time to time give us ticks of approval, or crosses of disapproval. That is fine as far as the Government is concerned. However, it is a once only benefit that it will accrue, but the damage that will be done to the institutions is ongoing. As I have said, most of them are deficit funded; very few of them have money to play around with. To require those sorts of institutions to come up with tens of millions of dollars, just because the Government wants this one-off boost to revenue, is bizarre, to put it mildly. They will have to acquire this money from somewhere, and that means either cutting their expenditure in some area-and I suspect that they do not have the sorts of overflows that they can cream off in that way-or borrowing the money, which will impose additional stresses on their finances for repayment, to say nothing of the additional pressure that it will apply to lending institutions.</PARA>
<PARA> This is one of the problems that we see in the Government's other piece of tax legislation-that which is requiring companies to bring forward their tax payments. When we start forcing businesses, public hospitals or tertiary institutions to go to lending institutions for fairly sizeable amounts of money, not only will that put a strain on existing capacity to lend but it must inevitably force interest rates up further because of the increased demand. I do not know what the Government is trying to do by this measure. For a miserable $50m-and let us face it, it is miserable in the general context of a government's annual budget-it will place enormous administrative and financial strains on institutions that are already reeling from government cutbacks and could lead to ripple effects down the track within the finance area that it may live to regret. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats have absolutely no intention of allowing either of those things to happen. I echo Senator Watson's comments: while the Government cannot guarantee that its guarantees will ever be met, these institutions have to be protected by this place, in the only way we know how-that is, by excluding them from the compass of the legislation, protecting them from further financial constraints, and asking the Government to rethink its position on this matter, to accept this amendment this time and proceed with the rest of the legislation. </PARA>

The provision in the Bill that the Senate is seeking to amend is a Budget measure and, of course, it does have revenue implications, of the order of $50m. I think all honourable senators would agree that that is a significant figure. I know that the Opposition has questioned this revenue loss; however, we have been able to confirm the figure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many institutions that are covered by the Senate's amendment are large employers. The Government does not accept the argument that, because the bodies that will gain from the amendment are public bodies, they should be given the benefit of the use of public funds. As was indicated at the time the Senate agreed to the amendment, government outlays to public hospitals, public benevolent institutions and public universities are appropriately provided by means of outlays which are subject to review and which are compared with competing demands for Commonwealth funds in the budgetary process. They are not provided by way of the use of funds that are prepayments of income tax by employees intended to be paid to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget measure does no more than seek to overcome the deferral of tax payments by the closer matching of remittances to collections. It should be remembered that it is not the remitter's money. It is necessary to realise that the Budget measure is part of a Government strategy aimed at eventually reducing the administrative burden placed on small businesses by the tax instalment deduction system, by moving small employers, which comprise the majority of remitters, to a system that would require less frequent remittances than at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government aims to continue with this strategy, despite the obstacle placed in its way by the Opposition parties in this amendment. However, the strategy should not be interfered with by making adjustments on the fringe, otherwise the system will become an administrative jungle. The amendment previously moved by the Opposition would effectively condone the back door financing of public institutions with Commonwealth funds through the use of extended retention of tax instalment deductions made from the salaries or wages of their employees. That is not acceptable to the Government, and again I ask honourable senators to reconsider their position on this matter, particularly given that it is a Budget measure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am suitably grateful to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) for his remarks. I emphasise the word `suitably', because, as Senator Haines has just interjected, what we heard from the Minister was simply a rendition, in virtually the same words, of the remarks that were made in the other place by the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Peter Morris). As Senator Haines has said, it proves that the Minister can read-which some may have doubted, but I give the Minister my personal assurance that I have never doubted that he could read.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator STONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But, again as Senator Haines suggests, it perhaps does not prove very much about his capacity for thought about these matters. The House of Representatives has returned to the Senate the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1989, indicating its disagreement to the amendment made here and, as is always the case, it has provided certain reasons for that disagreement. One of those reasons is that the amendment would reduce the 1989-90 revenue gain from the measure by an estimated $50m. The Minister has re-confirmed that estimate this afternoon. I take note of that. It is a serious point and one that we are not in the business of diminishing by jeering at it or something of that kind. I assure the Minister that we understand that that is a significant loss in revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, having acknowledged that aspect of the Minister's remarks, I want to say that the next reason for disagreement given by the House of Representatives is less convincing. It is that `the income tax instalment collections to be remitted twice-monthly by major employers . . . do not belong to them'. Again, taken at first blush that is incontrovertible. Obviously, the income tax instalment collections do not belong to the employers, but I suspect that the implication in that reason is that they belong to the Government. Indeed, I think this is not the first occasion when we have seen the Government apparently take the view that basically everyone's income belongs to it and that if we are good it will leave us a little bit, and that taxpayers should be appropriately grateful. I think we have here an example of that general syndrome. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, no-one on this side of the chamber could claim that these deductions, having been taken from the wage and salary packets of employees, are in any sense the property of the employers who, acting as agents for the Commonwealth, have made the deductions. We are not claiming that. What we are saying is that in the particular cases that are under reference here, namely, the public hospitals, public universities and public benevolent institutions, rightly or wrongly-and without spending too long on, shall I say, the theory of the matter-the fact that these deductions are made and have been made for some considerable time and remitted once monthly at present to the Australian Taxation Office has come to form part of the whole agglomerate of cash flows of these bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> What Senator Watson has been rather cogently pointing out since he first moved here the amendment relating to this matter when the Bill originally came to the Senate is that whether we like it or not those bodies are going to be significantly financially disadvantaged by the change that is proposed. I emphasise that this is not a matter of tax theory, because I think on the tax theory side I would not perhaps find myself totally in disagreement with the Minister. But it is a matter of the practicalities of the positions of the bodies concerned. There is not the slightest doubt that in order to meet the requirements of the proposed legislation, these bodies will be very much more considerably out of pocket than they now are. Indeed, the Minister's estimate of a $50m loss of revenue itself confirms that. The most obvious way in which these bodies can overcome the problem which will be created for them by this Bill is to borrow the amount to increase their floating debt, working capital or whatever one wants to call it-their borrowings from the bank, in most cases, I suppose. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not even sure that in every case they would be able to do that, and I would like to know from the Minister whether he is sure. Will the Minister give the Committee an assurance that all the bodies in the categories affected by the amendment originally passed by the Senate will be accommodated by their bankers in relation to the additional borrowings that they will have to make? That is the first question to which the Minister might address himself when he responds. </PARA>
<PARA> A further point-and Senator Watson also referred to this-is: even if these bodies can be given the initial financial accommodation to tide them over, shall I say, the effects of this legislation upon their cash flow position, will they then be able to sustain the interest costs on the borrowings that they have to make? What will that do to their overall finances? In the case, say, of public benevolent institutions, will it mean that they will have to cease carrying out some of the public benevolent activities that they presently carry out? In the case of a public university, will it mean that it will have to cut back a course or two here and there, employ less staff or, in some cases at least, increase fees? I do not know, but these are obviously the possibilities that present themselves when we start to think about this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose a further possibility is that some of these bodies would have to go to their respective State governments-I suspect that that would be the first port of call for public hospitals-and ask for a greater subsidy or subvention from the consolidated funds of the State government concerned. Without wanting to take that line of thought to its ultimate conclusion, I just want to know from the Minister whether the Government has given any thought to what in fact these bodies will do. So far I have heard nothing from the Minister to that effect. He simply got up here and made almost word for word the same speech as was made in the other place by Minister Morris. I hope that I am not misrepresenting the Minister; I read Mr Morris's speech earlier today. </PARA>

<PARA> The last of the reasons from the House of Representatives to which I propose to refer is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Government assistance to public benevolent institutions, hospitals and universities is appropriately provided by means of outlays measures which are subject to review and compared with competing demands for Commonwealth funds in the budgetary process. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, I want to say, so that there is no mistake on the Government's part as to where the Opposition stands on this matter, that I agree with that principle of public finance. Of course I agree with it. But, what we have here is a particular situation that has arisen because of a Government decision to impose this measure, the effects of which have not been properly thought through in relation to the institutions covered by the amendment originally passed by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> In that connection, I also want to say that the remarks made by Senator Haines were, I think, entirely apt, when she referred to the fact that this measure and, indeed, the companion measure to bring forward very considerably the timing of company tax payments, both of which were included in the Budget at the last minute, were pieces of quite shameless adhockery. I am not quite sure whether she referred to them in that way, but I do not think she would dissent. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator STONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also balk a little at the word `adhockery', so I understand the honourable senator's sensitivity. But I am afraid that the word has crept into the language. The fact is that both this measure and its companion measure were very much dreamed up at the last moment by a Treasurer desperate-and I mean that-to present to the Parliament last August a Budget which appeared to produce a significant increase in the Budget surplus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So we have this measure, which drags forward into 1989-90 a sum, I think from memory, of $550m, which otherwise would have been payable in 1990-91 and, therefore, improves the cosmetic appearance of the Budget surplus by the major amount of over half a billion dollars. Without straying too far, I point out that its companion measure brings forward the payment of what I might loosely call provisional company tax initially to the fifteenth day after balance date including-and this was the key point-in the case of so-called early balancing companies a measure which would have the effect of bringing into 1989-90 a sum, I think initially estimated in the Budget Papers at $885m, that also otherwise would have been collected in 1990-91. So between those two measures, we have a total amount of about $1.4 billion brought into 1989-90 that previously would have fallen due for collection in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> It is precisely because of this kind of ad hoc approach to budgeting that we have these two hastily constructed pieces of legislation-we have only one before us today-which are having the kind of fallout that is now detaining the Committee for the second time because of the unintended consequences. I am prepared to concede that the consequences probably were unintended. But that is the problem we face when we have the kind of government that we have today which rushes these measures through the Cabinet process and into a Budget for quite other reasons and which then has to face up to the consequences of having done so. </PARA>
<PARA> It is instructive to recall that, in the case of the other company tax proposal, we have subsequently had not one but two successive retreats by the Treasurer from the initial decision. Since that proposal is not before us this afternoon, I will not embark at length on that point. However, it is a fact that, in that case also, a hastily constructed piece of legislation had to be amended before the Treasurer (Mr Keating) introduced the Bill. The Treasurer retired in an absolute rout when finally the Bill was about to be debated in the Parliament. The Opposition announced its position on the matter and he beat a retreat. Quite frankly, we could not see his dust. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying to the Minister that, on the basis of what we have so far heard from his side-which is no more than a reiteration of what was heard in the House of Representatives-the coalition is disposed to maintain its objection to this aspect of the legislation and, therefore, to maintain the amendment that we originally moved to the Bill. The Minister may be able to remove our objections. Perhaps if he were to address the objections rather than merely addressing the piece of printed paper that someone has given him to read out to us, he might have more hope of doing so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to clear up a couple of points which have been made by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) in his reply. First of all, he has not addressed any of the questions which were put to him. I noted that, and it will be part of the basis on which we form our own attitudes to the matter. I want to pick up the comments which the Minister did make because, with such respect as I can retain in the circumstances, I have to say I find his comments extraordinary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First of all, he has described the interest cost to these bodies as minuscule. Of course, I do not know what interest rates these bodies would pay, and no doubt every one would be different. If the revenue loss, were this amendment to be accepted by the Government, would be $50m, and if one assumes, for example, that the average overdraft interest rate being paid by those bodies is 22 per cent-I doubt that it would be less, but we can quibble about a million or two if we want to-22 per cent of $50m is $11m, as far as I know. While admittedly this would be spread over a number of bodies, I do not regard-and do not think they would regard-their share of that as minuscule. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister then appeared to try to distort that point by talking about the revenue cost of the whole Bill. We are not rejecting the Bill. We are not proposing to reject the Bill. The Minister was talking about a revenue loss of $550m. That is the revenue to be had from the Bill as a whole. Our amendment would not cause that revenue to be lost. The Minister has told us-and I accept his estimate-that it would cause $50m to be lost. The revenue loss would not be $550m; it would be $50m. As to the word `minuscule', I leave the public benevolent institutions, the public universities and the public hospitals to judge whether they consider this amount to be minuscule. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicated earlier in this debate that public hospitals, by and large, operate on deficit financing. When this Bill comes back from the House of Representatives would the Minister be good enough to split the amount up State by State-as it is only `minuscule', it will not take a lot of calculation-in relation to public hospitals and the other bodies? Then we would be in a better position to accept this so-called `minuscule' figure. If it is minuscule, we have to doubt the propriety of the $50m. I am disappointed that none of the challenges that I have issued asking for proof have been taken up. If need be, show us the working papers-show that funding for these institutions has already been allocated in the Budget and we will accept it. Alternatively, agree to make a supplementary appropriation to cover the shortfall and we will withdraw our amendment. We will be satisfied.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In dealing with this package of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bills-Nos 3 and 4-the position of the Opposition is that it basically support the Bills on the basis that they represent a perhaps much lamented tightening up of the welfare system. After all, it has only taken five years of fairly lax administration by this Government for it to realise that there is a need for a tightening in this system. However, we will be monitoring the application of the various provisions, particularly those which have been brought to our attention by various groups who have a particular interest in these matters, to ensure that the administration of the provisions is equitable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In that regard the shadow Minister sought in the House of Representatives an undertaking from the Minister concerned that, in particular, those sections dealing with de facto or marriage-like relationships would be dealt with in a fair and equitable manner. Similarly, the shadow Minister, Mr Connolly, has given an undertaking that we will continue to monitor the administration of these provisions and, indeed, when in government, take any action deemed necessary should our monitoring show that there are unfairnesses resulting from the provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is probably fair enough to say that, when the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1989 was introduced into this chamber, Senator Powell moved a motion to suspend Standing Orders so as to refer parts of the Bill to a committee for scrutiny. We did not support the suspension of Standing Orders on that occasion, but the arguments that I voiced then in refusing to support the suspension of Standing Orders remain basically the same. </PARA>
<PARA> The term `marriage-like relationship' as a phrase seems to have supplanted the old term `de facto relationship'. The aim of the Bill seems to be to ensure that people who are not in a marriage situation but who are in a marriage-like situation are not advantaged above those people who are married. I think that there was a feeling of some resentment in the community hitherto that people who did not, in fact, enter into formal marriage but remained in a marriage-like or de facto relationship were somehow advantaged above those who were married. I suppose that the way in which the Bill is drafted gives a statutory code and a more precise meaning to a marriage-like situation than has existed in previous legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to take up the chamber's time in going through all of the clauses of the Bill. I notice that the Australian Democrats will be moving various amendments in the Committee of the Whole and we will deal with those then.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to touch on various aspects of the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) and the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4). As my colleague Senator Bishop has said, the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1989 was introduced by the Government to implement some of the details that were announced in the 1989-90 Budget and in the April 1989 economic statement. The Bill encompasses a number of features that I will briefly detail. My colleague has already referred to some of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill introduces new arrangements to determine whether recipients of certain social security payments are in what could be considered a de facto relationship. It also introduces a waiting period for unemployment benefit where the recipient moves to an area which can be considered as reducing his or her chance of gaining employment. It provides that unemployment and sickness benefits will not be payable to those who do not provide the Department of Social Security with their tax file number. It also includes changes involving deferment periods for education leavers, a tightening of recovery procedures where a person receives both compensation payments and social security benefits, changes to the income test arrangements for the family allowance and the family allowance supplement and some small changes to the administration of the child support scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps one of the most controversial aspects of the Bill is that relating to the definition of a de facto spouse, which Senator Bishop touched on earlier. The implications of this definition are far-reaching as they affect many areas of social security determinations which impact on pension payment rates and also on the payment of the supporting parent benefit. To be eligible for many of these benefits, an applicant must be unmarried. In that respect, the definition is widened to exclude those with a de facto spouse. A de facto spouse is often defined as a person of the opposite sex who is living as the spouse of an applicant on a bona fide domestic basis. Obviously, given the wide range of relationships that exist in today's society, when people of the opposite sex choose to cohabit there is considerable confusion. It may be that such a relationship involves merely a sharing of facilities or it may be one which on all accounts is identical to what would be considered a normal marriage. The current lack of an objective test results in considerable confusion not only for the potential recipients of benefits but also for those within the Department who must determine eligibility for the supporting parent benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> To give some idea of the number of people involved, as at 30 June 1988 some 182,000 people were receiving the supporting parent benefit-an increase of 2,900 on the previous year. There were also 95,369 new grants of benefit and 90,565 terminations during the same period. Of those terminations, 11,810 or 13 per cent were due to the recipient living with a de facto spouse. In Budget Paper No. 1 it has been estimated that the supporting parent benefit will cost the Australian taxpayer $2,236m in 1989-90, which is an increase of 4.9 per cent over the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been quite a deal of concern amongst community groups regarding changes to the de facto definition. It is perhaps to be expected that there should be an outcry from these groups, who may feel that some people will be disadvantaged under the terms of the Bill. Principally those concerns have centred on what they see as the continuing confusion over the definition of de facto relationships because of the lack of uniformity between State and Federal legislation. It is obvious that these concerns are genuine. However, the coalition believes that in this instance it is important to support the Government's attempt to tighten up an area of the social security system in which there is clear evidence of abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> In my State of Tasmania I am personally aware of many areas of abuse, but I do not claim that this abuse is by genuine recipients. However, Australian society being as it is, there will always be those who seek to exploit loopholes for their own benefit. The coalition will monitor the legislation to ensure that those people who are abiding by the rules are not disadvantaged. Accordingly, we will seek assurances from the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) that the appeal mechanisms will be maintained. The savings that will flow to the Australian taxpayer are significant and should not therefore be discounted. Under the legislation, which will come into force on 1 January 1990, $8m will be saved this financial year and $29m in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the area dealing with the unemployment benefit. As a result of the almost universal opposition within the community to the Australia Card proposal, the Government introduced a tax file number system. I do not need to spell out that individuals who fail to produce their tax file number suffer a tax rate at the top marginal rate plus the Medicare levy. No doubt the tax file number has served to reduce the incidence of tax evasion. It therefore does not seem unreasonable that those who fail to produce their tax file number should be denied unemployment or sickness benefit, as obviously there would appear to be some illicit reason for the non-production of that tax file number. Should applicants not wish to provide the tax file number themselves, they may give the Secretary to the Department authorisation to seek out their number or, alternatively, lodge an application for one. </PARA>
<PARA> Another measure mentioned in the Budget was a tightening of the work test for the unemployment benefit. This legislation will, therefore, amend the Act so that people who choose of their own volition to move to an area of higher unemployment than the one that they leave, or who may otherwise reduce their opportunity of gaining employment by moving, will be subject to a 12-week waiting period for that benefit. It is estimated that this measure will save $3.7m in 1989-90 and $9m in the next financial year. Again, I must stress that these savings will, hopefully, pass on to the ordinary taxpayer. Naturally the provisions of the legislation will not apply when the person concerned moves to be closer to his family. However, the coalition recognises that this, too, is an area of the social security system which has been subject to abuse. It is difficult to justify why people who are experiencing difficulty in finding employment can be supported by the Government in the dubious practice of moving to another area where their employment opportunities will be reduced even further. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the existing situation school leavers must wait for 13 weeks to receive unemployment benefits if they are single and have no dependants. This legislation will allow school leavers to reapply for either a job search allowance or unemployment benefits after four weeks, as compared with 13 weeks for the initial application. The coalition takes the view that people should not leave school and expect an immediate hand-out from the Federal Government before they have even had their first job. Therefore, under the Liberal-National Government, all secondary school and tertiary leavers who are over the age of 18 and have no dependants will qualify for a job search allowance only until they have their first job. The coalition sees the present unemployment benefit scheme as being sadly out of date with the reality of modern society. It does not reflect the needs or the wants of the Australian community. Quite simply, it is an unemployment scheme which should be reformed. </PARA>
<PARA> To respond to this situation, the coalition has put together an unemployment relief scheme package which we believe restores incentive. Unlike the present Government, we do not wish to condemn those who are unfortunate enough not to have a job to a never ending dependence upon unemployment benefit hand-outs. Unemployment benefits should not be seen as an alternative to employment. To reflect this philosophy, our police will provide unemployment benefits for a maximum of just nine months. When the existing unemployment scheme was initially devised, I do not believe anyone considered that unemployment would be such a long term problem. There is no doubt that as the problem has grown beyond the control of the Government there are some in our society who have simply grown to accept unemployment benefits as an alternative to work. Again, I wish to stress that this is by no means a broad generalisation; nevertheless, it is indicative of an element of those who abuse the system. </PARA>
<PARA> The knowledge that unemployment benefits will continue indefinitely reduces the urgency to seek employment, particularly in a situation where government sponsored income support may be on a par with, or perhaps even better than, that which could be expected from an independent income and there being no likelihood of the never ending supply being withdrawn. It is also apparent that officers within the Department find it extremely difficult to administer the existing work test arrangements and staff reductions will ensure that there is less verification of the extent to which applicants are genuinely seeking to gain employment. </PARA>
<PARA> To respond to this situation and to provide assistance which is obviously required by job seekers, the coalition is committed to ensuring the provision of intensive job interviews and assessments of the unemployed by officers from the social security, employment and education and training areas. This will facilitate the contact with the Department which the unemployed need if they are to receive the guidance they require. The staff resources of the Department of Social Security and the Department of Employment, Education and Training need to be maximised to assist the unemployed during the initial nine months. This is crucial to ensuring that the persons concerned return to the work force while they are still motivated and still possess their skills. There is no doubt that a period of long term unemployment not only makes the individual less attractive to a potential employer but also detracts from the skills which the employee can bring to that position. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's response to the initiatives which we have put forward have been very weak, to say the least. In fact, the Government has admitted that there are savings to be made in the area of unemployment benefit. However, it has provided no explanation as to why it has taken so long to acknowledge that the situation even exists. Part of its response has been an attempt to discredit the financial basis on which the coalition's plans are based. Once again, its arguments have been based upon facts which simply do not add up. The coalition believes that special benefits should be made available only to those who are making a genuine attempt to find work and not just to those who may of their own will have chosen to lead an unemployment lifestyle. The Government has cited figures, attempting to claim a leakage from long term unemployment benefits of 80 per cent. This assumption has been politically motivated and is definitely designed to discredit our policy. The Department of Social Security indicates that about 75 per cent of the long term unemployed are under the age of 45, about 65 per cent are single, and over 75 per cent do not have dependent children. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation also includes a provision which attempts to make adjustments to the income test arrangements for the family allowance and family allowance supplement. Section 74b of the principal Act deals with reductions in the rate of the family allowance supplement where there is a decrease or an increase in taxable income. In relation to a decrease, the provision will apply only if the income is at least 25 per cent down on that of the previous year and the threshold level based on the number of dependants. It cannot be denied that the family allowance and family allowance supplement provide significant support for Australia's families. As with other pensions, the coalition supports reasonable indexation arrangements. We have an ongoing commitment to ensuring the protection of the Australian family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was just going to say that when Prime Minister Hawke delivered his election policy speech on 13 November 1984 he made a very hollow promise to the Australian population. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>This Government sets the welfare of the Australian family as its top priority.</PARA>
<PARA>We would have to agree that that promise has come back to haunt him almost as much as his famous words of June 1987 when he said that no Australian child would be living in poverty by 1990. Unfortunately our present Prime Minister has a habit of making promises on which he fails to deliver. I, for one, am confident that the electorate will remember Labor's string of broken promises when it returns to the ballot box next year. </PARA>
<PARA> The very future of the family structure as we know it is under threat-not from an enemy from without, but rather from an enemy from within. The high taxing policies, the high inflation, the crippling interest rates and the unemployment, all of which have been inspired by the Hawke Government, are the things affecting Australian families of today. We do not need reminding that real disposable household income has fallen. An estimated 2.5 million people, one in every eight households, are living in poverty, and 440,000 children are in families living below the poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight when we climb into our comfortable Canberra beds-those of us who are staying here-we need to remember that 70,000 young Australians will be going to sleep in the streets. They will be found under bridges, under newspapers, and in any area where they are able to provide themselves with some form of shelter. This is a record of neglect that no government should be proud of. It is one that this Government should be condemned for. Not surprisingly, the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission has found that in the period from 1981 to 1986 the proportion of marriages ending in divorce increased from 14 per cent to 35 per cent. This is seen as a direct consequence of the pressure the Government is placing on Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA> Another consequence is that an increasing number of women and children are being forced to enter the work force in order to supplement family budgets and to cope with the ever increasing living costs, not to mention the ever increasing interest on their housing mortgages. If I remember correctly, that matter has been raised once or twice this week. It is certainly a dramatic increase and that can be shown by the fact that, in July 1980, 41.4 per cent of women with dependent children were working. By June 1988 this figure had risen to 51.2 per cent. Whilst the previous coalition Government increased the rate of the family allowance by 50 per cent for the third and subsequent children in 1981 and by 50 per cent in 1982 for the first and second children, up until April 1989 the present Hawke Government had not seen fit to make any meaningful increases in this allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite clearly, there is no doubt that this Government has ignored the family and its importance to our society. The real value of the family allowance, the dependent spouse rebate and the sole parent rebate remains about 20 per cent lower than it was when this Government came to office. The effects of this poverty on the children who are to become our future adults will be that they will be required to leave school earlier, generally they will have more health problems, and many will be permanently disadvantaged by their parents' lack of financial resources. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1989, which is currently before the Senate, I suppose has provoked in the community more outrage, because of the contents of some of the clauses, than I have seen for some time. The major point of contention is the proposal that postpones the unemployment benefit for three months for people who move to an area of high unemployment. The aim of this clause, presumably in the minds of the Government or the departmental adviser who in his or her wisdom dreamed it up, was to discourage people from prolonging their period of unemployment by deliberately going to an area where they knew jobs were scarce so that they would have an excuse to stay on unemployment benefit. I find that a most outrageous suggestion. I think it has taken the syndrome of blaming the victim to new heights or, probably more appropriately, new depths.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wonder whether the Government and its advisers have bothered to work out just what the demographics are in most of the major cities and most of the major retail areas of this country. Has the Government not worked out not only what the demographics are but also what the income distribution is? If it has not worked out either of those, I suggest that it should have a look at a few figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), or at some of the studies that have come out of the University of New South Wales-or the University of Sydney; I forget which one it is-which recently brought out a report delineating the distribution of income in this country. It is patently apparent to anybody who has a look at the demographics and the income distribution in this country that the two have a tendency to coincide; that the major groups in poverty are families headed by women whose marriages have broken down, or who have been widowed; who are left raising children; who are dependent on some sort of social security benefit; and families where one or more of the adults are unemployed. Those two groups make up two of the three major low income groups in this country, the third group, of course, being those people in their retirement years who are solely dependent on the age pension and have no other source of income. </PARA>
<PARA> So the Government should have been able to work out, if it tried even a little, that the unemployed are among the poorest in the community. They are, therefore, the ones who are most likely to need low income housing. In case greater minds than mine have not noticed this in the bureaucracy, low income housing has a tendency, certainly in South Australia, to be public housing units. The cheapest housing that is available is that housing which, in the case of South Australia, comes from the South Australian Housing Trust. Again in South Australia-and I presume that this is true of other States-the largest pools of public housing and the cheapest private housing rental accommodation are, surprise, surprise, in areas of highest unemployment. The two have a tendency to go together in places like Whyalla, the Riverland, Elizabeth and some parts of the south-east where jobs are rarely available in the long term and only occasionally available to some unemployed people on a seasonal basis.</PARA>
<PARA> Yet here we have the Government saying, `If you are unemployed and you are seeking low-cost accommodation and you live in a State where that accommodation is predominantly found in an area of high unemployment, we will deny you a further three months of unemployment benefit'. So, presumably people who move there, or who are actually sent there by the public Housing Trust authorities, will be hit harder than they have ever been hit before. What do they do when they go into the Adelaide office of the Housing Trust? Do they say, `Please put me on your list for a unit that is suitable to my family's needs, but make sure you do not put me in an area where there is high unemployment because, if you do, the Government will deny me unemployment benefit for a further three months and I will not be able to pay the rent anyway'?</PARA>
<PARA> Does the Government really intend-is it a deliberate intention-to penalise those families where unemployment is a problem, by delaying unemployment benefit by a further three months because they have to move from an area and accommodation they can no longer afford to an area where rents are low and, coincidentally, unemployment is high? Is there some sort of deliberate policy? Does the Government think that this will suddenly magically produce a job or magically produce the skills in the individual that will make him suitable to take a job that previously he had not been able to take? I suggest that, if that is the idea behind it, a few people on sizeable salaries, both on the Government benches and in the bureaucracy, need to get out there into the community and have a look at what life is really like. Simply to exclude from this loss of benefit people who move into a targeted area where other members of their family already happen to live-and that seems to be the only exclusion-is bizarre and, I might add, gives a whole new meaning to the term `family reunion'. Why should the people who move into an area where housing costs are low and where unemployment is high be entitled to retain unemployment benefit if, and only if, some other member of the family coincidentally happens to be living there? What if there are not any additional members of the family even living in that State, much less in those sorts of areas?</PARA>
<PARA> So we have a ludicrous situation where the Government is compounding an already serious problem of poverty, low self-esteem, family problems and other sorts of social problems that stem from unemployment and from low income households by saying, `If you choose to ease your financial problems by moving from an area where housing costs are relatively high to one where they are relatively low, and in doing so you move into an area where unemployment levels are high, bad luck, buster. You are going to be further financially impeded because we are going to take unemployment benefit away from you for a further three months'. No wonder we saw demonstrations held outside the Department of Social Security offices today, like the one in Footscray in Victoria where people met to protest against these cuts to unemployment benefit when people move to these areas of so-called low employment. I think it is worth while quoting what one of the speakers there had to say. She said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is an outrage that the Government intends to place a further financial burden on people in receipt of unemployment benefits and falsely assumes that the unemployed do not want work. </PARA>
<PARA>This is precisely the sort of assumption that was made by the Opposition and echoed by Mr Elliott, when the Opposition decided that it would penalise the long term unemployed, when he said, `This is not hitting at social welfare recipients; it is taking from the bludgers to give to the workers'. That is a nice, trite statement that certainly played on the prejudices of many Australians who believe that the long term unemployed are lay-about teenagers, and who do not bother to look at ABS figures that indicate that people who are long term unemployed fall into two main groups: males over 40 who have been made redundant by their previous employer for one reason or another, frequently because the firm has moved towards high technology or high mechanisation areas; and women over the age of 45 who have been at home for 20 or more years raising children and who are now seeking work. Quite often it is because the marriage has broken down because her husband has found somebody younger and more exciting and gone off with her, and she is forced to support a 15- or 16-year-old who possibly wants to go on to university. Those are the people who are finding it difficult to get jobs. The statement from the speaker at the protest rally in Footscray today went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>This cynical money saving exercise is grossly unfair and discriminatory. It effectively denies freedom of movement and increases the financial burden on an already financially disadvantaged group in our community. </PARA>
<PARA>Where is the Labor Party's commitment now to those who voted it into government, those people who supported it in 1983, who believed its political propaganda at that and subsequent elections that Labor would improve the economy so that by 1990 no child would be in poverty and that all people who wanted work would be able to get it, and that it was really there to look after the workers of the world and people who were least able to look after themselves-that is, age pensioners and people living in poverty?</PARA>
<PARA> Where are the Labor senators who were here in 1982 and joined the Democrats in defeating the iniquitous legislation introduced by the Fraser Government in relation to the wives of strikers? Where are the Labor senators who got up in the Senate chamber and decried attempts by a conservative government to blame the wives and children of men who had gone out on strike as though they were responsible for what their husbands and fathers were doing? Yet here we have another Bill aimed at blaming the victims for circumstances which are frequently beyond their control. I know where they are-or at least I know where they are not. Where they are not is in this chamber. Where they are not is in here either defending this legislation and letting us hear some of their reasons for voting for it in Caucus or saying why they believe this Government has gone wrong yet again. They are all, more or less, absent from the chamber, as they have been increasingly since 1983 as the current Labor Government moves further and further to the Right and becomes increasingly conservative and almost indistinguishable from the main Opposition party in this place. It is no longer true that there are significant differences between the Labor Party and the Liberal-National Party coalition. It is only a matter of degree. The Labor Party says it will cut expenditure in welfare, health and education areas, and the Liberal Party says that it will cut it a bit more. The Labor Party says that it will penalise people who do not have jobs, and the Liberal Party says that it will penalise them a little bit more. </PARA>
<PARA> It was bad enough, I suggest, in 1986 when the Government decided to increase its surplus and decrease its expenditure by delaying consumer price index increases to age pensioners by six weeks, just before Christmas. Not only was that an enormous impediment at that time to the elderly, who normally look to that half-yearly increase to give them the extra money that they need to stock up for Christmas or to buy their grandchildren presents, but it also hit very hard the small business sector, in particular the small retailing sector, which depends on its pre-Christmas trading to make up for losses in the low income parts of the year. But that did not seem to concern the Labor Party, nor the Opposition members who supported that legislation. Much more important, apparently, was to get a significant surplus to impress Moody's Investor Services Inc., Standard and Poor's Corporation, the big business community, or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of that the Government then moved to discount ex-service and defence pensions by 2 per cent and went on in 1987 to take Austudy payments away from those low income families who had a 15-year-old in one of the last two years of school, something which did not much affect New South Wales and Victoria but which had enormous effect on low income families in South Australia. I do not recall another piece of legislation that has led to so many women ringing my office in tears with stories about the effects of that loss of income-and it amounted to something like $40 a week maximum. The families concerned had to be very poor indeed to qualify for it. They were then going to be forced to take their children out of school. Of course, at that time the Government made quite sure that there were no benefits for youngsters of that age who were unemployed. So Austudy went out the window for those groups. Again, they were sacrificed on the altar of a high Budget surplus to impress the big business community and presumably to keep the Government in power in the election that followed that year. </PARA>
<PARA> Forty-five-year-old widows copped it in the neck that same year when the Government decided that once their youngest child turned 16 they did not need to be on the class B widows' pension any more, that they did not need to be a recipient of government assistance, that they could go out and get themselves a job, and that, if they could not get themselves a job, they could go on unemployment benefit. The latter, of course, meant a cut in income since the class B widows' pension was bringing in, with its size and its additional benefits, a greater income than the unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> They also lost significantly in another area, an area which is just as important as the financial one. They lost out psychologically, because their self-esteem took an incredible battering. Those business people who argued that the Government had to get an increased surplus by cutting expenditure in welfare areas and who were quite happy to see 45-year-old women on the class B widows' pension targeted are the very people who will not give a job to a woman in her mid-forties who has been out of the work force for 20 or more years. Why? It is because they give those women absolutely no credit at all for developing any sort of managerial, budgetary or personnel skills in all the years that they have spent raising their families. This Government, it seems, is hell-bent on proving that it can bash the less well off, that it can penalise those people who are the most powerless, and that it can blame the most victims even better than the Opposition can. So much for no child living in poverty by 1990. So much for putting families high on people's list of priorities in government. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to know from the Minister or anybody else in government how the Government believes that denying these benefits will keep people out of poverty. How does the Government believe it will keep families together? I ask how it can argue that its aims are fairness, justice and equity for all when, on the one hand, it is prepared to spend $2,000m cutting company tax by 20 per cent, from 49c in the dollar to 39c in the dollar, at a time when some businesses are paying no tax, thanks to the use of negative gearing and then, on the other hand, to cover the costs of that, make it up by taking widows of 45 years of age off the class B widows' pension and sending them out to try to find work, taking Austudy payments away from 15-years-olds, depriving ex-service and defence personnel of an overdue increase in their pension and saying to the unemployed: `If, in order to save costs on housing, you move to an area where unemployment is recognised as being high, we will take your benefits away from you altogether for another three months'. I say to the Labor Government: it is about time it had a look at the roots from which it claims it sprang and saw just how far it has moved away from them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a couple of points I would like to make before making my substantive contribution to this debate. Firstly, I say to Senator Calvert that I am very disappointed that he, too, should join the serried ranks opposite who clearly have the same speech, full of the same inaccuracies and wrong figures. Senator Calvert seemed to suggest that there had been no drop in unemployment benefit paid out or in the number of unemployed people in the term of this Government. Indeed, he suggested the reverse. For the record, I say to Senator Calvert, who has long since left this chamber, that there were about 630,000 unemployed people when we came to office. There are now 350,000 unemployed people, with long term savings of $5 billion. That is a lot of people who are no longer unemployed. If Senator Calvert keeps on saying that unemployment numbers have increased, one can only doubt his capacity to understand simple figures. There were 630,000 unemployed people when we came to government. There are 350,000 unemployed people now. Those figures are fairly clear and easy to understand. They are contrary to his claim.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, I say to Senator Haines, `Good stuff, but very wide of the mark'. To suggest that there is no difference between the Labor Party and the Liberal Party is a measure of Senator Haines's lack of understanding. The Labor Government has been very concerned to address the problem of unemployed people, the problem of poverty and the best ways to assist people out of poverty. We have had, within our own ranks as well as across this chamber, considerable debate about the best way to assist people out of poverty. Paying them benefits to keep them on a modest income for the rest of their lives is no way to do it. The Liberal Opposition's policy-to forget them after nine months, to never speak to them again and to put them on special benefits-is probably the very worst strategy. I am advised that it would not be unlike a return to the good old Chaney-led social security days, way back then. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's policy is to say to anybody else: `The best we can offer you is $100 a week for the rest of your life and if you are'-as Senator Haines wanted to say-`a little behind; if you are out of a job because you have had insufficient education, what we will do is keep paying you unemployment benefit, but we will not speak to you. We will not care if you never come in for an interview. We will not care if you do not have the skills or the bridging courses to get back into a job. We will not worry about that'. The best we can do, according to Senator Haines, if we are to help people, is to keep on paying modest unemployment benefits and forget people. That is not this Government's policy. It should be clear to people that this Government is concerned to assist those who are on unemployment benefit by saying that we think the very worst thing that can happen to people is if they are left on unemployment benefit forever. </PARA>
<PARA> We have established Newstart and the jobs, education and training (JET) program specifically targeted, in the first case to long term unemployed, and, in the second, to sole parent beneficiaries. We have said to both of those categories of people: `We think the best way out of poverty is the income security of a job. To get a job we know that you need education, bridging courses, or other assistance'-even in establishing the confidence that Senator Haines referred to. Absolutely. It is this Government and its specifically targeted policies that are addressing those needs. </PARA>
<PARA> Unemployed people do not get ignored by this Government. They get assistance to become employed because the Government knows, and so do the people out there, that it is much better to have a job than to have unemployment benefit. That is unarguably the fact. Senator Haines took us way back to when the pensioners, for example, had to contribute to all of this by taking a six-week delay in the payment of their pensions. She did not also say that, in the last Budget, that payment is now brought forward, not only by the six weeks but by a further six weeks. It is brought forward by 12 weeks to compensate pensioners and to restore the pension, as well as increase it. We did not hear that from Senator Haines. We did not hear Senator Haines say that, at the time that was done, the Government faced one of the worst economic crises this country has ever faced. It spared no group in the community when it asked the people to make their contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken to pensioner groups and I have heard people say, `Yes, it was terribly tough but we are not sad and we are not ashamed of having made our contribution to the economic recovery of this community'. I say to Senator Haines: if none of those things had been done, where would this country be now? Arguably, it would be much worse off. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also true that widows with children over 16 moved from the widows' pension to unemployment benefit. Senator Haines would seem to suggest that only 45-year-old women with no work force skills for the last 20 years suffered. But in all of this I did not hear Senator Haines saying, `And what about the workers of this country who have actually seen a real wage reduction traded off against the social wage, traded off against the creation of 1.5 million jobs in the last six years?'. This is the party of concern and consensus across the board. It involves the whole community. It does not pick off one section or another when it is asking for the tough stuff or when it is handing out the good stuff. It has its priorities but it says, `Everyone will be involved'. Senator Haines's speech was out of date. It was also wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> Ultimately, Senator Haines is very good at pointing out the insufficiencies, as she sees them, of the Liberal Party or the Labor Party, but I have never yet heard her declare what she would do. I presume from her speech today that the Australian Democrats would continue massive unemployment benefit payments to anybody who wanted to be unemployed, would do nothing to encourage people to cease to be unemployed and would persist with women being on class B widows' pensions and not encourage them, at whatever age, to get jobs. Senator Haines should also know that there is legislation lying on the table of the South Australian Parliament, introduced by a person who is no longer, I suspect, the member for Hayward, June Appleby, to make sure that there is no age discrimination against women, or men for that matter, who apply for jobs when they are over 35 years. That anti-age discrimination legislation is still lying on the table of the South Australian Parliament. So yes, we are aware of the problems, but the difference between a Labor government and a Democrat leader is that we are in a position to do something about them. I have never heard Senator Haines say what she would do. However, she is very good at complaining-again and again. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a significant cognate debate, covering the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) and the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4). It covers a number of significant areas of change and policy measures announced in the Budget. They include aged care, youth policies, and matters concerning the unemployed. In particular, I want to talk about the arrangements for sole parent beneficiary assessment, about eligibility for the sole parent's pension. I appreciate the time constraints; so I will try to make my comments brief. For the record, the Labor Caucus and the Labor Government have been very concerned, in addressing this issue, to pay considerable attention to the concerns of women in the community. Those concerns have been raised with a number of us over the last six months or so. I assure any women listening that those concerns have been taken very seriously. They have been addressed by the Government and the Caucus in the form of a special working group to make sure that the changes in this legislation did take account of the concerns raised by women in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that was clear was that the assessment of who was eligible for sole parent benefits sometimes became quite arbitrary, because there were no clear guidelines, rules, or indicators for departmental officers to follow when making that assessment. This legislation makes the list of indicators that departmental people must follow much clearer. It sets out a thoughtful and considered process in order to help people. It is designed to curtail any invasion of the privacy of the people concerned. It also allows the person applying for the sole parent pension or its continuation to give the Department all the information it needs by filling in forms or attending interviews in the departmental office. The home is not to be available for interview, unless a person makes that decision. Essentially, it is now a departmental procedure, and I think this will be helpful to both the people involved and the departmental officers. It is much clearer, much more accurate and much less arbitrary. </PARA>
<PARA> Those things are not done, as Senator Haines would suggest, because we are cruel or harsh but, rather, because we are fired by exactly the opposite-a concern to ensure privacy, accuracy, fairness and equity in relation to making those payments. I think this matter will be much better addressed with these clearer indicators and procedures outlined under this legislation. I hope that, if any women in the community who have raised concerns are listening, they will appreciate that considerable thought and effort has gone into addressing the problems that they have raised. </PARA>
<PARA> It is particularly useful in the legislation that, after the information has been provided in a series of sequential interviews, one leading to the next if necessary, the Secretary must make a decision, near enough to forthwith, on that evidence that the person is or is not eligible for a pension. This legislation requires that decision to be made. There is no possibility for the decision to drift on, with people living in a state of indecision. If pensioners or prospective pensioners are unhappy with the decision, they will be advised of the opportunity to appeal. If they are already on a pension, the pension will continue pending resolution of the appeal. If they are not, of course, they will still have the opportunity to apply for that appeal. So, in all sorts of ways I think the properly voiced concerns about this area of the legislation have been dealt with very sympathetically and constructively in the interests not only of the departmental officers who will have the administration in this area but also of those single parent pensioners who are applying either for the first time or for a continuation. </PARA>
<PARA> Once a person is assessed as being eligible for a sole parent pension, that assessment will apply for 12 weeks, and the pensioner can be assured that, during that three-month period, there will be no further examination of his circumstances or a requirement to provide information about their circumstances, unless of course he advises the Department of a significant change in his circumstances. As I said earlier, because of the time constraints I will confine my remarks to those I have made. I urge support of these very significant and comprehensive pieces of legislation. </PARA>

Clause 35 seeks to amend the Social Security Act 1947 so that people will not be able to claim an invalid pension once they reach 65 years of age in the case of males or 60 years in the case of females. The Government has said that it has introduced this legislation in order to prevent older migrants claiming invalid pension. Instead, an older migrant will have to claim special benefit, which will be recoverable from the person's relatives if they have signed an assurance of support in respect of that person.

<PARA>. . . the clear purpose of invalid pension as a payment related to incapacity for work for people of work force age. </PARA>
<PARA>However, I put it to the Senate that this step will create an inequitable circumstance. In fact, various ethnic groups have lobbied to this effect. It will be inequitable because the families of older migrants will be forced to meet the cost of unforeseen injury and illness which occur after the person has arrived in Australia. At present people have to wait until they have completed 10 years of residence before they are eligible for an age pension, which of course is a foreseen circumstance. A person knows how long it will take to reach pensionable age, but people who come to Australia able-bodied and able to work cannot foresee that they may have an accident or, because of unforeseen illness, find themselves unable to work. If that occurs, that person is placed, correctly, on an invalid pension. It is quite unnecessary to target and discriminate against older and newly arrived migrants and put them in a different class of citizen from other Australian citizens. Under the current Social Security Act, any working person, regardless of age or length of permanent residence in Australia, is eligible for the invalid pension. </PARA>
<PARA> The special benefit is to be available only to people who are deemed to be destitute. Further, the special benefit will not be a benefit at all for newly arrived migrants, because the Government is in a position to recover this payment from those migrants' relatives who have signed an assurance for support. That is now mandatory for migrants who seek to bring older relatives to Australia under the family reunion program. Therefore, the introduction of these changes would constitute a gross violation of the Government's social justice principles of access and equity and the Government's stated commitment to multiculturalism. Only a few weeks ago we had the launch for the multiculturalism agenda. It would also partly dismantle the very reform introduced by a previous Labor government to alleviate hardship faced by migrants. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1908 the invalid pension has been paid in respect of permanent incapacity for work, and at present there is no age limit in recognition that people's capacity for work does not necessarily vanish on the day that they turn 65 years in the case of a man or 60 years in the case of a woman. In fact, a substantial number of people continue to work for many years after they reach pensionable age. This has been recognised by the Government in its change to the taxation of non-pension incomes for age pensioners and in allowing many of those holding government appointments to continue to work until they reach 70 years of age. However, the proposed changes will confine eligibility for an invalid pension to working age people. The Government has justified this change on two grounds. The first is that the current eligibility guidelines are inconsistent with age pension residence requirements, but this is an illogical claim because the invalid pension has the same residence requirement as does the age pension unless the person became ill or injured after arrival in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It must also be borne in mind that, in the case of workers injured on the job, the Government has a clear responsibility to ensure an adequate income for an individual and for his or her dependants. This is, and will continue to be, the case for those younger people who are injured at work or become ill. Therefore, the proposed changes are clearly inequitable, forcing families of older migrants to meet the costs of injury or illness occurring after arrival in Australia and promoting a dependence which does not apply to other members of the community. The second justification by the Government for this step is that the change will prevent older migrants from receiving invalid pension. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 24 October 1989:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) With reference to an announcement made on 14 October 1986 on a package of measures designed to assist Australian industry to bid for Defence work and to develop and export military and related products: (a) what assistance has been provided to exporters or potential exporters of defence products by the Department of Defence since October 1986, and what was the cost of this assistance; (b) what indigenous defence products have been evaluated by Defence and to whom have the evaluation reports been supplied; and (c) has any arrangement been reached with overseas customers to establish and draw on spares holdings belonging to the Australian Defence Force; if so, who are these customers and what spares or parts were involved.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In the same announcement, the Minister announced that discussions were proceeding between Defence and AUSTRADE to enable the latter to better exploit export opportunities for defence products: (a) what is AUSTRADE's strategy for facilitating the export of defence products; (b) what products are being marketed; (c) who are the principal targets of the export strategy; (d) what is the annual cost of implementing the strategy; and (e) has the strategy been considered by Cabinet.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) On 14 June 1988 it was announced that the Government had agreed to new principles for the control of defence exports, and that the revised guidelines would be published in order to make the new export control system transparent and to facilitate `necessary and welcome dialogue between exporters and responsible officials': (a) what are the revised policy guidelines for the export of defence material: (i) do exports to New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada still require an End User Certificate stipulating that the items will not be re-sold to a third country without Australian concurrence, (ii) do the guidelines continue to divide items of defence material into Category I, II, and III items and how are these used in the consideration of export applications, and (iii) under what circumstances is the Department of Defence required to consult with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce in the consideration of export applications; and (b) when are the new policy guidelines being made available to the public.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) Assistance provided to exporters has included:</PARA>
<PARA>issue of export permits and advice on acceptability of proposed export markets</PARA>
<PARA>evaluation of products and provision of test facilities</PARA>
<PARA>co-ordination of industry missions overseas, product displays and attendance at exhibitions and trade fairs</PARA>
<PARA>advice to exporters on doing business in particular markets including provision of market research data</PARA>
<PARA>loan of personnel and equipment</PARA>
<PARA>Service stewardship of in-service products being promoted overseas and in Australia including the use of Defence Attaches</PARA>
<PARA>licensing of defence products/technologies for sales to third parties</PARA>
<PARA>negotiation of various collaborative agreements</PARA>
<PARA>publication of `Doing Australian Defence Business' and `Australian Controls on the Export of Defence and Related Goods'.</PARA>
<PARA> Direct costs above those required for Defence purposes are recovered from or paid separately by the exporters.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The majority of indigenous defence products are developed to satisfy specific Australian Defence Force requirements. During the course of the development the performance of the equipment is evaluated and the manufacturer advised accordingly. Two examples are the 1 and 2 tonne vehicles for the Army and the Minehunter for the Navy. There are occasions when the manufacturers of military equipment not destined for service with the Australian Defence Force, have the equipment evaluated by the Department. In these instances the manufacturer is required to meet the costs of the evaluation and is provided with a report.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Arrangements are in place with the Governments of the United States, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji (currently inoperative), and Tonga.</PARA>
<PARA> These arrangements cover a wide variety of spares from within the 1.4 million line items in the ADF inventory. They generally cover the less complex technical spares and include minor spare parts for radios, rifles, other field equipment, aircraft and ships electronic system components, and general mechanical equipment.</PARA>
<PARA> Issues of spares are made on a cost recovery or replacement-in-kind basis. There are no additional stockholdings established to support these arrangements. Issues are made at no detriment to the operations of the Australian Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) An export strategy is being developed between Defence and Austrade for defence related products and is planned to be considered by a number of other government departments, including the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Industry, Technology and Commerce early in the new year.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The export strategy will involve the complete range of defence products, services and capabilities available in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The strategy will list the main target markets as USA, Middle East and South East Asia, recognising the sensitivities where appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Detailed cost estimates for implementation of the export strategy have not been done since the strategy has yet to be formally agreed.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) The strategy has not been considered by Cabinet.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (a) I understand the Department of Defence has provided your office with a copy of the publication `Australian Controls on the Export of Defence and Related Goods-Guidelines for Exporters' (July 1989). This 21 page document sets out the revised policy guidelines for the export of defence materiel.</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) The guidelines divide the items under control into three parts, viz</PARA>
<PARA> Part 1a-Goods designed or adapted for military purposes and inherently lethal, incapacitating or destructive</PARA>
<PARA> 1b-Other military and related goods.</PARA>
<PARA> Part 2-Cryptographic and related electronic equipment and software.</PARA>
<PARA> Part 3-Non-military lethal goods. These parts reflect the type of goods and the level of sensitivity. The guidelines set out the various considerations which apply.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) a. The Department of Defence is required to consult with relevant Departments including the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Industry, Technology and Commerce if there are sensitivities regarding strategic, international or human rights issues. An exception is where the proposed export is lethal or of major military significance and to go to a destination which is clearly unacceptable to the Government in accordance with its Guidelines. In this case the Department can recommend direct to the Minister to deny the export. Further details regarding the criteria for considering export applications are contained in paras. 8-12, 36-37 of the Guidelines. Once approvals are given these act as precedents for follow-on sales unless circumstances change in the meantime.</PARA>
<PARA> b. The new guidelines were made available to the public from 24 July 1989 after advertisements appeared on that date in a major newspaper in each State or Territory and some national newspapers indicating availability of the document.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The number of applications received for approval under Regulation 13b to export defence materiel were:</PARA>
<PARA>1985-86</PARA>
<PARA>1986-87</PARA>
<PARA>1987-88</PARA>
<PARA>1988-89</PARA>
<PARA>291</PARA>
<PARA>245</PARA>
<PARA>283</PARA>
<PARA>321</PARA>
<PARA> These figures do not include applications for in principle approvals.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) About 91% of these were from non-government enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The export applications were treated as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>1985-86</PARA>
