<TITLE>Interest Rates</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families</PARA>
<PARA> Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.</PARA>
<PARA> Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled require the Hawke-Keating government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many Australian out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families.</PARA>

<PARA> If open not-for-profit health funds are to be able to meet the costs of providing benefits to their older members at affordable rates, they need to share these costs equitably.</PARA>
<PARA> Some health insurance organisations are being allowed to avoid meeting the health costs of sick and elderly people.</PARA>

<PARA> (c) notes with great concern the report on Roxby Downs in the Sydney Morning Herald of 6 May 1989 which indicates that in 1982 the South Australian Government suppressed a report on mine safety which contained critical information relating to the fatal risks to miners from exposure to radon gases, a radioactive by-product of uranium;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) condemns the suppression of the report which indicated that up to 170 miners in 1000 could die of lung cancer as a result of exposure to radon gas, which was nearly 3 times the average risk of lung cancer to Australian males in 1982; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) supports the call by the Leader of the Australian Democrats in South Australia (Mr Gilfillan) for the establishment of a parliamentary select committee into the actions of the then South Australian Minister for Mines (Mr Goldsworthy) and the companies which run Roxby Downs, Western Mining Corporation and British Petroleum, to make public the very real dangers of uranium mining to the miners.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure of this. It is my understanding that the BIE report is completed and is certainly going to the printer shortly. I personally have some preliminary knowledge of the contents of the BIE report by way of executive summary. That summary is a very short document; of course I have not seen the full report. There have been studies on the effectiveness of the research and development incentive. There has been a study done by Wollongong University's institute of technology studies-I am not sure of its exact name-on the research and development incentive. Of course, there has been work done by my Department and others in relation to that incentive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Chaney knows the improved performance of private sector research and development in the last four years has been quite dramatic, by previous standards. On the basis of those reports which we have had available to us and on the basis of my Department's continuing monitoring of the research and development incentive, a decision has been made in relation to it. That decision is recorded in the statement which will be brought down today.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Following his visit to Noumea yesterday, how does the Minister evaluate the prospects for continued stability in New Caledonia, and in particular the progress under the Matignon accords, following the recent assassinations of the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS) leaders Jean-Marie Tjibaou and Yeweine Yeweine?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1955" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I preface my answer by saying that when I attended the funeral in Noumea yesterday, I was accompanied in the Australian delegation by two parliamentary representatives, Senator Schacht and Senator Robert Hill, both of whom, only a fortnight ago, had visited New Caledonia as part of a Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence parliamentary delegation. I was particularly pleased to be accompanied by parliamentarians from both sides of the chamber and I very much appreciated the contribution they both made to the Australian representation at this event, which was a very charged moment in the recent fragile history of one of Australia's nearest neighbours. Their contribution included speaking to a very large crowd of Kanak mourners, family and friends, at the morgue in Noumea at about 2.30 in the morning, shortly after we arrived. That was an extremely moving occasion, as was the funeral itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The funeral was attended by many other regional leaders including Deputy Prime Minister Palmer from New Zealand and Foreign Ministers Somare from Papua New Guinea and Kalpokas from Vanuatu. Their attendance and that of Prime Minister Rocard and Overseas Territories Minister Le Pensec from France reflected not only the immense regard with which Jean-Marie Tjibaou and Yeweine Yeweine were held but also the hope that peace processes in place in New Caledonia will continue to work themselves through to a lasting solution to what has been one of the region's most intractable and dangerous problems.</PARA>
<PARA> In his eulogy to the two slain men, Prime Minister Rocard underlined the French Government's intention to press forward with the implementation of the Matignon accords reflecting, as those agreements do, the statesmanship of leaders not only on the Kanak side but also on the Caldoche side. I assured Prime Minister Rocard, in discussions I had with him during the day, that Australia fully shared the view that the future of the territory could be peacefully settled only by agreement amongst the various communities in the Territory itself and that the Matignon accords and the accompanying Oudinot accords continue to represent the best hope for progress towards a peaceful, economically sound, lasting and multiracial solution.</PARA>
<PARA> In trying to assess the future, the deaths of two such outstanding leaders leave an inevitable vacuum which is very hard for the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS) to fill. Nonetheless, I was encouraged, as I believe my parliamentary colleagues were, by the contacts I had with all sides. I was encouraged to believe that there are at least good prospects of continuing commitment to those processes of reconciliation and accommodation. It was particularly heartening to hear Prime Minister Rocard announcing that all sides seemed committed to proceeding with the timetable for elections on 11 June for the new provincial assemblies in accordance with the accords, and the fact that continuity and momentum behind this new democratic process can, it seems, be maintained in this way is a very good indicator of what might be able to be achieved. Finally, not least, Mr President, because I know your own interest in these matters, I hope I speak for all senators and members, and indeed all Australians generally, when I express our continuing very great, goodwill to our neighbours in the South West Pacific and when I say that it is our fervent hope that the continuing implementation of the accords and the ultimate success in resolving New Caledonia's difficulties will stand ultimately as the most impressive monument anyone could build to the memory of those two great Kanak statesmen.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations. The Government has said that a statement will be made this month on significant reforms for the waterfront. Mr Tas Bull of the Waterside Workers Federation has stated publicly that five weeks from the publication of the Inter-State Commission (ISC) report is insufficient time and that there is no way in the world that there will be any agreement in principle in that time. In view of the comments made by the Waterside Workers Federation and the Supportive adverse comments on the ISC report by Mr Ian Court of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), can the Minister assure this chamber that a meaningful statement will be made within the time-frame previously announced, or can we expect meaningless rhetoric with the ACTU dog yet again seen to be wagging the Labor Government tail?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stone apparently is objecting to the accuracy of the premise upon which the question is framed. If he really wants to object to that I guess he will have an opportunity to put his view on the record at the end of Question Time. But it has certainly been interpreted by everybody to whom I have spoken that Senator Stone is again advocating his well-known short, sharp shock theory based on the sort of advice that no doubt he gave to Mr Howard in 1982, which was followed by the worst recession in 50 years. There is no better example of the essential differences between the Liberal and Labor parties in government--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Stone objects to that perhaps he can explain that at the end of Question Time too. There is no better example of the difference between the approach of the Australian Labor Party and that of the Liberal Party of Australia to priorities in terms of social and economic agendas. But if Australia is going to be subjected to the political and economic theories of the H. R. Nicholls Society, espoused by people such as Senator Stone, and Mr Costello before too long presumably, if they ever find themselves in government, it is important to show whether the theories are soundly based.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those who believe that there is a positive savings response, that is, an increase in the savings ratio after a recession has been engineered, ought to look at the facts, particularly at what happened after the last recession in 1982-83. Over the whole of that financial year household savings fell by almost 2 per cent from 8.9 per cent to 7.1 per cent and reached a low in the June quarter of that year of 5.9 per cent which, incidentally, was the lowest quarterly household savings ratio ever recorded. However, Senator Stone is disputing whether he was advocating a recession and he will deal with that later on. I am pleased to say that in the same article he said in regard to incentives for savings-I apologise because it is a fairly lengthy paragraph but I think it is necessary to read out the whole paragraph--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Stone" NAMEID="LJ4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure there would be complaints from Senator Chaney if I did. I will read this paragraph in respect of incentives to increase household savings:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Thus we have various bright ideas being canvassed (including by some Opposition members who ought to know better) about so-called incentives for saving. The most intellectually respectable of those ideas (indexing pre-tax savings for inflation) will chiefly mean that Mr Keating's long march down the Argentinian road had finally brought us to our destination!</PARA>
<PARA>What Senator Stone is doing there very clearly-I am sure that not even he will deny this-is ridiculing snake oil remedies and ideas that have been put up to stimulate household savings including, as he said very specifically, those of some members of the Opposition who ought to know better. They are in contradiction to John Howard's position on the question of savings, which was put in the other Sydney newspaper, ironically on the same day, where Mr Howard is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Tax options being looked at to encourage savings were:</PARA>
<PARA>* An exemption from tax on interest up to a certain amount.</PARA>
<PARA>* A withholding tax of 15 pc on interest, collected by the banks for delivery to the Tax Office, as payment in full of tax liability.</PARA>
<PARA>* A tax on the real value of interest after inflation was accounted for.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I note the Minister's answer to a question on 3 May from Senator Burns on the situation in El Salvador in which he expressed Government concern, stated that the Australian Embassy in Mexico has been asked to investigate and that the Government will `certainly continue to raise our concerns about issues, as that is appropriate'. In light of the evidence which has been made public since then that several community workers, arrested in the San Salvador office of the Christian Committee for Refugees and Displaced People, have been subjected to brutal torture while in custody-as evidenced by a transcript of a telephone conversation with Mrs Eve Scarfe-does the Minister agree that the treatment of these people is a gross violation of human rights and that grave fears must be held for their safety, especially since eight of the people arrested are still in custody? Will the Minister lodge a public protest with the Government of El Salvador and call for an end to this inhumane treatment before deaths occur as a result of that Government's failure to observe fundamental international standards of human rights?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said in my statement on 3 May to which Senator Powell refers, the Australian Embassy in Mexico City, which is our nearest accredited diplomatic representation, has been asked to investigate the circumstances of the arrests, including that of Mrs Eve Scarfe, that were made by the Salvadoran police on 19 April and to make appropriate representations to the Salvadoran authorities. I am aware of allegations that persons arrested with Mrs Scarfe have been subjected to mistreatment while in detention. Those allegations will also be investigated by the Australian Embassy and representations made following those investigations in the way that I have described.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Government universally condemns human rights abuses. In respect of cases where we have been satisfied that hard evidence exists of human rights abuse we have made about 400 representations in 68 different countries over the last 12 months, many of those representations following from the activities of the Parliamentary Amnesty Group of which a number of honourable senators are members. Obviously we will take an immediate and intense interest in human rights abuse cases of immediate consular significance involving Australian residents, but I make it absolutely clear, lest there is any feeling on the part of Senator Powell or anyone else that we are selective in our approach, that that is not the case. We will not hesitate, and we have not hesitated, to register in the firmest way possible concerns at such abuses whether or not Australian residents such as Mrs Scarfe are involved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Needless to say, it is a cause of the utmost regret that the Speaker of the Iranian Parliament, Rafsanjani, not only has apparently sought to incite further violence in the occupied territories but also has called for international terrorism in support of the Palestinian people. Such calls are indefensible, counter-productive and only make a political settlement more difficult. I have noted that a number of Palestine Liberation Organisation leaders have repudiated the violence which Speaker Rafsanjani has been advocating. We hope that that response will be maintained elsewhere. The Australian Government deplores such calls to violent action and, in particular, the threats to international civil aviation that have been made by Speaker Rafsanjani.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intended to ask this question at the end of last week, so if events have rendered it obsolete I apologise. My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Housing and Aged Care, and I preface it with the information that the original report entitled I'm still an individual by Chris Ronalds created concern and anger in hostels and nursing homes and the follow-up meetings convened by Miss Ronalds were considered by them to be just a formality. Consequently the industry is anxiously awaiting the final report, which was to have been completed by the end of April. Can the Minister say when he expects to receive the final version of the report I'm still an individual by Chris Ronalds, which was due for completion at the end of April? When will the report be tabled in Parliament? When does he expect the report to be printed and made available to hostels, nursing homes and members of the public?</PARA></TALK.START>

It was originally envisaged that the presentation of the report would be followed by the consultants providing feedback to consumers until mid-April. Early in the consultancy the steering committee determined that it would be preferable to have more extensive consultations prior to the report and finalise the report by mid-April. However, the breadth of the issues raised and the level of public response have made it essential to extend the time by a few weeks and the final report is now due by mid-May. It will be tabled as soon as the Minister has had a chance to study the report and its contents. As soon as possible after the completion of the report the Minister will have it printed and made available to hostels, nursing homes and all other interested parties.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see Robert Hadler's article in Saturday's Weekend Australian. The relevant section states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader and economic spokesman of the Opposition, Mr Andrew Peacock, said yesterday that the recent growth in the money supply meant the prospects for a further fall in inflation were poor.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Peacock said the rate of growth of the key monetary aggregates had accelerated since August last year.</PARA>
<PARA>He appears to be basing his comments on statistics for M3, a definition of money supply which consists mainly of deposits with commercial banks. He seems to be unaware of the effect of the reduction of the statutory reserve deposit (SRD) ratio requirement last September and the effect that this had on banks. The old SRD gave forms of financing such as 90-day bills an artificial advantage vis-a-vis financial transactions appearing as deposits and advances on the balance sheets of commercial banks, and the substantial removal of that artificial advantage caused a process that economists call re-intermediation to occur. That does not mean an increase in the volume of credit; it simply means a change in the composition of that credit, with more of it going through bank deposits and bank advances and less through other arrangements and therefore artificially boosting the published M3 figure.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Peacock, unfortunately, seems not to have had tutorials from Dr Hewson and Senator Stone on that part of his elementary economics course. It demonstrates yet again that he should rapidly try to catch up. Everyone knows that the Government has tightened its stance on monetary policy over the period during which Mr Peacock claims it has been loosened-and, indeed, for some six months or so before the period to which Mr Peacock referred. If he wants to see some statistics on that, I suggest he look at what has happened to the yield curve which has become steeply inverse or at the recent figures for the rate of growth of the money base which grew by 8.6 per cent between February 1988 and February 1989; in other words, by a good deal less than the nominal GDP growth over the same period.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I gave Senator Boswell quite a lengthy answer to the question of the liquidator and his performance on Christmas Island on Friday. I have nothing to add to that. Obviously the liquidator had the primary task of assessing the three offers, from Booth and Century as well as from Elders. In the last couple of weeks I have been advised by the Department-twice because of Senator Boswell's interest-that even in retrospect the Government has no cause to regret the acceptance of the liquidator's decision and that the Government has not forgone any revenue by accepting it. I have nothing to add to those answers. If Senator Boswell has some evidence that I do not and that in some way what I have said is wrong, I would be very happy to have a look at his evidence. To repeat what I said the other day, I can only say that the Booth offer in the end added up to 5 per cent of the current phosphate price-that is the extra sweetener to the Government. In the case of Elders, it added up to 6 1/2 per cent. That is the only advice I have been given and the only advice on which I can work.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, the secrecy provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act-I think it is section 16-prevent me, or even the Treasurer, from discussing this case with the Commissioner of Taxation. They also prevent the Commissioner from disclosing information about any specific case to the Treasurer or anybody else. However, some general comments can be made about the issues raised in that story in the Australian. My information is that, in general, such payments are treated by the Commissioner as capital receipts and are not subject to income taxation, per se. For taxation purposes they normally fall within section 160m (7) which relates to capital gains. That is the sort of transaction, among others, for which capital gains tax was introduced. I was interested to see that the Premier of New South Wales is reported to have said that it would be outrageous if such payments were not taxable. I note with some satisfaction that the Premier of New South Wales is supporting the Government's policy on capital gains taxation, as distinct from the position taken by the Opposition which has a policy of effectively abolishing capital gains taxation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting that Senator Stone should be interjecting. I would have thought he would be one of the senators in this place-despite weekend newspaper reports that all National Party of Australia senators are going to vote against the Government legislation-who would vote with the Government, given many of the writings that he has published supporting deregulation and economic reform. The fact that he is seeking preselection for Fairfax and, maybe, the National Party leadership in the other place ought not deter him from sticking with his principles and supporting deregulation in this case when he has the opportunity later this week. I will not be saying he is a hypocrite, walking away from his previous convictions and taking the easy course of appealing to sentiment within his own Party. His support for deregulation has been strong and I look forward to seeing him on this side of the chamber voting with us when the legislation comes up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I return to the Royal Commission on Grain Storage, Handling and Transport. It stated that savings of $10 per tonne would be made on transporting grain across Australia. It said that the savings would not be uniform. The Commission found that in New South Wales the savings would be $11 a tonne; in Victoria the savings would be the same; and in Queensland the savings would be the highest of any State in the Commonwealth, $13 per tonne. In South Australia there would be a saving of $6 a tonne and in Western Australia the saving would be $7 per tonne. The total resource cost saving across Australia per annum would be $100m. The Government has of course committed itself to the deregulation of the wheat industry in the domestic market, and the growers, we believe, should be given greater freedom of choice to make decisions about how they dispose of their grain in the domestic market. We do not believe that that choice should be denied. In fact, if I look at recent writings I see that a former Liberal Party member in the other place, John Hyde, had this to say:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I have noted the somewhat extremist-I agree with Senator McKiernan's choice of that word `extremist'-comments by Mr Hugh Morgan to the Australian mining industry conference in Canberra last week. One of the quotes that I have is from the Australian Financial Review, in which he accuses environmentalists of being socialist revolutionaries of yesteryear who plunge Australia into impoverishment. I do not know whether that is an accurate quote, but since it has been carried in several newspapers I assume that it is. I have to say that Mr Hugh Morgan, as I understand it, does not represent the views of the Australian Mining Industry Council. Mr Morgan may represent the views of himself and of the other H. R. Nicholls Society luminaries like Peter Costello and David Kemp, both of whom I notice got Liberal Party endorsement at the weekend. He also puts in a most unbalanced way the old `divide and conquer, let's have a confrontation' approach of the Fraser years. The Australian Mining Industry Council, I believe, has taken quite a responsible role in promoting reasoned and informed debate on how issues of industry development and environment should be best reconciled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed, I attended a conference last year in Darwin put on by the Australian Mining Industry Council, to foster environmental discussion among its members. One of the members was an executive officer who served on the Brundtland World Commission on Environment and Development, which brought down the report on our common future. The purpose of the Australian Mining Industry Council running that seminar last year was to discuss with its senior executives of mining companies in Australia how best to reconcile those objectives. At the conference at which Mr Morgan spoke a leading international figure from an institute dealing with development and the environment was also a lead speaker, and he presented a balanced view for the industry. I would have to say that Hugh Morgan may represent the H. R. Nicholls Society and Mr Costello and Dr Kemp and other recent Liberal Party endorsements, but I do not believe he represents the concerted and considered views of the Australian Mining Industry Council. Its views have to be taken into consideration by the Government when dealing with these matters. It is interesting to note that in the other place on 3 May the Government introduced legislation for a Resource Assessment Commission, which is an extension of the Brundtland theory of finding a rational and logical framework in which those competing objectives can be sorted out and, on an informed basis, a conclusion can be drawn to promote environmentally sustainable development. That legislation is also endorsed by AMIC.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of proposals emanating from the New South Wales Government to pass a Proceeds of Crime Bill in this session, or perhaps in the spring session, of its Parliament. Indeed, it would be a good thing if that particular jurisdiction complemented and supplemented the already magnificent legislation passed by this Parliament which deals at a national level with those convicted of very serious Federal offences, such as the importation of drugs into this country, or those who commit major fraud against the Commonwealth. It does this by providing that a gaol sentence in those situations would not be a sufficient punishment; the convicted persons should be stripped of the assets they have accumulated over the years through their various nefarious activities. Indeed, upon conviction, unless the convicted persons can show, under Commonwealth legislation, that they have acquired their assets lawfully, then the palatial home, the flash car, the souped-up speedboat, the horse stud, and the jewellery shall be stripped from them. This is an important affirmation of the proposition that crime should not pay. The aphorism runs that crime does not pay; we know that it often does-in large dollars for those who are tempted to prey particularly on vulnerable young Australians in relation to drug trafficking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore, it is extremely important that all jurisdictions move to strip criminals of their assets, not simply as a punishment additional to a gaol sentence that might be handed down on that individual but also as a means of starting to break up the economic base from which criminal activities are mounted in this country. If a person is in gaol and the assets are left undisturbed, clearly his confederates in crime or others may use those assets to continue financing the criminal activity in which the particular syndicate or organised criminal activists might be engaged. Indeed, it is because it is important to break up the assets that are accumulated by these syndicates that this legislation was passed by the Federal Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> Coincidentally, I noticed in today's Age an article by Mr Peter Clark, a member of the National Crime Authority, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>The creation of enormous wealth by illegitimate means poses, in any society, a real threat to legitimate business.</PARA>
<PARA>He spoke about the way in which organised criminals can launder their money into legitimate businesses and, in his final paragraph, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Just ask those legitimate businessmen in the clothing industry, the building industry, fruit and vegetable markets in New York and listen to their replies.</PARA>
<PARA>It is very important that we follow the money trail, that we find where the assets of crime are transmuted into apparently legitimate businesses and strip the criminals of those assets including, as I say, those that are transformed into legitimate business enterprises, otherwise we will find that the legitimate businesses in this country are subservient to organised criminal interests. That must be prevented at all costs. I am pleased that the New South Wales Government is pursuing this form of legislation. If complemented by legislation in all other jurisdictions, it will help to ensure that crime does not pay in this country.</PARA>

Over recent years, local government has done fairly well out of funding from the Commonwealth level and many councils will do particularly well by the decision not to pursue the claw-back issue in relation to the rating of Telecom Australia and Australia Post. Many local government areas will be quite well off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is typical, I suppose, of Opposition senators to tell us in every Budget that they want another $4 billion or $5 billion worth of cuts. The problem is that they do not ever nominate the area that they want cut. They always favour cutting government expenditure but can never nominate the area that should be cut. When all of the whinges and complaints about the areas that should be cut are added up, billions of dollars are involved. The real problem is not for the Government to resolve; it is for Opposition senators to resolve in their own minds. How can the Opposition be in favour of reduced government expenditure when, in every case in which it occurs, the Opposition gets up in this place and whinges?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fact that most Australians are extremely worried by the spectre of those policemen who may be found to be corrupt nevertheless enjoying the fruits of a very generously subsidised superannuation scheme whereby the community contributes to the enjoyment of their years of retirement despite the fact that they have undermined so much which is important in our community, namely, the ability to rely on the honesty and integrity of those who are especially sworn to uphold and enforce the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will not comment on the instance in the preamble to Senator Jones's question about Commissioner Lewis. Nevertheless, obviously matters before the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct have brought into focus the need for all parliaments and all governments to look at the question of the payment of superannuation benefits to any policeman who may be found guilty of corrupt conduct, and, indeed, for that reason the Federal Government is moving in that direction.</PARA>
<PARA> I want to say, of course, that in this answer there is no hint, nor should any colouring be given to this answer by way of suggesting, that the Australian Federal Police harbours within it those who are guilty of corruption. Nevertheless, I believe that the public demands that we put in place those procedures and that legislation which will ensure that, if a former or serving member of the Australian Federal Police is convicted of a serious offence relating to corruption or is found guilty of a relevant disciplinary offence which leads to his dismissal, his superannuation benefits will be forfeited.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this community would not wish, as I say, to sustain the retirement of a police officer who has been found by due process to be guilty of corruption which not only in a particular instance might lead to the furtherance of a particular criminal enterprise but in general undermines that legitimate confidence which the community ought to have in those who are sworn to uphold and enforce its laws. For that reason, the Government will be seeking the support of this chamber and of this Parliament generally to ensure that that legislation is passed as speedily as possible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite wrong to say that Australian law enforcement authorities were not concerned with tracking down and, if possible, securing the extradition of Mr Robert Trimbole. The authorities, certainly at the national level, are concerned that those who engage in the sort of criminal activity in which Mr Trimbole was engaged ought to be brought to justice. The fact that they flee this jurisdiction and seek safe haven overseas ought not to be allowed to stop the process of justice taking full effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the hunt for Mr Trimbole, I certainly was briefed at various stages. After his corpse was discovered I made myself as well aware as I could of the course of the investigations, particularly in relation to the Spanish authorities, and the help which they had proffered and managed to deliver. So it might be of interest to the Senate to know that in late June or perhaps in the first week of July I will be in Madrid-at great sufferance to me, of course-to sign a mutual assistance in criminal matters treaty with the Spanish to secure those procedures which will help ensure that if an Australian criminal seeks haven overseas, particularly in Spain, we can have the procedures in place to allow us to work in conjunction with the Spanish authorities to ensure that such a person is brought to justice.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot believe my luck that Senator Lewis should have bothered to ask this question. As I understand it, the first part of his question sought my confirmation that oil companies pay a tax rate of 67 per cent, being company tax and resource rental tax. To the best of my knowledge, no Australian oil exploration or production company has paid resource rental tax up to the present time. The first company that is likely to pay resource rental tax is Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, on its Jabiru production. That will be some time next year. The resource rental tax was adopted in the Parliament as a taxing measure about two years ago and consists of the long-term bond rate plus 15 per cent. That component of the resource rental is exactly what it says. The oil deposits in the continental margins or on land in Australia are the property of the Australian community and companies that want the right to exploit those resources and produce from them are entitled and required, quite properly, to pay a rent to the Australian community for the privilege of doing so. This Government-indeed Senator Lewis's Party as well, as I understand it-has not derogated from that point. There might be a difference between us on to what extent secondary taxation should apply, but there is no disagreement that there ought to be secondary taxation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the first point of the honourable senator's question, that oil exploration companies pay a top marginal rate, to the best of my recollection no-one has actually paid yet and production companies-this excludes Bass Strait oil, which is in a special category which I will come to in a moment-pay a company tax rate. An excise regime is in place in Bass Strait. Because of overtures to the Government last year based on the fact that the price of oil was nudging under $10 a barrel, we undertook a review of the Bass Strait excise arrangements and made an offer to the operators-Esso and the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP)-to adopt a sliding scale so that when the price of oil fell below a certain point it would trigger a reduction in the excise. Esso and BHP rejected our offer and, as a consequence, we have withdrawn it. But I announced just last month at the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association national conference in Hobart that we would be bringing forward the excise review which was scheduled for the middle of next year to commence in September this year, and hopefully it will be completed in March this year. This would be a review of the excise regime and of deductability against excise. I also indicated that if it wanted to bring forward views on a revision of the resource rental tax, we think it would take a terrible lot to shift us on that but we would look to what it had to say about it.</PARA>
<PARA> With respect to the amount of $3.1 billion that the honourable senator has referred to as being spent offshore on exploration and production companies-I think the honourable senator is confused as to the difference between exploration and production-it is true that exploration companies in Australia have developed a capability and a maturity which enables some of them to explore overseas as well as in Australia. They do so because prospectivity is high in the countries that they choose. A large slab of that $3.1 billion involved the purchase by BHP of a refinery and distribution network based in Honolulu so that it can approach the American market. I do not think we can rightfully include the purchase price in those figures and give a genuine picture of what is happening.</PARA>

I do not believe that there is that positive disincentive that the honourable senator has referred to; indeed, the incentive for oil exploration in Australia is still quite strong. As I have said in this chamber, it is related to three things: the price of a barrel of oil, the possibility of finding oil-that is, our prospectivity-and the taxing regime and the costs of operating in Australia.

<PARA>SOUTH AFRICA: GLENEAGLES DECLARATION</PARA>
<PARA>The Gleneagles declaration or `Statement on Apartheid in Sport by Commonwealth Heads of Government' was drawn up in London in June 1977 for the purpose of regulating sporting contacts between Commonwealth countries and South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA>The Gleneagles declaration is not a formal agreement requiring ratification but a firm international political commitment to which successive Australian governments of whatever political persuasion have scrupulously adhered.</PARA>
<PARA>It is up to individual government signatories to determine what steps are practical to fulfil their basic commitments to the Gleneagles declaration</PARA>
<PARA>which requires them to withhold any form of support for and to take every practical step to discourage contact or competition by their nationals with sporting organisations, teams or sportspeople from South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA>Following a careful review of the question of sporting contacts, this government announced on 26 October 1983 that it had decided to significantly strengthen its policy on sporting contacts with South Africa. In fulfilment of Australia's commitment to Gleneagles</PARA>
<PARA>No South African sporting teams would be allowed entry to Australia</PARA>
<PARA>Individual amateur sportspeople domiciled in South Africa would be considered as representatives of South Africa unless there was definite proof to the contrary and accordingly refused entry</PARA>
<PARA>Individual professional sportspeople would be assumed to be non-representative unless there was proof to the contrary and hence would be allowed entry to compete in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Individual amateur sports contestants are distinguished from individual professional sports contestants in that they generally compete overseas either directly or indirectly under the auspices or at the expense of their national sporting bodies. In these circumstances they are clearly representative of South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA>Individual genuinely professional sportspeople normally do not rely on the support of a national body for their participation in overseas competition.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Government has actively discouraged Australian sportspeople from competing in South Africa and opposes `third country' contacts in which Australians compete against South Africans in other countries</PARA>
<PARA>Australian sporting bodies have responded most positively to the Government's position.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government remains firmly convinced that sporting sanctions, such as those implemented under the Gleneagles declaration, continue to deliver a powerful message to white South Africans of the need for fundamental change before normal sport can be played and international sporting contacts renewed.</PARA>

Senator Burns stated that in that column I was advocating a recession for this country of a short, sharp, shock variety. I have obtained a copy of my column. I will read briefly to the Senate those paragraphs in which that matter was referred to and allow the Senate to judge whether the claim was accurate. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that, because Mr Keating has got almost everything wrong both in and since his  1988-89 Budget, the Government is now in a terrible fix. </PARA>
<PARA> On the one hand, it badly needs to have the economy take a sharp dive . . . </PARA>
<PARA>which could be described as a recession. Later, I go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, the short, sharp-shock recession which that would entail would blow apart all the Government's claims that its Accord with the ACTU has removed the need for such harsh methods of economic course correction. </PARA>
<PARA>At a later point, I say:</PARA>
<PARA> Ironically, the one thing which, at this low ebb of our fortunes, would certainly produce a sharp lift in national savings-</PARA>
<PARA>of the kind which the Government now says it would like to see-</PARA>
<PARA>would be a recession of that short, sharp-shock variety referred to earlier. </PARA>
<PARA>I simply let the words speak for themselves and I defy any objective reader of those words to assert that they are a process of advocacy of such a short, sharp, shock recession. They are, of course, nothing of the kind. The assertions are merely a shabby example of this Government's propensity to mislead and to seek to distort statements coming from the Opposition side of the political spectrum. I leave it there. Honourable senators will judge for themselves, as will the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of his prepared response to Senator Burns, the Minister, however, also alleged that the 1982-83 recession, which certainly was a recession, was brought on by the policies of the Fraser Government which, as he no doubt reminded us, I was at that time serving as Secretary to the Treasury. I remind the Minister-as I have on several previous occasions; his misleading comments are therefore all the worse because he has been corrected previously-that the recession in 1982-83 was not brought on by the policies of the Fraser Government. It was brought on by the policies of the Australian trade union movement, the Australian Council of Trade Unions. I adduce in evidence of that no less an authority than the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia (Mr Keating) who, at the Australian Labor Party's biennial conference in Hobart nearly two years ago, accused personally Mr George Campbell, the Secretary of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, of having `some 100,000 dead men around his neck'. He was referring to the 100,000 unemployed members of the metalworkers union who were thrown out of work by the activities of Mr George Campbell and his fellow trade union bosses. </PARA>

<PARA>In 1984 a Labor Government introduced a Bill to reinsert section 3 (12) in the Fraser Government's 1982 Act. </PARA>
<PARA>That did not occur. He does not even know what he is talking about, because section 3 (12) was already in the principal Act. What Senator Walsh said was wrong. Secondly, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Labor Party in opposition in 1982 moved an amendment which was identical to the 1984 Bill later presented. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me explain precisely what happened. In 1982 the Opposition sought to remove from the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Act a provision-section 3 (12)-which would have enabled certain taxpayers to be entitled to certain relief. I voted against that because I did not consider it appropriate to vote to provide such relief. That was in 1982. In December 1983 the then Government sought to remove section 3 (12). I voted against that, for the simple reason that in 1982 there had been established a provision allowing relief for taxpayers, and once that provision was in legislation there was an expectation on the part of those taxpayers that they could have access to it. It is an entirely different question when that situation arises. It is not inconsistent at all; it is an entirely different situation from voting in such a way as to prevent the achievement of certain relief when that relief is not already there and, a year and a half later, voting to remove that relief. There is no inconsistency at all in that because a new situation had arisen. I am rather pleased that Senator Walsh has tried to turn that dorothy dix question into an attack on me because he is wrong again.

The march of technological change-where it seems possible that it might only lead to a polluted, clamorous, dangerous and uncertain world-must be made to serve our needs and to create a world in which our children and grandchildren can live at ease. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, if Australians of the next century are to inhabit a prosperous nation and a clean and safe world, we today must grasp the challenge of gaining control of the processes of scientific and technological innovation and ensure that we receive benefit, not disadvantage, from change. This is a challenge that confronts all Australians. Australians of course are used to enjoying a quality of life equal or superior to that anywhere in the world. But just as we accept that our predecessors had to work hard to build this society, so we must recognise that retaining such advantages, so as to pass them on to our children, will require hard work and constant effort. </PARA>
<PARA> Since this Government came to office in 1983, we have been single-minded in our determination to ensure that such an effort is made. A crucial foundation for the pursuit of our wider goals is our adoption of the most wide ranging and comprehensive program of structural adjustment in Australia's history. We have taken the decisions-tough ones, many of them-to create a more internationally competitive economy and to remove the impediments which prevent industries and individuals from making their fullest contribution to national prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA> In this endeavour, science and technology continue to have an essential role to play. They can open the way for Australia's manufacturing and service industries to be more competitive, and for the men and women who make up the Australian work force to be more productive. Our agricultural and mining industries, our medical researchers, our astronomers, our communications specialists are already showing the way, not just with new techniques and new products that can be sold abroad, but with new knowledge, on which no price tag can be placed. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is determined that Australia will not fall behind. We are committed to maintaining and enhancing the proven excellence of our researchers, allowing them to further the horizons of basic research and to contribute through their creativity and innovation to Australia's goals. Since coming to office my Government has pursued a consistent science and technology strategy. This strategy recognises that crucial elements of research must be supported by public funds. It adopts as two important objectives the pursuit of excellence and the closer cooperation between researchers and users of that research. It recognises that science and technology depend on the creativity of individuals, and finally it seeks to integrate science and technology into the broader community. In pursuit of that strategy, research in Australia into science and technology is supported by public funds totalling about $1.9 billion annually, through direct funding, through institutions of higher education and through tax concessions. </PARA>
<PARA> We have introduced new research and development promotion and incentive schemes, and reorganised our research organisations. There has been a massive expansion of higher education places and a dramatically lifted school retention rate. The best Australian research can now receive increased support, as researchers must now win a proportion of their funding by competing with others against a variety of standards, some involving peer review and others commercial criteria. Since 1982-83, Government support for research through grants, higher education and Government agencies has risen by 12 per cent in real terms. Support for industry research and development has trebled. Public funding of research and development in Australia is at about the middle order of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations. But private sector support has been near the bottom of the ladder. When this Government came to office, 80 per cent of the nation's research activities were publicly funded, with private industry providing the remaining 20 per cent. By 1986-87, within a substantial increase in total research and development expenditure, industry had increased its share in the nation's research effort to 35 per cent. This is a welcome trend. </PARA>
<PARA> With this statement today, the Government is saying it recognises that more needs to be done; more needs to be done both to enhance our efforts in the quest for knowledge, as well as to ensure that a sufficient research effort is directed to areas of crucial application for Australia. The details of the Government's initiatives are contained in the statement which I shall present shortly on behalf of the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, Mr Barry Jones. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me take this opportunity first to pay tribute to this Minister's determined and far-sighted advocacy of these issues. He is a Minister who makes an invaluable contribution to the Government's consideration of science issues and one in whom the science community can place its trust and confidence. The first element of the Government's statement that I wish to announce today is that the Prime Minister will be appointing Mr Jones as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Science and Technology. In this role Mr Jones, who will retain his existing portfolio duties, will exercise on the Prime Minister's behalf the day to day responsibility for the development and co-ordination of science policy across the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I also announce the establishment of a new consultative body which will bring together at the highest level all those who have a role to play in setting the nation's priorities in science and technology. This new body will be known as the Prime Minister's Science Council. It will be chaired by the Prime Minister and Mr Jones will be its Deputy Chairman. Its membership will consist of Government Ministers, representatives of the science community and leaders of Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The first meeting of the Council is to be held in October. At the top of its agenda will be a consideration of the status of science in Australia-covering both the state of research in Australia and the nature and effectiveness of linkages between research and industry. The October meeting will also consider the greenhouse effect, to the research on which the Government has recently provided $7.8m. </PARA>
<PARA> It is intended that the Council bring a new focus and prominence to discussions on Australia's national priorities in scientific research and a new capacity to make sure that our aims in basic and applied science are properly set and implemented. To assist in this, the Prime Minister is appointing Professor Ralph Slatyer as Chief Scientist. He will assist the Prime Minister and Mr Jones on science and technology policy, chair the Science and Technology Coordinating Committee and serve on and be the Executive Officer of the new Council. Professor Slatyer is a scientist of national and international distinction, both in research and in the development of science and technology policy. He has served as Chairman of the World Heritage Committee, President of the International Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment and most recently as Chairman of the Australian Science and Technology Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC), which has been providing analysis of developments in Australian science and technology throughout the term of the Government, will continue to provide this valuable service. Indeed, I expect ASTEC to make a substantial contribution to the success of the new arrangements I have just announced and to enjoy an enhanced role as a result of them. </PARA>
<PARA> This statement is based on extensive consultation with the science and technology community, and on detailed reviews both of specific problems and of the broader needs and concerns of scientists. It brings together, as the Government promised it would, all the strands of the Government's support of science and technology research throughout a number of portfolios. This statement does not represent a conclusion of the debate about science and technology in Australia, nor a reaction to it. It represents a contribution, and I believe a very significant one, to a continuing process of policy development. It provides for the expenditure of an additional $390m over the next five years in order to boost Australia's science and technology performance. Taken with the anticipated revenue forgone due to the extension of tax concessions, this represents a $1 billion package of support for science and technology in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This statement represents our recognition that the pace of change in this country cannot be relaxed. We cannot rest on our laurels. The world will not let us do so. No Australian wants to leave it up to the rest of the world to make the decisions that are so important to shaping our future. With this statement, we are showing our determination that Australia will be a full participant in the exciting and vital processes of scientific discovery, innovation and adaptation. </PARA>

<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR AUSTRALIA</PARA>
<PARA> 1 This is the first statement to consolidate government policy for science and technology. It involves a number of portfolios and announces substantial initiatives. It will further give Australian science and technology the capability to support the vision that the Government has for Australia and to respond to the opportunities and needs of the next five years. </PARA>
<PARA> 2 Science and technology (including engineering) have changed the quality, length and direction of life in the past century far more than politics, education, ideology or religion. Edison and Ford shaped human experience more broadly and enduringly than Lenin and Hitler. Because they are central to our culture and to the success of our economy governments must be concerned about science and technology and how they benefit us. It is also necessary for people in Australia to be aware of the ways in which science and technology, and I include engineering of course, can enhance Australian culture and help maintain the high standards of living we now enjoy. Society looks increasingly to science and technology to provide knowledge and understanding to support economic development and to contribute solutions to new and pressing concerns.</PARA>
<PARA> 3 Since 1983 the Hawke Government has undertaken a series of major reforms which has moved us away from being a protected, inward looking, insular economy towards accepting the new challenges arising from full participation by Australian industry in the global economy. </PARA>
<PARA> 4 The Government has given a high priority to structural adjustment. These changes include reduced levels of government expenditure, converting massive budget deficits into substantial surpluses, floating the dollar, reducing reliance on tariffs, bounties and subsidies, reforming the taxation system, and freeing up banking and capital markets. There have also been major reforms in the provision of education, health and social security and defence. Government actions have strengthened our manufacturing base, and revitalised existing industries. Large scale job creation, at the highest rate of any OECD nation, is recognised as a major achievement. </PARA>
<PARA> 5 Having achieved so much, it is now appropriate to place even more emphasis on other areas including our research and skill base. Four objectives have priority:</PARA>
<PARA>to increase industry's use of technology and investment in R&amp;D</PARA>
<PARA>to build a competitive research base that is recognised internationally</PARA>
<PARA>to attract high quality people into science, technology and engineering</PARA>
<PARA>to provide coordination and cohesiveness of science and technology in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Industrial Investment in Research and Development</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> 6 Public funding of research and development (R&amp;D) in Australia is about the average of other OECD nations, but private sector support is relatively poor. Such comparisons are important because Australian industries must compete with those of other countries on world markets. In Sweden, Switzerland and the Netherlands, the proportion of industry investment in total R&amp;D is 60 per cent, 79 per cent and 50 per cent respectively. </PARA>
<PARA> 7 In 1978-79, government contributed 79 cents to the total research dollar, compared with industry's 21 cents. This ratio was quite unbalanced, reflecting in part the reluctance of a previously closeted manufacturing sector to invest in indigenous R&amp;D. This reluctance was particularly serious in `development', where costs tend to be higher and the process more protracted than in `research'. By 1986-87, the proportion was healthier, with the Government share being 63 cents in every research dollar, compared to industry's 37 cents. By the mid 1990s, we should aim for a more even balance of contribution to R&amp;D investment. </PARA>
<PARA> 8 Changing this balance in Australia's R&amp;D spending has been essential, and the trend is in the right direction. However, there are still problems with the overall amount of research which will require a concerted effort by both industry and government. Overseas experience suggests that R&amp;D amounting to 2 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) could be seen as an appropriate critical mass. If Australia were to achieve a similar figure with balanced contributions from government and industry, industry would need to more than double its R&amp;D funding as a proportion of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA> 9 In 1986 the Government introduced the generous 150% tax concession in response to the low level of R&amp;D performance by the private sector; particularly manufacturing industry. The incentive has been enthusiastically welcomed by industry, continues to draw strong support, and has contributed significantly to the large increase in investment in industry R&amp;D that has taken place in the past few years. </PARA>
<PARA> 10 While it was originally intended that the concession would run for five years to June 1991, the Government has decided that it will be now extended for a further two years, to 30 June 1993. Recognising the long-term planning necessary in R&amp;D, the incentive will be phased out, operating at 125 per cent for a further two years. To give an indication of the gross cost to tax revenue of this recent decision, revenue foregone is expected to cost about $200 million in 1988-89, and of the order of $1 billion over the next five years. </PARA>
<PARA> 11 The Government believes that Australian researchers should be able to participate as a full partner in international precompetitive R&amp;D programs where the collaboration can help Australian technology enter world markets. The Government has therefore decided to increase funding for international science and technology by $17.5 million over the next five years, including additional support for Bilateral Science and Technology Cooperation programs, which have been seriously undernourished in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA>Core Capacity in Science and Technology</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> 12 Support for industrial R&amp;D is a key part of the Government's policy for science and technology, and provision of a sound core capacity in science and technology is another. </PARA>
<PARA> 13 Recent, and ongoing, debates about science have been marred by over-attention to extremes. In reality the situation is far more complex. There is no arbitrary line between treatment and research in cancer or between weather forecasting and upper atmosphere physics in meteorology. The extremes sharpen our perceptions, and provide rally points for intellectual turf-wars, but our need is to find ways of bringing together their best aspects to serve our visions for Australia's future. </PARA>
<PARA> 14 The distinction between `fundamental' (or basic), `strategic' and `applied' research, while convenient, is increasingly blurred in practice because the categories overlap: they are indeed part of a continuum. The labels `long-term research' and `short-term research' may be more appropriate. The concept of `relevance' in research is also increasingly dubious. When the frontiers of knowledge are pushed forward rapidly, areas which seemed remote or irrelevant a few years ago are now at the forefront of research by universities and corporations-for example, work on AIDS, superconductivity and the greenhouse/ozone phenomena. </PARA>
<PARA> 15 There is growing recognition, both in Australia and abroad, of the need to avoid two dangerous fallacies: first, that research must be required to meet utilitarian goals; second, that research for industry is inherently second rate and that product innovation is inconsistent with excellence in science. In much research, for example in molecular genetics, work carried out to expand the frontiers of knowledge was not recognised as having economic potential for many years. The award of Nobel Prizes to researchers in the laboratories of IBM, Bell, Du Pont, EMI, Burroughs-Wellcome and other firms confirms that some of the most intellectually challenging work anywhere is being carried out in industry. </PARA>
<PARA> 16 The pursuit of curiosity-driven, basic research is essential to the survival of a rich and lively science and technology in Australia. It provides the best training ground to stimulate and enthuse young scientists. However, the relationship between science and technology is very complex. Science provides the foundation of knowledge and skill formation which makes technology possible-it provides the context of continuity with past experience and future capability. Investment in science helps to provide the core capacity which is an essential precondition to the next stage of development in technology. If science is long-term and cumulative, technology is immediate and perishable in a context of market volatility, and frequent incremental change. </PARA>
<PARA> 17 There is a complex and unpredictable interaction between long-term and short-term research and between fundamental and applied research. In addition, there can be important synergistic effects between research projects which are advancing the frontiers of knowledge in different disciplines. For example, interdisciplinary cancer research-including physics, chemistry, biology and computer modelling-appears to have been even more productive than narrowly focussed biological or physiological approaches. </PARA>
<PARA> 18 The Government has encouraged major science and technology institutions to be more conscious of national needs and their responsibilities. Although much remains to be done, this process is now well under way. </PARA>
<PARA> 19 Change is never easy for those involved, however, and never free from transitional problems. Morale in some sections of the scientific community has understandably been affected. Redistribution of funding, particularly for the universities following creation of the ARC and for CSIRO have raised concerns. In CSIRO's case, its direct budget allocations have been reduced in real terms to both reflect and encourage a move to greater external funding and industry linkages, and to contribute significantly to the Government's general budget tightening. This has inevitably limited funds for some areas of research. Institutions feel they now lack flexibility to respond to government urgings to re-evaluate priorities. There was some criticism by industry that government was giving ambiguous signals. </PARA>
<PARA> 20 In a process of change there must be continuous monitoring. The Government has recently commissioned a number of reviews and investigations of science and technology capacity that have provided advice and information. These reports presented a number of themes indicating matters of general concern. </PARA>
<PARA> 21 Among the scientific community there is some apprehension brought about by the changes occurring within science and technology. Although there is broad agreement with the general direction of government policy, some scientists fear that the Government's commitment is lessening and others that their sectoral interests may be damaged. This is related to a general concern about the perceived lack of a clear statement of government science and technology strategy or sufficient mechanisms to coordinate science and technology policy.</PARA>
<PARA> 22 It is a general view that decades of neglect and insufficient funding have led to a rundown in science and technology infrastructure. Human resources are also of concern with difficulties in attracting young people to a scientific career. It is a matter of grave concern that the numbers in scientific vocations has fallen in recent years, especially in physics, chemistry, mathematics and engineering, although numbers remain high in computing and the life sciences including medicine. Equally worrying, as noted by the Vice-Chancellors, has been the decline in entry scores for students entering science disciplines compared to other areas. This confirms that there has been a loss of confidence about professional prospects in science. </PARA>
<PARA> 23 Frustration was evident from both researchers and research users about the difficulties of cooperating productively. Research users complain that researchers are not interested in addressing their needs. Researchers complain that commerce is not interested in funding research nor in becoming innovative. </PARA>
<PARA> 24 The Government takes these expressions of concern seriously and has attempted to provide a response through the measures now announced. Policy development in science and technology is a continuing process and the Government will be monitoring carefully the adequacy of the response. </PARA>
<PARA>CSIRO</PARA>
<PARA> 25 The Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organisation (CSIRO) has an excellent track record in strategic and applied research which has largely been earned in the agricultural and mining sectors. Industries in these sectors have been responsible for the creation of much of Australia's wealth and have had a continuous focus on world markets, with all the opportunities and pressures which that implies. These sectors have been continually exposed to fierce competition and, as a result, have felt a strong need to invest in state-of-the-art technology, much of it developed by CSIRO in conjunction with local industry. This research has been widely acclaimed, both here and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> 26 The Organisation will continue to provide vital research support for our rural, minerals and energy industries, as well as playing a major role in the development of Australia's manufacturing and information-based industries. These are areas in which CSIRO must play a major role. </PARA>
<PARA> 27 To encourage the Organisation to improve its links with industry, the Government has set a target for external income (i.e. funds from other than its direct Budget appropriation) of 30 per cent. This is a modest target by international standards and recognises that a significant portion of CSIRO's research is of broad public benefit and the need to maintain a core of long term, strategic research. To assist it to reach this target, the Government has decided that CSIRO will now retain all external income without reductions in its Budget appropriation. This decision, taken in March 1989, boosted CSIRO's base funding by $2.1 million, $6.6 million and $11.6 million, respectively, in each of 1988-89, 1989-90 and 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> 28 As a further commitment to enhancing the strength of the 1989 public research sector, the Government began a program in March to replace obsolete equipment in government research organisations, with $5 million for CSIRO in 1988-89. The Government has now decided to allocate a further $90 million over the next five years for equipment and priority projects. The allocation of this $90 million will be decided by the Board of CSIRO, which is in the strongest position to weight up the relative research importance of a range of technologies such as gene shears, vaccine and biological control, food processing, and other areas competing for funds. </PARA>
<PARA>ANSTO and AIMS</PARA>
<PARA> 29 Recent government decisions on budget continuity and retention of external revenue have given the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) and the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) the ability and incentive to raise revenue from industry and external sources. As part of the March decision to allocate additional funds for equipment in government laboratories, ANSTO received $0.5 million and AIMS received $1.1 million. The Government has now allocated a further $2.5 million to ANSTO and $2.5 million to AIMS for new equipment and research over the next five years. </PARA>
<PARA>Marine Science and Technology</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> 30 A recent review of Australia's marine industries and marine science and technology capabilities by a committee chaired by Professor Ken McKinnon has identified Australia's achievements, strengths and commercial advantages. I am tabling the Executive Summary of this report and the Government's response to the recommendations. The Government believes that industry development should be targeted to areas in which Australia has particular opportunity and where industry is a willing partner. </PARA>
<PARA> 31 The Government has decided to provide an extra $3.9 million for these activities (including additional staff and new projects) over the next five years. In addition, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy will be announcing details of an extra $2 million for the Bureau of Mineral Resources to maintain its marine seismic exploration capability at the highest standard. The Prime Minister has already announced support for a tidal measurement network and $1.8 million over four years under the greenhouse research initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA>Higher Education</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> 32 The Government has already allocated additional resources to expand the higher education system. During the 1989-91 triennium, an additional $843 million is provided to create 49,000 new places in higher education. Growth will be directed primarily towards priority fields such as engineering, computing, business and management studies. Funds of $430 million will be provided during the triennium to meet capital requirements. In addition a one-off special injection of $19 million has been provided in 1989 for urgent renovation needs. </PARA>
<PARA> 33 The Government will increase the resources available for allocation to higher education institutions and researchers on the advice of the ARC. </PARA>
<PARA> 34 A total of $977.9 million will be allocated through the ARC over the next five years, an increase of $466.4 million over 1989 funding levels. This will be achieved by a major injection of new funds and by continuing the transfer of funds from institutional operating grants to the ARC. New funds will total $254.4 million over the next five years with $56.9 million going to increase support for postgraduate research students and the remaining $197.5 million to develop the capacity of higher education institutions to support high quality research. </PARA>
<PARA>Health and Medical Research</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> 35 Australian medical researchers working in universities, research institutions and hospitals have won international acclaim and earned Australia a proud record for excellent research. Discoveries by Australian researchers have had a major impact on diagnosis and care. </PARA>
<PARA> 36 The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) has received increased funding for medical research throughout the term of the Hawke Government. </PARA>
<PARA> 37 To maintain Australia's very strong international record in medical research, the Government will also provide the NHMRC with an additional $39.8 million to upgrade and replace obsolete biomedical equipment and introduce new areas of research. The NHMRC will now also allocate a proportion of the funds which have been transferred from higher education operating grants to the ARC.</PARA>
<PARA>Greenhouse Research</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> 38 The Government has decided to support a national greenhouse research program so we can better understand and respond to greenhouse-related climate change. As announced by the Prime Minister, it will provide $7.8 million during 1988-89 and 1989-90 for policy support and for research principally by CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology. </PARA>
<PARA>Human Resources</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> 39 I will now turn to the key resource of the science base, its people; researchers, engineers, technicians and students. </PARA>
<PARA> 40 Science and technology depend on the excellence and creativity of individuals and groups of individuals. Without such creativity no amount of money will produce results. If science and technology is to flourish in Australia, first class minds must be attracted to its pursuit, and they must be offered the chance for intellectual development and a supportive work environment. </PARA>
<PARA> 41 There is an unfortunate perception that science is difficult, remote, unrewarded and unrecognised. Unfortunate because the opportunities for using a background in science and technology in an interesting career are much wider than being professional scientists or engineers. </PARA>
<PARA> 42 A range of initiatives has been taken to encourage students to remain in education and training, particularly in science and related courses. For example, the Commonwealth Government in cooperation with the States is promoting curriculum development in mathematics and science on a national basis. Specific strategies have been put in place to encourage more women to take mathematics and science at senior secondary level. </PARA>
<PARA> 43. One recent initiative is CSIRO's introduction of a cash bonus scheme to pay a substantial proportion of royalties earned on CSIRO's projects to reward individual research scientists and teams for excellent research. The full bonuses under this scheme which became effective from July 1988, will be paid to CSIRO scientists in July-August this year. </PARA>
<PARA> 44 Over the next five years the Government will upgrade the Post Graduate Awards Scheme. In 1990 the government will make available $31.8 million sufficient to provide for 1450 continuing research scholarships and 900 new research scholarships. From 1990 all Commonwealth Postgraduate Research Awards will be provided tax-free at a minimum level of $12,734, equivalent to a taxable level of $15,000, compared to the current level of $10,415. Institutions will have the flexibility to set stipends above this level up to $16,433 (equal to $20,000 taxed) according to their own research priorities and local needs. </PARA>
<PARA> 45 In addition, 30 new industry research scholarships will be available each year to link directly with industry. It is intended that by 1992 there will be a pool of about 80 or 90 of these awards. </PARA>
<PARA> 46. Further details will be given in the statement by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. </PARA>
<PARA> 47 The Minister for Community Services and Health will be announcing extra support for Australia's health and medical research force, and for post graduate awards costing $5.7 million over five years. </PARA>
<PARA> 48 The importance of public understanding of the central role which science and technology can play in economic growth and improved social welfare has already been described as crucial to the Government's policy objectives. To address these issues, the Government set up the Commission for the Future (CFF) to study and advise on the impact of science and technology as we prepare to enter the 21st Century. </PARA>
<PARA> 49 The Government has decided to support initiatives which further enhance public awareness of science and technology. It will create the Australia Prize, worth $250,000 tax free annually. This Prize will be an international award for scientific excellence in promoting the welfare of the peoples of the world. The Government will also increase support for prizes for scientific journalism. </PARA>
<PARA> 50 Discussions with leaders of Australian industry have indicated willingness to become involved in raising the nation's long-term scientific capacity and creating the industrial infrastructure needed for the future. The Government has therefore established an Industry-Science Foundation to create a mechanism which will alert business leaders to opportunities for long-term patient capital investments in research-based products and services. </PARA>
<PARA> 51 These and other initiatives to improve the public awareness of science will receive $4.0 million over the next five years. </PARA>
<PARA>Management and Coordination of Science and Technology</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> 52 The breadth of the Government's responsibilities in science and technology has persuaded the Government to review its coordination and consultation arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> 53 The Prime Minister has already announced the formation of the Prime Minister's Science Council and the appointment of a Chief Scientist. In addition at the officials level and complementing the work of the Prime Minister's Council, the Coordination Committee on Science and Technology will be chaired by the Chief Scientist with the Chief Science Adviser in the Industry, Technology and Commerce portfolio as deputy chair. This Committee will bring together senior officers from all departments with an interest in science and technology to share information about their programs and policies, problems and opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> 54 This management mechanism will ensure that coherence of policy is maintained and that government science and technology objectives are achieved efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA> 55 The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy will be introducing arrangements for a Primary Industries and Energy Research Council to provide high level representation for R&amp;D in the portfolio and to establish a consultative link with other major science and technology bodies and forums. </PARA>
<PARA> 56 The Government accepts that its central role in science and technology means that the decisions it takes will be a major influence on developments. However, in accepting the responsibilities this role brings, the Government has rejected any notion that it should dictate in detail the pattern of Australian science and technology. The establishment within the CSIRO and other research agencies of independent boards of management reflects this policy. </PARA>
<PARA> 57 The Government has aimed to have decisions taken by those best qualified to make the complex judgements required: research managers, researchers themselves and users of research. </PARA>
<PARA> 58 The Government is keenly aware that the scientific community is capable of offering useful advice and many worthwhile ideas. There are a variety of forums for this purpose including ASTEC, the Boards of government research establishments, the ARC and its associated committees and the learned academies. Ultimately, the kinds of efforts required if science and technology are to play the role envisaged for them by government are only likely to be made by people deeply committed to the enterprises in which they are engaged. </PARA>
<PARA> 59 Funds are limited and we need to make hard choices about priorities. We must be prepared to recognise and support excellence and contribute to world science as we have in the past. We need far more research-industry interaction, but it must be a two-way process. </PARA>
<PARA> 60 Government recognises that research is a high risk activity, where final outcomes are uncertain. Funds are limited and we need to make hard choices about priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> 61 We need to clarify the issue of who pays for what. As the work in R&amp;D is advanced toward production, it becomes clearly the responsibility of industry. Government should provide the national contribution to long-term research, while recognising that government research organisations (and higher education institutions) ought to be increasingly involved as a resource in industry collaboration, at industry's expense. In the United Kingdom and Canada there has been an increasing emphasis on ensuring that government expenditure is directed towards long-term generic research which contributes to the knowledge base and is generally available, while industry should be taking up and funding near-market research. However, in the United States, Europe and Japan, many major corporations are now undertaking much fundamental long term research in new areas, long in advance of the identification of products or processes. </PARA>
<PARA> 62 Increasingly, the economic performance of modern nations is judged on the basis of their ability to exploit new developments in technology-to capitalise upon brain power and scientific expertise. To secure maximum benefit for the community the importance of linkages between the development of new knowledge and the ways in which such knowledge can be used must be recognised. Innovation is the means by which we capture the benefits which science and technology may yield. The generation of new products and processes requires that research and development activities be fully integrated into the innovation processes of individual companies. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> 63 This statement demonstrates the Government's commitment to science and technology as an investment in our nation's future. </PARA>
<PARA> 64 Science and technology are an integral part of government policies for structural adjustment of the Australian economy, for education, health and defence and for the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> 65 The Government's decision to increase expenditure substantially on science and technology by $390 million over five years, and to forgo significant revenue at a time of financial restraint, shows the depth of its commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> 66 The Government's policy regarding science and technology is firmly based on achieving a better balance between government and business enterprise funded R&amp;D. The incentives to industry will encourage increased investment in R&amp;D, and increased use of Australia's technological achievements. </PARA>
<PARA> 67 Government policy also recognises the need for high quality long-term research to provide new ideas and the new industries of the 21st Century. </PARA>
<PARA> 68 In this statement, the Government has made its commitment. Successful implementation of these strategies will need an equally vigorous commitment from researchers, from research organisations, higher education and industry. </PARA>
<PARA> 69 We need to add science and scientific method to our culture, both publicly and privately, to recognise its achievements and see its achievers as role models, to talk it up, and make it part of our lives. This statement is the first step!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The extensive statements which have just been either read or tabled in the Senate represent the Government's response to a great deal of community concern and scientific community outrage about the state of science in Australia. If the statements illustrate anything, it is that the squeaky wheel gets the oil, and that politicians tend to respond when ideas are popular. I do not think there is any doubt that over the past two years this issue has impacted on the popular imagination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suspect that when the history of the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) is written, it will be recorded that his greatest contribution to the advancement of science in Australia was his labelling of the scientific community as a bunch of wimps. It is fair to say that that accusation on the part of the usually very non-abusive Minister represented his frustration at his failure to get the sorts of resources for science that he thought were necessary, and he was expressing the frustration that he must have felt at the quiet approach of his basic constituents, the scientists themselves. He was certainly very successful in changing their attitude to public presentation. I must say that in the period I have had renewed responsibility for shadowing the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), which is less than a year, I have been struck by the very forceful way in which the scientific community has presented itself and put forward its views. Therefore, I congratulate the scientific community-not just the officers and scientists from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) but also those from the Academy of Science, universities and various other bodies-which has, I think, with a very proper degree of vigour drawn attention to the important issues that these statements address. It is very important to remember that these statements are being made at a time when, within the last few days, CSIRO has been asked to produce another 500 retrenchments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was offered. The Minister broke in to say that this was offered; the CSIRO was not asked. I can only say that that indicates that those who are controlling CSIRO are in a position where they have to put the organisation under very considerable pressure. I am sure that many senators who have been keeping in touch with the scientific community would know just how much the pips are squeaking in some divisions of the CSIRO, which are concerned with dealing with the basic industries of this country. They would realise the pain that is felt at the need to offer up another 500 positions and the financial difficulties that that involves, because the offering up of those positions means that those officers have to be paid out, so there is no immediate financial relief. Indeed, in a sense it compounds the short term financial problem. The pain that has been felt within the CSIRO with respect to that and indeed the refusal, as I understand it, of the head of one division to do as requested, bear out the stresses and difficulties that are being faced. I do not think the Minister at the table would deny that we are in a period of massive dissatisfaction among scientists, again not merely scientists within the CSIRO.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of my own personal sample I would say that that massive dissatisfaction is not the dissatisfaction of unthinking people who are being forced into a process of necessary change-that is often the basis of objections in our community to changes in government policy and, in particular, to reductions in government expenditure-but rather that a significant proportion of those who are complaining are people who are doing valuable and world class work and who see that work being severely impeded by the financial strictures of recent years. After all, we have seen some very nice things said about the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC) in these statements. ASTEC is a distinguished body and has made a very distinguished contribution over a long time. It certainly did so during the period of the Fraser Government. Under the distinguished chairmanship of Professor Slatyer, the Australian Science and Technology Council was a major influence on government. Senator Collins, when Professor Slatyer was mentioned, interjected with some complimentary remarks and put them in the context of his approach to uranium. I speak from memory now but I think it was under Professor Slatyer's chairmanship that some key reports were made during the period of the previous Fraser Government which were pivotal in determining the policies which were adopted by the Government. There was great respect for the opinions that were put forward by ASTEC and Professor Slatyer as its leader; and they were not opinions which were simply gathering dust on bookshelves but were acted upon. </PARA>
<PARA> Within the last week this distinguished body, which has been acknowledged in these statements as having a continuing function, the previous chairman of which has been appointed to be the premier scientific adviser to the Government, has come out with some very sobering remarks on the state of science in Australia. Again I suppose the Government can say that these statements today are an attempt to meet that deficiency. But let me remind the Senate that perhaps the humorous line that was contained in the statement of the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, which was just read by Senator Button, is at the bottom of the second page where the Prime Minister used these words:</PARA>
<PARA>Since coming to office my Government has pursued a consistent science and technology strategy. </PARA>
<PARA>The broad view of the scientific community would be that to the extent that there has been a consistent strategy it has been in two streams. One stream has been actively to encourage and increase private research and development through the taxation system. I will have more to say about that soon. The Government can point to some improvement in that regard. But the other consistent stream has been a gradual tightening of the funding situation so that there have been real losses in resources in this area. The pressure which has been put on the system is one which has been reported on, as I say, within the last week by ASTEC in terms which give rise to a lot of concern. I do not have time to quote in great detail from the report entitled The Core Capacity of Australian Science and Technology. On the first page, after listing the core capacity which is required, ASTEC reports:</PARA>
<PARA>There are worrying deficiencies in Australia's ability to pursue these activities at a proper level. Concerns have been expressed about the adequacy and sources of research and development funding, the deterioration of buildings and equipment, the adequacy of our scientific and engineering workforce, the paucity of good research management practices, the meagre attempts to increase selectivity and concentration of effort in research, and the consequent effects on research productivity. </PARA>
<PARA>On the next page it goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>We consider that the present distribution of resources and capabilities is inappropriate for these future needs, largely as a result of historical developments. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate that that sort of statement from ASTEC indicates a need to shift resources and that accounts for the Minister's affirmation of the earlier comments I read out. ASTEC points out-I again quote from page 2 of the report-that:</PARA>
<PARA>Efforts to develop the S &amp; T capabilities in the private sector need to be continued, but we strongly advise that this should not provide reasons to allow Australia's investment in public sector R &amp; D to diminish. </PARA>
<PARA>That last point is very important and goes to the continued existence, vitality and health of the CSIRO. The fact of the matter is that one of the mistakes which has been made by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, who is at the table, and by the Government is that, in seeking a more active research and development approach in Australia in areas of high technology and manufacturing industry, there has been some forgetfulness about the fact that in the forseeable future we will continue to rely to a very significant extent on our major export industries which are the rural and mining industries. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to remember-again I want to put this in the context of what has been said by ASTEC in this most recent report-that in 1987-88 our rural exports were in excess of $15 billion and our mining exports were in excess of $16 billion. So in excess of $30 billion is involved in those fundamental basic primary industries which are so heavily and, in many cases, very efficiently and effectively supported by the activities of the CSIRO. ASTEC points out, again in that same report entitled The Core Capacity of Australian Science and Technology, on page 3 that:</PARA>
<PARA>Publicly supported research is broadly comparable with that of other countries, in terms of its size (relative to population) and objectives. It will continue to form a larger proportion of Australia's total R &amp; D effort for as long as we continue to rely on primary products to provide a large proportion of our export income. </PARA>
<PARA>That passage is very important. The fact which is contained in that statement has not been taken account of properly by the Government over these recent years in its treatment of the CSIRO. The truth is that because of the nature of some of Australia's major industries the sort of work which is done by the CSIRO is absolutely essential and will not be done by other bodies. In other words, it is not possible to shift a lot of that research out into the private sector. What is required is for us to ensure that the CSIRO continues to undertake that research; that it continues, as it is doing at the moment, to attract matching funds where possible from the industries which are concerned; that it attracts funds from the private companies which have an interest and so on; and to up the contribution of funds from other than the taxpayer. To do that the Government is required to be more sympathetic and practical than it has been over these last five years with respect to the public funding element. I made the point a little while ago that it is all very well to say that we will solve some of the CSIRO's financial problems by cutting staff. But the fact of the matter is that staff cuts in themselves create fresh expenses, tie up resources and may inhibit the CSIRO from carrying out basic functions. </PARA>
<PARA> One division of the CSIRO which has been very ready to come forward, to publish accounts and the costings of what it is doing and the economic, social and environmental benefits flowing from what it is doing is the division which deals with entomological research and development, that is, the Division of Entomology. I commend for the attention of honourable senators and, indeed, for public attention the account which is contained in that document which was published in August 1988 on the range of work which is undertaken and the direct economic benefits which flow from that work. We should then consider the wisdom or otherwise of putting the economic squeeze on the work of that division-I simply use that division as an example-at a time when it is out earning very significant amounts of external revenue to supplement the revenue which is put in by government. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last lot of figures which I saw, the funds for 1988-89, it was shown that that division attracted non-taxpayers funds in excess of $6m, and that ranged from rural research funds through to contributions by private companies, that is, companies in the private sector which are doing work to which the division can contribute. The document to which I have referred which reports on the division's work shows the great range of things which are being done. These include biological control of crop and pasture, lucerne aphids for example, a saving of $1.5m a year; integrated control of orchard mites, a saving in spray costs of $140 per hectare; and protection of underground cables from termites, a saving of $2m to $5m per year. The list, again, is too long for me to read into the record. But I want to mention the fact that this same division has worked on the biological control of water hyacinth and has been able not only to contribute to the freeing up of waterways in Australia but also to make a major international contribution to the clearing of waterways in New Guinea and in Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the sorts of things which are being done by a division on a relatively small budget attracting a high contribution from the non-government sector and producing very direct and measurable benefits for the Australian economy. The division makes the point that its research is market-oriented, that it solves problems in key agricultural industries and that in Australia the value of crops and horticultural plantings exceeds $7 billion a year. Pasture and native grasslands support animal production and dairy industries with a combined value exceeding $8 billion a year, timber production is worth more than $2 billion a year, and so on. These are massive figures we are dealing with. The CSIRO has a unique capacity to increase the productivity and to reduce the difficulties of those industries. I see that the Democrat senator from South Australia is perhaps going to take part in the debate. No doubt he will be able to speak on many of the areas in which he has expertise. I am sure that he would join with me in saying that if work can be done by the CSIRO which controls and limits the need to apply chemicals, and which contributes to the use of less toxic chemicals, then these are very valuable contributions not only to Australia but also to the rest of the world. These are the sorts of things which are being done at CSIRO and which one cannot see being readily replaced by commercial activity. </PARA>
<PARA> My simple point is that this key organisation servicing the great trunks of exports on which we are forced to rely, and on which we will continue to rely, in my view, for many years, has been put under enormous stress and difficulty by the Government. The failure of Minister Jones and those Ministers with economic responsibilities in the areas of the economy to which I have referred to ensure that there are adequate provisions for CSIRO will be long remembered and long suffered by this country. </PARA>
<PARA> To return to the ASTEC report on the core capacity of Australian science and technology, the sorts of criticisms which I have raised are just some of the concerns which are addressed by ASTEC. Let me touch on two things which raise points which I wish to deal with in this, what is essentially only a preliminary reply to the major statements which have been put down today. On page 7 of the report it is said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the key question facing the Government is whether allocating more money to public sector research and other industry incentives has had or will have a major impact on the competitiveness of industry . . . The Government needs to address the means by which a better environment for innovation can be established in which firms can take advantage of indigenous and imported research and development, but more importantly can confidently develop and market innovative goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA>I asked Minister Button in Question Time today when we would get the assessment by the Bureau of Industry Economics of the impact of the 150 per cent research and development tax deduction. It is a matter to be regretted that we have not yet had access to that report, yet the Government has decided to extend the benefit. On the face of it, one would always have to welcome the granting of another $1 billion of tax concessions to industry for the purpose of promoting research and development. On the face of it, that seems a sensible thing to be doing. But $1 billion is a very large amount of tax revenue forgone. I believe that when we are dealing in amounts of money of that sort it is important that not just the Government but also the Parliament, the public and industry itself have the capacity to assess what the real benefits of those concessions have proved to be. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at recent figures we find that in 1985-86 the deduction gave rise to revenue forgone of $140m. In other words, we were giving tax relief of $140m. By 1986-87 it was $170m. By 1987-88 the cost was around $200m. In that time, private sector expenditure on research and development increased from about $646m in 1984-85 to $1,069m in 1986-87. So there was a $423m net increase in expenditure in the two years to the end of 1986-87. But the cumulative cost of the tax concession was $310m over that two-year period. Clearly, there is a bigger benefit in terms of extra research than the actual amount of the tax concession. But one might have hoped for a larger multiplier. One might have expected that some of that increase would have occurred without the tax concession, in any event. In this speech I urge upon the Government the earliest possible release of the Bureau of Industry Economics report. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point which arises from the quotation which I gave from the ASTEC report is the question of the better environment for innovation. It is my own very strong view that we will not get that sort of take-off in manufacturing, the sort of translation of basic scientific research into research and development, product development and new, elaborately transformed manufactures in this country unless the Government is far more successful that it has been to date in transforming the general economic environment within which industry works. In a sense, things like management and investment companies (MICs) and tax concessions are attempts to overcome the disadvantages which Australian firms suffer in trying to move into vital areas if we are to reduce our dependence upon primary industry, including mining, and if we are to take advantage of the great growth areas of world trade, 70 per cent of which takes place in manufactured forms. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to persist with an economic environment in which Australian firms have to pay interest rates of 18 per cent to 20 per cent while their competitors pay interest rates of 3 per cent to 4 per cent, or perhaps 10 per cent; if we are to continue to have an environment in which labour and capital productivity is stagnant or reducing-as the current Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) figures suggest is the situation in Australia; if we are to continue to have a situation where our unit labour costs rise at a much faster rate than that of our trading partners; if we are to continue to have an economy where there are inbuilt inefficiencies on our waterfront, in our coastal shipping, in much of our transport systems-in other words, if we are to continue to have an economy in which there is not a genuine capacity on the part of Australian industry to compete, then we will continue to have the sorts of circumstances that each of us comes across so regularly. </PARA>
<PARA> The clever Australian whose research has shown that there is some splendid new product to be made promptly has to go offshore to make it. I can think of so many examples of that situation, and I suspect that each of the honourable senators in this chamber could also do so. Why does an Australian designer of mining drills, which have a market throughout the world and which are seen as technologically superior, have to go to a high labour cost country like Japan to manufacture the product that he has created through his own research and development, through his inventiveness, cleverness and capacity to be better at thinking through the problem than foreign competitors? He does not go to a low labour cost country; he goes to one of the highest labour cost countries in the world, Japan, because he knows that he will get his product produced to a high quality and to a standard which is required in a timely way without so many of the stupid difficulties which afflict the productive process in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no room, in this great plethora of paper that we have been given about the improvement of our basic scientific capacity in this country, to forget that in the end a lot of what is being sought by the scientific community does have to be demand driven. We remove that demand by removing the capacity of Australian producers to produce in a way which is economically competitive with the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the measures which the Government has announced-those measures cover some of the areas of complaint, such as the extremely poor remuneration of postgraduate students, and I welcome the fact that those postgraduate students will be offered a wage which will be a little more competitive than the wage that they have been offered recently; and improving the equipment of some of our basic institutions in the scientific area-will contribute to a situation where bright Australians see a scientific career as something which is attractive to them. </PARA>
<PARA> The final condemnation of the state of science and of the attitude to science in this country is that those areas of knowledge which require the application of a high degree of intelligence are often those areas of study which are easiest to get into. The qualification marks are very low because there is a low demand for the courses. I know that many scientists are very rueful about the fact that their courses are the easiest to enter for the simple reason that there is a low demand and, therefore, they do not have the brighter students competing for the places. I think that is a tragedy because undoubtedly science requires its share of people of very high intelligence. One has only to mix with the scientific community for a short time to see how many people have produced magnificent results because of their splendid minds. I do think that the drift away from science, which is recorded in so many of the criticisms which have been put forward over recent years and which has been a matter of such concern to the scientific community, is the proof positive that we as a community have not responded in a rational and sensible way to the future needs of our country in this area. I commend the Government to the extent that it has done something to remedy the gross failures of its first six years in office. In this its final year of office I guess it is desperate to buy off a little of the criticism that has so roundly surrounded it over this last 12 months. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it somewhat difficult to respond to this series of reports tabled this afternoon in that to respond adequately I think one needs to dig beneath merely the question of science and technology. The roots of the problem to which the Government is responding lie rather in its ideology, its economic policies and its total misunderstanding of the role of science in society. Indeed, it seems to me that the Government has destroyed a great deal of what is good and creative when in the past it has contributed, and could potentially again contribute, to the well-being not only of Australians but of people throughout the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I point here to the way in which this Government has pursued a deregulatory market driven approach. It has mixed that with quite a large measure of pragmatism. I believe that by understanding that approach we will find the root cause of what is wrong with Australian science and research today. The Government has adopted a position and a direction which is no different from that which the Opposition has taken in the past and would take if it were in government. Dare I say that the Government has gone further with that approach and that direction than perhaps the Opposition would have dared to go had it been in government. I often ask myself-indeed, a number of other people are asking themselves this question-whether we may not have been better off as a society with a coalition government over the last six years. But as a society we would have been better off only if such a government stuck to the policies it held while in opposition, and with the Australian Democrats' support strengthened its resolve to stick with those policies. One need only contrast the first page of the ministerial statement which has just been read by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) with what follows. On the very first page one finds the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA> Even the most basic cycle of our climate-</PARA>
<PARA>he is referring here to the physical climate-</PARA>
<PARA>the purity of the air we breath, the very borders between sea and land, seem-</PARA>
<PARA>I stress the word `seem'--</PARA>
<PARA>affected by technology. Problems such as the Greenhouse Effect and the depletion of the ozone layer are real issues today that even in the last decade would have seemed incredible outside the pages of science fiction. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the latter part is not true. The Government is attempting to cash in on the widespread concern which people in the community are expressing about environmental degradation. The Minister continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members who are in contact with their constituents will know that many people, especially many younger Australians, do indeed border on despair when they contemplate the dangers of nuclear war and the despoliation of the environment. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The march of technological change-where it seems possible that it might only lead to a polluted, clamorous, dangerous and uncertain world-must be made to serve our needs and to create a world in which our children and grandchildren can live at ease. </PARA>
<PARA>I would delete the last two words and suggest that what we are concerned with is a world in which our children and our grandchildren can live. Having said those things and paid lip service to the concerns of people in Australia, particularly young people, the Minister immediately descends into the usual jargon about competitive industry and the way in which our research effort must be directed towards making more gadgets and, indeed, precisely those things which are making the world more polluted, clamorous, dangerous and uncertain. That gives the lie to the direction which this Government has taken and indicates what is basically wrong with the direction of the Government in science policy and research effort. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 2 we find that the challenge that confronts all Australians is to create a more internationally competitive economy. That is the direction of the Government. It does not care a hoot about science, about technology, about society in general or about the world in which our children and grandchildren live; it cares about creating a more internationally competitive economy which will produce all the adverse effects to which the Minister pays lip service on the first page of his statement. There is a delightful expression on the second page. The Minister talks about `new knowledge, on which no price tag can be placed'. He is referring there to new knowledge which places Australia in a more competitive position and one in which Australia can profit from its research effort. This more fundamental analysis of what is wrong with science and research effort in Australia is relevant in a number of ways. The Government has observed the high rate of research and development in other countries-indeed, the Minister drew attention to that-but the deregulatory and market ideology which has driven this Government drives it also in regard to its emphasis on competitive activities vis-a-vis other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> That deregulatory approach and that market ideology has led to the situation in which much of Australia's industry is dominated by multinational companies. By the very nature of things, these multinational companies do their research overseas. They do not do their research in Australia. The very economic policy which the Government has adopted has been inimical to the other motivation of government, namely, to get industry involved more heavily in funding research. The Government will fail in that respect precisely because its economic policy is at variance with the direction it wants research in Australia to go. It follows that, having followed that deregulatory approach, the Government must continue to be the principal fund provider for research and for scientific effort in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I was recently in Sydney as a member of the Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia. The Agriculture and Veterinary Chemicals Association of Australia (AVCA) appeared before the Committee to give evidence. I asked one witness what proportion of all the chemical agents sold to farms in Australia by organisations which were members of AVCA were sold by Australian research companies. The answer was that practically all of them were sold by members of AVCA, the members of which were multinational companies. It is extremely unlikely that any of those companies will be involved in a great deal of research in Australia. It is probable that the only research which is likely to be done here is that which can be done only here and nowhere else. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Chaney has already pointed out, those companies which are marketing chemical control methods in agriculture are extremely unlikely to do research into biological methods, precisely for the reason that that is inimical to the profit that they would make out of chemicals. Therefore, this sort of work will be done only in Australian laboratories and laboratories which are publicly funded. </PARA>
<PARA> One could also reflect on the way in which the Government's economic policies have intruded into the passage of the plant variety rights legislation. For many decades Australia has been in the forefront of developing and maintaining genetic strains of crop plants best suited to Australian conditions and able to continue to produce food and fibre under the extremely harsh environmental conditions which prevail in this country. In passing the plant variety rights legislation and in contemplating shortly extending those rights, the Government is clearly moving to destroy this rich knowledge and experience base by substituting the short-term profit motive for the desire for comprehensive understanding of the wider service to the public good which has motivated this publicly funded research in Australia for so many years. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, it is significant that the Government has failed to notice that Japan did not recover economically from the Second World War and establish its present position of economic dominance by following the path which the Australian Government says we now have to follow to achieve the same economically dominant position. Japan maintained very high protection for its industry and perfected its technology at a lower level long before it entered into the area of high innovation and high technology. Indeed, the Japanese had a reputation for many decades as followers of technology which had been developed elsewhere and not as innovators. It would be fair to comment that only in very recent years, having established that economic base behind very high protective walls and following rather than innovating, have the Japanese entered the area of high technology innovation. In computing, they are now among some of the leaders in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The general point must be stressed that it is the ideology and pragmatism of the present Government that has led it into doing a number of things in apparently unrelated areas, but all of which are detrimental to eduction, science, scientific research and the institutions that carry out these functions. Unless this wider view is taken and a more comprehensive approach is made to directing our scientific and creative talents, we will merely put salves on the symptoms and not address the underlying problem. The statements we have before us this afternoon are precisely of that nature. In the main, they are bandaids rather than solutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Both David Suzuki and Paul Ehrlich have recently lectured in Australia to packed audiences. The public is very concerned about the message that they bring. That is outlined in the first page of the Minister's statement. Surveys have shown that awareness of major global environmental problems has never been higher. A survey in the Greensborough area at the time of the recent by-election indicated that the four most significant issues concerning voters in that electorate were environmental. But the Government's education and science policy, which was outlined today, contains no clear initiative in that direction whatsoever. It fails to address these concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> Only several weeks ago we saw in the newspapers a copy of what has come to be known as the Declaration of The Hague. `Greenhouse is emerging as the most important problem ever faced by mankind', to quote the words of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, words which, I believe, were used only for public consumption. The very next day after that statement appeared in our newspapers here, I asked him what the Government was going to do in relation to greenhouse. The answer was that the Government was going to do nothing at all. He went on to describe the Australian Democrats, for even raising such a question, as people who `had their feet firmly planted in mid-air'. That was said because we even dared to suggest that already we have enough information to indicate that greenhouse is a serious problem and enough information to indicate the directions in which we need to move. The Government is not doing anything about it. I simply say to Senator Evans and others that the Government has its economic feet firmly planted in the middle of the last century. It really has not caught up with the situation which obtains today, which is a disaster for science. </PARA>
<PARA> One could point to many other examples which underline the total scientific illiteracy of the Government, its inability to understand what the developments of science and technology have done to our environment. Without that proper understanding of science and technology, the Government cannot begin to repair that damage. I note Senator Cook's `Energy 2000' statement which he put down last year, the blueprint for Australia's energy policy to the year 2000. In that statement there was not a single mention anywhere of greenhouse. Recognised as the single biggest factor impacting on energy policy now and for decades into the future, greenhouse has been totally ignored by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) only two or three days ago when it was announced that some other coal exporting countries might be involved in subsidising coal exports, one finds that the Prime Minister was more concerned about Australia's competitive position with respect to coal exports than he was about greenhouse. I have a message for the Prime Minister, and that is that coal exports around the world will fall. As the world becomes a lot more concerned about the greenhouse effect, people will not want to burn coal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of alternative solutions to the use of electricity and none of them are being tackled by this Government. The principal one is to increase the efficiency with which we use energy. I point to the Button car plan, which has now obtained for several years and in which there was no emphasis whatsoever on improving the efficiency with which Australian cars used fuel. There was abundant evidence, when Senator Button first came forward with that plan, that we would face great difficulties on a number of fronts with respect to the use of petroleum in Australia in cars. One was the greenhouse problem. Another was that we are rapidly running out of indigenous supplies of crude oil. I understand that by 1991 we will be importing $3 billion worth of oil every year. This Government paid no attention whatsoever to that problem when it enunciated a plan for restructuring the Australian car industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed, one of the documents which were tabled today is entitled `Research, Innovation and Competitiveness'-I stress that word again-`Policies for Reshaping Australia's Primary Industries and Energy Portfolio Research and Development'. At page 100 we find that the Australian Coal Industry Research Laboratory has been a major recipient of National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Program funds over the past 10 years. Throughout all the years of this Government, we have been misdirecting a large amount of research effort which could have gone into finding far more efficient ways of using energy which contributed less to greenhouse warming and certainly contributed a great deal more to our economic benefit because we would not have to be importing these large amounts of petroleum and other energy resources in future years. </PARA>
<PARA> That brief mention of the Australian Coal Industry Research Laboratory indicates that as at June 1988 there were 17 members of that body and 185 staff. We could do a great deal by redirecting our research effort away from that activity and into far more productive enterprises which would be both economically and environmentally far more beneficial and sustainable. One is not likely to find this Government doing that, because it has a misunderstanding of the direction of science. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly, in the Prime Minister's statement one finds at page 16 a frank admission by the Government when it states:</PARA>
<PARA> The attitude of the community to science and technology will feed back, enhancing or undermining the contribution it can make to society generally. The attitude of young people to the prospect of a career in science and technology is a powerful example. The Government accepts that its own attitude exerts a strong influence on such community perceptions. </PARA>
<PARA>If there is anything which indicates the abysmal record of this Government with respect to research, scientific activity and the encouragement of people to seek a career in science, it is that statement. As Senator Chaney has already pointed out, whereas a few years ago a considerable matriculation mark was required to get into faculties of science around Australia, we now find that it is easy to get into faculties of science and, indeed, the mark required is frequently much lower than that required to get into other faculties. </PARA>
<PARA> Young people who are considering their careers, who have matriculated and have an opportunity to go into various faculties, are at the time in their lives when they are at their most idealistic. Those young people want to go into exciting careers which serve the needs of society. They are the young people whom the Government has identified as being concerned about the environment and the world in which they are to live. Indeed, they are concerned about whether there will be a world in which to live. Those people are turning away from science in droves because, as the Government accepts in this statement, its own attitude `exerts a strong influence on such community perceptions'. </PARA>
<PARA> The perception which this Government has given to those young people is that science is not worth going into; that the Government is turning its back on those exciting, innovative areas of science which have a strong commitment to useful social change, useful protection of the environment, and so on, and is attempting simply to push science into the area of greater international competitiveness, more production and all those things which will lead to more pollution of, and damage to, the environment-the very things about which young people are greatly concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> If one turns to the very first page of the Prime Minister's statement one finds that the very first fundamental direction of this Government in science and technology is to generate economic growth-fortunately, with equity. Of course, as I have said in this chamber several times already, it is that narrow perception of what economic growth is-the increase in gross national product, the increased throughput of resources and the increased wastage of resources-which lies at the core of the problem. The statement continues on the same page:</PARA>
<PARA>Science and its applications have a central role to play in achieving an internationally competitive Australian economy . . . Science and technology . . . are at the forefront of world performance, providing a strong competitive advantage. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government is so scientifically illiterate that it does no really understand that science, by its very nature, is a cooperative activity. It is an activity which is dedicated to understanding, to the sharing of knowledge and to the building of a better world. Science, basically, is not, and should not be, a competitive activity. Again, the Government is misunderstanding. The Prime Minister goes on to refer to:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . developing a wide range of new industries and products and increasing efficiency in existing industries. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have already indicated in response to the interjection by Senator Newman, an enormous amount can be done to increase the efficiency of existing industries in terms of their damage to the environment-not as it is currently very crudely measured, by increasing their efficiency in terms of economic return on inputs. The view which this Government and conventional economics takes of efficiency is very narrow. On page 2 the Prime Minister states:</PARA>
<PARA>Knowledge of the environment and the impact of technologies are crucial to ensure an appropriate balance between environmental and economic objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>It is clear, from the rest of the statement, that it is the economic objectives which the Government has uppermost in its mind when considering the research effort. The balance to which that sentence refers is clearly one which implies that, if there is a conflict, then it is the environment which must give way. The Prime Minister goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Since science and technology are potent factors in determining social change, there is a pressing need to raise awareness in the community of developments in this field, and to understand the impact these changes have on cultural attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, the Government is taking an incredibly deterministic view of science-that somehow science and technology determine social change and people are merely the pawns who must adapt to that change. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, what should be happening is that we should be having a far more scientifically literate society-one which can understand the options that science presents to it, which then exercises some control over those options and, itself, determines the direction that science will take. People should shape the direction of science and then, through that, science will direct its efforts towards those things that are democratically determined by the community at large. Science is not something which, in a deterministic way, should decide the future and expect people merely to adapt to that. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, one can only reflect again on the extent to which this Government is itself scientifically literate. Clearly it does not understand the position. One encouraging thing that I noticed in Mr Jones's statement, however, was that the Government will increase the support for prizes for scientific journalism. One of the things that one notices in this country also is that, with a number of quite marked exceptions, particularly in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's (ABC) science unit, journalists are not particularly scientifically literate. The ability to report properly what science is doing and the interaction of science and society is not of a particularly high quality in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of worrying things in the Government's statement. It refers to the higher proportion of funding which private industry makes in other countries. Having referred to the lower proportion in Australia, it says that this Government has succeeded in increasing the proportion that comes from private industry. Of course, if the Government has cut down its share, its proportion increases. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I repeat that the problem that faces science and research effort and the education that feeds those in Australia lies fundamentally with the economic ideology that this Government has adopted. It is an ideology that is shared by the Opposition. The problem will not be solved until that ideology is turned around, and we head--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to contribute briefly to this debate on the statements from the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the associated documents that have been presented to Parliament from other Ministers. As the Leader of my Party, Senator Chaney, said, we have indeed had a plethora of papers today. It would have been difficult, of course, for the Opposition to get to the bottom of all of them in the time that we had available for study. I personally welcome the Government's recognition, at last, of the great importance of scientific endeavour for the future of our country. Inevitably, our future lies in the hands and in the minds of scientists, and for too long they have been neglected by this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to speak only briefly on the matters that are of relevance to my portfolio responsibilities-namely, those relating to the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO). Referring to the document entitled Science and Technology for Australia, from the Prime Minister and from the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, I was interested to see that in a 31-page statement the Defence Science and Technology Organisation was given half a page. That, to me, says a lot about the priority that this Government gives to defence matters generally-something that one would have expected to be the first priority of a Federal government, yet something that is constantly put at the very bottom of the list. </PARA>
<PARA> In this case, of course, the future defence of Australia is inextricably entwined with the effectiveness of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation, which is at the cutting edge of our future ability to defend this country. The technology that it has produced over the years has been instrumental in giving us a leadership role in many areas which much larger countries have been unable to match. My concern is that, although the organisation has been reorganised recently-and, of course, that has been with the support of the Opposition parties-it is still suffering from problems similar to those being faced by other scientific bodies in this country, but because it is part of the Defence Department it tends to get little or no recognition of its problems. Of course, those problems go very much to the question of personnel-the ability to attract, to retain and to advance the interests of the personnel in the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The reorganisation of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation has led inevitably to some upheaval and to a considerable degree of uncertainty amongst the people who work there. Those who will no longer work there over the next few years, as development programs are handed over to industry, are of course, feeling unsettled. I believe, however, that it was a wise decision to make that move because inevitably it is an area that industry can pick up, whereas the sort of research work that the scientists and engineers at the Defence Science and Technology Organisation have been doing is in areas where private industry will rarely, if ever, be interested to get involved in research and development unless it is down the track an area that is likely to prove to be very commercial. In saying that I intend no criticism of private enterprise at all; those are simply the inevitable facts of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I see that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) has introduced a cash bonus scheme to pay a substantial proportion of royalties earned on CSIRO's projects to reward individual research scientists and teams for excellent research. The Minister for Science said that the full bonuses under this scheme would be paid to CSIRO scientists in July-August this year. I think that this is an imaginative and proper use of the royalties that come as a result of the work of the scientists, and I would have expected that this could also be introduced for the scientists and engineers at the DSTO. </PARA>
<PARA> The mechanisms have to be found to keep these people. First of all, it is not easy to find them; secondly, it is very difficult to keep them when, outside government, there is much better opportunity for rewarding employment in the private sector and, of course, even more so overseas. That is the context in which we must face the problems of scientists and engineers in government employment. They are not remunerated and rewarded as they can be outside government, and inevitably we lose some of the brightest people we have. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Estimates Committee just last month I asked the head of the DSTO, Mr d'Assumpcao about this very problem and, in reply, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we do require more highly skilled people and more than we have at present. </PARA>
<PARA>I asked him:</PARA>
<PARA>Am I to assume that you do not feel you have yet got the experience levels of qualifications that you are aiming for?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr d'Assumpcao said:</PARA>
<PARA>Not by a long shot, particularly because of the reorientation of the organisation towards other areas identified as being of high priority. In order to expand in those areas we have to recruit, retrain and divert resources and alongside other organisations in this country-indeed, around the world-we have a severe shortage of, for example, PhDs in say, computing science, amongst other fields. </PARA>
<PARA>DSTO is feeling the pinch, just as other organisations are, but we have heard very little about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the moves that the Government intends to make in upgrading the post-graduate awards scheme. The awards are to be provided, tax-free, at a minimum level of $12,734, compared to the current level of $10,415. I must say that I am pleased that the 30 new industry research scholarships will be available each year to link directly with industry. The Government states that it is intended that by 1992 there will be a pool of approximately 80 or 90 of these awards. In the major statement put down today there is only half a page on the DSTO and there is little or no detail about any measures which can be used in that organisation to retain the highest calibre of people. I ask: Will these new industry research scholarships be eligible to be taken up at an organisation like DSTO, or does it apply simply to private industry? The DSTO is increasingly involved with industry and I would have hoped that we could have used some of these scholarships in that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand from the paper that the DSTO is actively pursuing mechanisms, such as contract and collaborative research projects, to improve its interaction with higher education institutions and is developing a memorandum of understanding with the CSIRO to enhance research cooperation between the two organisations. In the light of the problems facing the CSIRO, I hope that that memorandum of understanding will have some meaning for DSTO and will not simply be a piece of paper without much impact. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement tabled today reminds me of the fact that DSTO currently has a research contract into information technology with Cambridge University. I would have hoped that that sort of contract could have been made with an Australian university. While I recognise that DSTO is actively pursuing such contract and collaborative research projects, I assume that the reason it has not pursued such a contract with an Australian university is that the Australians who may have been able to do the work may well have taken themselves to Cambridge. If so, that is just one more piece of evidence of the failure of this Government to take meaningful action early on to prevent the brain drain which we have been suffering. </PARA>
<PARA> I am disappointed that the Government is not prepared to give more substantial attention in this major report on science and technology in Australia to the needs of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation; to the recognition of the enormous contribution which DSTO has made over the years to industry and to the defence of this country; and to its great need to attract and retain professionals and to make a professional life very rewarding for that high calibre of scientists and engineers which it must have and must continue to attract if Australia is to be well defended in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My remarks on this statement will be short, but I think they need to be placed on the record. I listened with interest to Senator Button's reading of the statement which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made in the other place. I think this statement could have re-entitled, `An ode in praise of science'. But I would suggest the poetic licence which the speech took needs to be dealt with. I begin by directing attention to page 2, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Our agricultural and mining industries, our medical researchers, our astronomers . . . are already showing the way, not just with new techniques and new products that can be sold abroad, but with new knowledge, on which no price tag can be placed. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, this is a Government which readily places a price tag on the attainment and use of knowledge. We have already seen, prior to this statement coming out, that the reduction of Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) funds for this year was some $24m, with a projected $14m reduction for next year. If that cannot be construed as a government having put a price tag on the value of knowledge, I do not know what can be. It is fortunate that the scientists who are important within our community, who became angry, who spoke out, and who got others to join them, were successful in bringing this Government to account. This has resulted in the Prime Minister's statement being made. The statement goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>This Government is determined that Australia will not fall behind. </PARA>
<PARA>How interesting that it can be brought back in line so quickly. The statement talks about the `proven excellence of our researchers', our `allowing them to further the horizons of basic research and to contribute through their creativity and innovation to Australia's goals'. That is certainly the intention of the scientific community, but it is quite clearly not the intention of the Government. The Government has been implementing changes in the mix of funding between blue sky research and research which is tied to some practical purpose. When the idea of private funding for research was originally brought in, it was never meant to affect the funding which came from appropriations. Yet, that is exactly what occurred. On page 3 there is another amazing statement:</PARA>
<PARA>The best Australian research can now receive increased support, as researchers must now win a proportion of their funding by competing with others against a variety of standards, some involving peer review and others commercial criteria. </PARA>
<PARA>What a nonsense statement that is. Certainly Australian research can receive increased support. The point is that it simply may not. Researchers must now win a proportion of their funding. This means that the Government is abrogating some of its responsibility with regard to what I have called blue sky research. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that traditionally in this country-it is to be lamented-the private sector has not believed that it has a role to play in research and development to any large extent. It has been felt that that is a public sector responsibility, and for the most part that has been fulfilled by the existence of the CSIRO. The result of that tradition is that the CSIRO built up a tremendous expertise and earned a great place of respect, but that has meant that those private sector bodies which are capable of spending a greater amount on research and development are not doing so. Therefore, initiatives which have been taken, via tax deductability, to encourage the private sector to be active in this area are most important. That is not to say that there may not be the odd incidence of some work that was already being done being reclassified to make it attract the tax deductability incentive and that this may not add to the total sum of new research. However, for the most part I think it is an important initiative and one which I would like to see continue-but never at the expense of the important work that has to continue within the CSIRO. One cannot expect that overnight the culture, which seems to be the in terminology, will change and that the private sector will take over large segments of the research which has hitherto been the province and the function of the CSIRO. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly, Senator Chaney's remarks this afternoon drew attention to the fact that this country is still primarily a farm and a mine. We still basically earn our export dollars through agriculture and through mining. Hopefully over a period and with various initiatives this will alter so we will see a greater share of our export earnings coming from the services sector and from manufactures. Research and development in the area of manufactures is very important in helping this occur. But it must not and cannot be at the expense of the research and development which is necessary to keep us efficient and innovative producers of agriculture and effective miners. These two areas still provide our main earning capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> It is only when one starts to look at the work of individual institutes of the CSIRO which deal in those areas that one sees the nature of the importance of the research being done. One particular institute which is doing most important work is the Division of Entomology. On its own impressive figures it is generating income earnings for Australia of approximately $100m. When one sees that over the last five years it has lost 50 staff and is looking at losing another 10 or 12 staff, one begins to wonder how far those programs can be pared down before we basically suffer. It may well have been that five years ago there was indeed fat that could have been pared away but, having looked at the documentation, I am convinced that it has been pared down as far as it can go and it is to the bone. We would be very poor if we did not realise that there is a conflict of interest in CSIRO having to report to the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce (DITAC), which has a bias against agriculture in a sense because it is concerned with the industrial side and may not have the sympathetic ear that is required. This is an area that has been commented upon by people who are knowledgeable in the area and it is an important point that has to be taken on board. </PARA>
<PARA> Page 4 of the statement refers to the creation of the new Council, which certainly does seem to be an important initiative although, when I look at figure 7 on page 23 of the `Science and Technology for Australia' statement, I see that the Prime Minister will now have two advisory bodies-the new Science Council and, of course, the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC), which has been mentioned previously in this debate and which has hitherto been the Prime Minister's main policy advising body. One wonders what sort of coordination is anticipated and how effective it will be, or whether the creation of the new Science Council is only window-dressing by a government that has become seriously embarrassed by its attack on science and its failure to give due importance to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Having announced that the Council is to be set up, the statement goes on to say that it will:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . bring a new focus and prominence to discussions on Australia's national priorities in scientific research and a new capacity to make sure that our aims in basic and applied science are properly set and implemented. </PARA>
<PARA>What are they? The record to date is not very good. The record to date seems to be a downgrading of the importance of scientific research. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the statement is welcomed in that it does go some way to redressing the damage that has already been done. Perhaps, to conclude, I should quote from an article in the Canberra Times of 5 April headed `Gloves are off in the battle for Australian science'. It might perhaps set the tone for what is to be the future of science in Australia if the Government does not match up to the rhetoric in its statement today and in fact is concerned only with press releases and window-dressing. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no point in expecting CSIRO scientists-and divisional chiefs in particular-to act like company clones. They were all educated in the pre-Dawkins era when things like academic freedom and the pursuit of truth and excellence were ideals in which they were steeped. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I move this motion as part of my continuing campaign about the ludicrously late nature of so many of the reports that this Government has been presenting quite frankly in a grossly insulting way to both this chamber and the people of Australia. This report is for the year ended June 1988. It was signed by the City Manager on 10 March 1989; the Forestry Trust Account was signed on 20 February 1989; the Manager, Australian Capital Territory Forests signed his section on 15 February 1989; the Auditor- General signed his report on 8 March 1989. The Government owes this chamber an explanation as to the reasons it has given for the extensions of time-which it is required to give-for the people who prepared this report, resulting in its presentation to this Parliament so late. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Australian Capital Territory Forestry Trust Account were a public company, it would have been fined, delisted and its directors hammered over the knuckles. But, because it is a government operation, it can hide its incompetence behind the shield that this Government so readily provides for it in not requiring reporting within a reasonable time. </PARA>
<PARA> So that the Senate can understand what in fact has been going on, I ask the appropriate Minister to provide the Senate with the reasons given in agreeing to extend the time from the statutory six months in which this report should have been made. I mention in passing that, for the year, this body, the Australian Capital Territory Forestry Trust Account, incurred an operating loss of $192,840. I note that this Government, which is clearly so determined to dress up its figures even in a small way, paid itself a dividend of $165,000 even though the forestry operations made a loss. That seems to me to be moderately curious. </PARA>
<PARA> Also I have no doubt that many people interested in forestry activities would find it interesting that the Government itself undertakes clear-felling in its forests, which is, of course, a sensible and proper way to perform. The area clear-felled and awaiting replanting is about 1,367 hectares. I mentioned that in passing because it indicates that there is nothing obscene or indecent about clear-felling of forests-the Government itself does it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had to laugh at the last comment from Senator Michael Baume, who said that, because the Government does it, there is nothing obscene about the process of clear-felling. I have never heard him agree with the Government before and, furthermore, I think that many people would object to that comment about clear-felling. It is a very destructive use of a forest resource.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In speaking to the Australian Capital Territory Forestry Trust Account annual report, I note that there are some 15,000 hectares of softwood plantation. Plantation growth of wood for commercial use is one of the linchpins of the conservation or environmental movement's drive to preserve native forests in Australia. There is an outcry in the public about the use of native forests for wood pulp, woodchips and other uses and there is certainly a case to be made for the plantation growth of wood. Unfortunately, in the ACT, this plantation has denuded the hills of the native forests that previously existed and, as such, this is a retrograde step. Plantations should be established on derelict farmland or farmland of low productive capacity so that the native forests can be saved. To strip the native forests from the hills and put in plantations as has been done in the ACT has two detrimental impacts. One, of course, is the loss of the native forest itself and the habitat that it provides for animals and birds. The pine forests which replace them are austere places, deserts, as far as wildlife is concerned, because nothing is adapted to live there. In the United States, where I come from and where the pinus radiata comes from, there is a whole ecosystem based on that pine tree. But here there is none and these forests are sterile. The other impact arises from what the pine trees themselves do to the soil. They deplete the soil. It is not possible to get very much more than three, four or maybe five rotations before the soil is sterile. It makes far more sense to do two different things. One is to use the farmland, as I have said. The other, if farmers must put in plantations, is to use hardwood such as native eucalypts for their plantation wood type. </PARA>
<PARA> We have gone through a cultural cringe in wood use in Australia. The native forests were considered trash and softwoods were the flavour of the month, even the year. Hardwoods are now coming into their own. The Japanese, for instance, favour hardwood. I was in Tasmania over the weekend and talked to a friend in the craft wood industry. He has made items out of Huon pine, sassafras, and also Tasmanian oak, which is a hardwood eucalypt species. He said that the Japanese were keener to buy Tasmanian oak, the hardwood, than any other type of wood. We should promote our hardwoods more for what they are, which is a very durable and good species to use. </PARA>
<PARA> Our plantations should be more oriented towards hardwoods than softwoods. Softwoods certainly have a place in the construction industry but there are difficulties in growing them. In the south-eastern forests of New South Wales we could very much look to the admitted success of the plantation system in the ACT. Although I do not agree with the type of wood used, certainly the plantation system has been a success. If the State of New South Wales were to undertake this type of plantation in south-eastern New South Wales there would be no need to go in and woodchip in areas around Tantawangalo, Coolangubra and other areas of the National Estate. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill amends the Audit Act 1901. The principal amendments are intended to improve the administrative procedures followed by departments. Make arrangements for signing audit reports. Enhance the Auditor-General's powers to undertake audits and to indemnify the Auditor-General and his or her staff.</PARA>
<PARA> The amendments included in this Bill have been considered by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and that Committee has raised no objections to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Administrative procedures will be streamlined by amendments to sections 31 and 34 which will remove the requirement for the reimbursement of a drawing account from the Commonwealth Public Account to be certified and authorized under the provisions of section 34. The Commonwealth Public Account is the Commonwealth's main centralised bank account. Drawing accounts are the bank accounts maintained by paymasters from which cheques and similar payments are drawn to pay claims. Drawing accounts are reimbursed daily from the Commonwealth Public Account for the value of the cheques and payments drawn. The current requirements under section 34 mean that, technically, both the original payment from the drawing account and the subsequent daily reimbursement of that account need to be certified and authorized. Since the latter certification and authorization constitutes a duplication of the action taken when the payment is originally made from the drawing account it serves no purpose and can be dispensed with. </PARA>
<PARA> Further improvement in administrative procedures will be brought about by an amendment to section 35a of the Act. This will enable moneys from one parliamentary department to be transferred to another upon the approval of the Minister for Finance whenever there is a transfer of functions between the departments concerned. The power to approve such transfers of funds currently exists only in relation to transfers between departments of state. Another amendment to section 35a will enable the Minister for Finance to reduce amounts previously transferred between departments and to give directions on amounts to be transferred retrospectively. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also proposes that the regulations made under the Act may authorize a minister to give guidelines to officers concerning policy matters which have a service-wide financial application and for which that minister is responsible. Any such guidelines may not of course be inconsistent with the provisions of the Act. The regulations or the directions given under the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>Included in the amendments concerning the Auditor-General's responsibilities are provisions to provide for the Auditor-General to authorize officers to sign reports on his or her behalf for departmental financial statements and for the reports required of companies where the Auditor-General is their Auditor. This is an extension of the current authorization in respect of audit reports on authorities. The Auditor-General's personal workload will be increased significantly with the introduction of departmental financial statements by the Audit Amendment Act 1988 and with the increase over the past few years in the number of Commonwealth-owned and controlled companies. This Bill will alleviate the personal workload on the Auditor-General. However, it is emphasised that for all such audit reports the final responsibility will remain with the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA>Another amendment concerning the Auditor-General will put beyond doubt his or her power to conduct project performance audits when it is not cost effective to invoke the more formal efficiency audit provisions of Division 2 of Part VI of the Act. The meaning of a performance audit and its scope has been detailed in publications of the United Nations affiliated International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) to which the vast majority of the world's Auditors-General or equivalent officials are members. The Auditor-General for Australia is presently Chairman of the Organization. Briefly, a performance audit is concerned with efficiency and economy in the use of resources as is the case with an efficiency audit, except that a project performance audit is one done on a smaller scale than a formal efficiency audit. The Australian Audit Office auditing standards published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette No. S 200 of 7 August 1987 gives a more comprehensive discourse on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA>Another amendment is designed to make it mandatory for the Auditor-General to audit and report to relevant ministers on the financial statements and on the audit and inspection of the accounts and records of subsidiary companies. The proposed amendment will apply where the Auditor-General has been appointed as auditor of the authority or other body to which the company is a subsidiary. A dual appointment under the Companies Legislation will also be possible. It is anticipated that unless there are exceptional circumstances, the Auditor-General will carry out both the Audit Act and Companies Legislation requirements concurrently (that is, under normal circumstances it is not expected that an auditor other than the Auditor-General would be appointed to report under the Companies Legislation). The proposed new section will also provide that the Auditor-General may decide not to do an audit on the grounds that to do so would not be cost effective. The proposed amendment is intended to apply to subsidiaries acquired after the commencement of the section and to existing subsidiaries which currently have the Auditor-General as sole auditor. This is so as not to disturb any present arrangements for audit and report on existing subsidiaries which do not have the Auditor-General as sole auditor. </PARA>
<PARA> Another principal amendment directly affecting the Auditor-General is the introduction of an indemnity provision. The Auditor-General and his or her staff will be covered against liabilities incurred for any act done or omitted to be done in the performance of their duty, other than acts or omissions in bad faith. The provision mirrors the indemnity insurance which a company auditor would obtain. It will remove the necessity for the Auditor-General to rely on the largesse of the government of the day for providing compensation against actions arising in carrying out his or her duties. To date there have never been any actions taken for damages against the Auditor-General but there have been some actions against his counterparts in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The final principal amendment affecting the Auditor-General will give him or her a limited discretion not to include details of minor technical breaches of legislation in reports on the financial statements of Departments or statutory bodies provided that not to include the particulars is in accordance with accepted professional standards concerning the conduct of audits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes to make it mandatory for all newly established authorities to be automatically subject to the provisions of division 2 of part XI. Unless the legislation establishing the authority provides otherwise. Division 2 contains standard financial provisions on accounts, audit and reporting which are applicable to an authority which should keep its accounts in accordance with commercial practice. The amendments will, in the future, ensure that the standard provisions are applied across the board and that any modifications to those standard provisions are highlighted in the legislation establishing each body. </PARA>
<PARA> Other amendments of a minor nature will make the Australian Secret Intelligence Service a department for the purposes of the Act; make it clear that bank accounts are opened under section 21 and not 20; update certain provisions relating to the audit of the Australian Audit Office; substitute the Minister for Finance for Governor-General in section 62 and permit regulations to be made concerning the commitment of moneys and estimates of expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> Contingent costs could arise from the proposal to give the Auditor-General and staff an indemnity and it is possible that additional costs could result from the increased complexity of the audit of the Australian Audit Office. The other changes are not expected to have any significant financial impact on Commonwealth Revenue or expenditure. I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>In moving to take note of the report by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology entitled Assistance for the Sugar Industry I draw attention to the fact that the report contains five key recommendations. Together they provide reassurance for the industry and support if and when the world sugar price slumps in the next three years. In brief, the recommendations are, firstly, that the proposal to end the sugar embargo proceed; secondly, that a sliding scale tariff system be introduced to provide more protection for the industry should the world sugar price fall below a certain level in the next three years; thirdly, that the Industries Assistance Commission review the situation and report before 1 July 1992; fourthly, that an Australian Sugar Industry Council be established; and fifthly, that any deficiencies in the anti-dumping legislation be investigated and amendments made if necessary. These recommendations, if adopted, should ensure the continued viability of the Australian sugar industry. Furthermore, overall levels of protection will be significantly reduced in line with Government policy. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter was referred to the Committee on 14 December 1988. It resulted from concerns raised about proposals to replace the sugar embargo with tariffs and end current domestic pricing arrangements when the sugar agreement expires on 30 June 1989. The Committee conducted public hearings in Brisbane, Bundaberg and Canberra. It took evidence from a wide range of people and organisations, including the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), representatives of his Department and the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, and representatives of the Australian sugar industry, the trade unions and sugar consuming industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was also able to view a number of aspects of the sugar industry first hand. It visited the sugar growing centres of Mackay and Bundaberg and conducted informal discussions with a number of people and organisations there. The Committee found that there is widespread concern in the industry and in the trade unions about the possible implications of the proposed changes. The industry has just recovered from a prolonged period of very low prices which caused significant economic hardship. There are fears that removal of the embargo and current domestic pricing arrangements will threaten industry viability if the bottom falls out of the market again. These fears exist despite predictions by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics that prices will continue to improve for the next two years. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia exports 80 per cent of the sugar it produces. A considerable proportion of this sugar is sold on the world market, a market corrupted by government interference and unfair trading practices. Because of the nature of the world market the free market price of sugar is extremely volatile and has varied between US3c and US40c per pound in recent years. Sugar is frequently sold or dumped at prices which are well below the cost of production. </PARA>
<PARA> The sugar industry argues that the sugar embargo and the domestic pricing arrangements have helped it to survive previous slumps in the sugar market. This is because under the current arrangements domestic sales of sugar return more to the industry when the world price is low. When the price is high the industry subsidises the consumer as the domestic sugar price is held at lower levels than the prevailing world price. The industry considers that the tariffs proposed by the Government provide the least assistance when the price is low and protection is most needed. When the price is high and no assistance is needed the level of protection is high. </PARA>
<PARA> It is feared that when world prices are low and the industry is at its most vulnerable sugar will be dumped in Australia at very low prices. The trade union representatives to whom the Committee spoke also expressed concern about the possible effects of the changes, particularly on employment. They argued that the changes would increase insecurity of employment in an industry already characterised by declining employment levels. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy put the Government's position to the Committee. Mr Kerin's view is that excessive regulation and protection have resulted in a smaller, less efficient industry than would otherwise exist. The Committee was told by Mr Kerin that excessive regulation of the industry has meant that potentially profitable opportunities have been missed because production could not be increased in time and that the industry would be better off in the long term if it were less heavily regulated. Mr Kerin also informed the Committee that the changes are part of the Government's overall plan to reduce protection levels in all industries. He said that the sugar industry would benefit from these changes and could not expect to be exempted from them. </PARA>
<PARA> The embargo and the domestic pricing arrangements are just part of the regulation of what is a very heavily regulated industry. The Queensland Government, through the Sugar Board and the Central Sugar Cane Prices Board, controls most aspects of production. For example, farmers are told how much cane they may grow and are penalised if they grow it on land not assigned for cane growing. The Queensland Government also acquires and markets all sugar produced. Mr Kerin informed the Committee that he considers that the proposed changes will act as a catalyst to force other changes in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also took evidence from representatives of some of the sugar using industries. They were generally supportive of the Government's proposals. They considered that they should have alternative sources of supply available to them. They also thought that the sugar industry should operate in the same competitive environment as them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was placed in a difficult position by these conflicting viewpoints. On one hand, it appreciates that there is a need for change in the industry. There are benefits to be had from an overall reduction in protection levels. There is also a need for Australia to adopt policies which are consistent with its international efforts to free up world trade. The arguments for change presented by the sugar using industries must also be considered. On the other hand, the Committee is aware that, despite the controls on it, the sugar industry is technically a very efficient industry. Australia is a low cost producer of sugar by world standards. It competes on a world market characterised by wildly varying prices and unfair trading practices. </PARA>
<PARA> There is considerable scope for damage to be done to the industry if it is left unprotected during times when the world price is low. The people who will suffer most are those least able to adjust, such as mill workers and people in the extensive service industries. Even though the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has predicted that the price will increase over the next two years, the Committee believes that a mechanism for protection should be put in place. It is for these reasons that, after considerable deliberation, the Committee came to the view that the embargo should be lifted, but that the industry should be provided with some protection when prices are low. No protection need be provided when the price is at more reasonable levels. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee does not consider that the proposed ad valorem tariff structure is appropriate for this industry. Such tariffs provide very little assistance at low price levels, and burden sugar using industries with high tariffs when the price is high. The Committee canvassed a number of options for achieving an appropriate tariff mechanism. We recommend that a sliding scale tariff come into effect when the value of sugar falls below a certain level. Clearly, this mechanism is designed to apply only when the price is low. It will satisfy both the industry's requirement for some protection at low price levels and the Government's objective of reducing overall protection levels. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considers that there is a need for a forum in which all participants in the industry can be heard. Whatever the situation has been in the past, there will now be a national approach if an Australian sugar industry council is established. This body would operate as an advisory body to government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's final recommendation concerns the adequacy of the present anti-dumping legislation. The Committee received evidence during the inquiry which alleged that the anti-dumping legislation would not adequately protect the sugar industry from dumped imports. Despite apprehension in the industry, only a small number of companies would seek to import products at dumped prices. Nevertheless, advice from the Australian Customs Service confirmed that there may be some difficulties in applying the anti-dumping legislation to sugar imports. The Committee recommends that, if deficiencies are alleged, they should be investigated and changes made to the legislation if necessary. Should there be evidence of undue delay in dealing with dumping complaints, the Committee would be prepared to consider a further reference to investigate the evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to place on record the Committee's appreciation of the cooperation shown by Mr Kerin who made a personal appearance before the Committee. He provided us with a very frank statement of his views on why he considered change to be necessary in the sugar industry. This was most useful to the Committee in its deliberations. I would like to thank all those who made submissions and appeared as witnesses before the Committee. The Committee also received and took up offers of informal assistance from others such as representatives of the Australian Customs Service and I would like to thank these people. </PARA>
<PARA> I also would like to thank those companies and organisations in Mackay and Bundaberg which extended hospitality to the Committee during its visit to those areas. I am pleased to be able to tell the Senate that the Committee members were able to cooperate extremely well with each other in the conduct of this inquiry and are to present a unanimous report. The Committee secretariat, who had to work very hard, deserve our thanks because they had to meet a Senate deadline. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the mover of the original motion to refer this matter, lifting the embargo on sugar and its results, to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and as a senator from Queensland, where most Australian sugar is produced, I would like to put on record, on behalf of the sugarcane farmers and the millers of Queensland, our sincere thanks to the Committee-the coalition senators, Senator Archer, Senator Peter Baume and Senator Brownhill; the Labor senators, Senator Childs, Senator Burns, Senator Devereux and Senator McKiernan, and the Australian Democrat senator, Senator Coulter-for the support they have shown the Australian sugar industry. The 7,000 Australian sugarcane growers and the unionists who work in the sugar mills may believe that this report does not go as far as they want it to go but they will certainly recognise that their jobs are protected and that the industry has a future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am pleased that the Senate Committee recognised the problems that would affect the industry if the price of sugar collapsed as it did in 1985. I have said in the Senate on a number of occasions that if the price of sugar collapsed to where it was in 1985, around 3c to 4c a pound, that would set the benchmark that would be paid to the Australian sugar producers. I had some difficulty getting that argument across to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). He said to me that there would be no way the sugar industry would lose one-third of its sales. The point I was trying to make to Mr Kerin-obviously the Committee picked it up-was that sales would not be influenced by imported sugar. The refiners would say to the millers, `We can import sugar at 3c to 4c a pound, plus a bit of freight, and that is what we will pay you'. That is what would become the domestic price of Australian sugar. It would have happened had the Committee recognised that and recommended the introduction of what I would call an inverted tariff-as the price goes down, the tariff cuts in at around 11c a pound. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we have an industry that has some hope and does not have to worry as much about markets being corrupted for one of the most corrupted and heavily subsidised commodities in the world. Some of the Third World countries produce sugar and are almost prepared to give it away to get hard American currency and hard Australian currency. They will take anything for it. It has to be recognised that over the last 10 years the Australian sugar industry has subsidised the Australian domestic price of sugar by many millions of dollars. In the good times when it could have sold its sugar overseas at much higher prices it did not. It charged the Australian consumer probably 30 per cent to 50 per cent less than what it could have got overseas. When the boot is on the other foot, corruption is rife and Australia gets caught between the two huge giants-the European Economic Community and America-we will find that if the price of sugar falls below a certain level, then the industry has some protection. Once again, I take the opportunity of thanking honourable senators-Labor, Liberal, National and those from the Australian Democrats-for the support that they have given to the industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report entitled Assistance for the Sugar Industry is very important for the sugar industry in Queensland. Those people who are interested in various rural products in Australia would find a great deal of worth in the report. It is not a long report, but it has a very good introduction regarding the place of sugar in Australia and it has made some very succinct and interesting points. For example, sugar is the second commodity of importance to Australia after wheat. Page 10 of the report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . each nation intervenes directly in its domestic sweetener market and most regulate both producer and consumer prices. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the regulation of the industry in Australia is nothing unusual; every other country does it. By simply removing the tariff and letting the price ride the Government was attempting to say, `We are holier than thou with regard to the types of support provided across the board'. That may all be very well in the range of commodities that have a reasonably stable price, but sugar has a massively fluctuating price. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that there is an even more important point to make on behalf of the sugar industry, and that concerns, as the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology points out on pages 14 and 15, the effect of the domestic sugar price agreement. The report says, and I think this is one of the most interesting facts, that in the period 1970 to 1986 the industry subsidised the consumer to the extent of $96m. I think it is worth remembering when we talk about assistance to the sugar industry that in the period 1970 to 1986 it was a negative transfer; there was not any assistance to the sugar industry, indeed the sugar industry forsook the $96m that it could have received from world prices which prevailed in that period and instead took the lower domestic sugar price. When people bandy around the type of support that is provided to the various rural industries in this country, let us exempt the sugar industry from that. It has not been supported by the consumer, instead it has supported the consumer by way of having sugar prices lower than the world average to the tune of $96m. I therefore think that it has a very strong claim on the community in general with regard to the types of measures that are put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's recommendations are interesting, particularly option O with regard to the sliding scale tariff. Obviously that proposition has the unanimous support of the Committee. I think that is interesting, and as a proposition it would seem to recommend itself across the board. I have not had a chance to read the entire report, I have only read the recommendations. I would like to take a little longer to look at the implications of the sliding scale tariff before I commit myself to it. On the first reading it would at least seem to be a satisfactory resolution to the problem. It is not one which I would have preferred, but I think in the context that one's preferences are not always available that it may very well be that the Committee's recommendations are certainly the next best option and at least they provide a reasonably secure future in the immediate short term for the industry in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. I would like to commence my contribution by thanking those members of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) whose support and confidence have resulted in my election to the Senate. Since late 1980 I served the ALP in a full time capacity as Assistant General Secretary of its New South Wales Branch. Many claim that machine politics in the New South Wales Branch of the ALP is as tough as anywhere in the world. I think after my experience over the past 10 years that I am in a very good position to pass judgment on that assessment. I say only this: it was tough at times, but it would have been very tough, if not impossible, to survive during the difficult periods without the support and resolve of my colleagues on the Left of the New South Wales ALP. I must also say that in large measure I enjoyed my period as an officer of the Labor Party. It was a privilege to be directly involved in Federal Labor's successful campaigns of 1983, 1984 and 1987 and State Labor's winning campaigns of 1981 and 1984.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is often forgotten that the electorate of New South Wales is one of the largest electorates in the democratic world. In terms of providing constituency representation, I suspect that only senators from the more populous States of the United States of America have larger electorates. The Senate has provided an alternative form of constituency representation for people who otherwise would never have had the opportunity to approach a parliamentarian of their own political persuasion. I hope to join my other Labor Senate colleagues in New South Wales in providing ALP supporters in Liberal Party and National Party lower House seats with active and sympathetic representation. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish to place on record my thanks to my family for the sacrifices that they have made over the years and no doubt will make in the future. My wife, Sandra Nori, who is the member for McKell in the New South Wales Parliament, and particularly my two children, Bonnie and Lachlan, have often borne the brunt of my political involvement. I can only hope that in the years to come my children will believe that I was worthy of the sacrifices that they have made. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to the Senate as a result of the resignation of Arthur Gietzelt. I take this opportunity to pay a personal tribute to Arthur's public service over the years. Arthur was a councillor on the Sutherland Shire Council, situated in the south of Sydney, from 1956 until 1971 and served as its president for nine years. Those years of Arthur's leadership in Sutherland shire were crucial to making the area what it is today. Indeed, Arthur himself has often said that he believes his period in local government was the most productive and satisfying of his political career. </PARA>
<PARA> During his presidency, Arthur developed an area with little or no local infrastructure into a well serviced region. He stopped high-rise development around Cronulla beach and Caringbah. He made the council efficient and accountable. He never shied away from using his position as shire president to highlight wider causes such as the anti-apartheid and peace movements. He was first in Australia to ban South African competitors from a national sporting event, a surf-lifesaving carnival at Cronulla, and he led Vietnam moratorium marches in Sutherland shire. </PARA>
<PARA> Arthur's principled position on many issues earned him his enemies. During the early morning of Sunday 7 March 1971, the senator-elect and his wife, Dawn, were blasted from their sleep by an explosion which demolished the front walls of their house and left gaping holes in the roof above their heads. The force of the explosion blew out windows of surrounding homes and it was heard up to 10 kilometres away. Someone had planted 17 sticks of gelignite on the steps of the Gietzelt family home. The attack represented one of the thankfully rare acts of political terrorism in our country. It was the first bomb attack perpetrated on anyone in Australia in peacetime. In recent political history it would rank with the attack on Arthur Calwell in 1966 and the bashings of Peter Baldwin and Jim Cairns in their homes. With the support of his family, Arthur showed a special kind of courage to recover from the trauma of March 1971 to continue to fight publicly for his political beliefs. </PARA>
<PARA> The highlight of Arthur's parliamentary career was his service as Minister for Veterans' Affairs, where his achievements were considerable. He oversaw a complete rewriting of veterans' legislation which had been amended nearly 100 times in its 70-year history, culminating in the passing of the Veterans' Entitlements Act in 1986. He ensured that repatriation hospitals were overhauled after years of neglect by previous governments. In 1983, morale in the repatriation hospitals was at rock bottom. Pay was low and the equipment was ancient. Under Arthur's guidance, the hospitals were modernised and revamped, so that an operation in a repatriation hospital no longer became a life-endangering experience. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also appropriate to mention the support that Arthur has received from his wife, Dawn, and three children during the trials and tribulations of a long and often turbulent time in public life. I wish both Arthur and Dawn Gietzelt a long and happy retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to touch briefly on the issue of provision of services to people with disabilities, which has been an area of personal concern and involvement of mine over many years and one that I intend to pursue in the Senate. Prior to my full-time political career, I worked in the field of special education, teaching children with severe disabilities. Certainly giant strides have been made in the provision of services to people with disabilities over the past decade. An example close to my heart was the assumption of responsibility by State governments in Australia for the education of all children, regardless of the nature or degree of their disability. </PARA>
<PARA> The Disability Services Act has also represented a major breakthrough in providing opportunities for people with disabilities in the areas of employment, accommodation and training. As the chairman of a citizen advocacy group established in the inner west of Sydney, as yet unfunded by the Department of Community Services and Health, I can assure the Senate that, though much has been achieved in the disability area, there is still a great deal more to be done. I hope to involve myself in the task of bringing these issues to the attention of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make some comments now about my own State, New South Wales. On 19 March 1988 we saw the election in New South Wales of a coalition government, the first in New South Wales for 12 years and the first Liberal mainland victory in 14 attempts. Conservative political commentators hailed that victory as the beginning of a conservative resurgence in this country, a resurgence that would begin in New South Wales, carry through to Western Australia and Victoria, and culminate in a Federal coalition victory. It was to be a victory for the New Right, the dry Thatcher-inspired conservatism that dominates the Liberal Party and is now moving to total control. Indeed, the Greiner Government has been touted as the great model for new liberalism in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> John Hyde, the Executive Director of the Australian Institute for Public Policy, said that Mr Greiner's win put dry politics in the Liberal Party on trial for the first time. I would suggest that not only has it been put on trial, it has also been found guilty: found guilty of ripping the heart out of the education system in New South Wales; found guilty of placing decent and affordable housing beyond the reach of ordinary people; found guilty of cutting health services and slashing hospital budgets; found guilty of defrauding the people of New South Wales by promising prior to the New South Wales election that no State government charges would rise by more than the consumer price index and after the election massively increasing a whole range of taxes and charges; and found guilty of abandoning Labor's commitment to environmental protection in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that John Howard is a New South Wales Liberal. Ian Sinclair is a New South Wales National. They are the national leaders of the parties that form government in New South Wales. They, together and alone, are signatories to the Federal coalition's blueprint for government, the Future Directions document. The actions of the Greiner Government provide a very interesting comparison with Future Directions. The reality of Future Directions is for all to see in New South Wales today. There are no future directions in New South Wales. In New South Wales we are going backwards. </PARA>
<PARA> I take, for example, education. Education and training, perhaps more than any other factor, holds the key to Australia's social, cultural and economic well-being. It follows that governments, State and Federal, have the responsibility of improving the quality of our education systems and providing educational opportunities for young Australians. In New South Wales the education system has taken a drubbing since the conservatives took office in March last year and, as would be expected, those attacks have centred on public education, the bete noire of all conservatives. In New South Wales in its first year of office the Greiner Government axed 2,500 teaching positions and 800 ancillary staff from the public system. The consequences of such savage cuts have been increased class sizes and a large increase in the number of composite classes. Almost every public school in the State has lost staff. Fifteen schools will be closed and sold for their real estate value. Swimming classes have suffered major cutbacks. Thirty per cent of public schools have abandoned language classes. The list goes on and on. All these changes add up to one result: a plummeting decline in educational offerings and standards in New South Wales, a decline that increases the pressure on parents to seek alternatives for their children in private education. </PARA>
<PARA> What do the Liberal Party and the National Party of Australia say about education standards in Future Directions? They say:</PARA>
<PARA> Raising educational standards and extending parental influence and choice in the type of education their children receive is our first priority. </PARA>
<PARA>The conservatives' real priorities are clear from their brief stint of government in New South Wales where they have been standards wreckers, not standards raisers. Their notion of giving choice to parents boils down to destroying the public schools system so as to increase the attractiveness of the private system. The whole coalition policy is class-driven. In New South Wales the Greiner Government is deliberately seeking to perpetuate class distinctions by establishing specialist high schools which, at an early age, lock children into streams based on parental aspirations. Often educational achievement relates not to intelligence but to parental aspirations and a child's self-esteem. That is why, for generation after generation, regardless of fees and costs, the children of tertiary educated professional groups tend to follow their parents into universities. It is sometimes only the lack of parental example that prevents the children of working people entering universities in the same proportion. </PARA>
<PARA> A child of 11 or 12 does not know whether he or she wants to become a carpenter or a nuclear physicist. Education should be about delaying life's choices as late as possible. Every child is entitled to an academic core until 15 or 16 years of age which includes exposure to a wide range of experiences and fields of study. Later, they can choose. The New South Wales Government policy is a return to the pre-World War II education system of one school for the ambitious and another for those who are deemed to be ungifted. Unfortunately, Nick Greiner and John Howard are enslaved by the same anti-public system crusade. While Mr Greiner reduces opportunities, Mr Howard would cut funding for the public schools and hand over more to private schools. The same Party, the same plan, the same result. </PARA>
<PARA> Future Directions also provides us with a good insight into the Liberal Party's thinking on the housing issue. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>Most people want to become home-owners but Labor is directing resources to public rented housing and the lifelong dependence on government that brings. . . Our priority will be to assist people to buy their own home rather than to make them dependent on the government. </PARA>
<PARA>Public housing tenants and the homeless really are in the New Right's gun sights. In New South Wales existing public housing tenants are facing an unprecedented squeeze at the hands of the Greiner Government. In April, the rents of many low income tenants were raised by up to 100 per cent. It appears that the Liberals' plan to reduce the huge waiting lists for public housing is to force everybody, except the destitute, into the private rental market. </PARA>
<PARA> What is more, there is a total lack of planning in the New South Wales Government's approach to public housing. Property deals with developers take precedence over well-serviced public housing development. Hundreds of public housing properties in booming areas have been sold in New South Wales with only part of the profits being put into compensatory acquisitions. Where new property is acquired it is almost inevitably badly serviced in terms of transport and amenities. Mr Greiner's massive sell-offs and abandonment of public housing projects have resulted in a significant decrease of public housing stock and increased waiting lists. And then, in a dramatic display of contempt for the needs of tenants in New South Wales, the Government decided to cease funding of all of New South Wales 24 independent tenancy advisory services. As for the homeless, there is nothing in the policies of the Liberals, not even hope. </PARA>
<PARA> The record in health in New South Wales is just as bad. The Future Directions document outlines the conservative agenda for health care in Australia. It is quite straightforward-the destruction of Medicare, coupled with an underfunded public health system and a subsidised private system. We have seen in New South Wales the imposition of a 1.5 per cent cut to the entire health budget, cynically disguised as productivity savings, which has meant $35m less spent on basic health services this year. In total, over 1,000 hospital beds have closed, causing a dramatic increase in waiting lists. These cuts reflect the conservatives' strategy of running down and undermining confidence in our public hospitals, all to satisfy the New Right ideology of a user-pays, private health care system. </PARA>
<PARA> The fundamental theme of Future Directions is support for the family. We are told that the Liberal and National parties put families first. They say that the family is the cornerstone of society. The legacy of the first year of the Greiner Government in New South Wales has shown new liberalism to be unashamedly anti-family. One of the most effective ways to assist families, particularly young families, as a State Government, is to hold State charges and taxes down. </PARA>
<PARA> During the New South Wales election campaign Nick Greiner gave repeated assurances that State charges would not outstrip the consumer price index (CPI). But Mr Greiner's assurances are obviously worth very little, because this is his record: electricity bills up 9.1 per cent for the average home; water rates up 12 per cent and an $80 levy for water pollution; public transport fares up an average 12.5 per cent, with some rising by as much as 100 per cent; gas charges up 10.1 per cent; petrol tax up 3c a litre; car registrations up $26 for the average car, with another $110 increase for Transcover taking effect in July; the cost of a private bed in a public hospital up by 15 per cent; the first-ever TAFE charge of $263 for higher education courses, and a $100 charge for other enrolments. </PARA>
<PARA> The deceit in this is breathtaking. These charges will increase the national CPI by at least 0.4 per cent and the New South Wales CPI by 1.25 per cent. New South Wales currently has the highest inflation rate of any Australian State as a result of State Government charge hikes. And that is not the end of it. Further increases are planned-particularly for public transport fares. All this from a man who before the election said he was pro-family. Now John Howard and Ian Sinclair are making the same noises. Given the Liberals' record in New South Wales, it is not hard to see what would be lurking on the other side of the disaster of a coalition Federal election victory. </PARA>
<PARA> Last month the Treasurer (Mr Keating) released details of tax cuts that would come into effect on 1 July this year. Those cuts represent the largest single act of tax relief in our nation's history. They will provide unprecedented assistance to average wage earners who for years have paid more than their fair share of tax, while many of our corporate high-flyers have evaded their tax responsibilities. The tax cuts will provide assistance to average Australian families-those people who quietly and unpretentiously go about building a better life for themselves and their families. Unfortunately for families living under new liberalism, in New South Wales the benefits of the tax cuts will be significantly reduced. The average New South Wales family will be up to $16 a week, or $850 a year, worse off as a result of higher taxes and charges levied by the manager of New South Wales Incorporated, Premier Greiner. </PARA>
<PARA> Immediately upon gaining office the Greiner Government, directed by the National Party heavies Wal Murray and Ian Causley, turned its attention to the environment and set about winding back the many achievements and high environmental protection standards set by Labor in New South Wales. The Greiner Government's record on the environment is absolutely reprehensible. It is typified by the willy-nilly continuation of logging on the North Coast, where attempts to have logging halted by nominating areas for protection under the Wilderness Act have been refused by the Government. Mr Greiner's attempt to downgrade the New South Wales Environmental Planning and Assessment Act, which stipulates that environmental impact statements had to precede logging and were enforceable by law, was only narrowly defeated in the Legislative Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales Government has placed a moratorium on the creation of new national parks. In the existing south-east National Estate areas Mr Greiner has taken the confrontationist approach of ordering logging to commence, whilst a Federal Government forest inventory of possible alternative sites in the area was under way. Premier Greiner has also introduced a new coastal development code, which has been described as `superficial and without teeth' by Milo Dunphy, the Director of the Total Environment Centre. Under this code, a number of un- popular coastal developments have been approved by the Government, despite opposition from local councils and the Department of Environment and Planning. </PARA>
<PARA> The lessons of the Greiner management model are clear: ordinary people in New South Wales are being penalised; families whose children attend public school are copping it; public housing tenants and those in the private rental market are copping it; the people who use public transport are copping it; the sick and the disadvantaged are copping it. I say that New South Wales is the reality of new liberalism. The philosophy of the New South Wales Government of user pays and fee for service has only hurt the battlers. That is Mr Greiner's agenda. It is important to remember that it is the Federal coalition's agenda too. </PARA>
<PARA> However, let us not forget that, compared to his Federal counterparts, Mr Greiner is seen as a bit of a wet or, to put it in his own terms, `warm and dry'. Of course, the Federal Liberals are bone dry. The purge over the last couple of days of Victorian Liberal wets is further evidence of the Federal Liberals' lurch to the right. For those who think that the Greiner Government in New South Wales is bad, a New Right Howard-Sinclair Federal government would be a catastrophe for people dependent on government benefits and services. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1980s it has been fashionable to say that the difference between the major parties has become blurred. After 12 months of Greinerism in New South Wales, it is not so fashionable. The Federal Labor Government does stand for a very clear difference. Labor, federally, believes in adequate public infrastructure. It believes in a wages and taxes policy that looks after the poor and disadvantaged. It believes in equality, and not the perpetuation of advantages and easy fortunes for tax rorters and the shufflers of corporate papers. And it stands as an essential bulwark against the ravages of Mr Greiner and new Liberalism in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I should like to thank the officers and staff of the Senate for all their assistance over the past few weeks, as well as those senators who have helped me. It is a great honour to represent the Australian Labor Party in the Senate. I am committed to doing my best for my Party and fighting for social justice for the people I represent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the debate on the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill last week I stated that I wished to address my remarks in particular to part 4 of the Bill, concerning amendments to the Australian Centennial Roads Development Act 1988, and to part 2, concerning amendments to the Air Navigation (Charges) Act 1952. At this point I should like to focus on the Government's approach to some areas of road funding and the administration of aviation policy in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should like to begin with an issue that is of daily concern and of growing urgency in the Australian community-that is, the appalling state of our roads and the absolute neglect by this Government in relation to adequate levels of road funding. Road funding is becoming increasingly critical to Australia as the consequences of the current Government cutbacks become more and more apparent. These consequences do not show up in the short term; they occur progressively as a result of lower maintenance standards and an inability to increase the capacity of the road system to meet growing demand. Ultimately, they are producing higher vehicle operating costs, less efficient industries, and more road deaths and injuries. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the roads which support the industries that generate our nation's wealth. The road network is vital to all Australians. Indeed, it is a vital basis for our economy. Road funding should reflect this, and it deserves our support just as much as those industries generating our country's wealth and export earnings. Unprecedented publicity campaigns by the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland (RACQ) and the Queensland Local Government Association show the seriousness of the situation at grassroots level. What has resulted is a major discrepancy in our road system. There are good national highways, but when one drives off those highways onto arterial roads, all that one gets are pot-holed surfaces and, many times, roads that have returned to dirt, instead of bitumen, because councils cannot afford the upkeep. Indeed, on 2 May, in the Senate, the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) said:</PARA>
<PARA>I think that anyone who is reasonably familiar with roads around Australia will know that the condition of roads has never been better than it is now. </PARA>
<PARA>I wonder whether he has travelled on any roads other than highways or, perhaps, the lovely roads that we see around Canberra, which are a real pleasure to drive on. Maybe the Labor Government in Western Australia has done better for funding than the Queensland National Party Government has. Perhaps those are some of the answers to that statement of the Minister, with which, of course, I fail to agree. </PARA>
<PARA> Local authorities are naturally very concerned about the Government's refusal to acknowledge that insufficient funding has become a gigantic problem. In particular, cuts have had a major impact in country areas. It has become impossible to keep up with the demand for new and improved roads to cater for the needs of the transport industry and the individual motorist. Some months ago the RACQ undertook a State-wide survey of roads and found that country roads are so rough that motorists are often forced to drive on the shoulder rather than on the pot-holed bitumen. It found that many roads become impassable when it rains-we have certainly had plenty of rain in Queensland recently, so we realise that that is true-and that they are deteriorating more rapidly than city and shire councils can repair them. </PARA>
<PARA> Existing networks are rapidly falling into disrepair because of the decline in maintenance allocations. The transport industry and the private motorist have been forced to bear the financial burden of increased maintenance and operating costs brought about by declining standards of road maintenance. The high cost of wear and tear on transport vehicles is then being passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. </PARA>
<PARA> A safe, reliable road network is of fundamental importance to our nation's economy. Poor roads only serve to isolate communities, increase fuel consumption, damage vehicles, and increase the cost of goods and services. This is a highly ridiculous situation. Australia is such a vast country, with much of the export and financial income being created in rural areas. What has happened is that more than half the money spent by motorists on petrol goes to the Federal Government. Indeed, for every litre of petrol or diesel purchased, the Government takes about 22.39c in tax. I received some information the other day which stated that that amounted to about $15 in tax every time one filled an average sized car, based on a 65-litre tank for a Ford Falcon or a Holden Commodore. Of that $15 only 4.95c was spent on roads. The RACQ has been very concerned. I sometimes wonder whether the Government realises how large a State Queensland is and that vast lengths of road have to be maintained. Motorists paid $6,500m to the Federal Government in fuel taxes last year. That was the third largest source of revenue to the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say to the Minister at the table, Senator Tate, that Tasmania is a neat little State which does not have as many roads as does Queensland. It certainly does not have the long length of roads which we have in my State. This is something we need to take into consideration. The amount of money being paid to the Federal Government in taxes has certainly placed a greater financial strain on local and State authorities struggling to cope with rising costs. It is a fact that there have been reductions in real expenditure on road funding by Canberra every year that this Government has been in office. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fact that the Australian bicentennial roads development program, as it was, was sabotaged, particularly with regard to increases in the expenditure under that program. This Government diverted the increase in the initial 2c collection as adjusted by indexation and put it into Consolidated Revenue rather than into the money to be used on roads. I believe that if the Government had put the indexed amount into road funding we would not be having so many complaints from the RACQ, from local authorities and indeed from people who drive on the roads. Eventually, the Government repealed the Australian bicentennial roads development legislation. To be fair and balanced, the Government then brought in the Australian centennial roads development, or ACRD, program and the Australian land transport program. But that was a smokescreen. The reality of the situation is that road funding has been reduced again and again at the Federal level. The simple fact is that today road funding, under this Federal Government, totals $1,205m. When the Labor Government took office in 1983, road funding was about $1,250m. So in real dollar terms, road funding has deteriorated to the tune of 30 to 40 per cent. In actual dollar terms, it has dropped by about $50m in six years. That we have had a deterioration in road funding under this Government cannot be argued; that fact cannot be denied. </PARA>
<PARA> The unprecedented publicity campaigns by the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland and the Queensland Local Government Association show the seriousness of the situation at a grassroots level. I have had a number of articles sent to me about the state of the roads in rural Queensland. One of them says:</PARA>
<PARA>Lack of road funding is an insult to every travelling motorist. It is an insult to our intelligence to get so little back from our fuel tax for our roads. </PARA>
<PARA>Another quote which I have says:</PARA>
<PARA>It is unfair that people in the most productive areas of Australia have to put up with deteriorating roads while money for roads is lavished on Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA>I add another quote:</PARA>
<PARA>Australian motorists have been duped. They pay high fuel taxes with only a small percentage being returned to road funding. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, the priorities of this Government are questionable, to say the least. As fewer road works are commenced, fewer jobs become available in the areas of road construction and maintenance. This has had a particularly detrimental effect on employment opportunities in many provincial and rural centres. For every $1m spent on roads, about 60 jobs are created. Therefore, for every $100m spent on roads unemployment benefit payments could drop by $38m. Recent studies have shown that roads carry 97 per cent of all passenger journeys, 77 per cent of all freight, 83 per cent of all domestic tourist journeys and 43 per cent of overseas tourist journeys between capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of this Bill relates to aviation issues. If honourable senators think the Government's record on road funding is bad, they should look at its record on aviation. Aviation in this country is appalling. Tourism and air travel in Australia is booming. Our airports are stretched to their limits. They are at capacity, putting increasing pressure on safety standards. The Government's attitude towards the pressures being experienced at our airports is unrealistic and is stifling tourist growth. I must say I am very pleased indeed that in Queensland the Government is starting to move towards making a new international airport facility. However, it has been a long time coming. It has certainly been promised for a long time and it will take quite a long time to be built. In the meantime, we have lots and lots of tourists coming into Queensland. When Sydney has problems, more often than not it diverts the aircraft to Brisbane. Some, of course, are diverted to Melbourne. The airport facility in Brisbane is finding it very difficult to handle all the people and tourists coming in. </PARA>
<PARA> For nearly six years the Federal Government has ignored the needs of aviation and has refused to invest for the future growth of the industry and the safety of air travellers. Aviation traffic will continue to grow and we will continue to need greater capacity. Last year more than two million tourists visited Australia and our airports only just managed to cope. By the end of the 1990s, we will have five to seven million tourists a year. Without massive investment, I fail to see how we will cope. Australia's economic position demands that we encourage tourist growth. We need it for our economic survival. Without good and safe aircraft facilities, our international reputation will suffer and our popularity as a tourist destination will fall. </PARA>
<PARA> Actions by the air traffic controllers in Sydney do nothing to increase our popularity as a tourist resort. Indeed, many people who have been stranded at Sydney Airport because of lightning stoppages there have rather unpleasant thoughts of the air traffic controllers. Last Friday night I experienced a lightning strike of air traffic controllers with my colleague, Senator MacGibbon, who is in the chamber at the present time. We had landed in Sydney at a quarter to six and were faced with the announcement that the airport was closed. The air traffic controllers did not give very much notice that they were going to go on strike. That was a very unfortunate happening. It was not only Senator MacGibbon and I who struck trouble. I spoke to a lady who said, `I am trying to get to Canberra, but I will have to sit in the airport all night'. I am sure she would not be thinking too kindly of them either. When I told an Australian Airlines receptionist that it was the first time such an incident had happened to me, she shook hands with me and said, `Congratulations. You must be one of the ones who have had it happen to you only once. I am sure there are many people who have had it happen more than that'. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the reason for these lightning stoppages, this upsetting of travel arrangements of so many Australians and so many tourists? Is it the lack of staff? Is it the lack of training? Senator Calvert spoke to me a little earlier and said that it took five years to train an air traffic controller. Training of controllers has just commenced in Launceston in Tasmania. It will be a long time before those people are able to take up jobs as air traffic controllers. I wonder whether the Government is doing anything to try perhaps to get some air traffic controllers in from overseas. I suppose that that would be costly but, nevertheless, it is obvious to all travellers that more air traffic controllers are needed so that, if one of them becomes ill, at least he can be replaced and all air movements in and out of Sydney do not have to cease. Actually, air movements in and out of Sydney upset air movements in the other States as well. An alternative would be to declare the work of air traffic controllers an essential service. Perhaps if that were done we would not have in the aviation industry the terrible problems that have been occurring with such amazing regularity in Sydney recently, with resultant disruption to the travel plans of Australian and overseas tourists and business people alike. </PARA>
<PARA> In my own State of Queensland, two of the most popular tourist destinations would be the Gold Coast and Cairns in the far north. However, Coolangatta and Cairns airports, which service these two centres, are being pushed to their fullest capacities. It is incredible that the Federal Government and probably now the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) have allowed airports such as these to develop to such an extent without the provision of radar, so that lives are at risk. Coolangatta shifts about 250 aircraft a day, about the same as Perth and Adelaide which both have radar, and Cairns shifts about 300 aircraft a day. Air control at Cairns airport is particularly difficult because of the city's tropical weather and the fact that it is bordered by mountains. Although the Civil Aviation Authority has given an undertaking to install radar and increase the number of air traffic controllers at Cairns airport by mid-1990-yes, next year, which is well over 12 months ahead-who knows what might happen in the interim. Millions of dollars are being lost to the Federal Government in airport fees and from the tourist industry because the airports cannot cope with the aircraft that the airlines want to land at these places. </PARA>
<PARA> It is about time the Government indulged in some forward planning in the transport industry. The bandaid approach to problems as they arise is not good enough. The Government has an obligation that extends beyond collecting taxes and then adopting a patchwork approach to the transport industry. It needs to ensure that all Australians are served by the highest standard transport system, whether that be by road, rail, sea or air. If the Government is really serious about making industry more efficient, improving air and road safety and easing congestion, it has no option but to recognise problems long before they arise-and that applies also to the air traffic controllers-and act now to create the right framework for Australia to move into the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the Opposition amendment to the second reading motion which says:</PARA>
<PARA>-but the Senate is of the opinion that the Government should:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) reverse its policy of cutting road funding, recognize the significance of roads to the Australian economy and community and return more than 4.95 cents per litre of the 22.39 cents per litre fuel excise to road funding; and</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Anybody who has listened to the debate on the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, not only today but also on the earlier occasion, could not fail to understand the concern in the Senate at the parlous state of Australia's transport system during the six or seven years of total neglect of the Labor Government. I do not intend to go through this omnibus Bill in detail because most of the points have been more than competently and eloquently covered by my colleagues. Before moving on to one or two points, I should like to make a few general remarks about transport. Transport occupies a disproportionately important place in the Australian community and the Australian economy. We are a very large country with a low density population and we must have efficient transport. We do not have efficient transport despite the opportunities that exist through modern technology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now turn to our various modes of transport. Going back to what has been said by earlier speakers in this debate, I support what Senator Sanders said about our not having an efficient transport system. That is not to say that some parts of the Australian system are not world leaders, that they are not very efficient. But the aggregate position of transport in Australia is not good. As Senator Bjelke-Petersen was saying, the importance of that lies in that it has an impact on all the costs in the country. It affects the standard of living of everyone in the country because it increases the cost of living. Inefficient transport means higher transport costs. That means that people have to pay a little more or a great deal more than they should for everything they buy. It also means that the cost of production of everything in the country, which is of particular importance to the export trade, suffers penalties from the increased costs arising from inefficient transport. Inadequate transport flows right through the whole of the Australian economic picture. </PARA>
<PARA> In a way, it has got worse because, in the past 15 or 20 years, we have seen a great concentration of manufacturing and retailing resources in Australia. Small manufacturers in towns, particularly provincial towns, have gone out of business because they have been bought by a company in the capital city. Ultimately, the company in the capital city has been bought by a larger company in Sydney or Melbourne, so we have tended to get a concentration in the production of goods at fewer and fewer points, which means that the cost of distribution of goods throughout Australia has increased. Inevitably when that happens the transport component in the price of goods increases also. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia really lives round the coast. Apart from Alice Springs and Mount Isa there is nothing of any size in the centre. It is logical that Australia should have a good shipping trade. When they developed this country, our forebears had a very virile and efficient shipping service around the coast. There is still a place for that because a good deal of the goods that move round Australia are not time dependent. Time is not critical when they move from one point to another. It does not matter whether simple commodities, such as groceries, are sent overnight between capital cities by train or by semitrailer. It could well take a week to deliver a carton of cornflakes from Sydney to Lismore without affecting the quality. It is cheaper to move goods by sea provided the present technology is used. Historically that is the way this country developed. We need to go back only about 30 years to when Australia had a flourishing coastal trade. We had large bulk iron ore carriers, not as large as they are today, travelling from Yampi Sound to the steelworks on the east coast, and we had the colliers, and a great infrastructure of small coasters, 300 tonnes or even smaller, and a large number of ships of 500 to 1,500 tonnes trading between the river ports, particularly along the east coast. That trade disappeared because the State and Federal governments of the day failed to exercise, in the interests of the community, the authority that they had. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two reasons why the coastal shipping trade failed in Australia. First of all, it was the onslaught of the State-run railways, which were as grossly inefficient then as they are today. I know that in my own State of Queensland the Australasian United Steam Navigation Co. Ltd, Howard Smith Ltd and the Adelaide Steamship Co. Ltd, but particularly AUSN and Howard Smith which traded up and down the Queensland coast, were driven out of business by the Queensland railways coming in with subsidised contracts to move timber and general cargo up and down the coast at rates that were not profitable to the railways but certainly were grossly unprofitable for the shipping lines. As the shipping lines were private, had to pay a dividend and could not accumulate losses and maintain their trading position, they were gradually forced out and disappeared. Once the ships disappeared, the railways could set their own rates, having a monopoly on the trade, and they proceeded with even more inefficiency than they had proceeded with formerly. That is the sad state that we have today. We have no efficient State railways in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The other factor which beat the coastal shipping trade was the wild, unreasonable practices followed by the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia on the one hand and the Seamen's Union of Australian on another. I am probably one of the very few people in this Parliament who have actually worked on the wharves in Australia, lumping cargo with a cargo hook in one hand and losing a lot of perspiration. I have worked as a deckhand and as a crew member on freighters. To annoy members of the Australian Labor Party I will say that I did both of those jobs without either a union ticket or being paid for it. I did it for the experience when I was a student. It gave me an insight into the gross inefficiencies which existed about 30 years ago on the Australian waterfront and which, sadly, are as much there today as they were in those times. The combination of the State railways and the union movement killed the shipping trade. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now time we went back and in the national interest re-established an efficient coastal shipping service. It can be done. With containerisation we can move around the coast a great number of goods and general cargoes which are not time dependent in delivery. With the modern technical control systems on ships, we could have crews as small as five on a 500-tonne freighter running around the coastal ports with containerised cargo without any difficulty at all. The whole of the Australian community would benefit from that. </PARA>
<PARA> We move a great deal of bulk freight-iron ore, coal and alumina-around the coast. In the last decade there has been some progress towards lower manning strengths. Manning strengths on ships have come down very considerably. With a bit of good will and care, those manning strengths can go lower still. I hope that they will, because we must do that to maintain efficient coal, iron and aluminium smelting industries in this country. It is in the scale below that, that is, in coastal shipping, that there are considerable advances to be made in the Australian transport scene. </PARA>
<PARA> The next big carrier in Australia is the State government railways. It is heartening to see that the New South Wales Liberal Government has made a major investigation into the inefficiencies in its service. I am a great believer in rail traffic because it costs less to move by rail than it does to move by road. Admittedly, rail lacks flexibility, but it is still a good way to move bulk cargoes and move them with speed. It amuses me that we talk about cost recovery, user pays and 100 per cent cost recovery for aviation, but this Government and its predecessors have been quite happy to live with the situation where we lose hundreds, if not thousands, of millions of dollars a year in Australia on the railways. The New South Wales Government, for example, loses hundreds of millions of dollars a day on the New South Wales rail system. The Queensland Government would lose a huge amount of money but for the extortionate levy it puts on its coal exporters where it has a captive market, a monopoly situation. If one were to take the coal industry out of Queensland, one would find that the Queensland rail system was losing at a rate every bit comparable to that of the New South Wales railways. There is no reason at all for this. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to rethink the whole of the railway structure. We certainly need a standard gauge railway net throughout the Australian mainland. I remember years ago talking to a former transport Minister when the Fraser Government was in power. He told me that some years previously he had approached the Queensland Government to convert the line from the border up to Townsville to a standard gauge track, instead of the 3 feet 6 inches track, which exists and is in bad shape. That is quite apart from the problem of having a 3 foot 6 inch gauge track. The Queensland government of the day-I am going back at least 15 years-just ridiculed him. It just did not want the money although the money was offered to it to do that. I would hope that those sorts of attitudes have passed now in State governments, because we must have a standard gauge system throughout the whole country. </PARA>
<PARA> With modern technology and modern manning practices, I do not see why the freight services by rail cannot be made to pay. If that can be done, again there is considerable benefit to the Australian community. We certainly need to take the long term view and to put Darwin in the railway net. This was something I was opposed to for years, but the logic of it is inexorable. We have to be able to reach what will be the gateway to the Pacific rim nations. We should have a standard gauge railway introduced in Queensland. We should have a link through Queensland to Darwin through the Townsville-Mount Isa line which serves the Mount Isa mine and is already in reasonably good shape. We should build a line between Alice Springs and Katherine, or wherever that line comes in. It is one of those areas where we have to take the long term view and look 50 years ahead as to where Australia will be. With the development that will take place inevitably in the Pacific rim countries and given the proximity of Darwin to those countries, we have to take a much more realistic view of Darwin's place in the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The third part of the transport component is the road system. Every speaker on this side of the chamber has deplored the huge cutbacks in funding for the road system in Australia. It really is a terrible road system to have in the 1980s, coming into the 1990s. The air traffic controllers strike a couple of weeks ago meant that a group of my colleagues and I were driven from Canberra to Sydney in order to catch an aircraft because for some reason either Canberra Airport staff were on strike or the airport was closed. I was pleasantly surprised at the standard of the Hume Highway between Canberra and Sydney. But in the last recess week I drove down from Brisbane to Newcastle. It was the first time for about 25 years that I had travelled on the New England Highway. I was just appalled at the standard of that road. Most of it is a narrow, two-lane road with a bad surface. It goes through every town and hamlet between Newcastle and the Queensland border. It is in no sense at all a national highway. This is one of the main trunk routes of the country; route 1. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not at all impressed by the fact that members of the Labor Party get up and say that under their Government for the first time we have a continuous bitumen road right around Australia. That takes no recognition of the quality of that road. The road is absolutely inadequate. For the amount of money that the Government has collected in excise on fuel, one simply cannot justify the cost in lives that these poor roads are occasioning to the Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was saying that the various avenues of transport in Australia-sea, rail, road and air-all had to be efficient because of the great national importance of their being so. I discussed some of the shortcomings of the present road system. I made the point that, despite the Government's huge collection of funds from excise each year-running into billions of dollars-the road system in Australia is totally inadequate for a modern society. One of my dreams for Australia is to see a Federal government that has as its objectives the improvement of the standard of living of the Australian people by improving the economic competitiveness of the business sector in Australia and, secondly, the promotion of a decent transport system and also, certainly, something in the way of science and technology in the education system. But we will never get that with a Labor government which is more interested in handing out money to welfare programs and jobs for its friends. Since this Government is coming to the end of its term, hopefully we will not have too long to wait before we have a Liberal government which pursues those goals to the great benefit of all the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point I would make about the road system is that the inadequacies in all our transport systems cost Australia a great deal of money. The inadequacy of the road system costs us money, but it also brings the very great penalty that it costs us lives. Thousands of people a year are killed on the roads in Australia because of bad engineering practices. My argument is that far more people are killed through the bad engineering of those roads than are killed through things like drunken driving and speeding-the two things that provide such a great source of revenue to the State police in the various States of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we have the air system. In Australia we have good airlines, but we have a system which is not good. I am not referring to the inadequacies of the timetables and the inappropriateness of that situation. I am referring to the huge cost of travel. I am one of the very few people on this side of Parliament who voted against the two-airline Bill when it was brought in in the early 1980s. I am referring to the Act under which we presently operate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator would have voted with the government of the day had he been here-unless I had had the time and the patience to enlighten and educate him. My objection to the two-airline Bill at the time-about seven or eight years ago-was based on the fact that it provided no commercial competition between the two major airlines. I might say in passing that it was the Bill that both Trans-Australia Airlines, as it was then, and particularly Sir Peter Abeles, the head of Ansett Airlines of Australia, wanted at the time. So let there be no mistake about that: they got the Act they wanted, just as Sir Peter Abeles got what he wanted with respect to airport leases when Senator Gareth Evans was the Minister for Transport before the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) were created. But that is another story for another time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My objection to the two-airline Act is the fact that it did not provide any realistic commercial competition between the two major airlines, and I said at that time that the end point of that would be the fares in Australia, which were already high, would just go beyond the reach of the average person. That is true today in Australia. Ordinary Australians simply cannot afford to fly from Sydney to Cairns, from Sydney to Perth, or even from Brisbane to Sydney; the fare structure is just so high. I suspect that the great majority of travellers on Australian airlines are people who travel on a business account-people who have to travel in the legitimate pursuit of their business; otherwise they would find some other way. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason why air traffic in Australia is not efficient gets down to over-regulation on the part of the Government. We have too many restrictions. I am not calling for a completely dog-eat-dog or catch-as-catch-can society. There have to be some rules and regulations if we are to maintain safety. But one of the great determinants of safety in the airlines is profitability. Provided airlines can operate profitably, they are prepared to spend the money on the maintenance, do the right things and not cut corners. Although some degree of regulation is always required in aviation, we have far too much regulation in Australia for the whole of the aviation industry, and the great majority of that legislation is totally counter-productive for the interests of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the other problem we have is the union movement. It is not quite as bad and quite as blatant as it is on the waterfront, but we can look at the great unrest among air traffic controllers in Sydney at present and the airline pilots, with their eternal cry for more money-although they have more than kept pace despite the wage restraint of the last few years. I have noted a number of stories circulating through Australia at present to the effect that the airline pilots are ready to go on a major strike in June and bring the country to its knees. I hope they are not true, because the airline pilots have a responsibility to provide an essential service, and I hope they use the normal processes of negotiation. But it is the effects of over-regulation and excessive unionism that have contributed to the high cost of aviation in Australia. And aviation-along with road, rail and sea-has an essential part to play in the Australian economy, so it is in our interests that they are all efficient. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the great blows that the aviation industry has suffered has been the imposition of the Federal Airports Corporation and the Civil Aviation Authority on it by this Government. If we look at the whole of the infrastructure of Australian society with respect to transport we find that, in the six or seven years we have suffered and endured this Labor Government, it has collected tens of billions of dollars, if not hundreds of billions of dollars, in excise and taxes, and it has put very little of it back into the transport system as a whole. Certainly in the aviation field, despite the fact that the Government recovered outgoings to the extent of 108 per cent in the last year before the FAC and the CAA were introduced, very little of it went back into running the system-into building the radar systems and making the necessary improvements to the airports. The Government just socked it off into Consolidated Revenue and spent it on its pet welfare schemes, soft living and things like that that contributed nothing to the economic growth of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The creation of the CAA and the FAC has produced an enormous reaction in the Australian aviation industry. It was for that reason-I do not wish to canvass what might be the findings of the Senate Committee-that the Senate last year, at the behest of a motion of mine, agreed to set up an inquiry into both the organisation and the management of those bodies. Sadly, having started on that inquiry, one has to say that both of these authorities-the Federal Airports Corporation and the CAA-are not managing very well. The Civil Aviation Authority, as the descendant of the old Department of Aviation, at least has some glimmer of understanding of what the aviation community is about, even if it has a limited understanding of the realities of the commercial world. The Federal Airports Corporation, in contradiction, has no understanding-not even the faintest glimmer of understanding-of what the aviation industry is about, and it has a parallel ignorance about the commercial world. </PARA>
<PARA> Both of these bodies are trying to gouge hundreds of millions of dollars out of a very small tax base. The levels of charges by both authorities have increased enormously in the year or so that they have been in operation. For example, rentals to the FAC have commonly gone up by 500, 600 or even 800 per cent-which, even given the fact that we have rampant inflation under Labor, is hardly a fair thing for the limited base that is trying to support it. These bodies really cannot see that they are driving the aviation industry in this country, particularly the general aviation industry, out of existence. But it is not my purpose tonight to debate the shortcomings of those two authorities except to use them as an illustration of the way the Labor Party has failed to manage an essential component of the transport industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition will be moving an amendment that extends the time of payment from 28 to 45 days. The industry standard is between 60 and 90 days. We think it most unreasonable that draconian powers should be given to the aviation authorities to sue for payment after 28 days. The authorities are extraordinarily inefficient. By way of example I cite the case of an account for a sum of about $13.20 owing to the FAC. In the pile of papers I have before me there are 11 statements. The bill has been paid. A letter was written to the Federal Airports Corporation by the person concerned, who was billed about five months ago. That letter was never acknowledged. The letter pointed out that payment had been made, but accounts kept being sent out every month. As I said, the sum involved is $13.20. The short payment is alleged to be $6.60. It was paid when the account was originally presented. But the FAC's accounting system is so poor that it keeps sending out those accounts, each of which, the Federal Airports Corporation admitted to a Senate committee at the start of this week, costs about $30 to $35 to produce. So incompetence in detecting what went wrong over a $6 bill has probably cost the FAC a couple of hundred dollars in accounts which it has mindlessly sent to the person who has written explaining that the bill has already been paid. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is asking us to allow the period for payment under law to be 28 days instead of the industry standard of, as I said, between 60 and 90 days. The Federal Airports Corporation and the Civil Aviation Authority will be able to take a lien on the aircraft owned by the people. It is absolutely absurd to allow them the right to take a lien against an aircraft that certainly would cost at least tens of thousands and maybe hundreds of thousands of dollars, or millions of dollars in the case of corporate aircraft covered by the Business Aircraft Association, when their own accountancy practices are so bad. One only has to talk to people in the aviation industry to realise how widespread slipshod accounting practices are, quite apart from the argument as to whether these rapacious charges to be imposed are justified. It is just not tenable to reduce this payment period to 28 days. No-one in this country now pays his bills in 28 days. So the Opposition will be moving an amendment to the Bill in the committee stage which extends the payment period to a more realistic 45 days. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 covers a wide range of matters. I wish to speak in regard to the amendment to the Australian Centennial Roads Development Act 1988 which is the result of an undertaking given by Senator Gareth Evans during the debate late last year. This undertaking was given essentially to ensure that the Parliament had some right over determination of the level of fuel excise, presently struck at 4.95c per litre. At the time the legislation simply required the determination of the Minister made in writing and published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette. In other words, the Minister of the day is able to dictate the level of road funding in Australia without recourse to the Parliament. Of any government, the present Government is the least likely to deserve the imprimatur for that sort of responsibility. As a result of a commitment given by the Government that it would ultimately introduce amending legislation we now have this Bill before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill provides an opportunity to consider the state of roads in Australia generally. In the minds of so many people, ordinary citizens, people who drive vehicles, local councils and State governments, that is a matter of grave concern. It is an issue essentially because of the abysmal lack of responsibility that this Federal Government has been prepared to demonstrate in maintaining and preserving our road system in Australia. It is not without significance to note that, notwithstanding the promise made by this Government, road funding outlays have been slashed by $450m. That perhaps began with the introduction of the Australian land transport program which promised to guarantee the real value of road funding over its five-year life. In fact, in the second reading speech of the then Minister for Transport Mr Peter Morris, on the Australian Land Transport (Financial Assistance) Bill 1985, he said. </PARA>
<PARA>I regard it and related legislation as one of the most significant transport initiatives to come before Parliament since Federation. </PARA>
<PARA>If Mr Morris considered the legislation as significant, he obviously has a tiny mind. All that is significant about the legislation is that it signified the beginning of further decay in the integrity and responsibility of this Government and the beginning of the decline in road funding. In the very first year of that legislation there was a decline in road funding in real terms simply because of the galloping level of inflation. However, the Government did make a further promise which was that for the balance of the four years to 1990 the funding would be maintained by increasing the amount of excise going in to the Australian Land Transport Trust Fund at a level equivalent to the level of inflation. It was to be automatically adjusted by the consumer price index (CPI). The Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown) said:</PARA>
<PARA>The arrangements incorporate an automatic adjustment to match inflationary movements as measured by the consumer price index. It guarantees the continuity of the greatest road building program in Australia's history. </PARA>
<PARA>The rate of excise was initially 3.55c per litre of motor spirit and diesel fuel at the beginning of 1985-86. It rose through indexation to 3.845c per litre by the end of that period. That amount would have continued to rise had it not been for the fact that the Government introduced legislation deliberately to reduce the rate to 3.61c per litre. Additional legislation was introduced in 1987 to further reduce the allocated rate of excise to 3.241c per litre, to apply from 1 July 1987.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not without significance to note that while this sleight of hand was taking place the Government was creaming off the benefit of the indexation of the 2c per litre which was struck by the Fraser Government when it set up the Australian bicentennial road development levy. If I recall correctly, that levy was indexed in 1983. At the expiration of the program in December last year the levy had risen to 2.909c per litre. As a result of that, the Government was able to attract unto itself an additional $500m in revenue that did not go back into roads. It was not used to maintain or construct new roads and was not allocated for the purpose for which the program was set up; it simply went directly to Consolidated Revenue. The Government's attitude to and its priority of funding for roads cannot in any real way be justified by the state of Australian roads.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Walsh had the audacity to say in the Parliament last week that roads in Australia had never been better. In the face of Senator Walsh's audacious observations, I find it curious that 90 per cent of Australians surveyed have said that there ought to be a greater allocation by the Federal Government of funding for roads. The average life expectancy of a bitumen road is 20 years. Half the bitumen roads in Australia are approaching the 20-year mark. It is of no surprise to us that the Australian people are dissatisfied with the level of funding. They have to put up with the traffic jams and congestion and they also read the daily statistics of road deaths in this country, which I will come to shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that funding of roads is one of the very real uses to which the Government can put Australian taxpayers' money-and one which provides for a strengthening of Australia's economic base. For instance, 80 per cent of Australia's domestic freight is carried by road and 90 per cent of passenger kilometres are travelled by road-that is, over the 860,000 kilometres of our road network. I am reminded that in Western Australia alone we have 29 per cent of the national highway and 20 per cent of the total road network in Australia; yet in a State with one-third of Australia's land mass, producing vastly more than 20 per cent of Australia's exports and with a modest population of 9 per cent of the country's total, we find ourselves receiving a miserable 13.2 per cent of all Federal Government outlays for the purposes of roads. By way of example, I will point to a case where the investment in roads is manifestly demonstrated to contribute significantly to the economy. I remind honourable senators that in the 1960s the Liberal and National Party coalition Government had the foresight, courage and commitment to spend a very modest, but perhaps significant then, amount of $40m on the beef roads in the north of Western Australia. In a very short period a $200m industry was opened up as a result of the foresight of the Liberal Government in Western Australia and the Liberal and National Party coalition Government in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent times we have seen what the opening up of the hinterland and heartland has done for Australia's economy and for the people who live in remote and isolated areas. We could not have those enormous iron ore projects at Tom Price, Newman or Paraburdoo, that Senator McKiernan flies across from time to time on his way somewhere else, that contribute in a very enhancing way to our economy. It is very true of the central wheat belt of Western Australia and the eastern goldfields of Western Australia that their resource potential has been able to be exploited by virtue of the fact that there has been a road system in earlier days, in previous times, which has satisfied demand and allowed for the exploitation of the natural resources of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> For a moment I will turn to one or two other matters that impinge upon poor roads in Australia. I refer, first, to the levels of fatalities. Since 1980 more than 25,000 people have died on our roads. Enough people to make up a complete city have lost their lives in nine short years on our roads. The Department of Transport and Communications in its March 1989 publication on road crash statistics found that there were 2,883 deaths last year. Very nearly 3,000 people lost their lives on Australian roads last year. It is relevant to note that research by the National Roads and Motorists Association (NRMA) traffic and safety department has produced statistics which show that Australia has 2.1 fatalities per 100 million vehicle kilometres compared with 1.5 in the United States and 1.9 in Great Britain. In other words, the numbers of deaths per kilometres travelled in Australia is a great deal more than those in the United States and of the United Kingdom by way of example. I would have thought that under normal circumstances the numbers of deaths on Australia's roads per vehicle kilometres travelled should be significantly fewer, certainly than those of the United Kingdom because of its congestion, population and weather conditions. Very much the same thing could be said of the United States. Yet we find that we top the poll in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> The Automobile Association of Australia has found that substandard roads are a prominent factor in many crashes. Narrow lanes, slippery and broken surfaces, roadside trees and poles, sharp curves, blind corners, soft shoulders and poor signposting contribute to an estimated 30 per cent of all road crashes. NRMA research shows that road funding cut backs are likely to cost the lives of 600 people a year between now and the year 2000. Further, according to the NRMA, road crashes cost the Australian community at least $5.7 billion annually. It is the biggest killer and maimer of our greatest resource-our young people. </PARA>
<PARA> As I look at the figure of $5.7 billion, I am reminded that that is about what the Government collects in excises each year. If my memory serves me correctly it is in the range of $5.7 billion to $6 billion a year. If I am not wrong, only 20 per cent is re-employed in roads-a little over a billion dollars a year is returned to roads. The cruel, harsh, steel-like reality is that this Government makes an economic judgment that we can afford to lose 600 people every single year on our roads because it arbitrarily decides that it will spend as much as it does spend and not a penny more. The fact is that the levels of reductions directly relate to the number of deaths on Australian roads. I would have thought there was one resource in this country that we could not afford to sacrifice in the name of economic management-that is, the lives of our young. This Government that purports and pretends to care in a passionate way for people decides with the stroke of a pen that X number of people will die each year because that is its economic policy. I would have thought that ought to be sobering for anybody, not least of all the voters who will go to the booths at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told by those who deal in these matters that in the period between 1990 and the year 2000 we can expect a 30 per cent to 35 per cent growth in road usage and an anticipated 60 per cent increase in the freight carried on our roads. Nevertheless, we find that because a certain minimum road standard requires funding at one level or another, the onus, responsibility and the direct duty is cast more and more upon the shoulders of local and State governments. Thanks to the April economic statement, untied grants to the States and local government have been reduced by $360m in respect of States and $17.9m in respect of local government. Inevitably and invariably that will cause a shrinking in the capacity of State and local governments to fund local and arterial roads. Local government in Australia is now spending at least $100m a year more than State governments on roads and $300m a year more than the Commonwealth. The Government seems not moved in any way by that fact. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the outset, good roads in a very real and tangible way significantly contribute to the strength of Australia's economic base. It is not without significance to note that the figures produced by the Automobile Association of Australia show that fuel consumption for a large truck rises by 330 per cent on a steep grade and by 60 per cent on gravel. Rough road surfaces increase fuel consumption by 20 per cent and vehicle repair costs by nearly 40 per cent. It is not simply a matter of the Government looking at one side of the ledger and saying that it will reduce funds. There is no balancing factor to be considered on the other side of the ledger. The truth is that when we cut road funds, we increase costs. We increase unit costs of production and reduce our capacity to compete in the world markets. In addition, we drive up the consumer price index. </PARA>
<PARA> I move on to funding. As from 1 January this year we saw the commencement of the new Commonwealth scheme for funding roads with the Australian centennial roads development program, under which a set proportion of fuel excise is allocated to the ACRD trust fund for the maintenance of roads. That proportion, as I said at the outset of my speech, is presently 4.95c per litre, out of a total amount collected of 22.391c per litre. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Calvert for his interjection. This is a drop from the 5.66c per litre returned to roads by the Government last year. I contrast that with 1983-84, which was the last financial year in which road funding was affected by the coalition government's legislation. In that year, 66 per cent of diesel and petrol excise revenue was spent on roads. In other words, the vast bulk of revenue collected from Australian road users was returned for the purpose for which, presumably, it is collected. Now only 21.1 per cent of the petrol excise is allocated to roads. Therefore, each time Australians fill up their cars with petrol, 17.44c per litre goes straight into government coffers. Every time a driver pulls up and turns on a bowser, 17.44c per litre goes straight into the coffers of the avaricious Government, to be spent or wasted on some other crazy, loony project from which there is no benefit or return and, frankly, in which there is certainly no virtue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The projected income from petroleum products excise in 1988-89 is $5.05 billion. In addition, the estimated income from crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas is $1.38m, which makes a total projected petroleum excise of $6.4 billion in 1988-89. I was being kind to the Government when I said that it received somewhere between $5.7 billion and $6 billion. Now that I consult my notes, I see that the Government will receive $6.4 billion from the the poor old crippled taxpayer in 1988-89. Of this amount, funds allocated to roads under the ACRD trust fund are in the vicinity of $1 billion. </PARA>

<PARA> This issue is now of a political nature and, like all good political issues, it comes down to how it is affecting individuals. The vast majority of Australians feel that they are being ripped off, cheated and robbed; that the revenue that is going to government for the purpose of roads is not being used for that purpose, but for other purposes. I have no doubt that at the next election this will be an issue of significance. In consequence, the Government will feel the heat, the blast and the fury of Australian people who are dissatisfied with the way the Government is allocating its funds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The contributions by various Opposition speakers in this debate on the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill suggests two things. The first is that, in line with the speeches that they make on so many other Bills in this place, they have a view that government outlays should be cut, slashed, right across the board. The difficulty is that wherever the opportunity arises they urge more to be spent. They can get away with it until an election campaign. They discovered in the last campaign that it simply was not possible, that ordinary people wake up to that pretty quickly. The acid was put on them: `Tell us where you will cut; tell us what you will spend'. When it was discovered that they could not add up what they would spend and that they could not tell us what they would cut, inevitably they went down in inglorious defeat. Judging from the contributions to this debate, no lesson whatsoever has been learned and they are heading for the same inglorious defeat at the next election.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is illegal to bet on election results, but the honourable senator should see me later. The other thing that is apparent from this debate is that Opposition senators, particularly those who were here during those awful days of the Fraser-Howard Government, simply forget what was done then. The performance of the Hawke Government far exceeds that of the Fraser-Howard Government on the question of road funding. I will elaborate on that for the benefit of the Senate, and Western Australian Opposition senators in particular.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course the Government recognises the significance of road funding to the economy generally. We do not need to be told that it is important, and our actions are testimony to the fact that we believe it is important. The Australian centennial roads development program specifically targets roads that will assist our export and import competing industries under the new national arterials category. The main thing to note is that there is no reason whatsoever for the Government to be ashamed of its record. If one compares the total level of road funding provided by the Hawke Government in the last six Budgets with that provided by the Fraser-Howard Government in a comparable period, the Hawke Government is 21 per cent better in real terms. That should answer all of this rot. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Calvert may be forgiven, as he was not here at the time and is just ignorant. Other honourable senators opposite who were here at the time know the facts and, I am sad to say, simply have not acknowledged them during this debate. The Hawke Government has provided an average of $250m a year more than the previous Fraser-Howard Government for road funding. The amount of fuel excise, which has obviously attracted some attention during this debate, that has been devoted to road spending will increase next financial year in line with the indexation arrangements provided for in the legislation. A matter of interest to be noted is the amount of petroleum taxes devoted to road spending in 1981-88. Senator Calvert will remember 1981-82 as the years when, under the Fraser-Howard Government, the economy was out of control. There was a trio of inflation, interest rates and unemployment, all over 10 per cent. It was an absolute mess when John Howard was Treasurer. In those days 16 per cent of petroleum taxes was devoted to road funding, and that has risen to 19 per cent in 1988-89 under the Hawke Government. It astounds me that these facts have not been acknowledged in any of the speeches from the other side. Obviously we would all like to spend more on road funding-even more than with the great job we have done-but, in line with our commitment to the economy generally, we have recognised the need to cut government outlays and, therefore, we have had to balance priorities. We do not have the luxury of making stupid promises that in the end cannot be kept. Rather, we have tried to be honest with the Australian people and that honesty has been accepted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not propose to go into any great detail about the second part of the Opposition's motion, which concerns the Federal Airports Corporation and the Civil Aviation Authority, and calls upon us to review their activities. The facts are that the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure is already undertaking that task. My understanding is that it is to report by October this year. Given that that review is already being done, one would imagine that at least that section of the Opposition's motion is irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to other points that have been raised during this debate. There has been criticism of the way the Government indexes its funds under its roads programs. Measured against the consumer price index, road funding has been rising faster in recent times, so it is hardly logical to suggest that in some way that is a penalty on the users of roads. In the long term obviously the difference between the two will go up and down. I doubt very much whether anyone can predict with stunning accuracy exactly what will occur in the future. Having said that, I doubt very much whether there will be any real difference. At the moment the non-farm deflator is rising at a slightly faster rate than the CPI. It is not a criticism which I would either accept or be prepared to debate at any length. It is just too silly. </PARA>
<PARA> Much attention has been given during the debate to the Hume Highway and achieving four lanes. It is obvious, particularly to anyone who has driven on the highway recently, that considerable progress has been made. Already 500 kilometres of 815 have been converted to four lanes. That is 61 per cent of the total objective. Obviously the Federal Government's strategy has been the right one-to concentrate on those sections of the highway which have the heaviest traffic. As a result it is estimated now that 80 per cent of vehicle kilometres travelled on the Hume Highway are on four-lane sections. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown) announced a long term strategy for national highways. In New South Wales he has advanced construction of the Cullerin Range deviation at a cost of $79m and the Yass bypass at a cost of $50m. Both of these projects and the Goulburn bypass will commence next year, 1989-90. Major expenditure will be directed initially to the Cullerin Range and the Goulburn bypass, with preconstruction activity on the Yass bypass. The Mittagong bypass, to which Senator Michael Baume was referring, as I recall, in quite hysterical terms on Friday when this was being debated, will be completed in 1991-92, not 1993-94, as he suggested for some strange reason. That is certainly not the case. In Victoria the Hume will be duplicated between Melbourne and Wodonga, and this work will include completion of the Wangaratta bypass at a cost of $93m and the Euroa bypass at a cost of $43m. That will leave the Albury bypass, which will be considered post-1993. If the Hume Highway is to be the centrepiece of any road funding debate, again the Government's record is commendable and I have no difficulty in defending it. </PARA>
<PARA> There have also been a number of references, including one by Senator Crichton-Browne, to road deaths. Obviously, concern for road deaths is not limited to any one section of the Parliament. I would hope it is a concern shared by us all. It is not good enough to lay all the blame for deaths on our roads at the feet of inadequate road funding. Obviously accidents are caused by the interaction of a number of things. The state of the road is one of them. The weather conditions applying at the time are another. One would imagine that perhaps the most important factor that would influence road deaths was the person behind the wheel. That, quite clearly, is a very big problem. No matter now much we spend on roads, if people choose to drive when they are not sober then road deaths will continue at a rate that none of us would like to see. If people continue to ignore the requirement to wear seat belts, death and injury will remain at rates higher than we would like to see. Obviously, what is going to be needed in those cases is a change in community attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable senators take the opportunity to look at the Government's road safety strategy they will see that that is where the effort is being directed. I think that they will have to acknowledge that the runs are on the board in terms of success. The fatality rate in Australia, compared to that in other countries, has shown a dramatic reduction since 1975, with the 1987 figures being the lowest for 24 years. Only this week the New South Wales Minister for Transport, Mr Baird, announced that his State's road toll this year was the lowest for 27 years. Obviously the number of fatalities has gone down, and hopefully that trend will continue. Of course, neither the State governments nor the Federal Government can be complacent about the trend. We will all have to work together to make sure that we change the attitudes of those who continue to place themselves and, unfortunately, innocent people at risk because of the attitude that they take when they get behind the wheel. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to some comments made by Senator Lewis. He suggested that when errors in Telecom Australia's by-law amendments were brought to its notice it chose not to act to correct those errors prospectively. This is simply not the case. The Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, which, I might say, includes as members Senator Stone, Senator Bishop and Senator Patterson-people with whom one would imagine Senator Lewis could manage some contact-picked up some errors in a number of Telecom by-law amendments in early 1988. I doubt very much if this Government needs to worry too much about that, given that the errors dated back to May 1980. The amendments were found to be void as they had not been before the Parliament for the requisite number of days. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom moved to remake those by-laws that had become void as soon as the error was brought to its notice. Telecom was subsequently involved in a lengthy exchange of correspondence with the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances to establish that the remade by-laws were in fact prospective and not retrospective. The Committee allowed these by-law amendments to be made, and the former Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support gave a commitment to introduce validating legislation as soon as possible. The telecommunications part of the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 is in fact a fulfilment of that undertaking. The Bill enables Telecom to make by-laws to correct the errors. These by-laws will be subject to committee scrutiny once again. </PARA>
<PARA> Having covered those points, which I think were the main ones raised during the debate, may I say that the Government rejects the Opposition's amendment. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> Page 2, after clause 4, insert the following new clause:</PARA>
<PARA>Air Navigation Charges</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>``4a. Section 5 of the Principal Act is amended by omitting from subsection (2) `28' and substituting `45'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to point out that the reason that the coalition is moving this amendment is the fact that it believes that the Government has adopted double standards in this matter. It proposes that a new clause be inserted after clause 4, as I have just mentioned. The Government has set out to impose penalties on those operators who do not pay the required charges within 28 days. The situation prior to 1984 was that penalties were only imposed after the expiration of 45 days. We believe that it is unreasonable for this Government, or any other government, to impose standards on others which it cannot itself attain. The Government's attitude of, `We cannot do it but we expect you to do it anyway', is at best difficult to comprehend. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Federal Airways Corporation (FAC) and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) began their operations, certain charges have increased quite dramatically. I know that it is very difficult for those new corporations and authorities which have been charged with cleaning up something which has not been running all that well. For instance, in my own case, my constituents in Tasmania have been very concerned that parking charges at Hobart Airport have gone up from 40c to 80c and are proposed to go up to $3. I know that that is nothing like the costs involved at other airports throughout Australia, but even so it is quite a big percentage increase. Small private operators of airlines have found that their charges have increased dramatically. Although the FAC has only been in operation for 18 months, the Senate is having an inquiry into the operations of both the FAC and the CAA because of some of these increased charges and taxes imposed on operators. </PARA>
<PARA> The main objection we have, as an Opposition, is that the Government is imposing something on small businesses and airlines which it cannot itself carry out. By asking these operators to pay their accounts or to have penalties imposed on their accounts after 28 days, when in the past the period has been 45 days, the Government is being too stringent. The Government, on the one hand, is asking these people to pay their accounts post haste, but on the other hand it has a payment record which is abysmal. One only has to look at the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to see some of the delays in payment that chemists have to put up with. They have been told that the Government will guarantee paying them in 30 days, but in some cases it is 90 days before they receive their payments. The Government is adopting double standards, not just with pharmaceutical benefits. There are plenty of other examples where the Government is lax in paying its accounts. We believe that 45 days is a reasonable period for payment. It is a period which applied under our coalition government and which worked quite well. This seems to be another example of the Government appearing to be hell-bent on getting every dollar it can out of the taxpayer and small business community. For that reason, we propose this amendment, omitting `28' and substituting `45'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I indicated previously in the second reading debate, the Australian Democrats do not support this amendment. The Australian Democrats recognise full well the difficulties of aviation in this country, both of the airlines and of general aviation, as a result of the bureaucratic fumbling over the years which has actually inhibited the development of aviation in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of all the countries on earth, Australia is most dependent on aviation. Over the years, our bureaucrats have done everything they can to stifle aviation in this country. Their motto seems to be, `The only safe aeroplane is an aeroplane in a hangar with the doors welded shut'. They have done everything they can to keep aeroplanes out of the air. They have made everything as difficult as possible for aviation in this country. Because of their political clout, the airlines have generally been able to protect themselves, but general aviation-a collection of small businessmen and individuals-has not been able to protect itself. Under the general catch-cry, or banner, of `safety', the Government has been able to impose charges and regulations almost without any control over activity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague, Senator McLean, agrees. I am sure that Senator Calvert agrees, for that matter. The point is that `the times they are a-changing', as the song goes. Probably the turning point was the bravery of Mr Dick Smith who, a few years ago brought out his book about the aviation `hall of doom', in which he recorded all the instances of deprivation of the industry of its rights by the bureaucracy and the then Department of Aviation. This was followed by the inquiry into the occurrences surrounding the Darling Harbour heliport. For the first time, the bureaucracy was actually found to be increasing the danger of aircraft crashes rather than working on aircraft safety. As Senator Calvert has said, we now have an inquiry before the Senate Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure into the activities of the Federal Airways Corporation (FAC) and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1J4">Senator SANDERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Calvert says, I have been a bush flier and a bush lawyer. I have been a bush pilot in Alaska; I am a flight instructor, a glider tug pilot and a glider instructor. I know my way around the industry and I know the difficulties the industry has been facing, especially under complete cost recovery. It is very unreasonable for the Government to single out the aviation industry to pay for its entire costs. In fact, last year, we were told in a committee hearing that the Government actually recovered 108 per cent of the cost-8 per cent more than the cost of operating the industry. That is cost recovery with a vengance. The country, and the Government specifically, should take a look at aviation as a service to this country, as a benefit to this country, and not try to squeeze every last cent out of it as a revenue gesture. The Government should recognise the industry for what it is-an essential part of the transportation system of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I shall now deal specifically with the amendment. The Government has instituted a policy of 28 days recovery on outstanding debts. The Opposition wishes to amend it to read 45 days recovery. On the face of it, it looks like a good thing. Any time that the operators of aircraft in this country can be given a better break or a better chance to pay their bills over a longer period it is a good thing in general because many operators have been pushed to the wall by exorbitant government charges and regulations. They are really fighting to stay in business, especially the flying school operators and the charter operators. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had consultations with the Government and the Government has convinced me of the benefit of retaining the 28-day system. It is really a commentary on perhaps the inefficiency of the bureaucracy-it is ironic-that the bureaucracy would actually charge more money to collect the debts on a 45-day basis. It is probably best to leave it on a 28-day basis because it would increase costs for the bureaucracy to collect these bills on a 45-day basis. I have been convinced by the bureaucracy that there would be an increase, and it is probably to its own detriment that it has convinced me because that means that it is not being efficient in its own right, and honourable senators can believe it as much as they are sitting here tonight that those costs would be passed on to the industry itself. We would have to pay, the industry would have to pay, all aircraft users would have to pay and all passengers carried by the airlines would have to pay if the recovery period were extended to 45 days. </PARA>
<PARA> For this reason I find that I am forced to oppose this amendment which, on the surface, looks like a reasonable amendment to help the aircraft industry. In fact, because of the way the charges are collected, it would actually cost the industry more and the increase would be passed on. For those reasons I cannot support the Opposition's amendment. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(9.13)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with great interest to what my learned colleague had to say about the collection of fees. I am glad that he spoke to the Government. Perhaps now if I speak to him, having an erudite and informed mind, he might see that there is another side to the equation. Far from increasing the cost to the industry by proposing that the accepted commercial practices of Australia be followed, it may well act as a factor in reducing the costs to an already acutely overburdened industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us not lose sight of the fact that commercial aviation in Australia at any level is not a lucrative pastime. No-one in his right mind would buy aircraft or maintenance facilities and try to earn a living from it. Anyone who looks at the annual reports of Qantas Airways Ltd will find that the return on capital invested is very low. It is about one-third or one-quarter of the return that any other commercial enterprise would produce. Anyone who looks at the charter operators and flying school operators-and thousands of Australians are trying to make a living out of such operations-will find that their return on capital is something of the order of 1 per cent or 2 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> It is a desperately difficult business to make a living out of and it is being made much worse by the financial irresponsibility of the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). As I said in my speech, neither of those bodies has the first idea about the realities of the commercial world. I said that the CAA had a vague idea of what the aviation industry was about but the FAC did not have the slightest idea. I am sorry that I will not live long enough to see the FAC learn the first elements of that industry because it is quite beyond it. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me put this into perspective. I can remember when there was no charge to register an aircraft in Australia, or pay an air navigation charge. I can remember when charges came in. It is a long time ago. The charges were then subjected to rises of about 15 per cent per annum to pay for the cost of the airway services and the airports. </PARA>
<PARA> Some years ago the Government commissioned Mr Bosch to make an inquiry into the whole funding of the aviation industry in Australia. The Bosch Independent Inquiry into Aviation Cost Recovery reported that, if the Government corrected the gross inefficiencies in the Department of Civil Aviation, as it was then administering the aviation arena, it would be permissible and practicable for the industry to go to 100 per cent cost recovery in 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The tacit assumption, as Senator Sanders says, is that we should have cost recovery and user pays for aviation. I do not mind that being done, but if it is done I, as an aircraft owner, want a rebate on my personal income tax because I pay personal income tax for a whole range of services that the Government sets out to provide to me. If the Government is to double tax me I want a rebate on that double tax, and so does everyone else in the aviation industry. That is one argument about user pays. </PARA>
<PARA> The second argument is that no-one has control over the user pays doctrine. As an aircraft owner and operator, I cannot say that I do not want a particular service, yet I am subject to the most extravagant overprescription and, without any recourse at all, I am required to pay. I have no formal channel through which I can register my protests. There is no industry channel or pathway through which I can tell the FAC or the CAA what I want. Even if I could, they would not listen, so I suppose it is all rather pointless. Surely, if there is to be a user pays concept, I am entitled to be heard and to say what I want before I am charged for it. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point is that it is a very one-eyed philosophy. We have State railways which lose millions and millions of dollars a day and no government, irrespective of its political persuasion, worries about that because it is seen that there is a community benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a community benefit in aviation. Where would we be with our present huge balance of payments deficit if we did not have the tourists coming into this country? The little old widow who lives in the suburbs of Sydney or Melbourne might never see a tourist, but the economic impact of the trade in tourism benefits her in indirect ways. There are thousands of examples of the community deriving a benefit from aviation, yet this Government, as did its Labor predecessor, the Whitlam Government, clings violently to the concept that anybody who flies an aeroplane or flies in one has to pay 100 per cent of the cost. </PARA>
<PARA> When I am speaking about 100 per cent of the cost, let me go back to Mr Bosch because he said that, if the inefficiencies in the industry are cleaned up, it is possible to go to 100 per cent cost recovery in 10 years. What happened? The Labor Party in two years went to 108 per cent of outlays recovered. There is no argument about this. I have heard the FAC and the CAA argue that really the accounting system was a bit rocky, but the Budget statements outline quite accurately what moneys the Government attributed to or spent on the aviation industry. In the last year-about two years before the FAC and the CAA were created-the Government recovered 108 per cent of the amount it spent and the galling part of it was that the Government did not correct any of the inefficiencies in the old Department of Aviation. In fact it compounded them. We have had these monsters, the FAC and the CAA, created. They are quite out of control and answerable to no-one. That is why we have a Senate inquiry looking into them. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what is happening with these people for whom Senator Sanders thinks a 28-day recovery period is appropriate. They are both commercially incompetent bodies. When I was speaking earlier I had a file from one of the clients of the FAC. The amount was $13.20. The file is about half an inch thick. The person paid the sum of $13.20 when the bill was presented. The FAC has kept on billing him. When the first account came in after payment this person wrote to the FAC explaining that the bill had been paid and put a photocopy of the statement with the cheque of payment on it. That was in December of last year. The letter has never been acknowledged by the FAC. The person involved keeps getting monthly statements saying that his account is in arrears. The FAC gave evidence to the Senate Committee on Monday that it cost it about $30 to $35 to send out an account. Over a sum of $6.60 which is in dispute, it expended $200 to $300 in its bookkeeping practices. It will not even acknowledge the letter that it has been given. </PARA>
<PARA> If one goes around the aviation industry one will not find a hundred examples of this sort of commercial practice by the FAC and CAA; one will find thousands. I have in my files letters from people. Indeed, the Senate Committee has received letters showing where the FAC and the CAA, in particular, have remitted charges. In other words they have billed people in the industry for charges. When they have been challenged they have cut and run after a lengthy dispute. They have said, `No, we recognise that those charges are invalid'. They may well cut and run on those issues because some of the charges that have been made by both the FAC and the CAA are illegal; they will not stand up in court. </PARA>
<PARA> I inform Senator Sanders that it is against this background of administrative incompetence that we have to judge the proposition that the time for payment be extended beyond 28 days. I am sure, as an innately fair and just person, Senator Sanders would realise that there are these ogres out to take a lien over one's aircraft if one does not pay a $5 account within 28 days. The opportunity of granting a 45-day period during which protests can be made is really a reasonable move to make. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, one has to look at it in the light of accepted business and commercial practice in Australia. No-one now pays accounts within 28 days. I would be about the only guy, perhaps besides Senator Sanders, in the country who does. I can assure Senator Sanders that the business community does not settle an account in 28 days. The best terms of payment one can get with big accounts is 60 days. Many accounts are on a 90-day basis and some are even on a 120-day basis. It is quite wrong for this Government, given the background of the aviation industry, to be pushing such a restrictive practice. The FAC and the CAA are commercially irresponsible. The FAC is the equivalent in the commercial world of what Pol Pot was in the political world. They are utterly out of control and irrational. I will not aid and abet their irrational processes in any way at all. I want them brought to account. I want them to justify their charges. Putting in a reasonable period of payment, as the Opposition is doing, is one way of bringing it about. </PARA>

Quite rightly, as a bush pilot and as a bush lawyer, he admitted that pilots and aircraft owners are being pushed to the wall.

In this day of overdrafts, computer banking and all of those things which go with it I would like to know how Senator Sanders can be convinced by the Government, unless it is the promise of preferences in the coming election in Canberra that has twisted his ear on this issue. There is no way in the world I can understand how the Government can say it costs more to collect 45-day bills than 28-day bills. We are not opposing all the other sections relating to the air navigation charges which, as my colleague Senator MacGibbon has said, are rather steep.

I have been asked to elaborate on that argument and I propose to do so. But before I do so may I say that Senator Calvert may have given the game away in an unfinished sentence he uttered.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;However, the penalty free period is necessary to allow for the administrative processes involved in the payment of accounts. Currently 28 days is allowed from the issue of an invoice before penalty charges apply for late payment of air navigation charges under the Air Navigation (Charges) Act. A 28-day period is a normal commercial practice to allow for the payment of accounts. It is comparable with the period allowed by organisations such as Bankcard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposed amendment would not affect the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) or the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) charges as their charges are levied under their respective Acts and not under the Air Navigation (Charges) Act. A comparison with the arrangements applying before 1985 when the period was reduced from 45 days to 28 days is invalid as most operators paid annual air navigation charges in advance before 1985. Charges at that time had to be paid, on average, 137 days in advance to avoid penalty charges. Charges are now paid monthly in arrears and can be paid, on average, 45 days after the date of the subject flight without incurring penalty charges. The Calvert amendment would benefit only a small number of operators; it would not benefit avgas operators as they are not subject to the Department's landing charges. </PARA>
<PARA> The most significant effect of the charge would be to increase the cost to the industry of the collection of charges and the inconvenience involved in the checking of accounts. I think this is the point that Senator Sanders was making in his remarks. At present, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Department of Transport and Communications accounts are processed concurrently by the Authority. This arrangement allows industry to receive a single invoice from the two organisations, greatly reducing the time necessary to check accounts and simplifying the payment of accounts. The charge in the penalty free period for the Department's accounts would introduce a significant difference between the Department's accounts and the Authority's accounts. It would no longer be possible to operate a common accounting system. It would be necessary to send separate accounts for the Department and the Authority. The introduction of a new accounting system for the Department would increase the cost of the system, which is attributable to the industry, as the Department's accounts are at present processed by the Authority system with only a marginal increase in costs. The requirement to check and pay two separate accounts would inconvenience industry and directly increase its costs. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the proposed change would increase costs to industry both directly and indirectly, would destroy an aspect of the present arrangements which industry finds very convenient, would move away from normal commercial practice, and would provide only a dubious benefit to a small number of operators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I do not think it would pay any penalties. I think that until the Government puts its own house in order it cannot go throwing stones at someone else's. Senator Cook talked about air navigation charges being paid in advance. I remind him that, in the days when air navigation charges existed, they were virtually the sole charge paid by an aircraft operator. One did not pay for a licence renewal for any of the licences; one did not pay for examinations; one met no other charges in operating an aircraft other than one's annual air navigation charge-it was all wrapped up in that. It was quite a moderate charge, too. I think the first air navigation charge I paid, about 20 years ago, was about $80. The important point is that there was only one charge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We now have a huge plethora of charges-not one but dozens of them-and those charges are going up by 500, 600 and even 800 per cent. We are not talking about small money here. We can look at the rentals that the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) is trying to extort out of people for properties which are owned by the people of Australia but which have been transferred, in a bit of shonky bookkeeping, to the FAC. The FAC is now trying to earn a profit of at least 7 1/2 per cent in real terms on the notional value of those assets which have been transferred to it by this generous Government-assets which were paid for, probably completely in all cases, by the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give some examples of these charges. I had a letter last year from an aircraft radio technician at Archerfield in Brisbane. He got a directive from the FAC that he would have to pay a user charge of $500 per year to allow him to go on to the airport. There was no consultation with him about the imposition of this charge, and there was no consultation with him on the user pays principle. This particular operator works from his home, where his workshop is. That is where his telephone, his office and his maintenance facilities are. He drives on to the airport for an aggregate period of about two hours a week, basically to pull radios out of aircraft radio racks. He then takes them home. When he is working on those aircraft, pulling those radios out, he is always working in hangars for which a ground rental is paid to the FAC, or in a parking lot for which the aircraft operator pays a parking fee. This person is being asked to pay $500 for the privilege of going on to the field because, under the by-laws, the FAC is entitled to charge him as a supplier of goods or services to an FAC airfield. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that sort of charge is absolutely unbelievable. It means that if Senator Sanders gives advice to me, as an aircraft owner, as to how I should operate either my own aircraft or another aircraft, Senator Sanders is a supplier of a service and, since I am based on an FAC airfield, the FAC is quite entitled to charge Senator Sanders a fee. That is how ridiculous the law is. But these are the great powers that, in a moment of weakness, this Parliament gave the FAC, and similar great powers to impose charges are vested in the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). If the air navigation charge were the only charge, the Minister would not have any argument out of us at all. But it is not like that. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give another example. I was phoned up the other day by one of the big fuelling agents on an FAC airport. He said, `The FAC wants $500 per tonne per fuelling vehicle I own'. He said, `I have a number of trucks that are between 10 and 14 tonnes, and I have one 20-tonne refueller. That formula means I will pay $35,000 a year extra just for the vehicles I have on this one airport to provide fuel to aircraft'. He said, `On top of that, my site rental allowance, which I pay for the tank farm I have here, has gone up 100 per cent'. Again, there was no consultation-just this fee dropped on someone. I rang up the FAC and asked, `Are you going to impose a fee on fuelling agents?'. The reply was, `Well, yes; it is under discussion'. I said, `What is the proposition?'. I was told, `Oh, well, it is under discussion; we cannot discuss the details'. I asked, `Well, is it on the basis of $500 per tonne per fuelling vehicle?'. The answer was, `Well, it may be; it may not be. I am sorry; we cannot discuss it'-the old flim-flam stuff that we get and have got ever since the FAC and the CAA were created. They will not discuss charges at all before they are imposed. They will not discuss them with the industry, and they will not discuss them with the members and senators of this Parliament when we ring up in the legal and legitimate pursuit of our duties. All that happens is that a letter arrives in the mail informing of these extortionate charges. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only does the FAC want this $500 per tonne for fuellers; in the same letter which advised of those charges it said, `We reserve the right to put a levy per litre on fuel sold at a future date'. I could go on, but it is late at night. The point I want to emphasise is that we have a user pays doctrine. We have no control in the Parliament, or in the industry, over the charges that are being levelled and levied by an irresponsible FAC and CAA. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook talked about the difficulty of having two accounting practices. The Government has created not two but three accounting practices. Whereas we once had a Department of Civil Aviation or a Department of Transport, it has created a Department of Transport and Communications, a Civil Aviation Authority and a Federal Airports Corporation. The Government has trebled the administrative overheads imposed on the aviation industry. If one goes around the airports one will find the airport users protesting about the new CAA headquarters because the FAC will not have the CAA in them and vice versa. We are getting a plethora of buildings on airfields that we need like we need a hole in the head. It is big money. It not only costs to construct the buildings; it also costs to keep them going. Those overhead costs have been trebled by this Government for no benefit whatsoever to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> There are probably 1,100 people employed by the Federal Airports Corporation. Nearly 7,600 people are employed by the Civil Aviation Authority. There are another 400 employees in the old Department of Transport dealing with internal, not overseas, aviation matters. In total, about 8,800 Australian public servants and members of the Corporation are on the payroll, looking after just over 7,000 aircraft on the register. In the United States, instead of having a greater number of public servants than aircraft, the number of public servants would be one-third the number of aircraft on the register. It is against this background that the reasonable proposition is advanced for an extension of time for the payment of accounts to 45 days, to accord with normal industry practice of between 60 and 90 days, so that the greatly overburdened aviation community has time to challenge the FAC and the CAA as to whether the account is correct and whether those bodies are justified in raising it. </PARA>
<PARA> If I recall correctly, when Senator Sanders was speaking on this matter last week he made the point that it was not the little people in general aviation who were involved. In fact, they are the people who are most involved. It is not Sir Peter Abeles, or whoever runs Australian Airlines, or the Chairman of Qantas Airways Ltd who are discomforted by these moves. It is the battler, the person whom you and I know-the person who is worried about his overdraft, who is trying to make ends meet-who is feeling the lash of the accounting and charging practices followed by these bodies. It is on their behalf that I support this amendment so strenuously. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have discussed this matter at length. I find that I am in a position of making a decision, somewhat as King Solomon had to do. I do not wish to carve the baby in half, perhaps, but I am somewhat at a loss to reconcile the presentations of Senator MacGibbon and the Minister for Resources, Senator Cook. Senator MacGibbon and I often argue on other topics but we generally see eye to eye on aviation. He being the right wing and I being the left wing of this machine, we generally strike a pretty good balance on our aeronautical progress through the halls of this place. But I am a bit confused, and I hope that the Minister can set me straight. I thought that the Minister just said-and I am sure that the briefing I received from his officials said-that this extension of time would not really affect the small operators, the users of avgas, but only the users of avtur. Avgas, of course, is the mother's milk of the general aviation business. It is what powers the light aircraft of the flight instruction facilities and general aviation in its smaller sense. The turbine fuel is what powers jets. That was my understanding.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If that is the case, then I feel that this extension would benefit the airlines at the expense of those whom we both hold dear, the general aviation operators, because the airlines and the operators of avtur aircraft-the commuter airlines, I suppose-would be granted a 45-day extension. As Senator MacGibbon has said, the overheads have trebled. I agree with him. What we are talking about is overheads. It would cost more to collect these funds. The cost to all, including general aviation, would increase because of the overhead cost of having two accounting systems, but the benefit would accrue to the airlines. So, general aviation would be the loser. That is the reason I am opposed to this amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that Senator MacGibbon would not be misleading Parliament purposely, but in his zealousness to present the case of general aviation he might have somewhat enhanced the truth. I can only really take the Government's word and its briefing at face value. I have talked to the Minister's officials. Although I am on the horns of a dilemma, I still feel that I must back the Government because I do not want to see increased charges for general aviation. That will be my last position. If I found that the Government had not been completely honest in this I suppose that it would then be too late to rectify the damage, but I certainly would not be pleased. I put the Government on notice that I would make it quite plain if I felt that I was being deceived by the Government. All I can do is believe the Government's word and briefing, hope that the facts are as presented and, in this very difficult situation, adhere to my original position that, to protect general aviation from the increasing costs of collecting this charge over a 45-day period, I must support the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition parties will be opposing clauses 21 and 22. These clauses retrospectively validate what were and have been since 4 May 1980 a number of illegal charges being made by Telecom Australia. As I said during the second reading debate of the Bill, at the request of Telecom the Government has introduced this provision in an attempt to validate those charges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that Telecom is the largest business in Australia; its expenditures are larger than the Federal Government's expenditures on the defence of this nation. It has a larger budget than our defence forces, yet it needs the protection of the Parliament. It is quite capable of looking after itself. It has made a series of mistakes in regard to its charging. Unfortunately, ordinary people-perhaps 99.99 per cent of the people who have been affected by these charges, unlawful as they have been-will not know whether they have been overcharged or undercharged. On some of their calls they will have been overcharged; on other calls they will have been undercharged. To use layman's language, as the switchboard has been relocated in various charging areas, there should have been a change to the charging laws but Telecom on a number of occasions-I cannot remember how many; about 108 changes have been made-made the area changes in a relatively small number of cases without having made the by-law changes. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed that the charges unlawfully made in the past will now be retrospectively rectified and made lawful. The Liberal and National parties are totally opposed to retrospective legislation of this sort, which is not to the benefit of the citizen but which may be to the disadvantage of the citizen. Accordingly, we are opposed to the proposed amendments contained in clauses 21 and 22 of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Senator Lewis's comments. I too do not believe in the principle of retrospective legislation. I do not believe it should be supported by any responsible government. I hope that the Australian Democrats will support us in this because they too should not believe in retrospective legislation. As Senator Lewis said, this matter has come forward because Telecom Australia has messed things up and is asking the Parliament to rectify the situation, to cover up its inefficiency. I do not believe that we should be put in a situation like this. This way of doing things is a quick fix solution. We do not accept that requirement and, as I said earlier, I support Senator Lewis and the decision of the coalition to oppose these clauses.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my speech during the second reading debate, I foreshadowed that the Australian Democrats would not support this amendment. I make the point that Senator Lewis has drawn the attention of the Senate to the fact that the practice which is covered by the legislation, as unamended, has been operative since 1980, which means that between 1980 and 1983 this was happening under a coalition government and between 1983 and 1989 certainly under an Australian Labor Party Government. That probably only means that perhaps we could argue that the Labor Party is twice as bad as the Liberal Party, and from time to time honourable senators would find Democrats agreement on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amending legislation is necessary because Telecom Australia made changes as a result of changes in technology. This, having begun in 1980, perhaps demonstrates that the coalition Government was incapable of legislating then as the Labor Party Government is now legislating to cover the changes in technology, that is, the closure of manual telephone exchanges and the consequent changes of boundaries to charging areas. No legislative base was put in place in 1980; it is going in 1989 and both the coalition and the Labor Party stand condemned for their lack of legislation in that time. We are now getting the legislation. Therefore, the Democrats will not support the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refute what Senator Powell has said. She makes out that in some way or other the coalition Government in 1980 was at fault in this matter. The truth of the matter is that the Hawke Government found out what Telecom Australia was doing only around October last year. It introduced regulations to correct the matter then, so it probably found out what had happened in August or September last year. Since then it has tried to rectify the error on behalf of Telecom. The situation is quite clear. No government, whether Liberal-National Party or Labor Party, knew what was happening until the middle of last year, at the earliest. Having been advised by Telecom of what had happened, the Hawke Labor Government is endeavouring to rectify the error by introducing retrospective legislation. Our parties will not support that retrospective legislation, notwithstanding the fact that apparently the Australian Democrats are prepared to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it extraordinary in the context of this amendment that the defence here offered of a former government-particularly one whose party, now in opposition, often takes a holier than thou attitude to ministerial responsibility-is that it did not know what was going on. I find it extraordinary that a former member of that Government should stand up and say, `We are absolved because we did not know what was going on in one of our statutory authorities'. Perhaps we should congratulate the Government for having found out what was going on and for trying to do something about it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Powell totally misses the point. Had we found out about it in government, we would have rectified the matter prospectively. In other words, we would have said, `As from now this will not happen'. We would not have introduced retrospective legislation to correct an error in relation to this matter. That is the difference between us and the Labor Party and between us and the Australian Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In any case, the statement is not correct. The Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, which includes Senator Stone, Senator Bishop and Senator Patterson, picked up some errors in a number of Telecom by-laws amendments in early 1988. The errors date back to May 1980 and, I understand, are those referred to by Senator Powell.The amendments were found to be void as they had not sat before the Parliament for the requisite number of days. Telecom moved to remake those by-laws that had become void as soon as the error had been brought to its notice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Telecom was subsequently involved in a lengthy exchange of correspondence with the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances to establish that the remade by-laws were prospective and not retrospective. The Regulations and Ordinances Committee allowed these by-laws amendments to be made when the former Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support gave a commitment to introduce validating legislation as soon as possible. The telecommunications part of the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 is a fulfilment of that undertaking. The Bill enables Telecom to make by-laws to correct the errors. These by-laws will be subject to the scrutiny of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee and will come here and lie on the table in the normal way. </PARA>

The Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, one of the most famous committees this Senate has ever established, examined the regulations or by-laws, I am not sure which, that came before it and discovered that they contained within them retrospective laws.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Properly, the Committee said to the Minister, `Hey! You cannot do that by way of regulation. If you want to introduce some retrospective laws, you had better do it by way of Act of parliament'. We might have to call one of the Committee members into the chamber to explain it to us. I was not serving on the Committee, so I am only putting two and two together. For whatever reason, the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee told the Minister, `You had better do this by way of an Act of parliament'. As the Minister, Senator Cook, so rightly says, the Government is here fulfilling its undertaking to the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee to bring the legislation before the Parliament and saying, `We want to be able to introduce some retrospective regulations'. That then gives the Parliament an opportunity to consider whether it will allow the Government to introduce such laws retrospectively. What we are saying, on behalf of the coalition, is that the answer is no. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill was first debated on 7 April, and then we had a little more debate last week. So it has been a rather protracted matter, and I should like the opportunity to deal with some of the matters that have been raised by other senators and also to put on record some important matters of fact that relate to why the Labor Government continues to tamper with our electoral legislation within the framework of compulsory voting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to begin by looking at the report of the former Electoral Commissioner in New South Wales, Mr Gundy, who chaired a committee on behalf of the State Government of New South Wales inquiring into electoral fraud. That committee simply found that multiple voting had occurred and, indeed, that the integrity of the system was flawed. When Senator Schacht spoke in this debate he raised the matter of the Castle- reagh by-election which I had raised considerably earlier during the course of 1988. I think that it is important to raise the matter here, to put it into the correct context and to put certain facts on the record. Senator Schacht, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, and one or two other folk have obviously been acutely embarrassed by the truth of the sting in the tail of the story of the Castlereagh by-election. I would remind honourable senators that when I spoke on 17 March 1988 and tabled the tape of a speech by one John Patrick Begg boasting of his exploits for and on behalf of the Wran Government I did so in this context, and I quote from Hansard:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . as we go to the polls on Saturday, the scrutineering that will take place will be most scrupulous on the part of the Liberal Party. It has become of great concern that the laws have been changed to allow people to vote in any subdivision so that we run the risk of having multiple voting. </PARA>
<PARA>The same multiple voting that former Commissioner Gundy found had taken place. I continued:</PARA>
<PARA>As I have clearly outlined, the Labor Party is there to hang on at all costs. Mr Unsworth has his fall-back plan of trying to hang onto a minority government, to try to force the Governor into a position whereby Mr Unsworth could become, in the terms of the Sunday Telegraph, `not a loser but a martyr'. </PARA>
<PARA>So I raised the question of the Castlereagh boasting by Mr Begg, a former employee of Premier Wran, and I think it is important again to place on the record Mr Begg's own curriculum vitae. His name was John Patrick Begg. He was employed by Premier Neville Wran in his Department in 1976. Mr Begg wrote speeches and press releases for Mr Wran, and, after three months, was promoted to the ministerial advisory unit. In 1976 he was made responsible to Premier Wran for restructuring the Department of Industrial Development and Decentralisation. In 1977 he became involved in writing legislation and recommended key appointments to the New South Wales Meat Industry Authority. In 1977 he set up and managed a nine-member trade mission to Saudi Arabia and returned with a $1m three-year meat contract. In 1978 he was responsible for the election campaign in the country and, in his own words:</PARA>
<PARA>By astute identification of issues raised the Government's vote from 33.2 per cent to 50.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1980 he again boasted-this is in writing in his CV, as quoted in Hansard of 17 March 1988, at page 919-that he:</PARA>
<PARA>Organised and managed the Castlereagh By-election campaign culminating in a government win. Coordinated press releases/ads/slogans/protocol and issues. The `Curran for Castlereagh-Your Vote in the Government' campaign is regarded as his most outstanding achievement. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the statement that he put in his own CV, but the tape which I tabled in this place reveals that in 1984, when he was addressing a meeting of a group on the Central Coast, he said that the meeting was set up for organisers of a campaign to work against the establishment of power stations in that area. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . get your captive audience, and get around and by `em a beer, buy `em a drink, buy `em a steak sandwich, and keep talking, you know? Stooge-for God's sake, this has been done before, you know, like I mean, they read out my-I'll be quite open to you about this, you know-they read out my curriculum vitae. One of the things was the Castlereagh By-election which was a traditional Country Party seat they said the Labor Party had no chance of winning, and once again, getting back to basics, there were beautiful advertising slogans, there was this, there was that, and I just sat down one day and I, you know, sort of got myself and I thought to myself-this is going to be close. </PARA>
<PARA>This is Mr Wran's adviser boasting. This is not my allegation; this is Mr Begg's boasting. </PARA>

<PARA> Now, you know, I then went down-there's one office, the regional newspaper office, and Castlereagh started at Dubbo and went right through to Bourke-it was huge-big electorate-and I went down to the local thing and I went-it took me two days-and I went through twelve months and looked at the obituaries and I got everyone that died in the past 12 months and then I compared them to see if they were on the roll and there were 400 on the roll. So I sent little people out to vote for them on these blokes' behalfs and, do you realise, we won the seat by 330 votes. </PARA>
<PARA>As I was reading that quote Senator Schacht asked me what the Electoral Commissioner said. The Electoral Commissioner said, basically, that the boast about having won by 330 votes was not correct. But the important thing about Mr Begg was not that his arithmetic was wrong, but the simple fact that these are the sorts of endeavours and ends to which the Labor Party will go to win at any cost. We look at the amendments to the existing legislation in that context. What did the Labor Government do for the 1987 election? It changed the rules again to enable multiple voting to take place. As former Commissioner Cundy held, multiple voting did take place, as was enabled by the changes to the Electoral Act in 1987 in the State of New South Wales, which followed the precedent of similar changes in 1984 to the Federal electoral Acts to make it easier to cheat on the system. </PARA>
<PARA> Now what are we proposing? We are proposing to make it compulsory even for prisoners to vote. Is that on the assumption that most prisoners are Labor Party supporters? Is that a conclusion to which one can reasonably come?</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2039" SPEAKER="Reynolds Sen The Hon M." NAMEID="XI4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator Reynolds</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) It is anticipated that the National Workshop on Local Government, Immigration and Ethnic Communities, to be held on the 26 and 27 June 1989, will attract some 125 participants.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The participants will include representatives of the three spheres of government, local government associations, ethnic community associations and trade unions. It is expected that members of the major local government trade unions will participate. Representatives of the Municipal Officers Association (MOA) and Municipal Employees Union (MEU) have been invited to lead sessions.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) As the major focus of the workshop is on local government's role in immigration and ethnic affairs, there is no specific intent to include participants from private enterprise organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The cost will be $75 for registration and the workshop dinner.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Yes. It is proposed that a range of people from Non-English Speaking Backgrounds (NESB) who have a significant contribution to make to the National Workshop, will be sponsored through the Office of Multicultural Affairs (OMA). These people will be identified by OMA, in consultation with the Association of Non-English Speaking Women of Australia (ANESBWA) and the Federation of Ethnic Communities of Australia (FECCA).</PARA>
<PARA> The sponsorship includes registration fee ($75), return economy airfare and a per diem equivalent to non SES public servants of $101 to assist with accommodation costs.</PARA>
<PARA> The total cost to OMA is estimated to be $8,000, which will, on current airfare structures, enable at least one participant from all capital cities outside Melbourne as well as participants from regional and rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The workshop budget, including the cost of sponsorship of NESB participants, is an estimated $23,000 which will be met by the Federal Government.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The workshop will be held at the Altona City Council Civic Centre, in Victoria.</PARA>
