<PARA> That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, on 9 October 1989, of the Honourable Sir Alan Hulme, KBE, a member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Petrie from 1949 to 1961 and from 1963 to 1972, Minister for Supply from 1958 to 1961, Postmaster-General from 1963 to 1972 and Vice-President of the Executive Council from 1966 to 1972, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and the members of his family in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA>Sir Alan, who was born at Mosman, New South Wales, on 14 February 1907, was one of the founders of the Liberal Party, and entered parliament as a member of that Party in 1949. He represented the electors of Petrie for well over 20 years, serving under five Prime Ministers. He was Minister for Supply from 1958 to 1961; Postmaster-General from 1963 to 1972-the longest serving Postmaster-General-and Vice-President of the Executive Council from 1966 to 1972. </PARA>
<PARA> During his time in the House, Sir Alan served on numerous parliamentary committees. He was also Chairman of the Commonwealth Immigration Planning Council from 1956 to 1958. Alan Hulme was appointed Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in January 1971. Sir Alan Hulme was a respected member of the Parliament for many years. He also served his Party well, having been President of the Queensland branch on two occasions-from 1946 to 1949, and from 1962 to 1963. On behalf of the Government I extend to his family our sincere sympathy in their bereavement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition I join with the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) in support of the motion and in expressing our sympathy to the family of the late Sir Alan Hulme. Sir Alan Hulme was one of that generation of Liberal members of parliament who served during the 1949 to 1972 period, although he was absent from one parliament following the election in 1961 which, honourable senators will recall, was won narrowly by the Menzies Government. Apart from that he was part of that unbroken period of 23 years of Liberal and National Party governments and he played a distinguished role in them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Leader of the Government has already mentioned the particular ministerial functions that Sir Alan Hulme undertook as Minister for Supply and as Postmaster-General. In addition, he was an important supporter and confidante of Sir Robert Menzies. He played a distinguished role with, I think, the father of Senator Walters in providing very strong personal support for Australia's longest serving Prime Minister. He probably made his most distinguished contribution to government as Postmaster-General. Looking at the record of some of his period, I am pleased to say that he did not fulfil one of his ambitions, which was to see a telephone in every room in Australia. It seems to me that that would have made what is often an uncomfortable life in politics even more uncomfortable. I am pleased that in that respect Sir Alan did not achieve his stated ambition. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Alan presided over the then Post Office at a time of developments of very great importance in terms of the introduction of television, first black and white and later colour television. He was there for the introduction of international subscriber trunk dialling. He presided over a period of very great technological change and expansion. When he left the Parliament temporarily in 1961 he immediately resumed service to the Liberal Party and resumed his presidency of the Party in Queensland. He made an outstanding and consistent contribution to the fortunes of his Party over most of his life. It was a distinguished contribution. He was a man who was described as dour but who was warmly regarded by many people. The Opposition deeply regrets his death and expresses sympathy for his family. </PARA>

He was very active in the Liberal Party. He was very active in the early years when I started my association with the Liberal Party, in the mid-1960s.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add some words to this motion of condolence. Not only was Sir Alan Hulme one of the founders of the political party to which I belong, and a forty-niner-one of that great band of people who entered Parliament in the sweeping Menzies win of 1949-but also he was a person who knew the bitterness of 1961 and who still came back and served what for many people would be another full parliamentary career. There are very few forty-niners left. I have frequent communications from the Hon. William Charles Wentworth IV, who I would say to Bill if he is listening, keeps me busy and active. I would like to support Senator MacGibbon's comment that Sir Alan was a great Queenslander, but he was more than that. He occupied most positions within the Government and, I understand, served for longer than anyone else in the portfolio of Postmaster-General.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some years ago, in 1974-75, I was President of the Gordon Branch of the Liberal Party, a very large branch, of over 600 members. Following my election to this Parliament, I think the next President was a friend of Senator Chaney's, a former Western Australian by the name of Mr Mason-Jones. I think Senator Chaney would remember him. Sir Alan Hulme's son, Robert Hulme, succeeded him. Robert Hulme is a member of the Gordon Branch of the Liberal Party. We got to know him very well and to appreciate what he is and what he stands for. He is a barrister in Sydney. But more than that, we got to know from him some of the history of the family and some of the travails that his father went through in beginning, continuing and achieving his eminent career. I say to Robert Hulme that it is appropriate today that in the Senate we pay tribute to his father and put on record all that his father stood for. We say to the Hulme family that this is a story of a job well done. </PARA>

Will the Minister confirm that, as a result of approaches by the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service to the end of June to a sample of something over 10,000 of those long-term unemployed, 12 per cent of those approached had their unemployment benefit cancelled and not reinstated within six weeks? Will the Minister further confirm that another 13 per cent of this group had their level of payment reduced, making a total of 25 per cent who lost either the whole or part of the benefit? Is it also a fact that of those who made it to the interviews-to move on to another group of the same sample-a total of 14 per cent commenced employment, 6 per cent began a Department of Employment, Education and Training labour market program, and 8 per cent commenced some other form of educational training or had left the labour force?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As indicated by Senator Chaney I have not got precise figures on this particular question. At the outset I will respond to the point about those who have been interviewed under the Newstart program. I make the basic point that Newstart and the value of it may be underscored by the statistics that Senator Chaney puts forward-if, in fact, they are accurate. On the question of unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, the reality is that the Government has put in place a comprehensive program geared towards assisting transition to work. To that extent we have the Newstart and jobs, education and training (JET) programs that are geared towards problems with long-term unemployment. Essentially, this involves meshing together labour market programs, education, training and the social security system. This Government, unlike previous conservative governments in particular, has been quite relaxed about letting people stay on unemployment benefits. I point out that when Senator Chaney was a Minister for this area a number of criteria and checks were done away with to ensure that only those who were genuinely unemployed did, in fact, receive unemployment benefits. The Government's approach-this is consistent with all our approaches in the social security area-is that this area be tackled comprehensively. As a consequence, Newstart is a program which meshes together the need to ensure that retraining programs are in place. If Senator Chaney's figures are accurate one can contend quite strongly that one of the important aspects of the Government's policy-to ensure that those genuinely in need receive assistance-is being met. To that extent I do not know what particular point Senator Chaney is making other than one that rebounds on him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the second part of Senator Chaney's question about whether there is any further scope for savings in the unemployment area, unlike a statement delivered last week, this Government has consistently and comprehensively over our period of office tackled the problem of fraud in this area.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stone says that we made unemployment a way of life. Let me respond to that. Over the last six years this Government has created 1.6 million jobs. We have provided incentives for unemployed people to take part-time or casual work and to move into full-time employment. As a consequence, these schemes are enmeshed in that. Let me also say that this approach is starting to work and is having a major impact particularly on that area that Senator Stone seems to be concerned about. He has dragged Senator Chaney along on a chain on this question of the longer term unemployed. From 1986 to May 1989 we have had something like 500 longer term unemployed per week coming off the unemployment list. Senator Stone might sigh but the difference between our policies and his is that ours are not derived out of prejudice and long lost ideology. Another thing that the Opposition needs to notice is that in 1984 the total number of people receiving the unemployment benefit was about 670,000. Senator Chaney should know that. He was the responsible Minister at that time. As of Friday this number has fallen to 363,000-an average of 2,000 per week over the last three years. If we are talking about creating an unemployment mentality, let us compare the records. This Government has shown a commitment to controlling fraud in this area. Our commitment has been shown and well demonstrated by our targeting particular areas, particularly through our mobile review teams which, I am sure, Senator Chaney has also acknowledged in the past as having a major impact in this area. Senator Chaney should not come in here being vague, suffering from amnesia and not recognising what this Government has been doing in the area of employment, unemployment and social security fraud.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reality is-I have said this before and I will say it again-that the Government has consistently had a program in this area for longer term unemployed. We will not respond to the problem in a knee-jerk way, as the Opposition has. We will not appeal to prejudice. As, I think, the Sydney Morning Herald said on the weekend, the Opposition seems to be more concerned about politics than responsible policy and economics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reality is that this Government will not target the longer term unemployed and isolate them in the community. Our policy response in this area has, like most others, been driven by the Social Security Review-a review which, I suggest, would be good reading for Senator Chaney. He would find from that review that the sorts of people he is talking about are quite often older unemployed-those with families and those who, through no fault of their own, are on the unemployment list. So our response will not be arbitrary; it will be comprehensive and detailed. To that extent, we have implemented fraud control in this area over the last six years. Our response to fraud in this area is not the across-the-board response of the Opposition. We will not target a particular doctor and say that any person going to that doctor will not be able to get sickness benefits. This is what Senator Chaney said in regard to the Greek social security case-a case which was born out of prejudice and a lack of comprehensive policy detail and which cost the taxpayers of this country $20m rather than gained money for them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think the Government, at this stage, will accede to the request in Senator Jones's question, but it may do in time. Of course, there is concern about the recent series of accidents. The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation is examining the causes of these accidents. The safety of ballooning, like that of all aviation activities, is the responsibility of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). I understand that the CAA held discussions today with the ballooners association in relation to the recent spate of accidents. At this stage the causes of the accidents appear largely unrelated. Any action to suspend commercial balloon operations would be a matter for the CAA. The CAA has arranged a meeting with commercial balloon operators and the Australian Ballooning Federation to review the relevant standards and procedures. The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation will be closely involved in this process. I should make the point that Australian commercial balloon pilot requirements are much more stringent than those of most other countries and, in particular, more stringent than those in the United States of America.</PARA></TALK.START>

The first part of the question asks me to comment on what happened in New York and whether it has effect here. It had effect in New Zealand and in Hong Kong. As the financial markets open all around the world, it will have an effect there. It probably will not have the effect that Senator Stone predicted in his very erudite but totally inaccurate article about the effects of the October 1987 crash. We now auction Senator Stone's economic predictions at Australian Labor Party raffles. One cannot find anything that is even remotely as inaccurate as those were.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second part of the question asked when the Treasurer was coming out of hiding. The Treasurer has been very active in the last few days, as I have noticed from news programs. He has delivered the John Curtin Memorial Lecture and has given a whole series of interviews. I do not know where Senator Stone has been in the last two or three days to have missed that. The implication in his question was that, in some way, the Treasurer would be going into hiding because the Opposition has announced its alternative economic policy. I remind Senator Stone of some of the things that the Opposition has picked up in its alternative policy. We have had to put up for years in this chamber with Senator Crichton-Browne and Senator Panizza going on ad nauseam about gold tax. What has the Opposition picked up in its policy? Gold tax. We have listened to the Opposition ad nauseam going on about fringe benefits tax. An integral part of the Opposition's economic package is the fringe benefits tax. We have listened to the Opposition going on and on about capital gains tax. The Opposition withdraws capital gains tax and substitutes something of a similar ilk. We heard Senator Stone say how the Opposition was going to get rid of the assets test; yet it has picked all that up in its economic policy.</PARA>
<PARA> What the Opposition has done is pick up the basic economic prescriptions of this Government, as expressed in the Forward Estimates, where we have done all the hard work and the Opposition has been on the sideline whingeing and complaining all the way through. The Opposition never wants to do any of the tough things. When it comes to the crunch, the Opposition will let us do the tough things and then the Opposition will cop it without changing it when it gets into government. The Opposition's only contribution in all this is to say, `We will accept all those parameters, but we will do a little switch in the middle. We will take $2 billion off those who really need it and give it to other people as an electoral bribe'. That is how far the Opposition has come in terms of economic policy. Why should the Treasurer have to hide from any of that? As I said to Senator Chaney by way of interjection earlier on, the Opposition is just a bunch of Gordon Geckos.</PARA>

The fact remains that the Opposition's alternative economic policy reflects a lot of the basic economic parameters of this Government and then just adds to them. I would say what the Treasurer would say: having regard to Senator Stone's whingeing, whining and carryings-on over the last four or five years, when it comes to the crunch of producing an alternative policy, all of his micro-gripes are not picked up. He has accepted the basic macro approach of this Government; he has accepted the estimates and forward estimates. The only variation he has is based not on economics but on a supposed appeal to the electors. I say to Opposition senators right now that if that is the price they have to pay to win, it is not worth paying.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has been concerned to hear reports of two recent fuel oil spills at a United States station in Antarctica. The first, said to be up to 200,000 litres, was discovered in late September at the United States South Pole base. The second, reportedly involving up to 225,000 litres of jet fuel, diesel oil and petrol, was discovered on 11 October at Williamsfield Air Base on McMurdo Sound near the coast. In response to our inquiries United States agencies have limited comment to acknowledgment of the leaks, their causes and rectification and, in the case of McMurdo, the fact that clean-up of the area has begun. The United States Science Foundation maintains that when the clean-up is completed environmental impact is expected to be minimal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These latest examples of oil spills in Antarctica are only a small example of what might occur if Antarctica were to be opened to large scale mineral resource activity. Such accidents would more likely than not occur in the sensitive ice-free areas around the coast or at sea and the impact of a spill on wildlife and on the fragile environment generally would be very great indeed. I make the point that this year, 1989, there have been four oil spills from various countries' bases or Antarctic vessels, other than those of the United States. From this sort of record the argument that such accidents should be effectively guarded against and prevented under the Antarctic Minerals Convention is manifestly not credible. It is hard enough to prevent spills from existing lower levels of non-resourced based activity.</PARA>

<PARA>. . . Resources Minister, Senator Peter Cook, stated in the Senate Estimates Committee on September 28 that he had stopped talking about planting one billion trees.</PARA>
<PARA>At that point the article went on to extrapolate this whole feeble argument. I can only say that Mr McGauran, either through ignorance or deliberately, in this case is misrepresenting what I said in the Senate Estimates Committee. What I said in the Senate Estimates Committee can be seen by consulting Hansard of Estimates Committee F on 28 February. I said:</PARA>
<PARA>I have stopped talking about planting one billion trees. I have altered my language to talk about growing one billion trees. I acknowledge your point-</PARA>
<PARA>referring to a point made by Senator Brownhill-</PARA>
<PARA>that often social plantings mean that people make the commitment, go and plant a tree but do not ensure that it is fertilised properly, protected from grazing cattle or scavengers and that it survives until it has a healthy growth and continues to grow.</PARA>
<PARA>I was responding to a constructive intervention in the Senate Estimates Committee by Senator Brownhill about how, once we plant these trees, we make sure that they survive to grow properly. From that comment Mr McGauran has made his outrageous and inaccurate claim. One can only consider that he is deliberately or unknowingly misrepresenting the truth. I said in that exchange in the Senate Estimates Committee that the Government has not backed away from the billion trees initiative announced by the Prime Minister in the environment statement in July. Despite what Mr McGauran has said, the Government never said that it would plant and look after one billion trees by itself. Rather, we will be giving encouragement, advice and incentives to the whole community so that Australians as a whole will grow one billion trees by the year 2000. We are aiming to have 400 million trees planted and a further 600 million trees grown by direct seeding and natural regeneration under the one billion trees program. These figures do not include regeneration of existing forests, as suggested by Mr McGauran, which is another inaccuracy in his press statement. I can report that already Victoria and Western Australia have announced State schemes to grow more trees-100 million under the Tree Victoria program in Victoria and 200 million in Western Australia. I am sure that other States will emulate those programs. The Commonwealth will allocate-this is Senator Richardson's area, not mine, and he is in charge of that program, not me-</PARA>

In fact, that claim from a Queensland University anthropologist-whose name, I think, is Hyndman-has been around in some student newspapers for some time, which has given the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority an opportunity to examine it. The Authority is at a loss to explain the claim. There is obviously a significant problem with the Ok Tedi mine in particular. Like many honourable senators, I am sure, I have been disturbed to read that not only is a huge sediment load now coming down the Fly River but also, because of the failure of the tailings dam, there is considerable leaching of heavy metals. The effects of those on Torres Strait are as yet unknown. The Australian Government is committed under the Torres Strait Treaty to protect Torres Strait, and no doubt we will live up to our obligations. As a first step, the Prime Minister announced in his environment statement a commitment of $150,000 this year and $200,000 next year to have a baseline study conducted so that we can see what there is of the environment and then be able to monitor the effects of mining, from Ok Tedi in particular, over time.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Despite Senator Chaney's long interest, he is still lost. As Senator Coates indicated, the Government's approach has been comprehensive, has been based on empirical evidence and forms part of a very coherent long term policy. In 1987 we commenced our measures in this area by removing an anomaly which was introduced under the previous Liberal Government. This anomaly made sickness benefits payable at a higher rate than unemployment benefits. We felt that this incentive was inappropriate. We had to facilitate the scheme so that people would not detach themselves from the labour market. So in 1987 we removed that anomaly. In 1987 we also introduced selective and medical reviews for sickness beneficiaries, concentrating on those most at risk of wrong payment. In fact, in 1988 we overhauled procedures for doctors to advise of incapacities. This year we have taken measures to ensure that sickness benefit cannot be received during a period of unused annual leave. We have also introduced additional selective and medical reviews for people on sickness benefits. As honourable senators should know, we are introducing mobile review teams in this area, building on the experience of the last two years of measures and targeting people at risk of wrong payment. When one looks at these measures one can see, once again, the Government's long analysis and coherent policy responses to this problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Coates also referred to recently floated proposals, I presume that he meant suggestions, made by the Opposition and, I think, Senator Chaney's committee. The Government's approach to this area is very different from the one proposed by the Opposition. The Opposition says that as a fundamental part of its policy it will reject the certificates of general practitioners when people apply for sickness benefits. Treating doctors will never be permitted to assess whether a person is unable to work because of illness. Their function will be replaced by government-employed medicos-a whole different breed of doctors-and, as a consequence, the doctor treating the person involved will be excluded from the decision making process. What the Opposition is saying basically is that no treating doctor can be trusted. Obviously that has cost implications in terms of employing doctors.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government is concerned that its policy be based on empirical evidence and careful analysis. In that respect, one wonders on what basis the Opposition has come up with such an idea. It has not asked one question of the relevant Minister during this session of Parliament. The data presented by the Social Security Review does not support the Opposition. Common experience-I am sure that Opposition senators have made this point more strongly than many others-suggests that most doctors are honest and professional. There is no real empirical evidence or support for the Opposition's proposition in this area.</PARA>
<PARA> The only precedent we could find was very much the response which goes back to 1979 and which spawned the Greek conspiracy case. The benefits of hundreds of people were cancelled merely because they went to the particular doctor. It is a similar prejudice which drives Opposition policy in this area. It comes as no surprise because for three years after the Greek conspiracy case-after `Don's party'-Senator Chaney, who was the Minister for Social Security, did nothing to have the benefits and pensions restored to the hundreds of people who had been illegally denied support. He did nothing to ensure accountability in the prosecutions and he did nothing to remedy the gross injustices. Rather, at that time we had a policy spawned in a belief that a treating doctor was not the appropriate person to make a judgment. In the social security area, the Government has based its policy responses on empirical evidence and careful analysis. We have also been keen to ensure that administration costs have been kept to a minimum. The Opposition's policy will do nothing of the sort.</PARA>

When I say `members of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots', I am referring to the former employees of the airlines whom the Pilots Federation still purports to represent. I am aware of some of the matters which Senator Lewis raised. He referred to references which have been made to 60 per cent capacity in the airlines. I answered that question in this place a week or so ago. In answering that question I made the point at the time that if a fixed number of seats is provided on the two domestic airlines when they are normally operating, the number of seats being provided by the services now in place is equivalent to 60 per cent of that normal number. As I said at the time, that does not mean that adequate services are being provided to many places. They are not. That is clearly understood.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is one of our greatest pests in the pastoral industry. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) has estimated a national annual loss of $90m due to income forgone because of the competition rabbits provide for grazing stock. A separate estimate of $17m for South Australia alone was prepared by the ABARE. Rabbits have a significant effect upon the environment, particularly in semi-arid regions where, together with sheep, they have fundamentally altered the arid ecosystems. The disappearance of small marsupials, such as bilbies and hare-wallabies, is reputed to have occurred only after areas were invaded by rabbits. Rabbits are a major contributor to soil erosion, as I have said.</PARA></TALK.START>

Does the Government consider that the airlines ought to provide better services when they are in receipt of massive taxpayer subsidies? Does the Government recognise that the cancellation of scheduled flights caused by pilots running out of flight hours has rendered air communications unstable and unreliable? If so, what is the Government going to do about telling Australians the truth-that flights are not running at 62 per cent but at approximately 25 per cent-and increasing the percentage of flights to the west?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, the issues paper strongly recommends moving towards policies that reduce the dependency of people with disabilities. In the Budget this year, the Government announced its firm commitment to move in the direction suggested by the Cass Social Security Review in this area. To that extent, we have established a series of pilot projects and studies to determine the feasibility of income security arrangements to implement the social security review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In summary, the Government is developing a policy in this area on a basis of paying careful attention to the facts. That is clearly different from the policy projection that was put out last week by the Opposition. The Opposition is saying, firstly, that it will maintain the eligibility criteria for invalid pensions and, secondly, that it will medically review all except those who are totally and permanently incapacitated. There are two major problems with the policy proposal put out last week. Under the Opposition's scheme, almost everybody would be medically reviewed each year. That, of course, would have major costs.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition should go back to basics-it should go back to the Social Security Act and to the criteria which apply to the assessment of invalid pensions. A medical review cannot determine eligibility. Much wider considerations, such as socio-economic and other factors relevant to capacity to work, must be taken into account. Therefore, medical review is not the only determinant. That is the first mistake that the Opposition has made. Secondly, and most alarmingly and amazingly-Senator Stone once again can smile about this because this whole policy is his work; it is etched in stone-this proposal embodies the concept of total and permanent incapacity. This concept is not within the general social security system of this country; it is within the veterans' affairs area. And there are good reasons for that. It is impossible to use that as a basis to exempt people from the review. This concept adds a further tier, another criterion, that would act to marginalise and exclude people. Thirdly, and most fundamentally, it brings into the system a concept which was discarded in 1941 by the Menzies Government following the work of a joint parliamentary committee on social security. It was discarded because it was seen then, as it would be seen now, to discourage invalid pensioners from making an effort to become self-supporting, to get back into the system, to embark upon training. So the Opposition has not only gone back, but it has gone back to a policy which was discarded in 1941.</PARA>
<PARA> There is another objectionable part to this policy, and I am sure that it comes from Senator Stone. The Opposition is saying that if a migrant is unable to work because of an accident-that person may have become a quadriplegic-for no rational reason but for the arbitrary prejudice that Senator Stone has embodied time and again that person will not be eligible for the disability pension. Those are not the sorts of prejudices that this Government is about. As I said at the outset, we are more concerned about a rational, comprehensive response to this problem. Our policies will not be driven by prejudice and irrationality.</PARA>

Does Senator Cook believe that the standard of living is appropriately and comprehensively measured by the rate at which energy resources are consumed? Is it not possible that substantial energy efficiency improvements could deliver the same end use service, that is, the same standard of living with lower resource consumption and lowered greenhouse gas emissions? Is it also possible that a more rigorous pursuit of energy efficiency in Australia would not only increase Australia's present competitiveness but also place Australia in a better position to capitalise on the sale of technologies, for instance recent advances in solar technology by Professor Martin Green of the University of New South Wales, which the whole world must shortly adopt?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Coulter's question enables me to clarify a point which he has clearly misunderstood in terms of what I did say and how it was reported. I do not regard, and I do not think it is reasonable that anyone should regard, energy consumption as an appropriate measurement of the way in which we determine our standard of living. That was never the implication of what I said. I did say that, apart from running programs for better energy conservation and programs that achieve greater energy efficiency-apart from those two possible strands of policy approach to reducing fossil fuel consumption-we sooner or later come to the point at which we impact upon the ability of the economy to grow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Quite clearly, there is a link between energy consumption and economic growth. We as a government have been following those two prospects. It has been a policy not only of ours but of the former government. Ever since the first Arab oil price hike in 1973, governments in Australia have been concerned about greater energy efficiency and greater conservation. Under this Government it has received a particularly strong focus and it was part of what the Prime Minister said in July this year in his environmental statement. We certainly have those objectives clearly in our minds. But ultimately, if one is talking about massive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, one is also talking about a change in economic growth targets, which is significant. I do not think that point can be avoided.</PARA>
<PARA> For example, I note that a 20 per cent reduction on 1986-87 CO2 emission levels by 1999-2000 implies a compound reduction in fossil fuel demand of 1.7 per cent per annum over that 13-year period. In terms of growth rates in this economy and in terms of what changes would need to be made to deliver such a reduction, we are talking about significant changes in lifestyle and in economic growth. I think that it is proper and reasonable to state that point up front, to recognise what is involved and to deal with it if we are seriously going to set those targets and reach them. Otherwise the honourable senator is engaged in a bit of hocus-pocus and black magic. The electorate will finally apprehend and see through the paucity of his position and deal with him accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator's last question was: Would it not be better if we did more about alternative energy? Of course it would be better if we did more about alternative energy. But the honourable senator seems to imply that we have no program for promoting alternative energy projects. I would like to introduce him to the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council (NERDDC) which, for the period of this Government, has promoted, as it will continue to promote, alternative energy research in Australia. I take this opportunity in the chamber, in a gesture of goodwill, to invite the honourable senator to the national energy awards which will be handed out by me early next month in Sydney to reward publicly scientists and those with applied alternative energy approaches for their efforts. Through those programs, working with industry and with State governments, a lot of effort had been put into finding alternative energy applications and methods. As we look around Australia we see a proliferation of some of these alternatives that just a few decades ago we would never have thought possible. The one outstanding example, which most lay people in Australia are familiar with, is the solar-generated outback telephone system that has been developed through Telecom Australia. But the essential element in all these programs is that they must be commercially viable to hold a place in the market. We, through the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council, are assisting in the development of that science and in its commercial application.</PARA>

It started out as a text for Third World countries but it is indeed a text for all countries. Just this weekend I had the pleasure of making the observation that one of the useful projects that we could adopt in this country would be to provide a comprehensive response to the concepts laid down in the Brundtland report so that our economic development is environmentally sustainable and so that we develop our economy within the capability of the resource base on which it is predicated.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today Senator Chaney asked a number of questions in respect of the Newstart program. In that context he asked for up-to-date figures on the results of the Newstart program. During the course of Question Time I have been able to get some figures. Firstly, to 20 September, 15,500 interviews of people have been scheduled, of which 93, or 0.6 per cent, failed the work test. Secondly, 454, or 2.9 per cent, failed to attend the interview. I note here that we would expect some people to get a job in any given fortnight and for those people to be embodied in this figure. Thirdly, 40, or 3 per cent, were overpaid. As a result of Newstart, 1,645 people, or 10.6 per cent, have left the benefit. That is good news because they have been helped to get jobs; it is not evidence of fraud as Senator Chaney may have suggested. It is also true that 1,781 or 11.5 per cent have had their rate of payment reduced. Again, that is good news, because those people are now earning money. The only figure of help to Senator Chaney in the point that he is trying to make is that 40 or 0.3 per cent of people were overpaid, that is, had wrongly received payment prior to interview. Those payments will be pursued by the Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of much more interest to the community and to the Government is that, arising from these figures, the Government's policies have meant that 22 per cent of people who have been in this scheme have gone off benefit or had their rate reduced. They are better off and, as a consequence, the taxpayer is better off.</PARA>

<PARA> Mr Irvine continues to grossly misrepresent me by claiming that I said that the Liberal Party was unable to reduce interest rates. I repeat this because the Democrats in Western Australia seem to be peddling these lies. At a number of subsequent meetings to which I have not been invited, Mr Irvine has repeated that allegation notwithstanding interjections from the floor from invited Liberal Party speakers seeking to correct his lies. I assume that the only thing I can do to solve this problem is to literally drop an extract from Hansard into all the households in Western Australia so that Mr Irvine can be exposed as a liar though he may be a Democrat candidate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee is considering amendment No. 81 circulated by the Opposition. I remind the Committee that this seeks to amend clause 148 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill. For those who are following the Bill, that clause is at page 60. The clause proposed by the Government is very brief. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Except as expressly provided in this Act, the Minister is not empowered to direct the Corporation in relation to any of its activities. </PARA>
<PARA>The explanatory memorandum merely repeats the clause. Since it does not explain anything, I take it that this is why it is called an explanatory memorandum. The Opposition seeks to leave out that clause, which is really quite inadequate, and to insert a clause in its place. That clause would deal with directions given by the Minister. We are talking about the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation, the ATSICDC. The Opposition's amendment would propose a new clause 148 which states:</PARA>
<PARA>the Corporation shall perform its functions and exercise its powers in accordance with such general directions as are given to it by the Minister in writing. </PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to make the point that that does not empower the Minister to give directions relating to the content of any advice or information that may be given by the Corporation. The clause proposes that the Minister should cause a copy of any direction given by the Minister to be laid before each House of Parliament within 15 sitting days. We propose in the clause that any such direction laid before the Parliament shall not disclose certain secret, sensitive or confidential matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Temporary Chairman, if you are familiar with the Aboriginal Development Corporation Act, as I am sure you are, you will be aware that what we are proposing is broadly consistent with section 11 of the ADC Act which is a ministerial power to give directions of a general nature, not a power to give directions as to the content of any decision which the Corporation might take. We believe that that provision, which has existed in the ADC Act since its inception in 1980, is one that should be reproduced here. That is why we are proposing amendment No. 81. I remind the Committee again that we have had some recent experiences in Western Australia and Victoria which should give us considerable cause for concern. In Western Australia we had the experience with WA Inc. In Victoria we had experiences with the Victorian Economic Development Corporation. Each of those experiences has shown quite clearly the need for close ministerial supervision and accountability of publicly funded venture capital operations. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are talking about in this part of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill is precisely that-it is a commercial undertaking which will involve a venture capital operation. The ATSICDC should not be at loose in the marketplace without any kind of direction-making power in the hands of the Minister. We are suggesting directions of a general kind, not specific directions. Those who have followed the ADC legislation-I am sure Senator Coulter has-will know that that general directing power has been in place precisely because the Parliament thought that such a direction-making power in the hands of the Minister was a proper thing to have. Honourable senators and members of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs will recall that the Minister used that direction-making power in May 1988 in a manner which is now quite notorious. Therefore, we have sought to take the direction-giving power of the Minister as set out in section 11 of the ADC Act and propose it for the ATSICDC. We know of no good reason why it is not appropriate and why it should not be proper to include it. </PARA>
<PARA> It could be alleged that such a proposal could interfere with Aboriginal self-determination. That is not the case; that could not be so. It has never been envisaged that ATSIC or the ATSICDC would operate completely divorced from the Minister of the Crown with whom constitutional responsibility rests. In any event, the Corporation is supposed to be dealing in the market on a strict business basis anyway. If ministerial directions of a general kind merely required it to do that, which is all it could do, it would merely confirm what we know is the proper way for the Corporation to operate. It would not interfere with Aboriginal self-determination. We know that it is not proposed that the Corporation Board be wholly Aboriginal. There are places for experts with particular knowledge. It is not proposed that the Minister can make any particular specific directions-that is, it is not proposed that the Minister could interfere with individual cases. We are concerned because the powers given to the ATSICDC are very wide powers indeed. They resemble in many ways the powers that were given to the Victorian Economic Development Corporation in Victoria and the powers of Western Australia Inc. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crichton-Browne is aware of the scandal that occurred with WA Inc. The Corporation would be at large to invest in the market. Of course, it would have global but not specific approval from the Treasurer for this purpose. It would be at large in the market to make a guarantee to any person. I will come back to this question of guarantees in a moment. We propose an amendment. If it is accepted the Minister will be able to direct the Corporation in a general way-only in a general way-as to the ways in which it should operate, in exactly the same way as the Minister was empowered to direct the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). In all the criticisms I have heard of the ADC I have not once heard any criticism of the existence of that direction giving power under section 11 of the Aboriginal Development Commission Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We cannot understand some of the proposals for ATSICDC. It is proposed that it should have power to operate outside Australia. I wonder why. Is it intended that ATSICDC should become a player in international currency or futures markets? Maybe it is not, but I invite the Committee to look at the Bill as drafted. It would be possible for ATSICDC to do either of those things if it wanted to, as the Bill is presently drafted. That is why I have moved:</PARA>
<PARA> (81) Page 60, clause 148, lines 29 to 31, leave out the clause, insert the following clause:</PARA>
<PARA>Directions by Minister</PARA>
<PARA> ``148. (1) The Corporation shall perform its functions and exercise its powers in accordance with such general directions as are given to it by the Minister in writing. </PARA>
<PARA> ``(2) Subsection (1) does not empower the Minister to give directions relating to the content of any advice or information that may be given by the Corporation to a Minister, Department or authority of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> ``(3) Subject to subsection (4), the Minister shall cause a copy of any direction given by the Minister under subsection (1) to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after that direction was given. </PARA>
<PARA> ``(4) A copy of a direction laid before the Parliament in accordance with subsection (3) shall not disclose:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) any matter the disclosure of which in that manner would be inconsistent with the views or sensitivities of relevant Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) any confidential commercial information given to the Corporation.''. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the amendment to the Committee. The Opposition believes that the direction giving power from the ADC is one of the clauses which it is appropriate to bring across, to copy, to transfer into this new Bill, and that this is an appropriate place for it to appear. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This amendment would be appropriate only if Senator Peter Baume and the Opposition had successfully moved some previous amendments. This is truly consequential. We are really going over ground that was dealt with in the dying hours of the debate last time we met. This would flow only if the role of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation (ATSICDC) were changed to include some of those ventures and projects which the former Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) could undertake. Here we have a body which, as is announced in clause 145 (1), shall perform its functions `in accordance with sound business principles'. It is indeed a commercial development corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Baume spoke I wondered what the content of the general directions would be. I took a note of his saying `all the Minister could properly do by way of a general direction would be to ensure that the Corporation acted in a businesslike and commercial manner'. In fact, that would be redundant; it is already stated in the clause itself. In other words, Parliament is making it very clear that the Corporation shall act in accordance with sound business principles and engage in its various commercial activities in accordance with those sorts of criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the most analagous corporation, the Australian Industry Development Corporation, one finds there is no general power of direction because it is engaged in commercial and business activity. Senator Baume's proposition would have been acceptable as a consequential amendment if, as I mentioned earlier, he had succeeded in changing the parameters of the functions, capacities and objectives of the Corporation to include some of the former ADC matters. Obviously there is no analogy with WA Inc. which was not a creature of a parliament and did not have to report to a parliament. As I pointed out last time, the Minister has the capacity to change the corporate plan, as outlined in clause 147 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Under clause 147 of the Bill, the Minister may, by notice in writing to the Corporation Board, request the corporation to change its corporate plan in regard to certain matters. I think I pointed out last time that I believe that is the appropriate process for the Minister to deal with the general way in which the Corporation sets out its objectives and its method of achieving the goals and objectives under the corporate plan. Clause 147 provides an adequate capacity for the interplay which may be appropriate between the Minister and the Corporation in regard to setting its objectives in a general way. I do not believe that the analogy lies with the Aboriginal Development Commission; rather, I believe it lies with the AIDC and, for that reason, the Government will be opposing this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendment moved by Senator Peter Baume. I am somewhat surprised at the comments made by the Minister in the light of evidence given on 10= October to Estimates Committee E with regard to these very issues relating to the corporate plan and the use of ministerial directions for the current Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). In April 1989 it was necessary for the Minister to issue eight directions to the ADC pursuant to section 11 of the Aboriginal Development Commission Act. In pursuing a line of questioning last week in that regard Senator Short raised a number of very important issues relating to those eight directions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There was quite a lengthy dialogue between Senator Short and Mr Fitzwarryne of the ADC. In summary, what came out in the Estimates Committee last week was a very unsatisfactory system with regard to the directions, and compliance with them, that the Minister had made. I was very concerned at that Estimates Committee meeting-and I hope to pursue this matter in the report of Estimates Committee E-that Mr Fitzwarryne, as an officer of the ADC, repeatedly had to take questions on notice, even though very factual requests were made with regard to complying with the necessary directions brought in by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the Minister has sought, by his answer just now, to rely on clause 147 in this legislation and the adequacy of formulating a corporate plan. Again, in Estimates Committee E last week there was a series of questions relating to the formulation of a corporate plan by the Aboriginal Development Commission. The ADC is currently seeking to develop a new corporate plan, and what became very apparent was that it had been done in isolation from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) task force, which has been seeking to set in place the various mechanisms that would result from this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the various exchanges at Estimates Committee E last week a statement was made by Mr Stewart, the current Acting General Manager of the ADC, that the Commission's specific corporate plan is of little relevance to a body which has not yet commenced operations, yet the proposed corporate plan of the ADC will, in effect, forecast things for the coming five years. We all know that it is the intention of the Government that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation will assume most of the commercial operations which, for many years, have been conducted by the Aboriginal Development Commission. I am concerned that the Minister seeks to rely totally on clauses 147 and 148. It has been adequately demonstrated to the Senate, particularly at the Senate Estimates Committee last week, that there are very serious areas of concern that require the very necessary provision of suitable directions by the Minister. Amendment No. 81, proposed by Senator Peter Baume to introduce a comprehensive new clause 148, will accommodate this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Senator Peter Baume's amendment. The clause that the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) referred to really does not give the Minister any capacity to influence in any way the activities and the functioning of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation. The Minister referred to the Australian Industry Development Corporation. Of course, its charter is different, its purpose for being is different and its goals are quite different. Subclause 144 (2) of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill, in part, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (2) For the purpose of the performance of the Corporation's functions, the Corporation Board shall have regard to the desirability of:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) encouraging and facilitating Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participation in commercial projects and enterprises;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) securing, as far as practicable, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participation in the ownership and control of companies engaged in activities that are likely to have a significant impact on Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander interests;</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraphs (c) and (d) continue in a similar fashion. Presumably, the golden thread running through the functions of the Corporation is the need to provide employment and activities which have a tangible bearing on the involvement of the Aboriginal community. The commercial decisions will be tempered very much by their significance to the involvement and the immediate welfare of individual Aboriginals. I assume that the first criterion will be employment prospects, the second job opportunities and the third whether there are any commercial benefits. If the first two criteria are of the most significance, I imagine that the third will be the least consequential. Whenever those types of value judgments are made it is terribly important that the Minister be required to carry responsibility because, without exception, it will be argued that, while the board ultimately made a poor commercial judgment, that judgment was very much coloured by the board's attempts to comply with the thrust of the proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought, by any measure, that there ought be throughout this legislation at least proper ministerial responsibility and accountability. From my experience, one of the great problems with commercial activities that have failed and have been entered into using taxpayers' funds is that at the end of the day nobody has been held accountable. Perhaps I am in a position to judge Western Australia better than most other States. There is barely an area in my State where a commercial venture entered into by an Aboriginal community has not in some way gone adrift. The prime considerations have not been commercial merit and accountability; it seems that the criterion has been the Aboriginal being in some way involved in the activity. That criterion was thought to be reasonable. That has happened in a situation in which the Minister does have some discretion and responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> More than ever there ought to be some accountability by the Minister to the Parliament of the taxpayers' funds to be expended; otherwise, there will ultimately be absolutely no sanctions at all upon the Government. The Corporation can go along merrily without having to be responsible to those appropriating the funds; and notwithstanding Senator Walsh's view, it is the Parliament and not the Executive that appropriates the funds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remember Senator Crichton-Browne becoming involved in a debate on States rights, which was his other contribution to the ATSIC debate. I wish to make only two points regarding the amendment before us. First, I find it strange that the Opposition should object to the non-inclusion in the Aboriginal Development Commission Act of those very sections which were used by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) in a way which the Opposition itself, over recent months, has been objecting to vociferously; namely, a direction given by a Minister to the ADC. The Opposition wants to carry over these very sections into ATSICDC legislation. It may well be that the Minister had used inappropriately the powers that the Opposition wants to see carried across. Nonetheless, the Opposition has objected most vociferously to the exercising of those very powers that it wants to see carried across.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My second point is very much in line with the Minister's remarks-that is, that, had the functions of ATSICDC been broadened to include a number of the economic development functions which were defined as those which were either economic or had it a reasonable expectation of becoming economic, it may have been more appropriate for the Minister to have a hand in the guidance of such an organisation. However, the organisation as envisaged by the Government is a very tight, almost bank-like organisation which is controlled within very strict economic limits. Despite what Senator Crichton-Browne has said, it will not contain only Aboriginal people; it can contain other people who are experts in the financial and economic areas. For those reasons, as the Minister has said, it is more akin to the Australian Industry Development Corporation, which, I would point out, was formed by the Opposition. Recently the Government saw fit to sell to private interests 30 per cent of this organisation, which has been extremely successful financially. Under those circumstances, and with that analogy, it seems that the Bill in its unamended form is the more appropriate version to support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Several of the points made by Senator Coulter require a response. Firstly, it is necessary to make it clear to Senator Coulter that the Opposition can have great objections to the way in which a Minister uses a particular power and yet have no objection to the existence of the power. The Opposition does not object to the existence of section 11 directions in the Aboriginal Development Commission Act. It was our Act; we proposed it. We think the section 11 directions-the capacity to give a general direction-are well conceived. However, we did not approve of the way in which the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) used that power in 1988 to sack the then eight commissioners. I think Senator Coulter would acknowledge that a distinction can be drawn, and we have done so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have to look at clause 148 as proposed. It is an extraordinary clause. The Opposition is not arguing simply that there should be a power of general ministerial direction; it is arguing that such a power should replace what is proposed. Part of our argument goes to the fact that clause 148 is most undesirable because it seeks to tell us that the Minister is not empowered to direct the Corporation in relation to any of its activities, except as expressly provided in this legislation. We think this is an absolutely extraordinary provision in the light of what we have learnt in the last year and a half. If we assume that there will be a new set of directors and acknowledge a capacity for mismanagement within some of the portfolio agencies, we can see that there is some advantage in using the section 11 direction-giving power in the ADC legislation. There may be a need for the Minister to have such a power. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 148, as drafted, is really quite extraordinary. It reads, `Except as expressly provided . . . Minister is not empowered to direct the Corporation in relation to any of its activities'. The Minister drew to our attention the provisions of clause 147 and said that that would help to explain the matter. I am sure that honourable senators have read clause 147. They will be aware that all the clause does is permit the Minister to request the Corporation board to do certain things. That is the only power the Minister has. Clause 147 (3) states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister may, after consulting the Commission, by notice in writing to the Corporation Board, request the Corporation Board to change the corporate plan in specified respects. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is interesting, because that was the impression that came across. The Minister suggested that the Minister had power to make a direction. But he has none at all. He can merely request. It follows that the Corporation can tell the Minister to get lost. I consider present clause 148 quite inappropriate. There are two steps to what we are proposing: first, that the clause should be left out and, secondly, that it should be replaced with another clause. The argument has two legs, and I make these comments against the background that we have already amended clause 143, which deals with the purposes of the Corporation. Those purposes are now to assist and enhance Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander self-management and economic self-sufficiency and to advance the commercial and economic interests of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders by accumulating and using a substantial capital asset for the benefit of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I submit to the Committee that I find it quite extraordinary that we should then be asked to agree to clause 148.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If that is not bad enough, people have objected to our attempts to replace the clause with a provision that already exists in the nearest analogous piece of legislation. I still believe that the ADC Act is a better analogy than the Australian Industry Development Corporation legislation, which seems to me to be inappropriate. The Opposition believes that amendment No. 81, as circulated, is appropriate. We certainly do not believe that clause 148, as proposed in the Bill, is appropriate. I would love to hear some defence of it. We will, as a first step at least, seek to have amendment No. 81 agreed to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was going to come to that. It brings to my mind a bowl of water for the Minister to wash his hands in when things go wrong. We are dealing with legislation involving an immense amount of money-$900m of taxpayers' money. The taxpayer elects members of the Federal Parliament, including the Senate, to safeguard that money. I am quite prepared to acknowledge that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) must give Aboriginal and Islander people self-determination. It must let them make their own decisions. But there is also a responsibility on this Parliament and on this Committee to safeguard taxpayers' moneys. The only way that we can safeguard those moneys is to have legislation that makes an appointed Minister responsible for the spending and allocation of those moneys. Clause 148 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Except as expressly provided in this Act, the Minister is not empowered to direct the Corporation in relation to any of its activities. </PARA>
<PARA>I find it unacceptable that the Minister withdraws from any part in the decision-making under this legislation. It is inappropriate and incorrect for a Minister to walk away from the decision-making. I presume that the clause exists to exonerate the Minister from anything that may go wrong with this legislation. It is a complete reversal. It is going from the sublime to the ridiculous, considering the power that the Minister exercised when he sacked the previous board of the Aboriginal Development Commission. That was a tremendous abuse of power. But that does not require this legislation to take all responsibility away from a Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> This nation is governed by a Westminster system. As someone said, it may not be the best system in the world but no-one has ever been able to come up with a better system of government. </PARA>

ATSIC will be out the window and everyone will be pleased, including all Aboriginal and Islander people, who have shown their absolute astonishment that a government would come up with this type of legislation. Until that day we have to amend and make the best of this legislation. Under the Westminster system of government, Ministers are responsible for government spending. There is not a portfolio where taxpayers' money is spent that does not have a Minister responsible for the allocation of those funds. Yet we have in this legislation, this ATSIC proposal, a clause that will exonerate a Minister from all responsibility. Senator Tate has given no explanation. The reason that he has not given any explanation probably is that, even though he is a persuasive lawyer, he cannot come up with a reason why our amendment should not replace clause 148.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I listened with great attentiveness to Senator Coulter to hear whether he could come up with some argument that would enlighten me. Unfortunately, all he could do was abuse my colleague Senator Crichton-Browne, which I thought was quite wrong. Senator Crichton-Browne was making a good contribution to this debate. He has followed the ATSIC legislation through. He has spoken on it a number of times. He certainly spoke on it during the second reading debate. I recall that he has made two or three contributions in the committee stage. I certainly am not persuaded by any argument put forward by the Government or by Senator Coulter that clause 148 should not be replaced by our amendment. </PARA>

Of course, he was referring to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. In relation to ATSIC we said that a power of general directions ought to be vested in the Minister. We have agreed to that. This is the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation. It is a different body. Because the honourable senator's earlier amendments were not carried, my argument has been that we are now faced with a Corporation, the structure, the purposes, the goals, the objectives and the statutory charter of which are more akin to the Australian Industry Development Corporation than to the old ADC. In fact, in relation to the AIDC, a clause similar to clause 148 is to be found in its statutory charter. So they are the real reasons. For the sake of the record I wanted to correct that particular understanding of Senator Boswell's.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note the Minister's quite proper correction of the figure that I think was inadvertently used by my colleague Senator Boswell. But, with respect, while that particular point is true-that the funds deployed by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation would not constitute the whole of the $900m, which, as the Minister rightly says, concerns the total area of ambit of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC)-I rise to support very strongly the views that have been put by my colleagues Senator Peter Baume and Senator Boswell in opposing this clause and supporting the amendment that has been moved by Senator Peter Baume on behalf of the Opposition. While the Minister has conceded by his response to Senator Boswell that there are grounds for sufficient concern on the Government's part as to the operation of ATSIC, the Government has agreed that a power of direction should be included in the Bill to cover that-to cover the totality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put it to the Minister that, after all, the area we are now talking about, admittedly the more confined area of the Corporation, is not negligible. I think it is in that area, in particular, that there might be the kinds of risks to which I think Senator Peter Baume and Senator Boswell have referred. One only has to think of a couple of other corporations seen operating in recent times. For example, the Victorian Economic Development Corporation has been spraying Victorian taxpayers' money around in all directions. One would think that, if there were any sense of ministerial probity left in the Victorian Government, it would have resulted in Mr Jolly's resignation long ago. Surely it ought to be acknowledged by the Minister that we have here the potential-I put it no more strongly than that-for the most extraordinary mismanagement, or perhaps even misappropriation, to occur without, apparently, there being any capacity on the part of the Minister to give directions of a general kind which would make that inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept the thrust of the amendment moved by Senator Baume which is designed to ensure that any directions that are given should not allow the Minister to interfere in a particular case or a particular individual's affairs as they are being handled by the Corporation. However, I would have thought that it was crystal clear that the Corporation needs some guidelines; for example, some guidelines that might preclude it from operating in a particular area which the Government might well regard as being inappropriate. If the Government were to so regard it, the citizens of Australia might equally so regard it. </PARA>

I find it even more difficult to understand why the Australian Democrats should want to resist it because it seems to me to be no more than a normal precaution designed to buttress the desirability of fiscal probity in an area in which, it must be said, there will be no lack of potential critics looking for actions which might be thought to infringe that probity.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly because I always wish Hansard to record my arguments. For reasons which escape me, Senator Coulter suggested that I had claimed that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation Board would have on it not only Aborigines, but also experts. I find that grossly obnoxious. I did not say that. I made no comment about the composition of the Board. I said that ultimately if the Minister were not held in some part accountable to the Parliament, the associated risks would be grave. We have seen that with respect to a number of matters, not the least being WA Incorporated and the like. We have also seen it in the failings of the Department. In the last couple of years it was highlighted in no better place than the Auditor-General's report. I would have thought that the amendment proposed by Senator Peter Baume was eminently reasonable. It does not seek disclosure of commercial information of a confidential or sensitive nature and it does not seek to interfere in an improper fashion. It just seeks to ensure that there is some measure of ministerial responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am interested to note the reference to the powers of the Minister. The proposed amendment emphatically states for all to understand that the Minister is not empowered to direct the Corporation in respect of any of its activities, as if to say, `In the event that this thing runs away at a gallop, we all want you to understand it is not a responsibility of the Minister'. If certain matters which are subsequently disclosed cause concern or anxiety to the public or the Parliament, if questions of that nature are raised in Estimates committees, the Committee of the Whole or in the Senate, the Minister can simply refer us to clause 148. The link between the Minister and expenditure ought to be much more tangible and real than that proposed by the Government. I note that thus far Senator Tate has not sought in any way to justify the proposed provisions of the Bill, except to say in some obscure way that he imagines that our anxieties, as manifested in this proposal, are of no account. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to the capitalisation of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation. The Committee will recall that the fund of the Corporation will pick up the $20m that currently rests with the Aboriginal Development Commission. In this year's Budget Papers, it was also revealed that the Government has set out its plans in relation to the capital base of the ATSIC Development Corporation. In the last Budget, it indicated that it would be appropriating $40m over four years, starting next financial year. Whilst that matter has been alluded to in a number of other places in recent weeks, it is important to note that therefore the Corporation would initially have a capital base of $60m, which is very significant. Senator Boswell referred to the fact that the annual appropriation for the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio is in excess of $900m; however, we cannot step aside from this very important $60m capital base of the Corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a procedural suggestion which may help the Committee. A moment ago I mentioned that there were two questions in relation to the matter before us. The first is that we find clause 148, as proposed, inappropriate. Secondly, we have proposed an amendment to take its place. They are really two separate questions. I had the option of later moving an amendment that the clause be left out. However, there may be an easier way to do it. Amendment No. 81, circulated in my name, proposes first to leave out the clause and, secondly, to insert another clause. I put it to Senator Coulter that they are separate questions. One could look at clause 148 as proposed and say that we think that it is not an appropriate way to go and we do not want to have it. We could then form a separate view about the amendment proposed by the Opposition. I suggest to you, Mr Temporary Chairman, that you put first the question that the clause be left out. Should that be successful, the motion to insert the clause would follow as another question. In that way, I would not have to move the subsequent motion which I have prepared.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is extremely difficult to see the difference between what Senator Baume is suggesting and what is already in the Bill. Senator Baume's proposed subclause 148 (1) states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Corporation shall perform its functions and exercise its powers in accordance with such general directions as are given to it by the Minister in writing. </PARA>
<PARA>All the other subclauses modify that and say that the Minister shall not do this or that, or shall cause certain things to be laid or not laid before the Parliament. The Bill already provides that the Minister by notice in writing to the Corporation Board may request the Corporation Board to change the corporate plan in specified respects and that such a proposal must be laid before the Parliament. That provides the sort of mechanism needed. I have difficulty in seeing the difference between that and `such general directions'. What precisely does `such general directions' mean? They can be only general directions. All the speakers for the Opposition have indicated clearly that the Minister cannot give specific directions; they are very general directions. They would be the same sorts of directions that the Minister would give in suggesting a modification to the corporate plan. Therefore, it seems to me that the suggested amendment to the clause, after leaving out clause 148, simply is an expansion of what is already in the Bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two matters raised by Senator Coulter warrant a response. The first is that if one looks at proposed clause 146 of the Bill, which deals with the corporate plan, one will see part of the answer to what Senator Coulter has just said, that is, that the Corporation shall from time to time prepare a corporate plan and that the interval of time shall be somewhere between three and five years. That provision is contained in subclause 2 of clause 146. So the corporate plan once down is not to be changed for three years. There is quite a difference because the Minister may find it necessary, for reasons which my colleagues and Senator Stone have set out, to issue a general direction one year after the corporate plan has come down. The Corporation would have no power to vary its corporate plan-none whatsoever. It is bound by statute not to.</PARA></TALK.START>

Perhaps the Minister is saying that `from time to time' means that the Corporation could do it more often but, as we read it, it would probably be a corporate plan to last at least three years. The other point that Senator Coulter has made is that he cannot see the difference between what is in the Bill and what we are proposing by way of amendment. I will not take very long but I just say to the honourable senator that there is all the difference in the world between a capacity to request something and a capacity to give a general direction. Those who have been on either side-senior officers in the Public Service or Ministers-will know that that difference is very significant. One may request all one wishes, but the Corporation will be under no compulsion to take any notice of that request if it does not wish to, whereas where there is a power to give general direction that general direction will be obeyed. That is the difference. I am surprised that Senator Coulter could not see that. Having said that, I do not wish to prolong the debate unduly.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will add a few words to what Senator Peter Baume has just said because I think it is crucial, particularly in the light of Senator Coulter's own point on the matter. Senator Coulter said that he could not see a difference between what is being proposed by the Opposition to give the Minister a power of direction in this area in general, subject to a number of qualifications which are set out in the remainder of the Opposition's amendment, and the arrangements in relation to the changing of the corporate plan. Subclause 3 of clause 147, which is the clause relating to the consideration of the corporate plan by the Minister, states that, after various other procedures have occurred:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Minister may, after consulting with the Commission, by notice in writing to the Corporation Board, request the Corporation Board to change the corporate plan in specified respects. </PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Peter Baume has just pointed out, that is where the Minister's power stops. He can make a request, but there is no requirement upon the Corporation to adhere to the request.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do not proceed with the rest of amendment No. 81. Having failed to leave out the clause, there is no purpose in trying to proceed with substituting new words. It has been drawn to my attention by officers assisting the Minister that a word has been left out of an amendment to which we agreed earlier. I draw the attention of the Committee to the Journals of the Senate of 4 October 1989, page 2089, and to that amendment which was moved by me which sought to insert a new clause in the second part of clause 88 concerning secrecy. The officers have pointed out to me that the word `except' is missing from proposed clause 88a (3) (b). The subclause should read `to produce in court any document referred to in that subsection except when it is necessary to do so for the purposes of this Act, or of a prosecution for an offence against this Act'. I understand that we moved virtually the same amendment in another part of the Bill in which the word `except' was included. Therefore, I seek leave of the Committee to have that amendment adjusted to include the word `except' in the place I have indicated.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (82) Page 61, after subclause 150 (1) insert the following new subclause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(1a) The power of the Corporation to guarantee loans to a particular person is subject to the following limitations:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the Corporation shall not, without the prior approval of the Treasurer, guarantee a loan of more than $1,000,000 to the person;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the Corporation shall not, without the prior approval of the Treasurer, guarantee a loan to the person if the amount of the loan, together with the outstanding amounts of any other loans to the person guaranteed by the Corporation, would in total be more than $1,000,000.''. </PARA>
<PARA> (83) Page 61, subclause 150 (2), line 24, after ``is'', insert ``further''. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment No. 82 is an amendment to clause 150 and seeks to add a new subclause (1a) after subclause (1). Clause 150 concerns guarantees. The proposed new subclause reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The power of the Corporation to guarantee loans to a particular person is subject to the following limitations . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It then sets out two limitations. In essence it says that the guarantee shall be limited to $1m either for a single guarantee or for the total of all guarantees for a person. There is a consequential amendment-amendment No. 83, which I have moved-which seeks to add the word `further' after the word `is' in subclause (2). </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall the experience of the Aboriginal Development Commission in October 1988 in relation to the Woden Town Club. I recall that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand),who made great play of the fact that he had not approved any expenditure for the poker machine club, had approved the giving of a guarantee. This clause concerns guarantees and this amendment concerns the giving of guarantees. What emerged from the Woden Town Club experience was a demonstration that the giving of a guarantee can be just as much a charge on taxpayers' funds as the giving of a loan or a grant, especially when it is a guarantee which will be called in. One has to assume that the giving of any guarantee is a guarantee which may have to be met. Many of us here are parents and many of us will have had the experience of being approached by our young sons or daughters. The usual statement is, `Dad, I want to buy a motor car, and I have to get someone to guarantee a loan'. Of course, dads guarantee the loans, but we are well aware of the fact that we may end up, given the worst case scenario, having to pay out that guarantee. The giving of a guarantee implies that it may have to be met. All that the Opposition's amendment seeks to do is put some limitations on the guarantees which the Corporation may give. We say that the Corporation shall not, without the prior approval of the Treasurer, guarantee a loan of more than $1m to the person. We are reasonable people. It is not as though we are trying to limit the guarantee to $50,000 or $100,000; we are talking about large amounts of money. The real question is whether anyone should give guarantees for more than $1m. We seek to limit it in that way. Clause 150 (1) reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Where the Corporation Board is satisfied that money lent or to be lent to any person . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It conveys the impression that it is talking about guarantees to persons and we are merely saying that the guarantee should not involve more than $1m to one person without the prior approval of the Treasurer. If there were a special case, some special, exceptional circumstance, the Treasurer might well approve the giving of a guarantee for more than $1m. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Committee again of the experience of the Woden Town Club where the guarantee was called in, where the money that had been guaranteed had to be produced. A guarantee is a potential payout. We are well aware that there is a subclause in the Bill which gives the Treasurer power to influence the overall level of guarantees which the Corporation may grant, but that involves only the overall level. The subclauses we are proposing would give an added measure of control in the case of single large loans-and those are the loans that worry us. We go further because we are aware that some people are the subject of several guarantees. As a father I would look very coldly upon any proposal from any child of mine who said to me, `There is a guarantee still out but I want you to make a new guarantee'. I would be quite resistant to that request. </PARA>
<PARA> We propose in this amendment that the Corporation shall not, without the prior approval of the Treasurer, guarantee a loan-and we provide that special cases could be met by going to the Treasurer-if the amount of that loan, together with the amount of any other loans, guaranteed by the Corporation, come to more than $1m. One million dollars is a lot of money even today, with our devalued currency. It is a very large guarantee to be giving. All we are asking is that, in the interests of prudent and proper administration, in the interests of protecting the rights of the many tens of thousands of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders who will be looking to this Corporation to make their lot better, there be some limit on the extent and level of guarantees which can be given without approval from the Treasurer. I remind the Committee that, if the Corporation at any time wants to go above the $1m limit, we have proposed in our amendment a way in which that may be done. We understand that there may be special circumstances, special occasions, and we believe that going to the Treasurer for those is good and proper public administration. We believe the amendment is one which the Committee would wish to support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree; we just lost the vote. However, the proposal now before the Committee relates to the giving of loans. Senator Peter Baume has referred to the financial situation of the Woden Town Club. This is probably a very appropriate example to use. Again, I know that it is always convenient, when we have Senate Estimates committees, to solicit new information, but at Senate Estimates Committee E on 10 October, last week, we were able to ascertain that, despite what the Minister sought to do with regard to the financing of the Woden Town Club, particularly with regard to the purchasing of poker machines, the actual finances to the Woden Town Club in the 12 months since have blown out even further. We found that the ADC is the landlord of Bonner House, in which the Woden Town Club operates. In that 12-month period the Minister made a commitment to the Parliament that there would be no financing of that nature. We have now found that the Board has, in effect, not carried out its full responsibility and collected rent for the 12-month period. The Committee will recall that in October 1988 outstanding rentals to the Woden Town Club were $68,000. We ascertained in the Senate Estimates Committee last week that, as at 31 August 1989, outstanding rentals to the Woden Town Club are now $175,000. So that is another $105,000 of unpaid rent. In effect, the Woden Town Club has not paid rent in the past 12 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last year the Minister, Mr Hand, gave a commitment to the Parliament that in the financial restructuring and reorganisation of the Woden Town Club there would be no demand on this Parliament to provide the additional finance. But because of this restructuring and the fact that, in the interim, the Woden Town Club has gone into receivership, the financing of that club has now been subjected to and is caught up in various court procedures with regard to outstanding liabilities. In effect, we have found that, despite Mr Hand's assurances to the Parliament, the Woden Town Club has now been allowed, through various and devious means, to slip into arrears to the tune of another $105,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I appreciate that the limits that Senator Peter Baume has put forward in the amendments to this legislation go beyond this-we are talking in terms of $1m-the Commission or the Board is seeking to bypass the very directions and agreements that were reached at that time. I, therefore, fully support amendments Nos 82 and 83. They are very necessary where the Commission could be underwriting significant projects. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think there is some incorrect wording in the clause which is before us, which the Minister might care to pick up. Subclause 2 states, `the payment of which may at any time be the subject to guarantees under this section'. Surely it should be, `may . . . be the subject of guarantees', or `may . . . be subject to guarantees'. We should either take out the word `the' or change the `to' to `of'. I just raise that as a technical point.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the definite article should be removed, should it not?-`at any time be . . . subject to guarantees'. I will take advice while I am talking. My major concern in relation to the amendments moved by the Opposition is that, once again, they are probably consequential. I think they were drafted at a time when the Opposition hoped to secure an expansion of the role of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation to include some of the sorts of programs that the old Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) used to undertake. Indeed, I think the defeat of that series of earlier amendments leads to a situation where the Commercial Development Corporation more clearly has a mandate, a charter. In clause 145 (1) the Parliament requires the Corporation to act `in accordance with sound business principles'. I do not want to draw Senator Stone into the debate unnecessarily, but when we go out into the community looking for members of the Board of this Corporation, structured as it now is by the Parliament in this narrowly focused way, I wonder whether we might need to take account of clause 154 (4), which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A Director who is not a Commissioner shall be a person who the Minister is satisfied has experience and expertise in industry, commerce or finance. </PARA>
<PARA>So at least six out of the nine directors have to be persons with expertise in industry, commerce or finance. How would they feel, going onto a board of this importance, if their decision as to whether a guarantee might be extended to a loan of, say, $1,250,000 had to be second-guessed by the Treasurer? If I were a leading person in the commercial, industrial or financial life of Australia and I were asked, as a matter of public service, to go onto this Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation, to give of my time and to make these important decisions and so on, I might feel that my expertise was being somewhat devalued and my role was being minimised by the fact that the Treasurer was breathing down my neck or looking over my shoulder and second-guessing my decisions, which, as required by the Parliament, were in accordance with sound business principles and in accordance with all the professional expertise I could bring to bear. As I have said, if my decision needed the concurrence of the Treasurer, to put it at its least, it would appear that from day to day I would actually be subject to the veto of the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that might lead to difficulties in putting together a good board. Basically, for that reason I feel that this provision should be resisted. I can understand some of the arguments of prudence and caution that have been put, but I really think that, with the Corporation as it is now structured and with the sort of board we would be trying to put together, Senator Baume's amendment would be counterproductive in trying to secure the services of the best people possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nothing that the Minister has said really reflects upon the quality or need for these amendments. The need for sound business principles does not in any way exclude our trying to limit guarantees to $1m without the authority of the Treasurer. The fact that one has to ask the Treasurer if one wants to give more than $1m in no way is a reflection upon the competence of the Board or upon the people who may be asked to serve upon the Board. I simply do not follow the argument. The question is: Do we wish to see some reasonable limit-we suggest that $1m is quite generous-put upon the guarantees which may be made to any person?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is important at this stage to put into perspective what kind of capital the Corporation will have to play with. It will not take long. We know that the ADC's capital fund will be transferred to the Corporation and that, in theory, would be available, but the capital funds stands at $20m. The last government contribution to the fund was made in 1982-83, when $1m was provided, and that was during the time of the Fraser Government. Since then, during the entire life of the Labor Government, not one cent has been paid, by way of contribution, to the capital fund. The Government and my colleague Senator Tambling talked about the promise of $40m over four years starting next year. Next year never comes. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Government will not be here, but if the Government wants us to believe that it intends to put money into the capital fund, why was no money put in this year? It really sits very poorly with some of the things that the Minister has said. He has modified what he has said on various occasions. In Foundations for the Future, the Minister had this to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Act will provide that the AEDC's capital base-</PARA>
<PARA>the Aboriginal Economic Development Corporation was then the name of the Corporation-</PARA>
<PARA>shall be $60 million, of which $40 million (including the $20 million in assets of the ADC's Capital Fund) would be paid on commencement, with the remainder in equal instalments in 1989-90 and 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the Minister's statement to the Parliament in Foundations for the Future. We can give that away, because that is no longer happening. In his second reading speech on the Bill, the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Corporation's capital base will comprise the $20 million which has been allocated to the Capital Fund of the ADC since its establishment-</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate: by coalition governments-</PARA>
<PARA>plus an additional $40 million to be allocated over this and the next three financial years. As a consequence, the Corporation will have a very significant capital base. </PARA>
<PARA>There is nothing in either last year's or this year's Budget by way of contribution to the capital fund. The Minister goes on to repeat that kind of statement. Of course, the $20m from the ADC capital fund is not available to the Corporation. It is all tied up in the main asset owned by the Corporation, which is Bonner House, but there will be some income from that money. If the Corporation was to have by 1990-91 a capital base of $60m-and it will not-it might be thought that the Corporation would be able to play a significant part in encouraging Aboriginal economic development. But several things make that less likely. First, I have already mentioned that the ADC's $20m is, for the most part, already tied up in Bonner House. Second, the Corporation is not going to be allowed to use the $60m, if it ever gets the $60m-and I do not believe it will-for leverage. It cannot borrow money unless that is approved by the Treasurer. So the funds available to the Corporation are unlikely, even if the capital fund is built up, to be more than the interest on either $40m or $40m plus whatever income comes in from Bonner House. The interest on $40m, even at 15 per cent, is $6m. There have to be some administration and setting-up costs, and I think that the Corporation will be very lucky to have $5m available. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is merely proposing that, of that very limited amount of money, no guarantee in respect of a person of more than $1m-that is, one-fifth of the annual income, as we work it out-should be possible without the approval of the Treasurer. We think that is entirely proper and that the amendment which we have moved is necessary. </PARA>

Anyone who is considering an appointment to a directorship or the offer of an appointment to a directorship of this kind emanating from the Minister will obviously have to look at the whole legislation and consider very much the body of which he is to become a director. Without in any way disparaging the likely activities of this body, I would have thought that the proposal that the guarantee power be limited to not more than $1m in any individual case would be the least of the concerns of such a person considering appointment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendment that has just been moved by Senator Peter Baume. I think it is self-evident that a body cannot serve two masters. Clause 151 suggests that the Corporation is going to have two masters. I do not think that that is conceivable. It does not make for good administration or for an appropriate allocation of responsibility. When something goes wrong-no doubt something will, assuming that this body ever comes into being-in the affairs of the Corporation, are we to have a situation where we do not know who to blame? Are we to blame the Commission for intervening in the affairs of the Corporation? Will we be able to blame the Minister? Senator Baume's amendment is directed to a perfectly proper parliamentary objective of ensuring, firstly, that we know who to blame and, secondly, that it is the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I move the next amendment I have a question to ask of the Minister relating to clause 152 which deals with the board of directors of the Corporation. Clause 152 provides that there should be nine directors-a chairperson, a deputy chairperson and seven other members. Will the Minister explain how the figure nine was reached? Does the Board of the Corporation really need as many as nine members? The sums of money involved are not very large by merchant bank standards; in fact, they will be very small. By the Minister's own account, even if his previous agenda were adhered to, which it will not be, the capital fund will not reach $60m for three years yet. We are talking about very small amounts of money. The fund will not be available for investment, nor for use as leverage. Only the income will be available. Therefore, the amount of money will be fairly small potatoes. Does it really require nine members to administer such a small concern?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know precisely how the figure nine was arrived at, rather than perhaps eight or seven. Quite clearly it is desirable that there be available to this Corporation an input from the sorts of persons that I spoke of and that Senator Stone adverted to, people with expertise in industry, commerce or finance, supplemented with-or they could be the same people-the desirability of having Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders on the Corporation Board. Whilst I cannot specifically defend precisely the figure nine, I believe that the need for a full range of such interests to be represented is evident. It was evidently thought that the figure nine gave a sufficient number around the table to ensure that the important decisions to be made by the Commercial Development Corporation are considered and deliberated by a sufficient number of persons who are, or represent, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and who have the expertise which is obviously required.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (b) a fourth Director becomes a Commissioner;</PARA>
<PARA>that fourth Director ceases to be a Director.''. </PARA>
<PARA> (90) Page 65, subclause 164 (2), line 7, leave out ``including at least one Commissioner''. </PARA>
<PARA>These amendments deal with the relationship between the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation (ATSICDC) and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). The first amendment, No. 85, is one of the important ones. As clause 154 (3) stands on page 62 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill 1989, it reads:</PARA>
<PARA>At least 3 of the Directors shall be Commissioners. </PARA>
<PARA>That imposes a requirement that at least three, and possibly more, of the directors should be commissioners. The effect of the amendment which we have proposed is that those words should be taken out and replaced with the words `Up to 3 of the Directors may be Commissioners'-not `shall be' but `may be'. If it is thought, for reasons that have to do with expertise or appropriateness, that up to three directors should be commissioners, the Minister should have that capacity but it is very hard to justify the clause as it presently stands unless one envisages a subordinate role for the Commercial Development Corporation qua ATSIC itself. If one has that view of a subordinate role, that is fair enough. But we do not; we think the relationship of the Commercial Development Corporation with ATSIC itself should not be a subordinate one. Each agency has a proper role to play, subject to the Minister and, through him, subject to the wishes of the Parliament. If amendment No. 85 is agreed to, it would tend to break the nexus between the Commission and the Corporation because a Minister might decide that one-or perhaps even none-of the directors should be a commissioner. But at least it would provide a different relationship and a different set of possibilities for the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposed amendment No. 86 seeks to leave out subclause (4) of clause 154 and insert a new subclause. Clause 154 (4) as it is presently written reads:</PARA>
<PARA> A Director who is not a Commissioner shall be a person who the Minister is satisfied has experience and expertise in industry, commerce or finance. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that my colleague Senator Stone has referred to that proposed subsection already. In this amendment we propose a slightly different form of words-each director, not just the ones who are not commissioners. In a sense it is consequential upon agreement to amendment No. 85. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> (4) each Director shall be a person who the Minister is satisfied has experience in:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) industry, commerce or finance; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community life or enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA>We seek to require that those who are appointed directors shall have some kind of qualification which is relevant to the task of the Commercial Development Corporation. As we have proposed it, amendment No. 86 would be an improvement on clause 154 (4) as it presently stands. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments Nos 87 and 88 are consequential amendments. In clause 156 we want to take out the words `not being a Commissioner'. If amendment No. 85 is agreed to those words are no longer necessary. That also applies to amendment No. 88. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 89 seeks to amend clause 162 on page 64 of the Bill. We want to leave out subclause (3) with a view to inserting new words. At the present time subclause (3) reads:</PARA>
<PARA> A Director who was, at the time of his or her appointment, a Commissioner, ceases to be a Director if he is or she ceases to be a Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA>If we go back to amendment No. 85 and no longer have a nexus between commissioners and directors-if the Minister may just appoint those who he thinks are appropriate, with a limit of up to three directors-if someone ceases to be a director it does not matter. There is no reason why he or she should cease to be a commissioner in those circumstances. When we looked at that we realised that it was necessary to insert more words because there could be some other anomalous situations. We propose to put in a new subclause to read:</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Where:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) 3 of the Directors are Commissioners; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a fourth Director becomes a Commissioner; that fourth Director ceases to be a Director. </PARA>
<PARA>That merely means that there cannot be more than three commissioners who are directors. That is quite consistent with amendment No. 85. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, amendment No. 90 seeks to amend clause 164 at page 65 of the Bill by leaving out the words `including at least one Commissioner' where they appear in subclause (2). At the present time, clause 164 (2) reads:</PARA>
<PARA> At a meeting of the Corporation Board a quorum is constituted by 5 directors including at least one Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA>It is very important that that be amended and that amendment No. 90 be agreed to. Consider what would happen if there was a conflict between the ATSIC Board and the Corporation Board. As the clause is presently drafted, ATSIC could prevent any meetings of the Corporation Board simply by refusing to allow any of its commissioners to attend. As the clause is presently drafted a quorum could not be constituted unless one commissioner was present. Again I do not think that that is the proper relationship between the Commission and the Commercial Development Corporation. If the threshold question of proposed amendment No. 85 is accepted it follows that this proposed amendment to clause 164 is a proper and necessary one. I have an indication from the Government that it may find those amendments acceptable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to confirm, as indicated earlier in the committee stage of this debate, that the Government will accept Opposition amendments Nos 85 to 90 inclusive. It does so on the basis that it shares the objective that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation ought not to be in any sense subordinate to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. It was certainly not intended that that be the case. It is extremely important that the Corporation develop its own personality out in the arena of commercial and financial life in Australia and that it be seen to be quite distinct from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission which has its own charter in clause 17 in respect of the sort of enterprise loans and grants that it might make available. The Commission has quite a distinct role from that of the Corporation. It is important that the Corporation achieve a distinctive role-acting, as it must, in accordance with sound business principles. With the sort of board constituted in the way now indicated, with the acceptance of these amendments, I believe its distinctive role will become even more apparent than was the case in the way in which we originally drafted the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill. The Government accepts these amendments and believes that they advance an objective which is shared in this Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>(91) Page 62, clause 155, lines 15 to 28, leave out the clause, insert the following clause:</PARA>
<PARA>Selection of Directors</PARA>
<PARA> ``155. Whenever there is, or is expected to be, a vacancy in an office of Director, the Minister may consult the Commission about a suitable appointee.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment seeks to leave out clause 155 and insert a different clause. Clause 155 deals with the selection of directors and what should happen when there is, or is expected to be, a vacancy in an office of director. The clause, as it is drafted, sets up an elaborate to-and-fro consultation with the Commission about who might be the appropriate appointees. I return to a point made, I think, by the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) in relation to an earlier amendment. The Minister envisages that some people of substantial talent and experience from the commercial or business worlds may be considered for appointment as a director. I doubt whether many of them would subject themselves to the process laid down in clause 155 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be circumstances in which there is, or is expected to be, a vacancy. As we have already agreed to the earlier amendments concerning the appointment of Directors and as we have already lessened the nexus between the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation, the amendment we are now proposing seems to be a proper one and a much simpler provision. Instead of the complicated provision in the Bill at present, we propose a provision which says that whenever there is, or is expected to be, a vacancy in an office of director, the Minister may consult the Commission about a suitable appointee. It makes it quite clear that the appointment is the Minister's prerogative and that the Commission, at most, can have an advisory role to the Minister, if the Minister so wishes. I commend amendment No. 91. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment seeks to leave out subclauses (12) and (13) of clause 164. We have already amended clause 164 (2) by taking out the words, `including at least one Commissioner'. As presently drafted subclause 12 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation Chairperson shall, when he or she convenes a meeting, notify the Chief Executive Officer of the time and place fixed for the meeting. </PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear, from going back to the beginning of this Bill, that the Chief Executive Officer referred to is the Chief Executive Office of ATSIC. As it is presently drafted, this clause establishes a subservient relationship between the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation and ATSIC. In view of the amendments to which we have already agreed, it is appropriate that subclause (12) should be left out. </PARA>
<PARA> Subclause (13), as it is presently proposed, states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Chief Executive Officer is entitled to be present at meetings of the Corporation board but is not entitled to vote at any such meeting. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, this is an attempt to link the Commercial Development Corporation and ATSIC in an undesirable way. In view of the earlier amendments to which we have agreed, subclause (13), too, can be left out. There is no reason why the Chief Executive Officer of ATSIC should sit in on Corporation meetings. The Corporation will have its line of responsibility to the Minister, and we have already accepted a number of amendments to achieve that. Leaving out subclauses (12) and (13) is an appropriate consequence of the earlier amendments. </PARA>

<PARA>I have moved these amendments together so as to limit the amount of time which the Committee will have to consider this matter. It is interesting to note that this ATSIC debate has gone through several phases. One phase was the initial proposal and the responses which came from it. Another phase occurred during the time that the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs was meeting. This committee, on which Senator Boswell, Senator Coulter and I served, looked in great detail at many of the issues surrounding the introduction of ATSIC and the ways in which it might operate. Another phase followed the report of the Select Committee and the Government's acceptance of some, but not all, of its recommendations. Another phase was the consideration of the revised legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is entitled to believe that the Australian Democrats have a particular view in relation to the electoral roll. The Opposition is also entitled to believe that the Australian Democrats had certain minimum positions from which they would not depart. We had that view because of public statements made by the Australian Democrats through their spokesman, Senator Coulter. I select a few of the things that Senator Coulter has said to the Australian people through the press at various stages along this journey. On 12 April 1989-I think this was after the Select Committee had reported and probably after the Government had responded to the report-Senator Coulter was interviewed by Mr John Shovelan on what I think was an Australian Broadcasting Corporation AM program. Peter Thompson, in introducing that segment, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . but Democrat spokesman on Aboriginal Affairs, Senator John Coulter, told AM's John Shovelan that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission will remain on the drawing board until the Minister meets all the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Coulter was heard to say:</PARA>
<PARA>We're disgusted with the way in which the Minister has proceeded with this and of course he gave no inkling whatsoever of the establishment of an interim commission of five hand-picked people. </PARA>
<PARA>We may have something to ask Senator Coulter later about the interim commission. Senator Coulter was asked what he was disgusted about and he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Well, frankly it just flies right in the face of the whole thrust of ATSIC which the Minister all along has been saying is about self-determination and self-management. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say certain other things. Senator Coulter was also quoted in an article headed `Democrats' Libs team up to force Bill changes' by Lenore Taylor in the Australian dated 23 May 1989. What did he have to say? If it is not true, Senator Coulter can tell us. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> But sources in the Australian Democrats and the Opposition said yesterday that they would be supporting amendments in line with the rest of the committee's recommendations-</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate-that is the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs-</PARA>
<PARA>which were not adopted by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> These include two that are not negotiable for Mr Hand: the establishment of a separate black electoral roll for the ATSIC elections, and giving a wider range of activities to a proposed ``Aboriginal development bank''. </PARA>
<PARA>Later the article says:</PARA>
<PARA> But the Democrats' spokesman on Aboriginal affairs, Senator John Coulter, has said both that he expects the legislation to pass the Senate and that he will insist on several amendments, including those rejected by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>We read the newspapers and we listen to AM. We are reasonable people; when an honourable senator says something such as this we take it that he means what he says. Senator Coulter was also reported in the Canberra Times of 11 May 1989 in an article by Jeannie Zakharov. Her mother is not in the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will test this. The Democrats have roared like lions until the wind has started to blow. Jeannie Zakharov's article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But they still want the Government to agree to further changes, the party's spokesman on Aboriginal Affairs, Senator John Coulter, said yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> He said the major concern was the ``unworkable'' election system in the Bill to establish the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on, the article says:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has consistently opposed both the separate electoral roll and separate preamble. But Senator Coulter said yesterday he expected Mr Hand to accept the amendments to get the Bill through. </PARA>
<PARA>I think Senator Coulter is right. Mr Hand will want this Bill. He will accept it with the preamble taken out. If Senator Coulter intends to proceed with the amendment which the Democrats have circulated to have the preamble removed, Mr Hand will accept the Bill. Mr Hand will also accept the Bill if there is a separate electoral roll. He will not refuse to have ATSIC. This is merely an attempt to make the Bill workable. I will come to the seven amendments in a little while. The Democrats have been very courageous whilever no pressure has been placed on them. An article in the Northern Territory News of 27 February states:</PARA>
<PARA> A Democrat committee member, Senator John Coulter, described Mr Hand's McCarthyist reference as outrageous and an attempt to intimidate the committee. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind honourable senators and members of the Committee that Mr Hand had described the Senate Select Committee as McCarthyist in its operation. Senator Coulter also said that he was furious at Mr Hand's remarks. He said that there were some recommended amendments the Democrats would consider crucial. We have already heard from some of the other articles what some of those amendments included. </PARA>
<PARA> We have already tried Senator Coulter out on the question of malapportionment. We put a very simple proposition to the Australian Democrats: that is, that an electoral system which proposes malapportionment of the extent which is present in the ATSIC legislation should be unacceptable. It is a shame that a Labor Government that wants the people of Australia to vote at a referendum against malapportionment for whites is willing to impose a malapportionment of this degree for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. We gave Senator Coulter the opportunity to vote on that matter because we thought that he had indicated that malapportionment was inappropriate. We were impressed by an article in the Age of 24 January 1989 by Mark Metherell in which Senator Coulter is quoted. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats' member on the committee, Senator John Coulter, said after yesterday's hearing: ``If you build into ATSIC a reliance upon ministerial veto to overcome defects in disproportionate representation-</PARA>
<PARA>they are the words Senator Coulter is quoted as having used-</PARA>
<PARA>then it seems to undermine the basic principle of self-determination on which ATSIC is supposed to rest.''</PARA>
<PARA>We actually thought that Senator Coulter meant that, so we proposed some amendments to deal with malapportionment. We brought them to this Committee and we argued them on their merits, which is what we should be doing before this Committee in the Senate. We argued that the malapportionment was wrong and should be overcome. We were encouraged by the fact that Senator Coulter was on record as saying that he disapproved of malapportionment. But he got up and said that the Minister had told him that if he did not accept the malapportionment the Bill would not go through. It is absolutely not correct. I have been a Minister; I know the tricks that Ministers get up to. Of course he would have accepted the Bill. He simply bluffed Senator Coulter out of it by making a threat. We have all these brave statements on the public record, in the newspapers and on the radio waves, but when put to the test, nothing happened. </PARA>
<PARA> We now come to the matter of separate electoral rolls. This has been one concern of Senator Coulter, representing the Democrats, in all the areas we have been working together. </PARA>

We asked: How can we trigger the recall provisions unless we have an electorate number which we can test and trust?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will have to wait and see. The Opposition has sought to produce some amendments which will give effect to what we understood was Senator Coulter's proposition and which we have agreed to. It has been necessary to produce seven amendments. Because they are related, I have sought to move them together and deal with them en bloc. The first amendment, which is to clause 110 at page 46 of the Bill, seeks to leave out paragraph (2) (a). Paragraph (2) (a) provides that the matters that may be dealt with in the electoral rules include the use of an electoral roll or voter cards. The Opposition is saying simply that there shall be an electoral roll so that subclause becomes unnecessary. The second of these related amendments is also to clause 110, at page 47, lines one to three. It seeks to leave out the words, `entitling Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders to vote at Regional Council elections even if those persons would not be entitled so to vote pursuant to subparagraph 99 (b) (i)', with a view to inserting the words, `in relation to the entitlement to vote at Regional Council elections of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders who are not covered by subparagraph 99 (b) (i)'. If one reads those two forms of words, one sees that the words that we have proposed are superior and are desirable if an electoral roll is to be introduced. The third amendment is simply a definitional one which would appear at page 4 of the Bill. After the definition `approved Regional Council estimates', we propose to insert the following definition:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>`` `ATSIC Roll' means the Roll established and maintained in accordance with section 101a;''. </PARA>
<PARA>The fourth amendment which we have proposed is to clause 99 at page 43 of the Bill, line 11. It seeks to leave out subparagraph (a) and insert the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(a) the person's name is on the ATSIC Roll; and''. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will see that at present it simply reads, `the person is an Aboriginal person or a Torres Strait Islander'. We are saying that the person should be on the ATSIC roll, because that gives effect to one of Senator Coulter's long-stated goals. Senator Coulter has stated to me on a number of occasions-he has also done so publicly-his belief that while enrolments should be voluntary, voting thereafter should be compulsory. This amendment would be consistent with the view that he has expressed. Amendment No. 5 is to page 43, clause 99, line 17. It would leave out the words, `entitled to vote at the election pursuant to', and insert the words `covered by'. The words that are there at present are not necessary if there is to be an electoral roll. The words that we have proposed in their place are more appropriate. Amendment No. 6, which is to page 43, seeks to insert new clause 101a called `ATSIC Roll'. This is an attempt to give effect to what one might call the Coulter crusade. The new clause would read:</PARA>
<PARA> ``101a. (1) The Australian Electoral Commission (hereafter called ``the Electoral Commission'') is to cause to be established and maintained, in accordance with this section, a roll of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders who have attained the age of 18 years. </PARA>
<PARA>If a person who is an Aboriginal or a Torres Strait Islander has attained the age of 18 years and applies, as prescribed, to have his or her name entered on the ATSIC roll, the Electoral Commission must cause the person's name to be entered. Firstly, a person has to be an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, secondly, the person has to be 18 years old; and, thirdly, if that person wishes, his or her name should be entered. It goes on to say that a person can have his or her name removed, and makes the point that enrolment should be pursuant to other parts of the Bill. That takes account of the fact that there is a residency requirement as well. The very difficult position, of which Senator Boswell is more than aware, is that many people who are Torres Strait Islanders do not live in the Torres Strait and it is a question of whether people should have to have a residential qualification. The Bill proposes that and the Opposition does not propose to interfere with it. We provide for certain consequential regulations which will be necessary if there is an ATSIC roll. </PARA>
<PARA> Our seventh amendment is that clause 106 at page 45 which says, `Voting at Regional Council elections is not compulsory' should be left out. We want to leave it out because we were convinced, on the Select Committee and afterwards, by the power and force of Senator Coulter's arguments. His proposal was simple: voluntary enrolment and compulsory voting thereafter. I do not think I misstate Senator Coulter's position. That is what he has said publicly to anyone who would listen. Certainly many of the press listened. So we propose to take out the clause that says that voting should not be compulsory and put in new words that say: `A person who is entitled to vote at an election for the members of a regional council must vote'. We do so to give effect to what Senator Coulter has proposed. We have suggested a small sanction, a small monetary fine, for failure to vote. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Senate works at its best it is able to take in ideas and suggestions from all sides of the chamber. At the committee stage, in the Committee of the Whole, we are able to amend and improve legislation, to examine its clauses, as we are expected to do in this place. In doing so, we are entitled to look to the views of those who have studied the matter and the statements of those who know what they are talking about, and to put some weight upon those statements. Senator Coulter is his Party's spokesman on Aboriginal affairs. He has made great play in a number of press statements, some of which I have read, on radio whenever he can get on, and in meetings with Aboriginal people, of his belief in the necessity for an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander roll if ATSIC is to work properly. He has some compelling arguments, not the least being the triggering of recall provisions. We want to do nothing more than to give Senator Coulter the opportunity now to vote for the propositions about which he was so vociferous in months gone by. Accordingly, I commend the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Baume is absolutely correct. I was a member of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. I put it to the Committee that a roll of Aboriginal people be established, and that the placing of a person's name on that roll be voluntary. We canvassed the reasons for that the other day, namely, that in the community there are a number of Aboriginal people or people of Aboriginal descent who may not wish to be part of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) process-that was the reason why the placing of the name should be voluntary-but that once one's names was on the roll the voting process should then be compulsory. As Senator Baume also correctly pointed out, apparently I successfully convinced the other members of the Committee that that was the correct course to follow and the Committee appropriately carried that in its recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have already run this debate, as Senator Baume and other honourable senators would know. I have explained the processes by which this legislation will go forward now and the processes that we are now engaged in which bear very much on the decision in relation to this absolutely crucial matter. We have been involved for weeks in the committee stage of this debate. We have not yet finished the debate. The debate could well continue for the rest of this week. If the Opposition chooses, it could use the third reading stage, it could put every senator on its side of the chamber on the speakers list and it could continue to occupy the time of this chamber for a considerable time in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the statements which Senator Baume read out-and I do not in any sense withdraw from those statements; that is still my preferred position in relation to rolls and in relation to electoral procedure-I have had very extensive discussions with the Minister. As a consequence, the Minister has sought advice from the Australian Electoral Commission. That advice has been passed on to me. I have discussed that advice with the Minister over many hours. Some of that advice I believe to be sound; some I reject. I still philosophically support the position that I have supported all along. I believe that what I have stated would be the preferred position. However, on the basis of the advice which the Minister has received from the Electoral Commission, and possibly for other reasons, the Minister has made it absolutely clear that in his view the legislation would not proceed on that basis. I ask the honourable senators present in this Committee to consider the process, if I am correct in my presumption: this legislation will go to the House of Representatives, be there rejected on the basis of these amendments and come back into this place, giving the Opposition the opportunity to continue its filibustering activities.

Honourable senators will recall that the Torres Strait Island Regional Council will be both the regional and the zonal council for purposes of the people living in the Torres Strait. The Bill makes it clear that the Minister may accept the Island Coordinating Council (ICC), with or without some changes, as the Regional Council for the purposes of ATSIC. The drafting rules make it clear that the Minister intends to proceed with the adoption of the ICC as the Regional Council for purposes of ATSIC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The drafting instructions say that the Regional Council is to comprise 20 members: the elected chairmen from time to time of each of the 17 island councils represented on the Island Coordinating Council, the appointed representative of the Tamwoy community on Thursday Island on the ICC, an elected representative of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons who are members of the Thursday Island Port Kennedy community, and, finally, an elected representative of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons who are members of the Horn Island and Prince of Wales communities. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me point out that there are roughly 1,800 voters on Thursday Island and only 1,200 voters scattered among the 17 other islands of the Torres Strait. Yet the Government is proposing that the elected chairmen of each of those councils shall form the Regional Council, a process totally different from the proportional representation system which will elect all the other regional councils. That is a system which Senator Boswell, who was so critical of me only five minutes ago, strongly supports. So I point out to the Committee that, while Senator Baume has made great play of the desirability of one vote one value and has been strongly critical of the Government, his own Party, and specifically Senator Boswell, support in the case of the Torres Strait a very unfair system according to their own criteria. The reason that Senator Boswell is doing that is that he believes that the Torres Strait Islanders want that form of election. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no difference between that process which the Opposition has assented to in relation to the Torres Strait-against its declared position and desire in relation to one vote one value-and putting the expressed desire of the constituency, in this case of the Torres Strait. I say to the Opposition that while philosophically I support the idea of a roll and the idea of an electoral process as outlined, my greater responsibility in this is to the ATSIC legislation and to the vast majority of Aboriginal people who support this legislation. While that puts me in a difficult position, I have a greater responsibility to the Aboriginal people than to my philosophical position. </PARA>

I am simply making the analogy that clearly on this issue Senator Baume and, I presume, Senator Boswell and others are placing the expressed desire of the constituents, that is the people of Torres Strait, above their philosophical position. In arguing still for a roll, I am asking the Government to take that suggestion on board. I believe that the ATSIC proposal will work better. But at this stage in the development of the legislation, I am not prepared to see it crash because I believe that the majority of Aboriginal people want the legislation to pass.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened very attentively to Senator Coulter and I found it quite difficult to understand his remarks. The question before the Committee is Senator Peter Baume's amendment proposing an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander electoral roll. Senator Coulter falls back on the red herring defence and talks about the Torres Strait, which has absolutely nothing to do with the proposal for an Aboriginal roll. Senator Coulter may well be embarrassed about his turnaround in his position on an Aboriginal roll, but I would have thought that he could have come up with a better defence than he did. Grasping for a straw like a drowning man, he brought in a spurious argument that has absolutely nothing to do with an Aboriginal roll. He then talked about the Torres Strait Islands which will be a matter for discussion later in the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me not fall for Senator Coulter's tactics and be diverted to taking him up on the Torres Strait Islands because we will come to that issue later. I want to address the Senate on Senator Coulter's obvious turnaround. We-Senator Coulter, Senator Baume, a number of other senators and I-were appointed by the Senate to go out, talk to the Aboriginals and Islanders throughout Australia and come back and pool our ideas on what amendment would best reflect the views of the Committee as a whole. There were a number of discussions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs met over a period of eight or nine months. We did our job successfully and well. Senator Coulter came up with a number of ideas-some that we did not agree with and some that we did. His position on an electoral roll for all those who were to get benefits from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission was one that the Committee supported unanimously. It was his idea; he came forward with it; he promoted it; and he sold it not only to the Committee members, but also to the community. He sold it through the press; he sold it through the electronic media; and he sold it to the Aboriginal people. He then has the audacity to say that, because the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) will not support it, he will back down and not support his own proposal. The proposition that Gerry Hand is the de facto leader of the Australian Democrats is an outrageous one. That is what you are saying, Senator Coulter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, I say that the Democrats now have a new leader. They get their riding instructions from Mr Gerry Hand, the socialist Left leader. I am telling the people of Australia that the Democrats can come up with the ideas. Some ideas are good-even a stopped clock has to be right twice a day-and Senator Coulter came up with an idea that had a lot going for it. But the new leader of the Democrats, Mr Gerry Hand, vetoed it and told Senator Coulter not to be stupid because the Bill would not be passed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put it to the Committee that Senate select committees are made a mockery of, are absolutely useless and a waste of taxpayers' money, if we select as a member of a committee a Democrat who gets his riding instructions from the Minister. Senator Coulter went further than that. He came up with some very strong words: `outrageous', `disgusted' and `furious'. He was furious that the Minister put forward a proposition which did not make provision for an electoral roll and that he would elect five interim commissioners. Senator Coulter went out there like a raging lion and has come back like a tame pussy cat. That is what the Democrats are about. They stand up and tell the people what they want to hear; but when it comes to putting up or shutting up, they cannot perform. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter and every other member of the Democrats ought to be ashamed of Senator Coulter's action today. He has misrepresented his position in the Committee. He has falsely built up hope among Aboriginal and Islander people that there would be an electoral roll. He has told the people of Australia that most Aboriginals want ATSIC. He is certainly not talking to the same Aboriginal people as I am. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out to Senator Coulter that 36 per cent of Aboriginals reside in Queensland and I have not found very many-in fact, I could not count them on the fingers of one hand-who want ATSIC. The Aboriginal Coordinating Council, possibly the largest peak body of Aboriginals in Australia, represents some 27,000 Aboriginal people and it does not want it. None of the members of the Cherbourg Council wants it; Yarrabah does not want it; Palm Island does not want it; and Hopevale does not want it. I cannot find anyone in Queensland, which has 36 per cent of the Aboriginal and Islander community, who wants it. I do not mind that so much, but what I find offensive is that Senator Coulter can come up with an idea that would gain the support of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs and be unanimously adopted by it and then he folds like a pack of cards when Gerry Hand gives him his riding instructions. If that is the best the Democrats can do in keeping the bastards honest, maybe they ought to call for their old leader to come back because I am sure that it would not have happened under the previous leadership. At least when they took a position then, they stood by it. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that this is a sad day for the Aboriginal and Islander people, but it is a sadder day for the Democrats because this is the day on which they have said that they cannot be trusted. They say one thing in very strong terms in the press and make their position clear; but when the Minister tells them what to do, they do it. I believe that Senator Coulter has wasted an enormous amount of the time of the Senate Select Committee. He has made a farce of the whole process of the Senate committee system-a system that should work if everyone is true to himself and true to his own ideals. For the Senate to work properly a group of people representing various community groups-farmers, small business people, academics and the green vote-should all come together and exchange ideas by way of the committee system. We do that. We went through the whole process of trying to get what would be best for the Aboriginal community. Yet the Democrats come in here and let the 230,000 Aboriginal people down. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter, Senator Peter Baume and I know-everyone knows-that unless we have an electoral roll there will be rorts. We saw that through the experience of the National Aboriginal Conference. Candidates drove around picking up votes, with ballot boxes in the rear seat of their cars. We have seen all those things happen. We have seen people not being allowed to vote on the day. We have seen people being forced to vote-absolutely forced to the ballot box. Senator Coulter's suggestion of an electoral roll would have eliminated all those rorts. It would have put down a system that would have had an amount of fairness and fair play about it and it would have eliminated the possibility of rorting of the system. Will some officer at the ballot box determine who is an Aboriginal by the colour of his skin? Unless there is an electoral roll this cannot work and Senator Coulter has rightly identified that, as has the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> ATSIC will be manipulated by people with vested interests. They will force some people to vote and deny others the right to vote. All this could be eliminated if there were an electoral roll. In my opinion the success of the whole ATSIC proposal hinges on whether we establish an electoral roll. If we do not establish that roll there will be the greatest rort we have ever seen. Senator Coulter knows that, as do we all. Yet for some reason that I cannot understand the Minister, Gerry Hand, seems to have some hold over the Democrats. I would have thought that the Democrats were men and women enough to say, `We are people of principle; our Party is a party of principle'. But the Democrats have just denied that. They have told the people of Australia that they are a party of wimps and that they get their riding instructions from the socialist Left of the Australian Labor Party. They then come into this chamber with the feeble excuse of referring to the election in the Torres Strait Islands and how it will work. </PARA>
<PARA> To say the least, I am disappointed in Senator Coulter and his Party. They occupy the exact opposite position to that of the National Party of Australia in the political spectrum. I did think that the Australian Democrats would stand up and fight for what they believe in even if their beliefs are totally different from mine. Senator Coulter has disappointed me and I am sure that he will disappoint all his supporters in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was grateful to Senator Boswell for his intervention; it gave me a chance to collect my thoughts about some of the matters raised by Senator Coulter and which I take very seriously. I have tried to sit down and assess them on their merits and say: Where does it leave us? What should we be doing? The subject before us is, as Senator Boswell says, the question of whether or not there should be an electoral roll for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). It is not some other question. My colleague Senator Puplick talked about the defence being the St Augustine defence; that is, virtue, but not now. Senator Boswell referred to the red herring defence. Let us just try to stick to what the issue is. The subject is whether there should be an electoral roll for ATSIC, and nothing more.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think I heard Senator Coulter correctly. The honourable senator said that, by conviction, or on the arguments, his position today remains as it was when he stated it publicly. I do not think I do the honourable senator a disservice. His position is that, by conviction, he believes that there should be an electoral roll for the reasons he put to us, and that is the position he has had throughout. He then says-I think I do him no injustice again-`However, I believe that to vote this way might jeopardise the passage of the legislation'. He said that it may rest on two or three forms of jeopardy. The first is that the Minister may simply take his bat and ball and go home; secondly, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill may require to be brought back here and time may not be found for it-he certainly did not raise that today, but he did on a previous occasion; and, thirdly, if it did come back the Opposition might mount a filibuster. I actually think the honourable senator said that the Opposition might continue a filibuster. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me just digress there in talking about a filibuster. We have not filibustered on this Bill. It is true that this is the main legislation which has been before the Senate and the Committee since we resumed in August, that is, two months. I remind the Committee that we have not had a lot of time to consider this particular legislation. Various things have intervened to prevent our getting to it. Had I been managing a proper filibuster in the American style, we would have had a speakers list on the second reading of this Bill which would have been much greater than it was. Had we been mounting a filibuster we would not have agreed readily, as we did, to the cognating of the Aboriginal Development Commission Bill and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Bill and to the limitation of that second reading debate to a total of three hours. But we did agree to it. There has not been a filibuster going on. It was quite reasonable that we limited the second reading debate on the two minor Bills as we did. The fact that this is such dreadful legislation that we were required to produce over 100 amendments is not the fault of the Opposition. We proposed this number of amendments because it was necessary. I remind the Committee of how we dealt with the amendments. Had we been running a filibuster, we would have dealt with them one at a time; but that is not what we have done. We sought the leave of the Committee wherever possible to take two or three amendments together. In fact, about half an hour ago we took nine of the amendments together. If we were running a filibuster, I assure the Committee that we would be more professional. This is not a filibuster. Senator Coulter says that he is worried that if the Bill had to be returned, a filibuster would be mounted. What basis does he have for such a concern?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, Senator Boswell makes the point that there are procedural means to bring the debate to a speedy end which would be within Senator Coulter's capacity to activate if he so wished. But there would not be a filibuster. The question then arises as to whether that is a valid argument. It is not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We now get down to what Senator Coulter's concerns are, as I understand them. First, he says that by conviction he would support the amendments which the Opposition has proposed because he thinks that on the merits of the argument they are correct, but that it is his belief that if the amendments were agreed to, the Bill would be in jeopardy. I believe that is based on a misconception.</PARA>
<PARA> The crux of the argument is whether the Minister would then refuse to proceed with the Bill. I do not believe the Minister would refuse. None of us is the font of all political wisdom. I have been in this place longer than anyone else who is in the chamber at present. I have occupied most positions, and I can tell the Committee that the Minister would not refuse to proceed with the legislation. He would proceed. It is possible that he would send it back here, but that is no absolute bar to agreeing to the merits. The duty of this Committee is to look at Senator Coulter's preferred position on its merits rather than on the position he has identified as being one related to the Minister's objection. We have to decide in this Committee of the Australian Senate, which is designed to be a powerful legislative chamber, whether we will be dictated to by a Minister of the Crown. I have done it in my time. In fact, I bullied the Australian Democrats one year on an education Bill when I was a Minister. I can tell the Democrats now that had they called my bluff they would have won. Most people knew that; but they did not. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Senate and this Committee of the Senate have constitutional rights and duties which it is expected to discharge. I am trying to leave emotion out of this. What is the correct way to interpret Senator Coulter's thesis that this legislation would be doomed if the amendments were accepted? Of course, the Minister wanted no amendments at all to his legislation. Ministers never do-that is not true; the Government proposed its own group of amendments. But the Minister wanted no Opposition and no Australian Democrat amendments to this legislation or to the legislative package. Ministers never do. This Minister is no different. He did not want any. As of this moment, with the ATSIC legislation still incomplete, 115 amendments to the package of three Bills have been agreed to by this Committee. So I do not see how Senator Coulter can argue that we can accept 115 amendments but we cannot possibly accept some amendments on the matter of the electoral roll because the Minister will not like it. </PARA>
<PARA> The first of the three Bills was the Bill to repeal the Act for the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies. It is now to be the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. All 14 of the Opposition's amendments were accepted. Had the Minister had his way, there would not have been any amendments. I will pay adequate tribute to the Minister here, Senator Tate, later, in the third reading debate. The Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill was an instrument for the Minister to gut the ADC, as it were. It was not enough for him to hang it; he wanted to hang, draw and quarter it. There were 11 Opposition amendments and three Government amendments accepted. The Minister did not want any of them, but they were accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course the Minister will call in a freshman senator and sit him down to tell him that if he dares to pass the amendment the Bill will be doomed. But it it not true. The duty we have is to look at these matters and to go back to our public statements, to what we have said on the merits, and to determine from that how we should vote. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe very deeply that the provision of an electoral roll would make the operation of ATSIC much more efficient and effective. The Opposition might say. `It is a terrible set of Bills anyhow; so why are we trying to make it more efficient and effective?'. Nevertheless, having lost our battle at the second reading, we are taking that view. The amendments are ones which were inspired by Senator Coulter's logic and argument and the force of what he said to us in various fora. We have listened to him and we have produced amendments modelled on what he put to us and what he told us. They are good amendments. They will achieve the various things which Senator Coulter has said he wishes to see. They will produce an electoral roll which can prevent many of the electoral rorts which otherwise will occur and which will be on the head of this Committee if we do not take steps which are available to us now to try to stop them. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Committee of what I said to it last sitting. The National Aboriginal Conference election that I had to oversee was riddled with rorts, and the Ombudsman, Neville Bonner, had to declare one of the elections for one of the seats null and void. Voters were enrolled on the day, as is proposed in the ATSIC legislation, and what happened in this mid-western part of New South Wales is that people were bussed in by one faction, they enrolled on the spot and attempted to steal the election from the locals. Neville Bonner quite correctly declared that election null and void. There were claims of rorts and of irregular behaviour from all around the country. The problem was that we could not prove it in other places. An electoral roll will help minimise that. As Senator Coulter pointed out to us, correctly, an electoral roll will help determine the electoral number which is defined in this Bill and which appears in clause 4, which appears later. It will help set the trigger for a petition to the Minister to recall a regional council. It will help set the number to trigger a petition to the Minister to dismiss a commissioner. These things are provided for in the Bill and require a particular number of people to take certain action. Without the electoral roll we run the very grave risk of having a court challenge the first time anyone tries to do this. If there is no electoral roll, the first time anyone tries to recall a regional council someone will go to court and ask the court to say what `25 per cent' means. They will say, `It is 25 per cent of what?': That is why without an electoral roll we are in a lot of difficulty. On the merits of it, the roll is necessary for the reason Senator Coulter has stated publicly. I put to him that his reasons for abandoning his position of conviction are, in fact, not--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to pick up on various points made by Senator Peter Baume and Senator Boswell immediately before the suspension of the sitting for dinner. It was implied that there is a great deal of Aboriginal support for the idea of an electoral roll and system as outlined in the amendments moved by Senator Baume. The other members of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, Senators Baume and Boswell, will recall that, while there was some evidence before the Committee on this matter, there was not a great deal. There was not a great deal of concern one way or the other expressed to me on this matter as I moved around the Aboriginal communities. So we do not have any support for one system or the other from the constituents, as it were, of ATSIC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The benefits or otherwise of what is proposed are perceived in a more objective analysis of what this legislation seeks to do. It is in that context that we need to look at it. It is in that context that I have said to Senator Baume that I do not in any way resile from the preferred position of rolls and so on. Senator Boswell has attempted to adduce support for his view from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, but that support is simply not there. That is not the basis of this argument. It rests on a critical analysis of the benefits of one system vis-a-vis the other proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Boswell talked about ballot boxes being trucked around in the backs of cars. All senators in this place will know that the procedures outlined in this legislation involve elections conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad Senator Stone asks that question because I am about to outline again the record of the Opposition in this matter. Throughout the second reading stage of this Bill, the Opposition made it absolutely clear that it opposed the ATSIC legislation. Senator Baume has repeated on a number of occasions during the committee stage that that is his position. He is attempting here to change the legislation unwillingly because this chamber has already agreed to pass the legislation. Let us be quite clear that, basically, the Opposition is opposed to the legislation. It has also said quite recently in connection with its announced economic policies that, not only is it opposed to ATSIC, but also, should it form the next government, it would revoke this legislation and abolish ATSIC. Let us recall also that, in that same statement, the Opposition said that it would pull $100m out of the funding for Aboriginal Affairs. So its standing in this area is one of total opposition to this legislation-opposition to the point where it is not prepared to support it, even if the legislation were passed and it formed the next government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With that as a background, let us just recognise the motivation in attempting to push in amendments which, in my assessment-and I admit I may be wrong-will cause this legislation to falter. If it becomes necessary for this legislation to come back to this place from the House of Representatives, clearly that would be another opportunity for the Opposition to continue to delay its passage. It seems reasonable that there will be a Federal election in March; that is the preferred time. If this roll amendment were passed the ATSIC legislation would require the Australian Electoral Commission, as well as preparing rolls for the next Federal election, to prepare rolls for ATSIC. Information from the Australian Electoral Commission is that it would not be possible to do that during the early months of next year-during the time when it would be preparing for a Federal election. The same situation obtains whether it is March or April. This means that, under this proposed amendment, it would be very likely that ATSIC would not be put in place and be actually up and running before the election was called. If that event supervened and the Opposition formed the next government we know what would happen. </PARA>
<PARA> Our declared position consistently throughout this debate has been that we are fundamentally committed to the ATSIC concept. We accept that it has flaws and this, I believe, is one of those flaws. However, we are not prepared to see this legislation fail. Let me return to a point which Senator Boswell seemed completely to misunderstand. We are dealing here with amendments which go to the heart of the processes of electing regional councils. Senator Boswell has accused me and the Australian Democrats of being led by left wing member of parliament, Gerry Hand. Senator Boswell has done a deal with Gerry Hand in relation to the Torres Strait. The Torres Strait is a regional council--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting to note that Senator Boswell likes dishing it out but he does not like receiving it. The processes that have been put in place for the election of the regional council in the Torres Strait are completely contrary to what the Opposition is now putting in place. Those proposals are contrary also to what Senator Baume argued very strongly for-the one vote one value principle-yet they are supported by Senator Boswell. The numbers of electors on some of the Torres Strait Islands are: Badu, 217; Coconut, 79; Darnley, 142; Yorke, 190; Horn, 128; Kubin, 52; Murray, 223; Seisa, 27; and Bamaga, 350. There are enormous variations. There are some 1,800 people on Thursday Island. Yet in relation to the Torres Strait part of this electoral process we see the Opposition supporting something quite contrary to what they are putting now. Quite simply, the Opposition are accusing me--</PARA></TALK.START>

For reasons which evidently it does not accept, I am now supporting a somewhat different position because I believe that it is in the interests of and in accordance with the wishes of the Aboriginal people so to do. The Opposition is supporting a position in relation to the election of regional councils, which it is diametrically opposed to in relation to Torres Strait, because the people of the Torres Strait have made it quite clear that they will not support ATSIC unless they have this system of election. Indeed, that system of election is supported specifically by Senator Boswell. There is nothing unusual about dealing with two principles which are in conflict and recognising that one principle takes precedence over the other. In this instance, the principle of getting this legislation through in the belief that it is in the interests and has the support of the majority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is a more superior principle to the principle of supporting the Opposition's amendment on this particular clause.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Baume. I should speak more slowly and not get quite so excited. The timing of the passage of this legislation is very important. The legislation was first suggested back in December 1987. We saw an outline of it in about April 1988. We did not see the legislation itself until August 1988. A Senate select committee then had a look at the legislation and went through it. As a result, the legislation was significantly amended. It has been before the Senate for essentially the whole of the life of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The stage has been reached where, facing a Federal election and given the difficulties faced by the Opposition's proposal in relation to a roll, it is quite clear to me that supporting these amendments at this point, at this time-I remind Senator Baume that I did not say `point in time'-could well cause this legislation to falter, either by reason of the time required to put the roll in place, if the Government should see fit to accept it and try to get it through, or by reason of the legislation having to go to the House of Representatives, being there rejected and coming back here, where legislative debating time would have to be found. The possibility is that, given the Opposition's continuing and declared opposition to this legislation, the opportunity would then exist for a considerable further delay in the debate. It is for those reasons that the Democrats are not supporting this set of amendments. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that is a fair comment. I have somewhat of an interest in this matter because I am on the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters and on its sub-committee inquiring into the Aboriginal Electoral Information Service. I am very interested in the outcome of this particular measure. It seems to me that a fundamental prerequisite for any fair election is the establishment of an electoral roll which is unquestionably fair and is of unquestioned integrity. Without that we do not have a fair election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have heard of three excuses. One is that there is a filibuster going on. There are a number of senators around the place who have a great interest in this piece of legislation who have not been on their feet but who have left the arguments to be advanced largely by the members of the Senate Select Committee. I reject outright the suggestion that there is any filibuster. The second excuse that has been given is that there is an election coming up and the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) does not have the time to establish an electoral roll. As far as I am concerned the AEC had better get its act together and put on staff to get the roll in order. At last there has recently been a printing of the general rolls. With all of the moneys that have been provided to the Australian Electoral Commission for sophisticated equipment no-one can tell me that it cannot establish a roll as would be required of it under this amendment. If it cannot, then it is very inefficient. I for one, as a member of the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters, would be seeking a reference to inquire into the Commission's efficiency if it is suggesting that it cannot establish a roll. I have not actually heard it say that it cannot establish a roll. </PARA>
<PARA> The third and most important excuse that has been given by Senator Coulter is that if this amendment is adopted the Minister will reject it; not only will he reject it but he will torpedo the whole of the legislation. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs is not here to tell us why he would reject the whole of the legislation if this amendment-which everybody agrees is entirely fair-is adopted by the Committee. I suggest to the Committee, particularly to Senator Coulter and the other Australian Democrats, that we should adopt this amendment. If the Bill is rejected when it goes back to the House of Representatives, under its Standing Orders, a committee of reasons must be established and members in that place have to give us their reasons for rejecting any amendment that we make to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> As an Independent senator, I have not heard anyone in the second reading debate or at the committee stage advance any reasons in principle as to why this eminently fair amendment should not be carried. We have an assertion that the Government will reject the amendment and thus reject the whole of the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If that is the case, the Government has to put those reasons in writing when it sends its message back to us. The odds would be that the committee of reasons would not include that as its reason for rejecting the amendment. The procedural way to go about it is to try it. It will only take a week. The amendment has the unanimous support of the Senate Select Committee. If we pass the amendment, let it then go back to the House of Representatives where the committee of reasons can explain its reasons for rejecting the amendment. We can then consider those reasons on their merits. How can we do otherwise when the Minister has not put forward a reason-unless the Minister says today that the Government will reject the Bill? I do not think that course should be accepted by the Committee. It should be done in the proper and formal way, particularly as this Committee has acted in the most propitious way-that is, it has sent the measure to a Senate select committee, which has considered it. Surely the Government and the House of Representatives should have the opportunity to consider this amendment and then come up with reasons as to why it should be rejected.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin my remarks in supporting the amendments moved by Senator Peter Baume by saying that I have been privileged to listen to the finely reasoned and eminently reasonable remarks just made by Senator Brian Harradine. I want to add my comments to those he has made in asking what has produced this switch in Senator Coulter's opinions on this matter and the stance of the Australian Democrats. Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I heard Senator Coulter, in an earlier intervention, put forward a couple of extraordinarily weak-indeed, just extraordinary-reasons in response to Senator Baume's remarks, as to why Senator Coulter had diametrically made a 180-degree change in his position. It was not just a minor diversion from his previous position, but a 180-degree switch.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps as Senator Tambling properly reminds me, there are more degrees on the compass. If one goes round more than once, 540 degrees might be correct-it is equally possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I heard Senator Coulter put forward two arguments at that point. First, he said he did not believe he could support this filibuster, as he called it, on the part of the Opposition against this otherwise to be desired piece of legislation. Let met consider that. That is a shameful comment on the part of Senator Coulter and, frankly, I am surprised that he should have made it. After all, Senator Coulter has played a valuable part in the debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I have rather lost track, and Senator Baume can perhaps give me the information, but we must now have passed 140 amendments on the three pieces of legislation in the package. It was 120 or so before we came back today and the Government has agreed to a number today. For Senator Coulter to suggest in any way, let alone as explicitly as he did, that the performance of the Senate in handling this legislation has been a filibuster is, I think, shameful. If Senator Coulter wants to withdraw that comment, I would welcome it. As I say, Senator Coulter himself has contributed in a valuable way to what has been an excellent debate. In fact, I heard his leader, Senator Janine Haines, when this Bill was being debated a week or so ago and the question of its progress came up, agree that the Senate has been seen at its best in its handling of this Bill. Far from any filibuster being involved, this was the Senate working in a methodical and workmanlike way to produce at least better legislation from the shambles of a Bill that this Government, and this incompetent Minister, Minister Hand, put up to us. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator STONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot from my personal knowledge aver that that is the case, although I would have to say that all the evidence certainly supports that view. I go no further than that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to the second reason which Senator Coulter adduced prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner as to why the Democrats no longer feel it possible to stick by their previously proudly and, indeed, widely proclaimed public sentiments on the matters concerning the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) electoral roll, which are the subject of Senator Baume's amendments. The second reason was that, as a result of long and arduous conversation with the Minister, Senator Coulter had become convinced that the Minister, if the Senate were to accept these amendments, would not accept the Bill and ATSIC would founder. There would be many a dry eye throughout the Australian community were that the case. But that is not my point. My point is simply that that is nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hand, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, has devoted himself to obtaining this legislation throughout the last two years of this particular Parliament. He has a very big agenda in mind in obtaining it. If it is the genuine view of Senator Coulter that the Minister would drop the Bill if we, this Senate, were to put in place a perfectly proper system of electoral roll under which the elections for the Commission were to be undertaken, it is simply a mark of naivety, to use no harsher word. I seem to recall that George Orwell, when speaking of some sentiment or other, said that only an intellectual would believe such stuff; no ordinary man would be so stupid. Adapting that to this particular circumstance, only a Democrat would believe such stuff; no ordinary parliamentarian would be so stupid. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the dinner break we have had paraded a number of other reasons why Senator Peter Baume's amendments should not be accepted by the Senate. If I recall correctly-it was a rather confused argument; I hope I do not misrepresent Senator Coulter-the first of those had something to do with the fact that after exhaustive, critical analysis of one system versus the other, he no longer felt it possible to adopt the system he had originally argued so passionately for and, indeed, as Senator Peter Baume reminded us, had swayed other members of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs to his way of thinking. I do not want to spend more time on that other than to say that this exhaustive, critical analysis has not been deployed to the Senate this evening and, I suspect, is unlikely to be because, as Senator Harradine reminded us, what possible argument could there be against the view being put in the Opposition's amendments to produce a proper and, in a sense, electorally accountable system?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Harradine" NAMEID="6H4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator STONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. As Senator Harradine quite rightly says, we have to have a proper electoral roll for any system to work. The only question is: what kind of roll will we have? There will be a roll as a result of the election. The only question is whether it will be a roll which we have in advance and which will therefore allow the proper procedures to be mounted on and allow people to be held accountable for or whether we have some kind of electoral rort, which is clearly what the Minister would prefer us to have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next excuse-I will not call it a reason-that Senator Coulter has advanced this evening as a further insult to our intelligence is that, because of the pressures which the impending Federal election is already placing on the Australian Electoral Commission, the Commission would not have the resources to prepare such a roll were we to enact a Bill containing these provisions which are the subject of Senator Baume's amendment. Again, Senator Harradine has effectively dealt with that piece of nonsense. I have made it plain by my interjection, which Senator Coulter was good enough to take up, that there is a good deal of dissatisfaction anyway with certain respects of the procedures of the Australian Electoral Commission. That notwithstanding, we would rather have the Electoral Commission charged with the duty of putting into place a proper electoral roll for the purposes of the ATSIC elections than not have one at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter, not content with these excuses, then proceeded to follow his Labor Party mentors even further by picking up their well-known tactic. When confessing their inability to play the ball they start playing the man. He started accusing Senator Boswell, my National Party colleague, of having done a deal with Gerry Hand. Those were his words. I wrote them down. The Democrats have the hide and impertinence to stand up in this place and accuse someone of doing a deal. My God!</PARA>
<PARA> What was the basis of this extraordinary charge which Senator Coulter has not yet had the decency to withdraw? I accept your ruling, Mr Temporary Chairman, that no point of order was involved when Senator Boswell quite properly took exception to Senator Coulter's quite uncalled for comment. Nevertheless, I would have thought that the intervention and the exchange would have at least given Senator Coulter the opportunity to think again and withdraw voluntarily his unseemly aspersion on his senatorial colleague. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter produced not the slightest evidence-not a whit of evidence-other than citing a few figures about the population of a number of islands in the Torres Strait. That was the sole piece of evidence that Senator Coulter adduced for his personal attack on Senator Boswell's integrity. I understand that when a senator rises in his place and states, on his personal affidavit, that at no time has he had a conversation with Minister Hand, let alone a conversation on this matter-unlike Senator Coulter-the proper course for the senator in question is, in all courtesy, to withdraw the aspersion he has just made. But we have not had that degree of senatorial decency from Senator Coulter this evening, an outcome which is regrettable. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter then went on to impugn, more generally, the Opposition's bona fides in this area. He went on to say that the Opposition has always been opposed to ATSIC. Of course the Opposition has always been opposed to ATSIC. There has never been the slightest doubt about that. Indeed, as Senator Coulter was good enough to remind us, and as I reminded him by way of interjection, the Opposition stated specifically in its Economic Action Plan document which was released only last Thursday that after the next election it will disband ATSIC-should it be in operation-saving $10m of taxpayers' money in the process, at the very least. The Opposition has made no secret of its intentions and attitudes in that regard. But moving from that to Senator Coulter's imputation that the process that is going on here tonight is somehow dishonest or lacking in integrity is an aspersion to which I object strongly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Temporary Chairman, I thought Senator Jenkins was seeking the call. I would have welcomed some contributions by another member of the Australian Democrats on what I think is a most important point of principle, particularly as it has reflected so very badly on the role of the Democrats in this place. This amendment that the Opposition has put forward is one that I am very pleased to support because, in practical terms, in future we will find with hindsight that it would have been crucial to any decent and proper operation of a system of this nature. I am extremely angry because for the past few months I have been wandering around my electorate-I remind the chamber, and in particular, the Democrats, that 30 to 35 per cent of the people in my electorate are Aboriginal people-talking comprehensively about this legislation, about the recommendations that were made by the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs and about the statements that were made by the Australian Democrats. Heaven forbid that I would have ever necessarily pushed the Australian Democrats line, but on this particular issue whenever I talked to the people in the Aboriginal community I was able to detail the stance being taken by the Opposition, the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Peter Baume outlined earlier when he quoted quite comprehensively from statements made by Senator Coulter, whether in the Parliament, the media or elsewhere, they were statements on which we could rely and on which I could say to the Aboriginal constituency of the Northern Territory, `This is the position that the Australian Democrats want to take'. But we have found that the Democrats have become the handmaidens to Mr Hand. As I said earlier by interjection, they have fallen into a deal. As Senator Coulter openly admitted, he spent hours in discussions with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand. We have not heard from any other Democrat senator the views on this and the reason for the very dramatic change. The Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Haines, the Deputy Leader, Senator Macklin, and Senator Jenkins, whose constituency is in Western Australia, will obviously have a lot to answer for, but they have not come into the chamber to explain their inconsistency on this important point of principle. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the chamber of a particular recommendation of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. The Committee made a unanimous recommendation at paragraph 2.130. It was made by all members of the Committee, including the three Labor senators and Senator Coulter. I can understand that Senator Collins and Senator McMullan had to toe the party line on this because of other decisions that were caught up in it, but the same reasons cannot be applied to Senator Coulter. The recommendation reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that this population should be, in each instance, the population of people on an electoral roll. While placing one's name on the electoral roll should be voluntary, voting should be compulsory thereafter for those whose names are on the roll. The recall provisions should be exercisable only by those on the electoral roll. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is exactly what the amendments seek to do. They are totally consistent with all the statements of points of principle. If we really think about it, we need to address the question of when we first got a flag of interest from the Democrats that they had chosen to prostitute their principles on this issue. When did they decide that Aboriginal Australians would be the losers? As Senator Peter Baume said earlier in the day, the legislation will get caught up in court appeals. The determination could be made quite properly today in the chamber, where the amendments could be put into the legislation. So much for the hypocrisy of Senator Coulter's deal with the Minister because he wants to see the legislation quickly pushed through in a particular way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrats have not had the guts to face up to the real decisions and the disastrous implications that this will have for Aboriginal Australians. Instead, we have had the feeble excuse that it will create an administrative problem for the Australian Electoral Commission. I remind the chamber that 230,000 Aboriginal Australians will be affected by the legislation. Some municipalities in Australia have more numbers than that and they can organise a structure. While I appreciate the very diverse nature of the spread of Aboriginal people around Australia, I do not think that it would be that difficult a task, given all the other resources that the Government has been prepared to commit to the other points of principle of this legislation. Senator Coulter threw up as an excuse or a reason that in the coalition's announcements last week with regard to its tax and spending policies we had outlined a cut of $100m in this portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me remind the Committee of the exposes of the last 18 months that have proved the waste, the inefficiency and the maladministration. Let me also remind it of the fact that the increase, the blow-out, in the vote of this portfolio in this financial year well exceeds that $100m worth of adjustment that we would seek to make in an area that we believe could be far more efficient. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a good description. It would be lovely to find out, but unfortunately we probably will not be able to do so until next year when the Senate Estimates committees meet. I remind honourable senators that so far we have considered 84 amendments to this Bill, all of which have to go before Minister Hand for major consideration. There are probably quite a number of amendments that he will not particularly like or will not be particularly enamoured of and he may want to come back and renegotiate. He has obviously grabbed Senator Coulter by the back of the neck, roughed him up against the wall and said, `Hey, don't you touch these amendments; they are ones that I will not move on'. But the Government has not come in here and admitted that these amendments are non-negotiable. Only Senator Coulter is saying, `The Minister is telling me that these are amendments that he will do a deal with, that he will hold us to', and all the rest of it. In total, we have looked at 115 amendments to this package of legislation. As Senator Stone said, the number will soon pass 120, and probably we will end up with quite a few more either tonight or tomorrow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are considering a most important point of principle that demonstrates that there is no role in Australian politics for the Democrats because they cannot be trusted. I ask: Who is playing the role of Benedict Arnold to Aboriginal people throughout Australia? It is Senator Coulter and the Australian Democrats. Let me remind the Committee of the important aspects of doing deals, living extravagantly, and socialising with these sorts of things. This is not a place for the Benedict Arnolds; this is a place for people who have vision in Australia and are prepared to put a commitment to Aboriginal Australians before the other deals that they have done in the backroom. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Both Senator Baume and Senator Coulter have received a letter from Giff Jones, the Chairman of the ATSIC task force, indicating that the Australian Audit Office had drawn to our attention that a recent amendment to the Audit Act 1901, which took effect on 25 June this year, has dealt with the audit of subsidiaries. Arising from that, the Audit Act provision, apparently, has exactly the same effect as the provisions in the ATSIC Bill at clauses 72, 185 and 195. I therefore seek leave to move three amendments to those three clauses scattered throughout the Bill which deal with the audit of subsidiaries. The First Assistant Auditor-General, Mr O'Neill, has suggested that, as a result of a recent amendment which took effect on 25 June, the Audit Act now sufficiently covers the situation and these clauses would be superfluous.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a result of what we have just done it is no longer necessary, appropriate or possible to move the Opposition's circulated amendment No. 93 since that was an amendment to one of the clauses that we have now deleted. I indicate to the Committee that I will not move circulated amendment No. 93 but instead will pass to circulated amendment No. 94. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (94) Page 72, clause 191, lines 5 and 6, leave out ``, or an officer of the Australian Public Service authorised by the Treasurer to give approvals under this section,''. </PARA>
<PARA>This is an amendment to clause 191 at page 72 of the Bill. It seeks to leave out the words `or an officer of the Australian Public Service authorised by the Treasurer to give approvals under this section'. I have an indication from the Minister that the Government would not find this amendment unacceptable and I am grateful for that. I remind the Committee that the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, in its 1988 report on the then ATSIC Bill, advised the Parliament on various matters. The clause number I will quote referred to the Bill that existed at that time. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 210 of the Bill allows the Treasurer to delegate to `a person' the power to give approvals for `a bank' to operate as a bank for certain purposes under the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has consistently objected to such provisions as are proposed by this clause. The power to delegate such important powers to `a person' without further qualification as to a person's position, would give the Treasurer an unacceptably wide discretion in the Committee's opinion. </PARA>
<PARA> The clause is accordingly drawn to Senators' attention as it may breach principle 1 (a) (iv) of the terms of reference and constitute an inappropriate delegation of administrative power. </PARA>
<PARA>That is really a significant report from the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. It suggested that one of the provisions in the then Bill may have breached one of the principles under which the Scrutiny of Bills Committee operates. When we saw that we looked at the new Bill. The appropriate clause in the new Bill is clause 191. It is for that reason that we have proposed the amendment that is now before the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem can be resolved by an agreement to the amendment which we have proposed to take out the words `or an officer of the Australian Public Service authorised by the Treasurer', and for us to say `The Treasurer may, in writing, approve a bank for the purposes of this Act'. It is a small amendment and will not give the Department of the Treasury any great difficulty. The Acts Interpretation Act will assist in making clear what that means. I am grateful to the Government for indicating that it will not object to this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before we move to any further amendments I would like to refer briefly to that part of the dissenting report of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs written by Senator Boswell and me. At page 11 of that dissenting report under the heading `But not all aspects are included' we make a point on which I would like the Minister's reassurance and comment. Under that heading we have made mention of a few apparent anomalies in the ATSIC package. We really just want some answers. We state:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By the time the Minister took office, the Government's commitment to the single statutory authority responsible for all aspects of Aboriginal Affairs had to be made. </PARA>
<PARA>It seemed to us that the new Commission was not going to deal with all aspects of Aboriginal affairs and we wondered about certain other activities covered by other departments of state. Can the Minister now advise the Committee on the position of Aboriginal education, employment and training activities under the former Department of Education and Department of Employment and Industrial Relations-which I think is now the Department for Employment, Education and Training (DEET)-which had some quite specific Aboriginal education and training functions? What will happen to the States grants programs for Aboriginal housing? Who will administer those and how will they be administered? What will happen to the Aboriginal Arts Board of the Australia Council? I think I have made reference to this at a previous stage of the committee debate, but no attempt has been made to explain, when we talk about all aspects of Aboriginal affairs going to the new Commission, what will happen to these particular areas, which affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people but which, at first glance, seem to be located separately and outside ATSIC. Can the Minister clarify those matters?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seem to recall at an earlier stage in the Committee talking about various matters to do with education and employment. It was indicated that the Department of Employment, Education and Training would be dealing with some of the matters that Senator Peter Baume has spoken of in relation to his first query about certain education and training programs currently conducted by DEET. They will continue to be conducted by DEET. I understand that States grants programs for Aboriginal housing are conducted under the auspices of one of the junior Ministers within the Department of Community Services and Health. I take it that the Aboriginal Arts Board of the Australia Council will continue to be administered under the portfolio of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true that not all expenditures, not all programs, directed at the well-being of and enhancement of the situation of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island peoples will emanate from the organisations established and the processes outlined in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill 1989. Other departments and portfolios will be making contributions, as was noted last week in Estimates Committee E. There are other portfolios contributing to the welfare of Aboriginal people, and I have no doubt that that will continue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand it will have a coordination role, though I think-and this will probably come out in the Committee of the Whole and in the report of the Estimates Committee-the strengths or weight which one gives to that word is a difficult one. Obviously, portfolios responsible to their own Ministers will be carrying out programs which, as I say, have their own direct line of political responsibility, but the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission no doubt will be concerned to ensure that as far as possible other portfolio contributions to the well-being of and enhancement of the situation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island peoples are coordinated and supplement, within the proper confines of the other portfolios, the work which ATSIC itself is undertaking.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Justice for that answer. I now go back to clause 7 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill. Does it follow that the Prime Minister could, by notices in force under clause 8, transfer all the listed functions to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission at any time? I would have thought that the answer was yes. I come to Senator Tambling's question. I go back to clause 7.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under clause 7 (m) there is a capacity for a transfer to the Commission to include `such other functions as are conferred on the Commission by the Prime Minister by notices in force under section 8'. Senator Tate is quite correct that clause 8 is the Prime Minister's function, but I drew attention to clause 7 for convenience. Looking at the functions listed in clause 7, I pick up Senator Tambling's question. What will be the function of ATSIC in relation to these other matters which will not be under the control of ATSIC but will fall under other departments of state? Senator Tate mentioned the Aboriginal Arts Board being under Senator Richardson's portfolio. Will ATSIC nevertheless have a function in monitoring the effectiveness of the programs of, for example, the Aboriginal Arts Board, and Aboriginal education programs and training programs within the Department of Employment, Education and Training? Will ATSIC still have a function in developing policy proposals? Will ATSIC still have the responsibility of establishing extra consultative arrangements in relation to these programs?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having identified that these are areas affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people which will not be part of ATSIC and which will remain parts of other departments of state, we want to be quite clear on how clause 7 will relate the functioning of ATSIC to these other areas. </PARA>

<PARA>Whether or not strictly speaking a department qualifies as a Commonwealth body-I guess that is possible for the purposes of the Act-the fact is that the Commission would, as the Department does now, advise its Minister in relation to how those activities of other Commonwealth bodies might be brought into a supplementary, coordinated and fully effective means of advancing the well-being of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders and of enhancing their status in our society. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Baume asked about monitoring in subclause 7 (1) (b). I am trying to recall the arguments. We went through them about three weeks ago. Monitoring was simply a question of being in a position to list and understand the effect of the programs for Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders being conducted by bodies other than the Commission. Its monitoring role will be important as far as determining the sorts of expenditures and programs which it should undertake. Quite clearly, if it finds that a program being conducted by a body other than the Commission is ineffectual, perhaps in the provision of sewerage, fresh water, health services or housing, it may conclude that it needs to provide more funding and give greater priority to those matters than it would if it found that those programs were effective. Quite clearly, the monitoring of the effectiveness of those programs is a very sensible preliminary step to determining its own programs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter was addressed last week in Senate Estimates Committee E. I remind the Minister of the particular exchange that took place. I asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Does DAA retain, under a current Cabinet decision, coordination responsibility in respect of non-portfolio expenditure?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Gray, the departmental Secretary, replied:</PARA>
<PARA>Yes, we do. We have been given a responsibility to advise the Cabinet on matters pertaining to the programs that apply specifically in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people. </PARA>
<PARA>The transcript continues:</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Will not ATSIC be expected to assume a similar responsibility?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Gray-Yes, I believe it will. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is it appropriate to say that ATSIC will have either direct or indirect control over the spending of approximately $1 billion per annum?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Gray-I do not believe it will have control in the sense that you imply there. What we have is a role of coordination. It is not one of control, it is not one of determining. For example, there are programs in other departments even now, which you have just identified and referred to. We do not control those in the sense that we can turn off or turn on those particular programs, but we do have a capacity to advise the Cabinet in relation to the impact of those programs on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>The issue that needs to be pursued here concerns the function of responsibility. The Minister was just quoting clause 7 (1) (f) (ii), which refers to the coordination functions of other Commonwealth bodies that affect people. This refers really to advising the Minister. Then, of course, other functions are conferred by the Prime Minister under paragraph (m) by notices in force under section 8. There seems to be a difference here between those functions on which ATSIC advises the Minister on coordination of activities and those functions on which ATSIC will report or respond direct, as under present Department of Aboriginal Affairs terms, to the Cabinet. The intention of the Prime Minister for additional functions that are subsequently conferred needs to be clarified. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that Senator Tambling is seeking to establish a difference where there is not one. What Mr Gray and I have said and what I believe the legislation says is all perfectly compatible. In a shorthand way, if the Cabinet is discussing matters relating to Aboriginal advancement, it may have a submission before it which has elements from the Department of Employment, Education and Training, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, and the Department of Community Services and Health. Quite clearly Mr Gray was not saying that the Department somehow makes a direct submission to the Cabinet. Obviously a submission goes through the Department's Minister. All departments must make their Cabinet submissions. In fact the Minister takes the submissions to the Cabinet. The submissions may be composed for his approval by the Department, and its officers may brief him, but the Minister takes the matters to Cabinet. It is clear that, as the Department advises the Minister now in relation to matters coming up before Cabinet which require advice as to coordination, supplementation and the fully effective thrust of all Commonwealth programs in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, so too the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission will take on the role of advising the Minister so that if he needs to go to Cabinet on these matters he can be advised by ATSIC as he is now advised by the Department.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have heard what was said in answer to the questions. The answer means what the words say. I want to return to the point I was making about clause 7 (1) (b) in relation to the answer Senator Tate gave me about other functions which rest with other departments. The functions of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) are the functions it is expected to perform. In relation to powers, section 10 (1) of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commission has the power to do all things that are necessary or convenient to be done for or in connection with the performance of its functions. </PARA>
<PARA>We expect the Commission to carry out its functions as given to it by statute. Those functions include monitoring the effectiveness of programs, including programs conducted by bodies other than the Commission. We sought to have those words taken out, but that is history and the words remain in there. That means that ATSIC will have a function which it is expected to perform in relation to monitoring the effectiveness of programs in other portfolios. It will be expected to monitor the work of the Aboriginal Arts Board, which comes within Senator Richardson's portfolio. On the Estimates committees we have been teasing out for some years what we mean when we are talking about monitoring the effectiveness of programs. </PARA>
<PARA> For a start, it means we require some explicit goals and objectives. It means that we require the development of performance indicators which relate to the achievement of those goals, and we require those performance indicators to be applied. What we will get-and we want to bring this home-is ATSIC, as a function which it is required to perform, producing performance indicators for bodies which operate in other people's portfolios. If it does not, during Estimates committee hearings we can ask how it is carrying out its function of monitoring the effectiveness of, say, the Aboriginal Arts Board of the Australia Council. We would be able to say to ATSIC, `This is what the statute provides you shall do, and we require you to do it'. There will be tremendous problems within the government. I do not wish to pursue that matter much further. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise one general matter. As I indicated earlier, the Government was kind enough to provide me with a copy of its drafting instructions on the electoral procedures for ATSIC, which I read yesterday. I would like to reflect on one part of those drafting directions. In relation to the matter that was raised last week dealing with how one defines Aboriginality, honourable senators will recall that I made the point that it was highly desirable that the working definition be actually written into the regulations when they are finally drafted. I would like to draw attention to the proposed electoral procedures as they are set out in the document. They state:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander Liaison Officers to be engaged by the AEC in each polling centre and mobile polling centre . . . Liaison officers to be chosen in consultation with ATSIC (and DAA for the first election); the AEC to be reasonably satisfied that the Liaison Officers chosen are capable of making judgments about the qualifications of potential voters;</PARA>
<PARA> Liaison officers to have duty to satisfy themselves on the balance of probabilities whether a voter is an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person within the meaning of the Act . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The words, `on the balance of probabilities whether a voter is an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander' are particularly relevant when we skip several points and read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>false certification of Aboriginality by a Liaison Officer or person certifying a postal vote, or attempts to improperly influence a Liaison Officer to be an offence under the Rules. </PARA>
<PARA>One of those suggestions is that the liaison officer must satisfy himself or herself, on the balance of probabilities, whether a voter is an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person and, further, if a person is wrongly certified, it is likely that the liaison officer would be committing an offence by improperly or falsely certifying as to Aboriginality. It seems to me that that underscores the need to make quite clear the definition which is to be used in relation to Aboriginality, and to go well beyond the definition which is presently in the Bill. The drafting instructions go on:</PARA>
<PARA> It is considered appropriate that there should be some mechanism for the review of a decision of a Liaison Officer that a person is not an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person within the meaning of the Bill. Review should be to the Senior Liaison Officer for each region. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the mechanism. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>A request for review should be made and the review determined within 8 days of the close of polling. No formalities should be required. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an extremely brave assumption, particularly in view of this very open, tautological definition that no formality is required and that the Liaison Officer or the Senior Liaison Officer in each region, if there is an appeal, is able to determine Aboriginality. Again, I make the plea for that working definition to be written into the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I want to raise in connection with this draft is the method of filling casual vacancies if a regional councillor retires or leaves the regional council. The method outlined is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> It will be necessary for the Australian Electoral Commission to provide the Minister with a list in order of priority of unsuccessful candidates, starting with the last-excluded candidate, and ending with the first-excluded. Where bulk-exclusions occur, the authorised electoral officer will be required to determine the order of priority based on the number of votes cast for each excluded candidate or, where two candidates have an equal number of votes, by drawing lots. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister will then offer to appoint the first person on the list, and if that person does not consent, will continue down the list. </PARA>
<PARA>In that we have a method of filling casual vacancies in which one simply runs on to the next person who would have been elected if an extra number is to be elected. For argument's sake, suppose 21 were to be elected instead of 20. The twenty-first person would become the person who, under this system, would be elected. As this is only a draft, I suggest that the most appropriate and fairest method of filling those casual vacancies would be to follow the modified system as used in Tasmania, which is the full proportional representation system. It involves a recount of the vote to find how the votes would have gone had the person retiring not been present. In view of the fact that these elections will be conducted by proportional representation one might as well go the whole way and fill casual vacancies in the fairer way rather than in the way outlined here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can reiterate my undertaking to Senator Coulter and indeed to the Committee that I will seek to find out whether the working definition which he proposes can be put in the regulations in a way which keeps the working definition obviously intra vires the Act and therefore intra vires the Constitution. I can assure Senator Coulter that that will be examined with integrity. As to false certification, quite clearly the rules would have to provide for that to be a false certification undertaken knowingly or wilfully. One would have to have a mental element there which made it appropriate that there be an offence. It would not be an objective matter. We would have to find some mental element which was of a criminal kind justifying making the false certification an offence. I am quite sure that Senator Coulter's comments on that can be taken by the advisers here and relayed to those to whom we have given drafting instructions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say that also in relation to Senator Coulter's suggestion that certainly, as he was speaking, struck a chord with me. The Hare-Clark proportional voting system in Tasmania does work well in the filling of casual vacancies. That method could be put to the Minister. I will undertake to convey that to him. Indeed, I am sure that any other suggestions which Senator Coulter, Senator Baume or Senator Harradine may have in relation to the drawing up of these rules will be useful and I undertake that they will be considered fairly by the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not the Opposition's intention to move amendments Nos. 95, 96 and 97. The Committee can ignore those amendments. I now move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (98) Page 16, clause 27, lines 15 to 28, leave out the clause. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 27 is an attempt to establish an interim Commission. We have spent a lot of time today discussing electoral rules and systems. It is quite clear that what is proposed is that a first Commission be appointed-not an elected Commission but an interim Commission. It is a device to get ATSIC up and operating quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is one thing that has come through the debate, particularly from those with whom we may not necessarily agree, it is this belief in self-management, in Aboriginal people making up their own minds. What is proposed is that the very first Commission, which will make many of the rules by which the Commission will operate thereafter, is to be an interim Commission which is to be appointed. Clause 27, for example, talks about a period starting at the commencement of the Act and ending on a day not being more than 12 months after commencement; therefore the Minister has 12 months. The Commission is to consist of a chairperson, a deputy chairperson and three other members appointed by the Minister. So this is an interim Commission which will be totally appointed and will have no elected commissioners. The chairperson could hold office for up to three years; the other four members could hold office for one year, as referred to in subclause (1). </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is quite concerned about this. We have to look at the performance of the Aboriginal Development Commission over the past 16 to 18 months, ever since the eight commissioners were sacked by Mr Hand and replaced by his own choices. From what we have seen of that group of people, we have no confidence that competence or sound judgment are necessarily the result of the people Mr Hand selects. So we believe that this clause should not be included. That would then require the Government to proceed to an election. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to Senator Coulter that the essential element the Democrats want in place during this Parliament is the legislation. If I were in the Democrats' position it is the legislation I would want. Whatever the results of the general election-and I imagine that we will probably form the government; however the Senate vote goes, and I imagine that there will be no single party with a majority in the Senate, looking at the arithmetic of the various States-the key to what the Democrats require now is the legislation being put in place. They do not require as an essential element of what they are trying to achieve this use of an interim commission. It is a device to get quick action. It flies in the face of everything the Minister has said about self-determination by Aboriginal people. Given the history we have seen so far, of the people in the ADC who replaced the eight commissioners, we have no confidence that this is a good or proper way to go. We have no confidence either that it will reflect well upon the long term reputation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support amendment No. 98 circulated in Senator Peter Baume's name. The effect of this amendment is that there will be immediate elections of the Commission. I do not know which way Senator Coulter is going on this, but to do anything other than to elect the commissioners of ATSIC would be a fundamental denial of their right to run ATSIC and to give self-determination and self-management. I do not know which way the Democrats are going to vote, but I hope that they stick to their original position, unlike the position they took on the roll. Senator Coulter is on record as saying on AM on 12 April:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>We're disgusted with the way in which the Minister has proceeded with this and of course he gave no inkling whatsoever of the establishment of an interim commission of five hand-picked people. </PARA>
<PARA>John Shovelan then said:</PARA>
<PARA>What are you disgusted about?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer was:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, frankly it just flies right in the face of the whole thrust of ATSIC which the Minister all along has been saying is about self-determination and self-management. We already have the experience of Mr Hand's appointment to the ADC back in May last year and that was a complete fiasco. </PARA>
<PARA>John Shovelan went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Isn't this just another stumbling block placed in front of the Government's proposal?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Coulter answered:</PARA>
<PARA>Not at all. All along Mr Hand knows that he's had my support provided that various conditions are met. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that Senator Coulter is going to stick to his guns in this case and that we will not see another turnaround, which he provided us with only half an hour or so ago. As Senator Coulter said, and I could not be more explicit myself:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it just flies in the face of the whole thrust of ATSIC which the Minister all along has been saying is all about self-determination . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Committee: How can one have self-determination when the Minister picks the five interim commissioners? It is absolutely farcical to suggest that anything like self-determination is being offered to the Aboriginal people. As one of my colleagues said, the interim commission could go for as long as 12 months. It could bring down two budgets, which would effectively give it control of ATSIC for something like two years. Certainly, the policies it set down would be in train for up to two years. I am waiting to hear what Senator Coulter is going to say about this particular proposal, but I am hopeful that he will stand by his words; otherwise the whole procedure that we are going through tonight will be a blot on this chamber Senator Coulter makes strong statements and then retracts them. I will yield to Senator Coulter now and listen to what he says about this-whether he will stick to his guns or whether it will be another backdown by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am getting sick of this holier-than-thou attitude from the Opposition. I remind the Opposition that during the previous session, which concluded in June, Senator Vallentine put forward a Bill in relation to the Antarctic. The Opposition and the Government both spoke vehemently as to why the Antarctic should not be protected. Within a fortnight the Opposition put forward its own motion, couched in very similar terms, to protect the Antarctic. The Government spoke against it, but within another fortnight it saw the wisdom of changing its stance. One could also look at my amendments in relation to the sales tax on recycled paper. That was opposed by both the Opposition and the Government, yet within a few weeks they were trying to jump over each other to introduce legislation to remove the 20 per cent sales tax from recycled paper. So let us not be too holy about the ability to change one's mind-for quite flippant reasons in those two cases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the interim commission, unlike the matter of the roll, I have been persuaded to a different position. In the case of the roll, my position was that philosophically I still supported the position being put by the Opposition. There were different reasons for not supporting it. In this case, when the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) tabled his statement and a number of other statements-I remind the Committee that about five were tabled within about an hour of the start of Question Time, among them, Mr Hand's suggestion that he appoint the five interim commissioners-I reacted very sharply and angrily to the Minister's suggestion and I used the words that Senator Boswell has read into the record. </PARA>
<PARA> However, having looked at this more calmly and dispassionately it seems to me desirable that there should be an interim commission to get this thing up and running as quickly as possible. In the process of converting the Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA) and the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) to the new structure, it will be necessary for the bureaucracy that will carry out a lot of that work to be responsible to somebody. It will take some time for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission to be elected. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to bear in mind that the processes to be gone through are the education of people at the level of the regions as to what is available to them and what is expected of them, then the election of regional councils and educating them about the opportunities which are available to them and the responsibilities they have. From that process will follow the election through the zones of ATSIC and then the further eduction and instruction of the ATSIC commissioners. As everybody has pointed out, this will be an extremely onerous task placed on those commissioners. They will not be ready to assume that task for some considerable time. It seems to me that it would be quite inappropriate-this is a consideration which I did not have in mind when I reacted to the Minister's original suggestion-for the commissioners to carry out as their first task the integration of those bureaucracies and bodies which now form the DAA and the ADC. It would be much better if that process could be carried out so that when the elected commissioners are ready to take up their duties the ATSIC structure is largely in place and they can take it over. </PARA>
<PARA> For that reason it seems to me that now-although it did not apply then-it is quite appropriate for the Minister to appoint an interim commission which will serve for a period not being more than 12 months after the commencement specified by the Minister, et cetera. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking in support of Senator Baume's amendment, this is a very important matter with regard to the appointment of an interim commission. It does go to fundamentals. Once again, it highlights the compromises that the Australian Democrats have chosen to make for the expediency of getting the legislation through. The fact that the Democrats have chosen to compromise their own principles and statements that have been so well expounded in the past and brought out I think is a matter that must concern us, as I said when I was speaking earlier with regard to it. It is a matter that makes me angry because I believe the Aboriginal people of Australia have taken the Democrats at their word and on face value. This is another instance where the Democrats have proven, particularly to Aboriginal people, that they cannot be trusted for whatever public statements they have made along the way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to remind the Committee that once this interim commission is in place, it operates as the Commission. One of the most important and fundamental jobs that it will have will be to determine a corporate plan. So it could well be that we will have in place an interim commission which is tying up for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission a corporate plan for a period of three to five years. Again, as I said, Senator Coulter and the Democrats have compromised self-determination and self-management-I prefer to use the term self-management-as a mechanism of achieving the proper Aboriginal process of decision making. By agreeing to the institution of an interim commission that will have the full powers and functions to develop the corporate plan which will then be in place, the Democrats have thrown away the process for years and years. Again, I remind the Committee of the deliberation that took place last week in Senate Estimates Committee E. When we were discussing the proposals for a corporate plan for the Aboriginal Development Commission, it was made very clear to the Committee that the Hand-picked group of commissioners who had been appointed in May 1988 and who currently comprise the Board of the ADC, have determined, in their own wisdom, without proper regard to the proposals for ATSIC and without any consultation, even with the ATSIC task force of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs that is currently in place, to steamroll ahead with a new corporate plan for the ADC. What confidence can Aboriginal Australians have in knowing that the group of commissioners, appointed by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand), is already locked into a political objective to predetermine what the corporate plan will be?</PARA>
<PARA> Given that the interim commissioners could well be the same bunch of characters that Minister Hand chose to appoint in 1988-even Senator Coulter has agreed that they have not measured up to any good measure of performance as a Board-we could end up with a constitution of the first Commission which will have to compromise. It will have to establish policies and principles, and it will have to pick up and determine all the initial Public Service arrangements-all of the staffing, all of the initial financing and all of the other structures. The Australian Democrats had the audacity to say that they are quite happy to wash their hands of this and sit back and watch the consequences for Aboriginal Australians, which will be disastrous. I am surprised once again that the Democrats have chosen to walk away from this group of people for whom I thought they had a particular regard. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, the Democrats have chosen not to consult with the community. Senator Jenkins has not said what consultations she has had in this regard in Western Australia. Senator Powell has not given her interpretation of any views from Victoria. Senator McLean has not outlined the provisions for Aboriginals that he has consulted throughout New South Wales. Senator Macklin has not said boo with regard to Queensland, and Senator Haines has given no representation on this issue for Aboriginals in South Australia. Senator Peter Baume from New South Wales, Senator Boswell from Queensland, Senator Crichton-Browne from Western Australia, I from the Northern Territory and other senators have been having discussions for months on this issue. I believe we are properly reflecting views and concerns, and the political dilemma that will be posed by an interim commission. The sheer raw politics that will be evidenced by the manipulative manner of Minister Hand in the initial setting up of ATSIC will have disastrous consequences for Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I invite Senator McLean to make a contribution. I wish he would not just sit there and snipe at people who are trying genuinely to do something for the Aboriginal people. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) has told us that the Government is determined that the Aboriginal people will achieve self-determination. We have been told by Senator Coulter that ATSIC, with its faults and all, will be better than what we have now and that it will give the Aboriginal people some say in their affairs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the legislation goes through in its present form we could have, for up to three years, a chairman appointed by the Minister telling the elected members what the Government policy is. For up to 12 months we will certainly have commissioners being appointed by Mr Hand; he will have the power to hire and fire them. They will be appointed by him and beholden to him. So the countless hours of debate in this chamber and the hours spent by the Senate Select Committee in travelling around Australia to try to get the best out of this ineffective legislation will all be wasted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are coming out of this debate now without the roll that the Democrats promised and with unelected commissioners, appointed by the Minister, who will no doubt get their riding instructions from the Minister. A corporate plan will be set down and any hope of self-determination will be lost. The whole legislation now becomes an utter farce, thanks to the Democrats. We may as well not have even started. With this legislation there will be no roll, no self-determination and no prospect of ever lifting the standing of Aboriginal people. I suppose we should not go into politics if we get disappointed by such things; we should just let them roll over us. But this is disappointing, although not surprising. It is the last straw for the Aboriginal people. They never wanted ATSIC in the first place. The Minister went around and told them that it was the only way they could ever make decisions for themselves. He even sold it to some people. But when he said that there would be an appointed commission, they lost all faith in any promises that the Minister had made. They saw through the whole shoddy charade of the ATSIC legislation. But they did have some hope; they did not believe that the Democrats would cave in. They thought that at least Senator Coulter could keep one promise. How disillusioned they will be that Senator Coulter could not stand up for them even on this one issue and let them have their self-determination, their elected representatives and democracy in their communities. They will not get that. Mr Hand will elect the commissioners and, if they do not do as they are told, he will sack them and send them home in disgrace, as he did with the commissioners of the Aboriginal Development Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is not worth even the paper it is written on. It is a charade, a fraud and a disappointment. Consequently, Aboriginal people will walk away from it as though it is the plague. The fate of this legislation hangs on what the Democrats do. If the Aboriginal people cannot make an input, if they cannot have a roll and if they do not know who will be elected, they will treat this legislation like they treated the National Aboriginal Conference. They will walk away from it; it will be just another piece of white man's legislation that they do not understand and do not want to know about. It will not deliver them anything and it will be a farce. </PARA>
<PARA> I am disappointed, but not as disappointed as the Aboriginal and Islander communities. I think they will take out their vengeance on the Democrats who have enjoyed some small electoral support from them. But I do not think the Aboriginal people will touch the Democrats with a 40-foot barge pole after having been sold out so badly by them on this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA> (99) Page 16, subclause 27 (1), line 20, leave out ``Minister'', insert ``Governor-General''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee will realise that amendment No. 99 was to be moved only if amendment No. 98 failed. What we are seeking to do with amendment No. 99 is amend clause 27 by leaving out the word `Minister` and inserting the word `Governor-General' at line 20. That would then mean that the appointments of the interim commissioners would be, as it were, made by the Executive Council.</PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Committee very briefly of the situation that arose in May 1988. Although the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) was able to sack eight commissioners, he was not able to sack the chairperson and one other commissioner because they had been appointed by the Executive Council. They were Governor-General appointments. What emerged from that little exercise was the enormous vulnerability of those appointees of the Minister and the relative security of the appointees of the Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Coulter is now convinced that it is appropriate to appoint an interim commission, we put to him that the Governor-General-that is, the Governor-General in Council-should appoint the commissioners. The appointments would go through Cabinet and the appointees would be given a security and a protection which they deserve and which history shows can be useful. History also showed us last year the inappropriateness of the Minister having the sole prerogative to make these appointments. We commend amendment No. 99. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think most honourable senators will recall the litany of disasters that came before Estimates committees and before the Senate during the last year, of loans that were made on inadequate documentation, of money that was given in areas within which those acting commissioners had a personal interest, and of loans which have been disastrous in their effect. We have already talked about the Woden Town Club and the fact that the guarantees that were given there have had to be called up. We should at least address ourselves to the manifest failure of that group of people. I would hope that the Minister, in his wisdom, would not want to appoint those people who have failed so badly to administer what was an established Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) with a good administrative infrastructure and established procedures. Those acting commissioners, when associated with the ADC, turned it into an area of disaster.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Reluctant as I am to direct criticism towards individual people, I have to say that we must look at what happened, look at the results that occurred and look at the actual events that are recorded. Those notorious acting commissioners have performed abysmally. The Opposition is concerned as to how it should proceed because it does not believe that they should become members of this interim commission. Of course, it is a different matter when we talk of the first elected Commission. That will be a matter for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. If they want to elect someone such as Ray Robinson-actually they cannot elect him at the moment but they can elect someone like him-then that is a matter for the electors. I do not wish to look behind the kind of choices they might make. Our concerns relate to the interim commissioners, who will not be elected and who will then reflect the judgments of the Cabinet and the Governor-General in Council, and the performance and record of the acting commissioners who have been there since 1988. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us be more honest in relation to this particular amendment. It is couched in a very objective way. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>A person shall not be appointed under subsection (1) if he or she was appointed to act as a Commissioner of the Aboriginal Development Commission on or after 12 May 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>It might have been more up front, more open, to have drafted the provision to say: `The following persons, being persons appointed to act as Commissioners of the Aboriginal Development Commission on or after 12 May 1988, are not to be appointed under subsection (1)'. Then the persons concerned could be listed. It is like an act of attainder under the Stuarts or the Tudors. Those parliaments had the capacity, apparently, to name certain persons, and terrible consequences followed. </PARA>
<PARA> If this were done in a more open way it would amount to the listing of certain individuals and persons and saying, `They are precluded from office because they accepted an appointment offered to them by a Minister to discharge a task on behalf of the Aboriginal community'-in this case with the Aboriginal Development Commission. I find it quite extraordinary that people like Mr Lui Junior, whom Senator Boswell would know well, the very respected Chairman of the Island Coordinating Council, should be precluded by dictate of this Parliament from serving on this interim Commission if it be the will of the Minister. I do not know that it is his will; I have no idea whatsoever. But I believe that Mr Lui would not wish it to be thought that Senator Boswell would vote for a provision which precluded him from participating-and I am sure that is not the intention of the Opposition. It is signalling a concern but I do not think that it will move the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> What does one say, for example, about listing Lois O'Donoghue? She is a remarkable woman by any standards who is performing an extraordinarily difficult task at the moment but doing it extremely well. We know that she was the foundation commissioner of the Aboriginal Development Commission for four years and has been an acting commissioner for the last 15 months. Senator Boswell has spoken of her role on the Aboriginal Hostels Limited Board over many years. I do not need to remind the persons who are involved in the committee stage of this debate of her qualifications, personal integrity and the high regard in which she is held-so much so that she is a member of the Order of Australia-indeed, a member of the Order of Australia Council. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Opposition, which has indicated its concerns, not to move this particular amendment because I believe that it could be misinterpreted in the Aboriginal community in a way which could become very personalised in regard to very good Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, two of whom I have mentioned. It would be a very remiss step for this Parliament to agree to a clause which, as I say, has more to do with the Tudor and the Stuart parliaments than with an Australian parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am impressed by the reference by the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) to Lois O'Donoghue and to Gaetano Lui Junior. I first met Lois O'Donoghue in 1974 or 1975 when I was a member of a Senate committee under the chairmanship of a former senator, the late Jim Keeffe. Lois O'Donoghue accompanied us to Oodnadatta on quite a memorable visit where former Senator Jean Melzer distinguished herself in defence of the Senate committee system. Lois O'Donoghue is a distinguished Australian. I think that some of the other people who have been appointed on or after 12 May 1988 are known to be distinguished Australians. But the fact is that the Aboriginal Development Commission has performed abysmally by any test one cares to make of its performance. Its decisions have been bad, partial, unfair, self-serving and vindictive. That is what the Commission has been like. Its treatment of Shirley McPherson--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> What concerns the Opposition is that this plea from the Minister-which we think is not unreasonable-contrasts markedly with the actions of the Minister himself in the treatment he meted out to the eight people he sacked. Those of us who were on the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs-Senator Coulter, Senator Boswell, I and other members who are not in the chamber-consider that those sacked Commissioners were treated shamefully. Senator Tate has just referred to the fact that if people are treated in this way their reputations may suffer in the community. Goodness me! What happened to the reputations of the eight sacked commissioners? The Senate Select Committee met a very fine person who came before it. She said, `When I went home people said, ``What have you done wrong?'' `. They assumed that she would not have been sacked had she not done something improper or wrong-that she had been cheating, or something like that. Of course, we care about the way she was treated, but the Minister did not, and if the Minister did not then the Government did not. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter was compounded because at about the time that they were sacked a very disgraceful event occurred. A story was leaked from somewhere centrally placed, somewhere with a fax. It appeared in the second edition of the Sydney Morning Herald and it alleged that a large amount of money had gone missing from the ADC and was unaccounted for. The fax turned up in Alice Springs at almost the same time. There was a concerted effort to discredit those dismissed commissioners. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I wish to draw to the attention of the Senate some correspondence that I received last week concerning the activities of Australia Post. This concerned me greatly, as it concerned many members of the Victorian electorate and I am sure the Australia-wide electorate. I refer to a letter that I have received from a constituent in Victoria concerning the delay in her receipt of a telegram from Austria advising her of the death of her brother. I have not had the opportunity to show the letter to Senator Reynolds, the Minister on duty. I would be very happy to pass the letter to her, and I hope that she will allow me to have it incorporated in Hansard. It basically advises Australia Post of the fact that her only brother passed away suddenly in Austria last month and that the telegram which was sent from Austria on the morning of 21 September was not received by her, for a variety of reasons, until 26 September. The letter points out that the telegram advising my constituent of the death of her brother was received by her five days after its dispatch from Austria. By that time not only had her brother died but also his funeral had taken place. As she says in her letter, this caused her great distress and embarrassment. She said that her relatives in Austria found it hard to accept that an overseas telegram would take five days to be delivered. I seek leave to have that letter, with the name deleted for personal reasons, incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Paul Smith,</PARA>
<PARA>Post Office Liaison Officer,</PARA>
<PARA>G.P.O. Box 2020,</PARA>
<PARA>Melbourne. 3001. </PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA>I write to say how distressed and bitterly disappointed I am with your telegram service. My only brother passed away suddenly in Austria and my relatives sent me a telegram informing me of this sad event and details of his funeral from Newmarket, Austria, at 11.30 a.m. 21 September. This telegram was received by me today 26 September at 2.00 p.m. in the ordinary mail. The number of the telegram is 00093-086674-01. From my inquiries I was told that the telegram was received in Melbourne at 10.00 p.m. on 21 September and was posted to my address from the West Footscray Post Office on 22 September. </PARA>
<PARA>A death in the family is a difficult time and in my case it has been even more difficult because of your delay and lack of service. My relatives in Austria believed that the telegram would be delivered immediately on its receipt in Australia. It is of great concern to me also that this is probably not the first time, or the last time, something like this has happened or will happen in a time of death and distress. </PARA>
<PARA>I would be grateful to receive your comments and explanations. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have written to the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Willis, drawing his attention to this fact. I have raised it in the Senate because it involves some very important issues of principle that relate to us all. A human fact of life has been exposed where, for whatever reason-and it would seem to be for reasons of less than perfect efficiency and operation-a government agency has caused considerable distress, embarrassment and concern to a person in Australia. If this were a one-off example I would perhaps be less likely to raise it in the Senate, but I find that there are increasing concerns expressed among my constituency in Victoria about the state of affairs with Australia Post and the delivery of services in my State. I would assume that that is not confined to Victoria but is Australia-wide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I raise this matter in the hope that the Minister and, through the Minister, the Government will look at the efficiency and operations of Australia Post in particular but of other government agencies as well in terms of their delivery of services. Although this is perhaps a small example it is a very important one for the persons concerned. I think that it is indicative of concern about the operations of government agencies, particularly in the area of telecommunications-Australia Post and Telecom Australia-in relation to the services that we have traditionally come to expect them to provide to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In that context I put to Senator Reynolds and, through her, to the Minister responsible, my considerable concern about the continuing rumour of Australia Post having a hit list of post offices and postal outlets around Australia. This rumour was probably at its peak in January this year. Despite denials from Australia Post, in January this year it was revealed through freedom of information provisions that there are proposed policy guidelines for the closure of Australia Post outlets throughout Australia. A figure of 240 outlets has been mentioned in the press. I do not know whether that figure is correct or not, but I do know that the guidelines were contained in a letter from Australia Post to the General Secretary of the Union of Postal Clerks and Telegraphists almost exactly one year ago from today. I am not sure that the contents of that letter have been made public, but on 28 October 1988 a letter to the General Secretary of the Union of Postal Clerks and Telegraphists from Mr Flynn, the Director of Retail Operations of Australia Post, contained as an addendum proposed policy guidelines for retail facilities in postal outlets in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Those guidelines said, among other things, that for provincial centres-which were classified in that category as having a population of between 10,000 and 100,000-the retail revenue was to be sufficient to cover full retail costs; that is, break even. The Australia Post guidelines for towns with fewer than 3,000 people were that the retail revenue was to be sufficient to cover 80 per cent of full retail costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia Post and the Government must tell the people of Australia, particularly those in non-metropolitan areas, whether those guidelines-which the press have called a hit list-are realistic guidelines in the sense of their being worked towards by Australia Post. Or does Australia Post deny those guidelines and claim that there are other guidelines or policy directives operating in relation to the postal facilities in this nation? If one believes the guidelines that were made available only through freedom of information, then one would say that the hit list that has been alleged in the media and elsewhere is, in fact, a hit list. It is an indictment of this Government that-to my knowledge-the Government has not been prepared to say whether this is or is not a list of the criteria on which postal facilities will operate. </PARA>
<PARA> If the guidelines that I have read out tonight are accurate in the sense that they are guidelines on which Australia Post will operate, they will have an enormous impact on regional and rural Australia. Regional and rural Australia has a right to know whether that is the area in which they are operating. If those guidelines were introduced, their impact would be considerable. I pay tribute to my colleague the shadow Minister for communications, Senator Alston, who has pointed out in press releases over the last couple of weeks that the re-emergence of speculation about the downgrading of rural post offices and Australia Post facilities will be resolved only when Australia Post outlines specifically what it proposes. So I ask the Government, through the Minister at the table tonight, to take on board what I have said and to bring back to the Parliament, and therefore to the Australian people, a clear indication of what is proposed so far as the future of postal facilities in rural and regional Australia is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the second part of my comments tonight. The first part, as I said earlier, related to the approach I have had from a very distressed and embarrassed constituent. Her family is overseas, and her problem concerns what seems to me to be an unconscionable delay in the receipt of a vitally important personal message through the overseas telegram service, operating in this case between Austria and Australia. Almost all of the delay has been occasioned at the Australian end. I demand that the Government give that constituent, through the Senate, an answer to that question and also look very seriously at the wider issues I have raised tonight because, in the end, our ability to communicate amongst ourselves, particularly the ability of the rural and regional areas of this country to communicate with each other; affects the lifeblood of this country. It is not an insignificant matter by any means. It is a matter that the Government should be coming clean on in a way that it has not been prepared to do to date. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) The Department of Finance has conducted three surveys since 1982: (A) A survey, conducted in 1986 using the 1985-86 Budget documents, sought views on the content, presentation and usefulness of Budget documents. (B) A survey, conducted in 1988 using the Commonwealth Financial Transactions, also seeking views on the content and format of the Commonwealth Financial Transactions. (C) A survey, conducted in 1987 using the Financial Management Information Service Circular (FISC), seeking comments on content, layout and presentation of the circular.</PARA>
<PARA>(A) 1985-86 Budget Documents Survey</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The questionnaire for the survey was developed and analysed by officers of the Department. The questionnaire was included in Budget documents q, 1a, 5 and 6 for 1985-86. The cost of producing the questionnaire was included in the overall cost of producing the Budget documents by AGPS and constituted only a very minor part of the overall cost.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes, before the contract was awarded.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There was no Defence Acquisition Council for DESINE. Acquisition Councils are convened for each major computing acquisition proposal. The DESINE proposal did not commit to any specific level of purchase and therefore did not come under the Acquisition Council process. Nonetheless, specific major acquisitions, which are being progressed under the DESINE concept, such as the Supply Systems Redevelopment Project, are each subject to Acquisition Council processes and these involve officers from my Department.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) As stated, there was no Acquisition Council for DESINE. The tenders were examined by the Defence Source Definition Committee which, on this occasion, included representatives of the Department of Administrative Services, Industry Technology and Commerce and the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Finance considered Defence's decision to proceed with DESINE to be justified. Some reservations were expressed at the time about having one major supplier for the bulk of Defence ADP acquisitions for five years. These were addressed by Defence and balanced against the potential benefits from improved capability of systems.</PARA>
<PARA> Finance is strongly supportive of the development of OSI, which has the potential in the longer term to reduce the lock in to any particular supplier. It is noted that acceptance of OSI is an element of the DESINE concept.</PARA>
<PARA> As to implementation of DESINE, it was Defence's expressed intention that DESINE should not preclude the adding to existing (non-DESINE) equipment where a DESINE solution would not be economic at this time. Finance understands that the contract provides exemptions from the sole-supplier status of IBM, where solutions covered by the contract would be clearly unsuitable in terms of functionality or time or where excessive project cost is involved, which would appear to give effect to this intention; Finance would be concerned if it did not.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) No. My officers' advice was that information provided from Defence indicated that, on the basis of Life Cycle Costs, for indicative purchase quantities specified in the Request for Tender, the IBM offer was the cheapest and most cost-effective.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) I agree that I share with other Ministers the responsibility to achieve the lowest cost-effective solution. I consider that my particular responsibility is best discharged by establishing an appropriate framework to promote good decision making. This is achieved through promulgating regulations and guidelines which provide guidance on procedures and other aspects of decision making. Open tender is a desirable process and should be the norm, but may not always be practicable or the most appropriate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 28 September 1989, Senator Chapman asked me, as Minister representing the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industrial Relations, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is it a fact that the Government has decided to provide fully maintained motor vehicles for the use of Senior Executive Service (SES) level public servants? Does the Minister agree that this decision could amount to anything from a 10 to 15 per cent pay rise on top of what these officers will receive in national wage adjustments? Is this decision consistent with the wage guidelines that the Government is so determined to protect in the pilots dispute? How many such cars are being provided? Is it correct that the public servants have the option of purchasing their vehicles at the end of two years or 40,000 kilometres? If so, will they buy them at normal commercial value or at the depreciated figure taken from a Commonwealth sales tax free original purchase price? Will he in due course provide the Senate with full details of the decision, the extent of its implementation and the guidelines which apply so that the public can make an assessment of how the provision of this facility to its own employees sits with Government's rhetoric about other pay claims?</PARA>
<PARA> In my reply, I undertook to provide the Senate with full details of the decision to introduce the scheme, the extent of implementation and the guidelines which apply. The Minister for Industrial Relations has provided the following response (and the response is sub-divided for convenience):</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Senior Executive Service (SES) officers in the Australian Public Service now have access to Commonwealth owned private plated vehicles for private purposes under clearly stated terms and conditions. The vehicles are not for the exclusive use of the participating officers. They must remain available for operational requirements of official Commonwealth use, including by other staff, during office hours, and SES officers who choose to participate are required to make a personal financial contribution towards meeting the costs of private use of the vehicle.</PARA>
<PARA> Participation by SES officers in the scheme is optional, and is a conditional entitlement. The personal contribution is currently set at $500 per annum for those officers who choose to drive a 4-cylinder vehicle and $700 for a 6-cylinder vehicle. Participating officers may choose from a specific range of standard, fleet-type cars, fully maintained, which as far as possible comply with the Government's passenger vehicle manufacturing plan.</PARA>
<PARA> The provisions are modest in comparison to many private sector schemes, which frequently provide luxury cars for the exclusive private use of executives without the requirement for any financial contribution, and other public sector schemes.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that the limited provision of cars for SES officers will assist in retaining skilled and experienced senior officers, while in no way conflicting with the Government's commitment to the adherence to National Wage Case Guidelines in the area of SES pay.</PARA>
<PARA> The Coalition would apparently go further. The current Coalition Public Administration Policy document proposes terms and conditions of employment in the public sector broadly comparable to those in the private sector. It also proposes market loadings in addition to the terms and conditions determined by the Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Approximately 1600 SES officers are eligible to participate in the scheme. As some eligible officers will elect not to participate, and others will gain access to existing Commonwealth vehicles converted to private plates, a lesser number of new vehicles is required. Final details are therefore not available.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) SES officers will not have an option to buy the cars at the end of two years or 40,000 kilometres. Rather, when the vehicles are being replaced, approximately every two years, the used vehicles will be sold by DAS at public auction.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) I table a copy of Guidelines on the Private Use and Registration of Commonwealth Vehicles, which sets out in full the provisions which apply.</PARA>
