<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the Administrative Services Legislation Amendment Bill contains amendments to a number of Acts administered by the Administrative Services portfolio. The amendments are of a kind which, in recent years, it has been the practice to include in an omnibus Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment of the Public Works Committee Act 1969</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>As Honourable Senators will be aware, the Public Works Committee Act 1969 established the Public Works Committee to scrutinise the Executive's expenditure on public works. Since the inception of the Committee, departments and to an extent the Committee itself, have regarded works as being limited to those of a permanent architectural or engineering nature carried out for or by the Government. Movable works, such as the construction of a ship, have long been regarded as being of the nature of specialised procurement which ought not to be subject to the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>However, in recent years, legal advice to the effect that movable works may in certain circumstances indeed be works within the terms of the Public Works Committee Act, has called this view into question. To remove the ambiguity as to what comes within the definition of a work for the purpose of the Act, the amendments introduced by this Bill provide that a work means an architectural or engineering work and specifically excludes intangible things, movable works and engineering equipment not being integral components of a work. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also expands the definition of work to ensure that works which are financed by deferred payment or similar arrangements are referrable to the Committee. In these times of economic restraint Government bodies are increasingly turning to alternative methods of financing their public works. Under a deferred payment arrangement, the Government body is not required to finance the work during construction, but effectively, it is paid off by instalments after occupancy. Such alternatives to traditional funding are attractive, but in some situations the relevant works are not referrable to the Committee under the existing provisions of the Act. Where there is a clear intention for the Government and its agencies to become the owner of such facilities, the amendment will allow the Public Works Committee to fulfil its established role. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also provides that after consultation with the Committee, types of works can be declared to be works or public works by regulation for the purposes of the Act. Similarly, types or works can also be declared not to be works or public works by regulation. This approach is intended to facilitate consideration of new types of projects and delivery systems and to meet changing circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment of the Protective Service Act 1987</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The amendments of the Australian Protective Service Act 1987 extend the powers of arrest of protective service officers to the offences of escaping from lawful custody, aiding a person to escape from lawful custody or rescuing a person by force from lawful custody which were recently created by amendments to the Crimes Act 1914. This is essentially a consequential amendment. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment of the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators may be aware that presently the Chairman of the Grants Commission must be appointed on a full-time basis, whereas members can be appointed on either a full-time or part-time basis. The amendments to the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973 provide for the option of appointing the Chairman also on a full-time or a part-time basis. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment of the Parliament House Construction Authority Act 1979</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The Parliament House Construction Authority will have successfully completed the major phase of the design and construction of the new Parliament House by early 1989. There are however financial and legal tasks related to the completion and termination of over 500 contracts requiring further work over the next two to three years. There are also minor construction works remaining to be completed. </PARA>
<PARA>While the functions to be undertaken by the Authority after early 1989 continue to be very important to the completion of the project, the range of matters to be managed will be more restricted than in earlier years. Consequently, the Government considers that the range of skills and experience required by Authority board members in this period would not need to be as diverse as those required for the current and previous boards. </PARA>
<PARA>In recognition of the change in nature and scope of the remaining work the Government took two decisions:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) that the Authority was to complete its remaining work and be terminated in June 1991, and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) consonant with the wind down phase commencing early in 1989, from that time the Authority board would be restructured reducing its numbers from 6 to 3 part-time members including the position of chairman. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill puts into effect the later decision. It is the Government's intention to bring forward in 1991 appropriate legislation terminating the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Debate (on motion by Senator Knowles) adjourned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the adjournment of the debate last evening, I was speaking to the three points on which the Australian Democrats believe there needs to be more emphasis from Australian representatives at the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. They are: endeavours to alleviate poverty, particularly in Third World countries; the need to look at environmental degradation; and the requirement to take into account the legitimate desires of indigenous peoples.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the first item, the alleviation of poverty, American economists Bruce Russett and David Sylvan have considered the social opportunity costs of certain expenditure, particularly military expenditure, in Third World countries. They found that for an average developing country with a population of 8.5 million and a gross national product of around $US350m, the first $200m of arms imports would lead to approximately 20 additional infant deaths per 1,000 live births; decreased average life expectancy of three to four years; and 13 to 14 fewer literate adults out of every hundred in the adult population. These are extraordinary statistics. There is the direct linkage between arms imports by those poor countries and the lessening of the amount spent on health, education and general social conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, one wonders whether the multilateral finance institutions should start making arms reductions a condition of loans to developing countries. After all, the International Monetary Fund is known for the socially harsh conditions which it places on its balance of payments loans to countries. Countries are required to cut public expenditure, particularly in the area of social expenditure, and raise interest rates to stabilise their external balance of payments. Military expenditure, however, seems to be a matter of total indifference to the International Monetary Fund when it imposes those types of conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> Investing in poverty alleviation just happens to make good economic sense. It is not charity. Study after study has shown that investments in poverty alleviation and human capital formation are not less economically productive than investments in infrastructure, energy or industry. On the contrary, empirical research shows that satisfying human needs yields high rates of economic return. This is, in fact, borne out by World Bank figures comparing the economic gains from poverty-oriented projects and non-poverty oriented projects in rural areas. As a footnote, I point out that the World Bank considers the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) a good means of directly overcoming poverty at the grass roots level. The bank, in last year's document, one that I have already mentioned-that is, the World Bank's support for the alleviation of poverty-says that it is cooperating with IFAD in 122 projects. The two organisations are cofinancing 78 projects and IFAD is coordinating its interventions in countries undertaking bank supported structural adjustment programs such as Ghana and Guinea-Bissau. The bank states:</PARA>
<PARA>Experience with these and other initiatives can greatly enhance the Bank's understanding of which programs work and why, as well as provide valuable support for efforts to protect the poor during periods of adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA>However, we noted that the Australian Government does not seem to appear to concur with the bank's view of IFAD since it announced some time ago that it does not plan to replenish its contributions to the fund. The Australian Democrats urge the new Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) to review this particular decision since it seems an extremely shortsighted one in terms of the major thrust which the World Bank has identified as necessary and which has been supported by members of all parties in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> The second item to which I wish to refer is environmental degradation. Poverty alleviation and overcoming Third World debt are, I believe, closely intertwined with preventing environmental degradation in those Third World countries. Countries facing crippling debt interest payments are more likely to destroy wilderness and rainforest and misuse rural land in their efforts to increase commodity exports and gain export dollars to pay those debts. We have seen this in country after country. Unless poverty is overcome, the rural poor farm flood-prone valleys and rapidly eroding hillsides. Poor people cannot afford to invest in conservation measures or grow crops which take a long time to mature. Urban poor live in crowded and unsanitary conditions and are hurt most by flooding, water pollution and congestion. On a grander scale, industrialisation in the Third World must take account of the greenhouse effect on the entire planet of further emissions into the atmosphere. Yet the developing world is hardly likely to accept regulations on its development, certainly those imposed from without, while the developed world continues to pursue self-interested economic and environmental policies. </PARA>
<PARA> As the World Bank itself has noted, wealthier countries directly damage the global environment by transmitting pollutants and by using developing countries as `pollutant havens' for industry at the same time that they voice increasing concern about the preservation of species and ecosystems, pointing to the direct hypocrisy of countries such as ours. Industrial countries continue to pursue pricing policies and trade restrictions which are massively destructive of the economies in those countries, either by preventing them from exporting agricultural products or by encouraging them to deplete their natural resource base without adequate compensation. In April 1987 the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development concluded in its report entitled Our Common Future that environmental management should be integrated into economic planning; that public participation is required; and that economic growth, the alleviation of poverty and sound environmental management are in many cases mutually consistent objectives. Clearly then, through the World Bank, developed countries can, at least in part, meet their economic and humanitarian responsibilities to the developing world. Through the World Bank, at least in part, Third World development can be environmentally sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA> The third item that I raise-that is, the needs of indigenous people-is one which unfortunately has not received a great deal of attention. The development policies of the IBRD and other arms of the World Bank must become increasingly sensitive to the Fourth World, the world of the planet's remaining indigenous peoples. Fourth World people are those still living tribal or semi-tribal lives. In many cases they do not identify with the sovereign states within whose borders they live. In many cases also they live and travel backwards and forwards across international borders. Development policies must allow their cultures to evolve; they must not destroy those cultures and leave the people alienated and therefore more likely to become part of the rural and urban poor. </PARA>
<PARA> More effort needs to be put into understanding that culture is a form of knowledge. We have in the past-and even at present we are doing it-pushed extremely poor educational development policies, for example, those which can destroy the knowledge base within a particular community. If I may give a concrete example of this, a study in a Mexican village showed that non-Indian school-age children were able to identify the uses of 37 plants. In contrast, Otomi Indian children in that village could identify the uses of 138 plants. That is an enormous difference. In spite of this, a development program which was being funded saw the Indian children as `ignorant' and in need of education. In other words, there was a total mismatch in that the people who were coming in lacked a sympathetic understanding of the knowledge base of those indigenous people. Of course, the danger there is that those educational activities could in fact destroy the indigenous knowledge base rather than supplement it. In destroying that base, they could very well destroy the livelihood of many of those people. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an area that, hopefully, will become of greater interest to members of this chamber because it is one with which Australia is intimately involved and it is one to which, through our activities in the World Bank, we need to make sure that other countries pay attention. </PARA>
<PARA> I have outlined why the Democrats believe that poverty alleviation, environmental protection and the rights of indigenous people are important. What we are looking for is that Australia's representatives at the World Bank promote these concerns and monitor the effectiveness of the bank's response to them. We are looking for more extensive annual reporting to parliament of Australia's participation in World Bank fora. That reporting should include an assessment of the effectiveness of the bank's efforts in the areas of which I have spoken. </PARA>
<PARA> I foreshadow that in the committee stage I shall ask a number of questions concerned with the availability and extent of the material that we receive, particularly that material which is provided to Australia and which is declassified by the World Bank-in other words, it is freely available-and yet which has never been included in annual reports to this Parliament. If Senator Messner's amendment is not carried I foreshadow that, at the second reading stage of the debate, I will move an amendment which has been circulated in my name. I point out also that, in the committee stage, I wish to move a substantive amendment directed at that reporting mechanism so that this Parliament can be better informed and so that those parliamentarians from all political parties who have signed letters to the World Bank over the last couple of years in regard to the three items that I have been speaking about will be better informed as to the movements within the World Bank. With that information these debates about whether we should continue our activity or whether we should move our resources to some other area would be better informed. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment I am concerned that the debates we have in this place are based on information that we receive from outside the country rather than from inside the country. We know that the material is being received by the Australian Government. The difficulty is that, while it is not classified by the World Bank, it seems to be classified by the departments that receive it in Australia. I think that is a pity because these are matters that concern the Australian community. The Australian community is putting up the dollars for this activity and I think it has a right to be informed of the developmental philosophies of the World Bank-not just who we have sitting on the board and how much money is being moved around. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (General Capital Increase) Bill 1988 will provide parliamentary approval for Australia to take up part of its allocated subscription to increase the capital of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), sometimes referred to as the World Bank. Although it has 151 member countries it is not quite a world bank, as countries such as Russia and some other notable countries are not members. Australia is entitled to subscribe to 10,734 shares before September 1992 and the Federal Government has decided to subscribe approximately 73 per cent of its entitlement, which it has been estimated will cost Australia about $US28 1/2m. In fact, Australia is about the thirteenth major source of funds for the bank, accounting for about 2 per cent of total funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to remind the Senate that the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) said in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia is a strong, but not uncritical, supporter of the IBRD. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition endorses those words but it feels that the country can do more to monitor the programs and priorities of the bank in pursuing its goals. This is especially so when we consider the growing indebtedness of many of the bank's major clients and the realistic conclusion that many will not for a long period, if ever, have a capacity to repay their loans. I refer specifically to Latin American countries and also to countries in sub-Saharan Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the President of the bank, Mr Barber Conable, is very sincere in his wish for the bank to assume a more invigorated role, as he has outlined in his report of September 1987. The President was encouraging the World Bank to be more circumspect in its lending activities and, at the same time, much more appreciative of the pressures on many underdeveloped countries. On the one hand, many countries are endeavouring to lay a firm fiscal infrastructure in their own national economies and, on the other hand, some of them are trying to compete generally on the global market in the raw material area-a very difficult exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> The President, since coming to that high office, has reduced the bureaucracy of the World Bank by several hundred positions but unfortunately, in some people's view, it still has too many people because it is still over 6,000 strong. I hope that a leaner structure in future will also bring with it a higher degree of responsiveness. The bank dispenses cash to the poor amongst its members, either to governments or to private sector groups undertaking projects guaranteed by their governments. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only has the World Bank increased the provision for loan losses to cover bad debts from $100m to $500m but it has also encouraged nations to increase and elongate debt. Eight borrowers from the World Bank are presently in arrears. The most indebted nation is Peru, which owes $US1.2 billion. Others on this formidable list include Panama, Nicaragua, Guyana, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Zambia and Syria. With the exception of Syria, all these countries are in Central Africa or Central and South America. The legislation in effect will recommit Australia to picking up part of the cost for programs and loans that the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development dispenses. To that extent, it should not be a step that is taken lightly. Indeed, the American Congress had a very extensive and drawn out debate before it decided to increase the capital because of the disquiet that many congressmen felt about the role of the World Bank, particularly some of its past policies which they believed tended to promote socialism, thwarted United States foreign policy and supported corrupt governments. I hope, therefore, that honourable senators in this place will also reflect not only on the specifics of this Bill but also on what it partially represents-that is, an enduring commitment to take part in the financial charter of the World Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has been a member of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development since 1947 following its establishment. As its name implies, it was established to aid postwar reconstruction and development, particularly in newly independent countries or those in Europe whose industrial bases were destroyed by war. After the resurrection of European industry, the bank turned its focus to the Third World. Regrettably, many Third World countries which the bank has assisted since the 1950s have been run by undemocratic governments and, in some cases, dictatorships. Thus, the World Bank has achieved in some circles an unfortunate profile of supporting the political stances of some of these governments through support for programs in their countries. Some critics say that the bank has a preoccupation with infrastructures rather than with poverty, with having preferences for dams and petrochemical plants and with displacing indigenous people from their land by virtue of some of its programs. In fact, President Aquino inherited debts over the corruption financed nuclear power plant in the Philippines. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of this political colouring of the World Bank's work and the nature of many of the economies that it assists, much of the money spent by the World Bank effectively can be said to become aid. The World Bank is not an aid agency and should not have been developed in this manner. Indeed, the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau has estimated that the World Bank is three times less efficient in the disbursement of funds than AIDAB itself. But unlike AIDAB, the World Bank has no national government to whom it is responsible for efficiency and the allocation of funds. Thus, in this regard, the World Bank has degenerated, in my view and in the view of many on this side of the Parliament, to an inefficient aid agency, losing sight of the objectives of its boundaries and losing control over the specific end purpose of many of its program funds. </PARA>
<PARA> To this degree, I am disturbed about some of the activities of the World Bank and its role in the economy. However, the Opposition supports the original aims of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and hopes that it will move in a number of directions: first, stop increasing loans to countries whose capacity to pay diminishes proportionately and, secondly, stop seeing itself as a quasi aid agency. National governments have their own aid agencies and are at least able to be accountable to their respective parliaments. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I think that there is need for the Western world to face up to two issues: firstly, too harsh an application of economic stringency and enforced reduction of living standards will bring an adverse and hostile reaction from debtor countries with consequent loss of goodwill. I draw the Senate's attention to recent events in Venezuela. There has been a degree of revolution there because of the commitment of that country's Government to force down the standard of living of workers to help repay international debts. The second issue is that a hard core of the debt needs to be absorbed, shared and written off by the lender agency to enable a reasonable ratio of debt repayment to export income, because some countries now find themselves in a quite impossible position in servicing debt. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, there is a responsibility on the part of debtor countries not to squander money. Countries which have very poor base economies are having their economies further eroded by the development of huge, unnecessary, grandiose schemes, such as the replica of the Basilica of Rome which is being constructed along the Ivory Coast. </PARA>
<PARA> While the bank is facing unprecedented criticism, the bulk of its lending is to stable governments. Despite politically motivated difficulties, it has still provided a number of worthwhile projects, including some extensive reafforestation items. I hope that some of my concerns expressed today will be heeded by the World Bank bureaucrats and the Australian Treasury, which gives advice on how many shares will be subscribed to. </PARA>
<PARA> While I criticise the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, I believe that there are some parallels in Australia. The Government has been as negligent as the bank in some areas, that is, in its attention to the management of the Australian economy and its failure to implement appropriate measures to curb the development of stagflation. So we have a parallel situation. Our balance of payments problems not only are a reaction to an overheated domestic demand but also reflect Australia's problems because of our dependence on a few export commodities of the unprocessed kind-problems which are faced by many of the debtor nations to which the World Bank provides funds. At home our problems reveal our import dependence on capital equipment and industrial supplies. </PARA>
<PARA> The ineffectiveness of government monetary policy to stave off inflation and its implications on the well-being of the economy is a matter of which everybody should take note. In fact, we get continual reminders from informed sources. The National Australia Bank Economist of 13 February said that the tight monetary policy with subsequent high professional market interest rates appears set to continue. It is worrying when the market advisers keep giving us information which is contrary to that given by the Government's best advisers, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). It is confusing and must be worrying to business when the political masters do not seem to know, or do not want to know, what is happening in our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told that interest rates may need to go quite a lot higher before they bite economic activity. The firming of United States interest rates will also lead to our own interest rates being sustained at high levels. What is happening in Germany and across Europe supports this contention. What the Government does not realise is that there is a time lag between changes in interest rates and their effectiveness in the economy. The evidence of the past two credit squeezes in 1974 and 1981 shows that monetary policy takes a long time to bite, but it has real teeth when it does. </PARA>
<PARA> This aspect does not seem to have been appreciated by either the Prime Minister or by the Treasurer. High interest rates increase the speculative effect from overseas. However, the gains made to Australia do not offset the balance of payments problems because essentially it is hot money that is drawn in. There is no short term relief for inflation or for the current account deficit. Contrary to what the Treasurer says, there is no short term relief on the interest rates front. The intended rise in interest rates to take the heat out of the labour market and slow wages, inflation and imports has not been fully realised. Prices, imports and the demand for a rise in wages and tax cuts have continued to increase, which implies that a recession is looming. All these will impact on the cost of living. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is deficient in domestic savings. My colleague Senator Parer gave a marvellous notice of motion this morning pointing out the gravity of the situation. It is also reflected in the current account deficit and the consequent rise in external debt. The domestic demand for savings funds has exceeded the supply of domestic funds, with the shortfall being covered by borrowings from overseas. To reverse this trend, savings will have to increase to between 3 and 4 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) from the present level. </PARA>
<PARA> The four main indicators of saving reflect the fact that consumer debt has risen over the past decade. Australia has unsatisfactory ratios of debt to household income, interest to disposable income, debt to household assets, and real debt per capita. No wonder our standard of living is falling. From the 1970s to the 1980s consumer debt rose on all four indicators. However, there has been a small decline in all four indicators following the collapse of the sharemarket in October 1987. But the fact that that crash occurred is no credit to the Government. Australia's lack of savings, therefore, impinges on its international trade performance and, in part, on our trade imbalance because we need to borrow from overseas to satisfy our demand. We are now borrowing from overseas in an environment of increasing interest rates in North America and Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> The investment position is equally bleak. Investment outlays were lower in 1988 than in 1981-82. Business investment as a share of GDP in the September quarter of 1988 was 11.4 per cent lower than the ratio for the previous three quarters and lower than the ratio which applied in the last quarter of 1981 and the first two quarters of 1982. Australia depends on the importation of capital goods and industry supplies, as we have no significant import substitution industries for these goods. The consequence is that the import of investment goods always has an impact on the current account deficit which, therefore, weakens our balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, we have been misled. There is not a lot of evidence to support the view that higher investment will pump out sufficient exports, including import competing exports, to restore the current account deficit. Funds are going into consumer goods and not into capital goods which would enhance our export performance. Our exports need to grow 5 per cent faster than our imports for at least two years just to get our external debt level stable, with a constant Australian dollar and high commodity prices. That is how serious it is. The trend in our current account deficit has continued to deteriorate since 1970, as most of our spending on imports is on consumer goods rather than on capital goods designed for export enhancement. </PARA>
<PARA> Capital imports as a share of total imports fell from the six months ended December 1987 to the six months ended December 1988. This implies that imports of consumer and other goods are responsible to a large degree for the strong import growth which has boosted our current account deficit. High interest rates have not dampened domestic demand or discouraged imports. I remind the Senate of their time lag, which means that when they bite they are going to bite very savagely, and it is therefore going to be difficult to turn off the tap quickly. In fact, imports have increased. There has been pressure on interest rates to rise due to increased demand for consumer goods and the relative ease in obtaining goods on credit. Due to deregulation of the financial market, credit is easy to obtain, apart from the cost of servicing it, and the effects on the balance of payments are significant. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this Government tax increases, which account for 25.5 per cent of all gross domestic product, have increased revenue by $41 billion. Under the Hawke Government, personal taxes have increased by 100 per cent and sales tax by 107 per cent. The Budget surplus could be somewhat closer to $6 billion than the $5 billion estimated last August. Treasury officers estimate a Budget surplus of almost $7 billion this year and $12 billion next year if conservative forecasts are assumed. The blow-out in the current account deficit, the increase in the inflation rate and a strong reliance on monetary policy have weakened Australia's economic position. The Government needs to look at its role in the fiscal and wages policy area to effect a more positive economic climate in Australia, because the effect of our spending has been to blow out our balance of payments deficit. Our balance of payments deficit for January was the worst January figure on record, about three times the deficit recorded for January last year. The Government's Budget forecast for 1988-89 of $9.5 billion has already been exceeded. Indeed, the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), explained in the House that a Morgan Guaranty Australia Ltd trust company study had shown that in 1986 our gross foreign debt was $101 billion, or 42 per cent of gross domestic product. Brazil's foreign debt at that time was 41 per cent of gross domestic product, almost a parallel situation. In fact Australia was not far behind the ailing Colombian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Australia Bank forecast a current account deficit of about $14 billion for 1988-89, almost $2 billion more than the previous year and $4.5 billion up on the Budget forecast. That is indeed a problem for Australia. But what happens? We are told that the Government is sitting it out and not doing anything. In other words, it is burying its head in the sand in relation to Australia's economic problems. So the problems of declining savings rates, falling or flat productivity of the labour force, excessive reliance on government, a lack of competition in the market, a lack of incentive in the economic system, and the structure of the tax system have all got to be addressed. All these factors compound our balance of payments problem and reflect the lack of commitment to continuing sound economic management. It is, therefore, relevant that we compare Australia's performance with that of some of those ailing countries which the World Bank lends to, because after all many of those countries have been referred to by Mr Keating as banana republics. Australia could well go down that road unless the Government starts to take positive action and draws a May economic statement or a mini-Budget to address the major factors that are affecting the lives of millions of Australians. </PARA>

<PARA>At the end of August 1988, a little less than six months ago, this Government brought down its Budget for 1988-89. It is a government which, I understand, sometime this week will move into its seventh year of government. The questions that every Australian and the media are now asking are: what has been achieved, and how does the standard of living of the average Australian now compare to the standard of living of the average Australian in 1983? The answer, with very few exceptions, is that the great majority of Australians are far worse off. The honeymoon is over for this Government. The rhetoric has not been matched with results and promises of better days have not materialised. The light at the end of the tunnel has dimmed. It has got further and further away, notwithstanding the promises we have had year after year in subsequent Budgets. It is worth noting some of the quotes from the recent Budget Speech by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). I will quote him, in part:</PARA>
<PARA>Just a short time ago we faced grave economic difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA>We have grave economic difficulties. They are worse than they have ever been previously. But that remark was the light offered by the Treasurer in the Budget Speech. The Treasurer went on:</PARA>
<PARA>Adverse world developments hacked into our export earnings; our national income shrank and foreign debt surged. </PARA>
<PARA>There had been a reduction in the terms of trade, I agree, but last year there was a massive increase in the terms of trade. I would like to ask: what has changed? The Treasurer said our foreign debt surged. Our foreign debt continues to surge. The implication in the Budget Speech was that somehow something had changed. The Treasurer went on:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we are now well on the way back to prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA>What a joke! Do the members of this Government not talk to the average Australian? They would find out whether we were well on the way back to prosperity. All one has to do is to ask those on average weekly earnings, `What are your problems?' and they will give about three. The first is that interest rates have gone out of sight. They say, `We cannot afford our mortgage repayments'. Sure, the banks have been able to alleviate this to some extent by extending the time of payment. However, of course, the total payment for the purchase of a house has gone up substantially. I will come back to that later. The second answer average Australians will give is, `The prices our wives have to pay in the supermarkets for ordinary goods, whether they be--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the Senate that we are talking about the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (General Capital Increase) Bill and the amendment moved by Senator Messner to the motion for the second reading of that Bill. I indicated at the beginning of my speech that I would address my remarks to that area. Senator Messner has introduced his amendment because, while nobody disagrees that we have some sort of duty to perform in making payments to this bank, we also need to look in our own backyard. It was with that in mind that I was addressing those items.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is appropriate that we talk about the economic crisis in our own country while at the same time we seek to address the problems that occur in Third World countries. Some people would argue that this country, compared with many of its near neighbours, may well be approaching that Third World status. I could not help noting that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) gave gratuitous advice to Vietnam during a recent trip to South East Asia when he said, `If you're not careful and don't do something about it, you might end up as an island in a sea of progress in South East Asia'. Again, he ignored his own backyard. From the point of view of the manufacturing industry, for instance, we run that very grave risk. Some people would say that we are already facing that situation. Some of the figures that I will refer to shortly might well bear that out. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of a parliamentary team last year, I visited some Asian countries, including the Philippines and Korea. One could not help making the comparison between the Korea of 10 years ago and the Korea of today. Korea, 10 years ago, was a Third World country. It is still regarded as such by some. However, in that 10-year period that country has put us in a position, comparatively, from a manufacturing point of view, of approaching Third World status. I return to the remarks made by the Treasurer in his Budget Speech:</PARA>
<PARA> This year our balance of payments deficit will be halved from its peak of just three years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>He is nowhere near the mark. Our balance of payments deficit figures for the first seven months of this financial year were in excess of the Budget forecast. Senator Watson referred to the estimate made by various people that by the end of this year the figure may well be in excess of $14 billion. The Treasurer also said:</PARA>
<PARA> Our foreign debt burden has stabilised and begun to fall. </PARA>
<PARA>Our foreign debt burden has never been higher. I read in the paper today that the net foreign debt is in excess of $95 billion and presumably, with the reduction in the value of the dollar, we can expect it to be somewhat higher when the next figures are released. That sort of net foreign debt-the gross is in excess of $120 billion-is putting us in the same category as Latin American countries. It is, and should be, a cause of great concern. This is the reason for Senator Messner's amendment, in which he points out that we are alarmed at this Government's lack of concern or urgency in addressing the economic crisis which is evident to everybody except, apparently, the Prime Minister of this country, the Treasurer and the Government. The Treasurer pointed out in his speech:</PARA>
<PARA> On the export front, new manufacturing activities and tourism have blossomed.</PARA>
<PARA>Certainly, tourism has blossomed but not because of this Government, although I agree that the television advertisements arranged by Paul Hogan some years ago in the United States were a success. However, the major reason for the success-there are always two sides to the coin-has been the growing investment, mainly by the Japanese, in our tourist developments. This is attracting more and more people, mainly to my own State of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> The only comment in the 1988-89 Budget Speech that made any sense-but again the rhetoric was not backed up by any sort of performance-was that we must abandon forever the myopic view that the world owes us a living and will go on bankrolling us whatever we do. Let us examine these brave, optimistic words. I do not mind the Government talking up the economy if it can, but talking on its own is not enough; there must be action and this Government is not taking any action. As I mentioned earlier, the Government forecast a reduction in the current account deficit, a reduction in debt and so on. In seven months we have achieved a $9.6 billion deficit. The Budget forecast was $9.5 billion. The Government subsequently amended it upwards after only a couple of months-not a long time. </PARA>
<PARA> The level of inflation is of great concern. That is something that governments can have some control over. In his amendment in relation to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development Bill, Senator Messner stated his concern about the collapse in family living standards since 1983 caused by a drop in purchasing power of at least $58 a week for families on average weekly earnings. Only yesterday the Australian Institute of Family Studies put out its report with its recommendations. It is obvious to everyone that the standard of living of average Australians has diminished dramatically. In fact, a one income family on average weekly earnings with two children has lost $41 in real disposable income over the past four years under the Hawke Government. There have been some gainers, and the gainers have been those people whose average weekly income is less than one-half of average weekly earnings and those at the top end of the scale. Again, it shows how gratuitous advice given to other people about the way in which they should run their economies has thus diverted attention from the quite disastrous results being imposed upon Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter is interest rates. Interest rates are a wonderful saga. This Government has an appalling record on what it has said and done about interest rates in Australia. It is worth quoting a few comments made by our own Prime Minister. Was he acting out of ignorance, or was he saying things because it suited him politically before an election or a by-election? During the election campaign in 1987 the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>Interest rates are again falling and under Labor will continue to fall . . . Labor will continue to pursue policies which will allow interest rates to fall further. </PARA>
<PARA>At a press conference in July 1987 he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Interest rates as you know are falling and will continue to fall and mortgage rates are . . . expected to fall before the end of 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>He said in January 1989 that home loan interest rates will go down this year. The facts on interest rates present quite a different story. Since June 1988 short term interest rates have increased from 13.5 per cent to 15.5 per cent, and the prime interest rate today has risen from about 15 per cent to about 17 1/2 to 18 per cent. Those are the problems that affect ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent times the question of savings has been raised. Australia has one of the lowest savings ratios in the industrialised world. There is a good reason for that. There is a complete disincentive for people to save. People want to save, and they have two options. They can put their money into a home which protects their savings. It is what I referred to in a previous speech some time ago as the `gold mentality', which has been introduced into this economy by this Government. Honourable senators will be aware that when things get tough in the Third World countries-the very area that this Bill covers-people tend to invest in gold because it protects their savings and can be easily transferred into some other commodity. It may also be a method of escaping from a country that has economic and political difficulties. That is what has happened here. When speaking about-with which no-one agrees, including the Labor back bench-the road back to prosperity, the Treasurer, in his Budget Speech, said:</PARA>
<PARA> This is because the Government moved quickly to institute a unique set of policy arrangements which have created the right conditions for recovery. </PARA>
<PARA>What unique set of policy arrangements? The Government keeps talking about waiting until the structural improvements it has instituted take effect. What structural improvements?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Stone very much. He is quite right. The Treasurer talks about his levers. The only levers he uses are forward and reverse with monetary policy and interest rates. He works on the basis that if we squeeze the interest rates up to great heights this will dampen the economy and improve our balance of payments problems. That is the only unique set of policy arrangements that he has. I have not been able to detect any others. This brings me to the final point of Senator Messner's amendment, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . its abject failure to implement changes in vital areas of the economy such as the labour market, shipping and the waterfront, affecting Australia's ability to pay off its debts, raise living standards and compete on world markets. </PARA>
<PARA>If we are to get back on track in Australia, the key area that must be addressed is our ability to compete on world markets, in respect of both exports and import replacement. From a productivity point of view we have gone nowhere. There has been some slight improvement, but it does not rate when compared with the improvement of our closest neighbours. After all, this is a competitive world. We are in a competitive world today. We cannot avoid it. We cannot duck it. The Government is now going into its seventh year. At this stage it has still not addressed any of the micro-economic problems that confront this country. I see that Senator Cook is nodding. Of the new Ministers, he may be one that is moving in the right direction, but I notice from the newspapers in recent times that he is getting a rough time from his colleagues. I suggest that he keep moving in the direction he has taken in an effort to do the things that must be done if we are to get away from the quite disastrous economic situation in which Australia finds itself simply because of the inaction of the Prime Minister and the majority of his Government, who are more interested in political survival than in the survival of this great nation of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Senator Messner's amendment to the motion for the second reading of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (General Capital Increase) Bill 1988. I refer in particular to the first two paragraphs of Senator Messner's amendment, the first of which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) notes that a thorough analysis of Australia's contribution to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development is long overdue;</PARA>
<PARA>I would personally underline those words from some experience in the past with that organisation. The second paragraph of Senator Messner's amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) further notes that, in future, the Australian Government should take a more active role in the forums of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, to explain this country's growing concerns with the Bank's management and direction, and to convey the message that a more efficient utilisation of the Bank's existing resources must eventuate before further contributions to its capital base will be provided;</PARA>
<PARA>I will speak on those two paragraphs of Senator Messner's amendment before addressing myself to the remainder of it. </PARA>
<PARA> I spent the four years from 1967 to 1970 sitting on the Executive Board of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development in Washington. I had the honour there to represent not only Australia but also the other two members of our constituency, as it was called at that time, namely, New Zealand and South Africa. They were fascinating years because we saw the beginning of what has subsequently been a transformation of that institution. That transformation, while containing many good aspects, has also contained a good many steps in directions which, if not wrong, have at been least questionable. That all began under Mr Robert McNamara, who came to the bank as its President in about March 1968. He began at about that time to work out some of the guilt which he was feeling, not necessarily correctly, about his personal involvement with the United States involvement in the war in Vietnam. That is not a matter about which I think he should have felt any guilt whatsoever, but perhaps there were personal aspects of that matter which weighed on his mind. Certainly the attacks upon him would have led to that. I do not want to criticise Mr McNamara personally; I am simply looking for an explanation for some of his actions while in the bank. Mr McNamara took the bank from being a very proper, fully sound financial institution going about the highly constructive and productive business of assisting developing countries in the world improve the state of their economies and increase their productiveness towards being an assistance agency. It was called a development assistance agency, but the emphasis tended to be more on assistance than development. If we are to find where the bank went wrong in the succeeding 20 years, we have to start back there. But that is history and we are now addressing 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last four or five years in particular the bank, as part of that general stream of change within it, has moved more towards a process of providing money to the developing countries which are its members on less strict conditions and with easier availability. The chief instrument the bank has used for that purpose has been its so-called structural adjustment loans, which basically provide funds to developing country borrowers to ease their balance of payments and debt repayment problems, supposedly conditional upon the setting in place by those countries, in undertakings given to the bank, of so-called structural adjustment programs. The country might undertake, for example, to reform its tariff system, to stop using its exchange rate in various contrived ways, or to get out of a number of enterprises in which its government may be unproductively involved, and the like. Countries may enter into such programs in order to obtain access to structural adjustment loans from the World Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of those programs have been fully successful, but in too many cases we have found that, having taken the money and run with it, the countries involved have not kept up their end of the bargain and have not fulfilled their undertakings with respect to the structural assistance programs. The whole point about structural adjustment loans is that they are fast disbursing loans. The money is paid out quickly, the country receives it and then has a debt, but the bank no longer has much say over further conditions. It may very well be that if this country continues on the rake's progress on which the Hawke Government has embarked it in the past six years it will have to apply in five or 10 years time-if there were no change in that outlook-for structural adjustment programs from the World Bank to make up for the ones which this Government, having talked a great deal about structural adjustment, has not followed through. However, that is a digression. The truth is that there is also today an unfortunate degree of in-fighting between the otherwise highly professional staff of the World Bank and the equally highly professional staff of the International Monetary Fund as to the respective responsibilities of these twin Bretton Woods organisations in Washington, DC. It is time to call a halt to that kind of thing. </PARA>
<PARA> One very worrying aspect of the present state of the World Bank is that there is now a growing volume of arrears in servicing and meeting interest payments on some of its members' debts to it. Fifteen or 20 years ago, when I served on the board of the institution, that was virtually unheard of. Occasionally, one or two countries may have fallen briefly into arrears in meeting their interest payments on loans they had taken from the bank, but only temporarily, in most cases only a few days duration. </PARA>
<PARA> A very important aspect of the World Bank's operations was that it had no bad debts. That is important, although not merely because it is good for institutions not to have bad debts. The World Bank depends for its funds in part on contributions from countries such as Australia or, for that matter, its bigger members such as the United States, Japan, or the Federal Republic of Germany, who do provide capital from time to time, as this Bill provides. However, by far the greater source of the World Bank's funds for its very large volume of lending to developing countries is the world capital market. The World Bank borrows in its own right from those capital markets. It borrows in the United States, Switzerland and the Eurobond markets and anywhere it can find a market big enough to make it worth while borrowing. It has not yet borrowed in Australia; it has too many other competitors here in the shape-until very recently at least-of the Australian Government. But in undertaking those borrowings it is terribly important for the World Bank to be able to say, `This is our financial record; this is our balance sheet; this is our situation'. Once the arrears of interest payments start to show up in that financial record a question mark begins to be raised over the World Bank which was not there before and which does not stand well to it in the rates it can then command in those markets. Why should that be a matter of concern to us in one sense, if the World Bank begins to find some greater difficulties in undertaking borrowings in world markets?</PARA>
<PARA> We should never forget that all the member countries of the World Bank are its guarantors. If ever there were to come the day-I do not for one moment suggest that we are approaching or even getting within sight of that day, but one has to be long-sighted about these things-when the World Bank was unable to meet the repayments of the very large loans it has already borrowed in the international market, the member countries would have to foot the bill. Those member countries include Australia. That is why I take up a few minutes of the time of the Senate just to draw out these particular points. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say, without spending undue time on it, that I agree with one element of the Bill which we are now debating-that is, that the Government has not on this occasion seen fit to take up the whole of its entitlement in new additional share capital in the bank which it would have been able to take up. It is appropriately prudent not to do so-almost unusually prudent, given the record of this Government in financial matters. I would go further to express the hope that the Government will not go further than it has decided to go. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me come to the other aspect of Senator Messner's amendment, which asks us to bear in mind the fact-and I underline those words-that through the bank Australia presumes to assist other economies. In the light of that fact the amendment expresses alarm at the Hawke Government's lack of concern or urgency in addressing Australia's emerging economic crisis, which is evident to all but the out of touch Mr Keating and Mr Hawke. Secondly, it further expresses concern at the collapse in family living standards since 1983 caused by a drop in purchasing power of at least $58 a week for families on average earnings. Thirdly, it urges the Hawke Labor Government to adopt policies to restore incentives to individuals to work and save and create job opportunities for their fellow Australians. Finally, it condemns the Hawke Labor Government for its abject failure to implement change in vital areas of the economy such as the labour market, shipping and the waterfront, affecting Australia's ability to pay off its debts, raise living standards and compete on world markets. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to address my remaining remarks to that aspect of Senator Messner's amendment. I might begin by asking myself the rhetorical question: What, in effect, would be the relevance of those matters to the Bill which we are presently debating in the Parliament? It is a Bill to provide extra capital to the World Bank on the part of one of its members, Australia. I do not think it takes very much thought to see the relevance of the final part of Senator Messner's amendment to that particular matter. How can any country which is itself going broke continue to provide hand-outs in foreign aid? How is that possible? I will tell honourable senators how it is possible. It can only do so by getting itself further into debt. Of course, it is open to us, as big-hearted people in the world, to incur more debts for Australians in order to provide funds for the World Bank or some other foreign aid recipient. But many Australians-and an increasing number of Australians, I would have to say to the Government-are questioning the wisdom of such a course at this time. They are beginning to say two things: first, that charity begins at home in any case; and, secondly, that we should begin to get our own house in order and until we have got our house in order we ought to be a great deal more restrained in the lavishness with which we go around the world providing funds to other countries, or other institutions in this case, at the expense of loading more debt on to our children. </PARA>
<PARA> Towards the end of January and at the beginning of February the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) spent 10 days travelling through four countries: Korea, Thailand, Pakistan and India. I happened to be in Japan when he was in Korea. I am not sure what he did there by way of hand-outs. Perhaps he did nothing. Korea is not a country which really is in need of hand-outs from Australia. Before very long the boot will be on the other foot, perhaps, if things carry on the way they are at the moment. If my memory serves me correctly, when Mr Hawke was in Thailand he handed out $35m to contribute to a bridge across the Mekong. When he was in Pakistan he handed out another $44m for assorted good works. When he was in India he committed one of Australia's agencies to providing another $60m, allegedly in that case in support of some export project. But it still comes on the back of the Australian taxpayer. So I think it is entirely proper for Senator Messner to express alarm at the fact that the Government seems to display so little urgency or concern about the present state in which this country finds itself. </PARA>
<PARA> It is well to remind ourselves that in this financial year we look like living beyond our means to the tune of $14 billion. That is not just my figure, my guess or my guesstimate. That is a figure put down by the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia, Mr Paul Keating, in an interview with Michelle Grattan and published in the Melbourne Age last Monday. The Treasurer now thinks $14 billion will be the balance of payments deficit on the current account this financial year. The Senate does not need reminding that only six months earlier in his own Budget of last August the Treasurer was predicting that that figure would be $9.5 billion and that it would be falling from $12.3 billion of last year. Now it is rising from that figure of $12.3 billion to $14 billion, if indeed it can be contained to that figure. </PARA>
<PARA> People get impatient, quite rightly, with economists for all the jargon that they go on with-I find myself guilty of it from time to time, I must confess-when they talk about the balance of payments, the current account, the foreign debt and those things. But it is much easier to think about the situation of a family. When a family is living beyond its means there are only two ways it can do so. We all know this from our experience or the experience of friends or relatives. If a family is spending more than the income coming into the household will allow them to spend, there are only two ways they can do that. One is by getting into debt-getting a loan from the bank, a finance company, or perhaps a loan shark in the end. The other way in which they can finance living beyond their means is to sell something. If they happen to have a second car, they can sell it. If they get really desperate, they can sell their only car. Or they can sell off a paddock, if they happen to have one, or the wife's jewellery, if she happens to have any. If one is in a family situation, one can live beyond one's means only by borrowing, by getting into debt, or by selling things. It is exactly the same for a nation. Australia has been both borrowing and selling things now hand over fist under the present Government for almost precisely six years. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that, when this Government came into office in early 1983, our net debt to foreigners-that is to say, our debts to foreigners less those debts which foreigners owed to us, including to our Reserve Bank-were less than $20 billion. Figures published only yesterday showed that at the end of December last year our net debt to foreigners had reached $95.4 billion; $95,402m, to be precise, according to the Australian Statistician. It had taken this country 195 years to accumulate net debts of less than $20 billion, from the time when Captain Phillip stepped ashore to 1983. But in the last six years we have accumulated further net debts of $75 billion. Under those circumstances, the message of Senator Messner's amendment, namely, that we cannot go on providing foreign aid in the way we are doing while at the same time going broke, is entirely apposite. </PARA>
<PARA> I said when I drew out the analogy about the family that there were two ways of financing a process of living beyond one's means. One of them is by borrowing. We have done that to the nth degree, as the figures I have just quoted would illustrate. The other way is by selling things, and under this Government's policies a lot of that has been going on, because it has had to. The Government itself has not been selling things. Perhaps it should have been more anxious to sell things. If we had a privatisation program, we might have seen some results. That is the program, you will recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, on which just after the last election the Prime Minister told us he was going to embark. He was taken away into a corner and spoken to kindly-or not so kindly-by members of his Party in the course of the next eight or nine months. Then when the Australian Labor Party foregathered for its biennial conference in Hobart in June of last year the whole privatisation program which the Prime Minister had raised was quietly tucked away, and we have heard no more of it since. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians have certainly been selling lots of things. Fortuitously, the annual report for 1987-88 of the Foreign Investment Review Board was published yesterday. That is a document which contains a certain amount of information about the process of selling off Australia which is now going on apace under the policies of this government and which is quite rightly creating a degree of concern in the community. When people see particularly major assets of this country falling into the hands of foreigners, they wonder what the future of this country is about and the future of their children. The first thing Australians have to understand about that is that one major reason why it is happening-not the only reason-is that when one lives beyond one's means, as this country is doing to the tune of $14 billion this year, according to the Treasurer, one has to either borrow or sell things, or both, which is what we are doing, in order to pay for it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Foreign Investment Review Board's annual report 1987-88, published yesterday, has a great deal of information on that subject. A table on page 19 of the report, which is entitled `The Level of Foreign Investment in Australia by Type of Investment', brings out the record of the Hawke Government in this area. Complete figures for 1987-88 are not yet available and will not be for some time until the Statistician completes his survey. Comparisons are provided in two fields from 30 June 1983-just after this Government came into office-to 30 June 1987. The first is the area of corporate equities, or share capital of companies. At 30 June 1983 foreign ownership of Australian corporate equities amounted to $27.1 billion. Four years later, at 30 June 1987, that figure had risen to $57.2 billion. Leaving aside some valuation effects because of the boom occurring on the stock exchange in June 1987, the fact is that there is a very large increase. In some ways, the more interesting figure is in the so-called `other' item, which includes all sorts of direct investment in factories, hotels and those sorts of things. In June 1983 total foreign ownership of that kind in Australia was valued at just over $16 billion, whereas by June 1987, only four years later, it had risen to $42.1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> One should bear in mind that those figures for June 1987 are now nearly 20 months out of date and, as we all know, the pace of the growth of foreign ownership in Australia has stepped up considerably during that time to the point where it is becoming a matter of quite widespread public concern. Some of that public concern is misplaced, but in a general sense the public is correct to be concerned that under the policies of this Government we are selling off the country in order to go on living beyond our means because the Government will not take the action, or put into place policies, or even acknowledge the concern, which would be required to stop that happening. We therefore have a situation in which we are going broke. We are going further and further into debt, as those figures which I have quoted underline. We are selling off more and more of Australia, yet we continue to feel that nothing is wrong and that we can continue to provide funds of the kind provided in the Bill before us for this particular international financial agency. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Government doing about this? My time will not allow me to address that subject adequately, but in Canberra this very day we have an indication of the kind of thing this Government thinks should be done about our present malaise. It has called a housing summit. Can we believe that? What a joke! The Premier of my State of Queensland, Mr Mike Ahern, early in January, if I recall correctly, floated the idea of a housing summit between the Commonwealth and the States to talk about the matter with some degree of seriousness. At the time, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer dismissed the idea as nonsense. I think they actually used that word. If they did not, they used some other perhaps more colourful word of the kind which Mr Keating, in particular, is so prone to use. </PARA>
<PARA> When the December quarter consumer price index figures were published on 31 January and the Treasurer, ashen-faced, had to contend with the clamour that arose out of those appalling figures, which showed that our inflation, far from coming down, was actually accelerating, he quickly got on the telephone to the Prime Minister in Karachi, or wherever he was at the time, and agreed that the thing to do was to call a housing summit, which is going on elsewhere in this building today. What do we find is on the agenda? What is the Government putting on the agenda of this housing summit, this major meeting which has brought together the Premiers of all six States, our Prime Minister, our Treasurer and goodness knows how many bureaucrats? There are two things that the Government has put on the agenda. First of all, it is going to sell off some previously unused land. I welcome that. The only question is: why has the Government not done it before? Why has it been the result of the December quarter consumer price index which has suddenly produced this flurry of activity on the part of the Government to sell off this previously unused land? Secondly, the Government is going to talk about local authority restrictions, in the form of various building regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, I think that that is a perfectly proper subject for debate in the housing area, but is it really suggested that we need to have a meeting at prime ministerial level with all the Premiers to talk about that? It is nonsense. Of course, what the Government will not want to talk about is the level of interest rates which its policies have produced and which are killing mortgage holders in this country and it will not talk about the fact that its capital gains tax, which provides an exemption for the principal private residence, is producing a situation where more and more people are pouring more and more capital into the private residence because it is the only refuge they have left to them. </PARA>

Having read the second reading speech of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) and, more importantly, the recent press statements and other documents in this field I do not believe that the Government shares our commitment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Messner's amendment is very worth while because it notes that a thorough analysis of Australia's contribution to the World Bank is long overdue. It is clear in the Minister's second reading speech that we recognise that the bank has to adopt economic criteria that take a macro-economic view, that indeed there should not be lending to countries for long term structural adjustment purposes in the absence of a suitable framework of macro-economic policies for individual countries. I think that that is a commendable approach. It was one that commended itself to the United States Government, and certainly the current President of the World Bank, Mr Barber Conable, has frequently reiterated that that is a very important component of any aid program. I think that we are increasingly seeing that recognition by the bank and its staff. I think that that is desirable and hopefully the impact will flow through to the bank and its officials. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am concerned about principally today is that on the one hand we have a recognition in this country that things are deteriorating in the Third World, that there are significant economic as well as humanitarian benefits to Australia that can be derived from maintaining and increasing an official development assistance program that does include significant grants to international financial institutions, and yet on the other hand we have a mishmash of cynical political decisions that result in a downgrading of our contribution to the World Bank at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> It is perhaps significant to start with an article in the Australian Financial Review of 23 February last. The article described the visit of Mr Barber Conable to Australia and his specific criticism of Australia for its attitude to the Third World. Mr Conable stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is your neighbourhood, where development is a matter of both opportunity and security for Australia now and into the future. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . referred specifically to Australia's refusal so far to take up its full share of the World Bank's third general capital increase, and overall reductions in the level of Australia's foreign aid under the Hawke Government.</PARA>
<PARA>The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> `I am confident Australia will take up the general capital increase in full,' he said. </PARA>
<PARA> `But if it does not, then Australia will to a modest degree lost a percentage of its (voting) weight in the bank.'</PARA>
<PARA>The article pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has made an initial payment of $3.6 million to the bank's general capital increase . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The current Bill would see an increase of almost $36m in our allocation. That would be a paid up contribution equivalent to about 3 per cent of the total of something of the order of $950m which would need to be available on a standby basis if the bank were ever to get into the sorts of difficulties that Senator Stone was talking about. What concerns me most of all is that in this article there are unnamed sources which indicate:</PARA>
<PARA> One of the Australian Government's principal objections to making its full contribution to the general capital increase involves the World Bank's environmental record, and mounting criticism among member countries that macro-economic reforms in poor countries are undertaken by the bank with little regard for environmental impact. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a disgraceful furphy. The fact of the matter is that the Australian Government has never made public criticisms of the World Bank for its environmental performance in recent times. I think that there is general understanding that the bank has not been as sensitive as it might have been in the past. There are a number of examples that one could give of areas where World Bank projects have gone ahead without concern for the environmental consequences. One could give instances of transmigration in Indonesia, the Narmada Valley Dam in India and the Electric Power Sector II loan in Brazil. There are a number of other examples where one could say quite accurately that the World Bank needed to get its act together, but the fact is that it is in the process of doing just that. It has increased its environmental staff some tenfold in the last few years. In 1987 it established a separate environmental department at its world headquarters and it created a further four environmental departments in major regional lending areas. </PARA>
<PARA> It follows that the bank has been susceptible to the criticism that has been made and it has adopted more stringent environmental criteria. This means that the snide suggestion in that article that somehow Australia is withholding funds because of environmental concerns is false and inaccurate and a disguise of the true economic reasons, which I will come to. No one has been game to stand up and say that in public; yet it is put forward in this backhand way as somehow an indication that we would really like to be on board, but there are some problems that we would like to see addressed first of all. They do not get a run in the Minister's second reading speech and, again, I think that is significant. The second reading speech states:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia is a strong, but not uncritical, supporter of the IBRD. We are concerned that the Bank maintains the high quality of its lending and continues to be cost effective. Australia has criticised the Bank when appropriate with the aim of improving its overall efficiency. In particular, Australia has expressed concerns about the very fast rate of growth of large scale fast disbursing structural adjustment loans, the growing incidence of arrears on Bank loans and the need to further enhance the Bank's work on environmental matters. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the only mention of environmental matters, and it comes a long way down the list. So the real concerns put forward are supposedly economic, supposedly the sorts of concerns that should have influenced many of the private sector banks before they embarked on those massive and ill-fated lending programs to the Third World and, in particular, to Latin America. But the fact is that Australia is putting forward at this time reasons which are simply not true. The environmental reason is a furphy and the concern about the World Bank's own lending programs I suggest is vastly overstated. The fact of the matter is this: what the Australian Government really has in mind is that in an election year, when it is desperate to cut back in as many areas as possible, it sees this as a cheap and easy option. For about the last 20 years the International Monetary Fund has kept economic indicators of relative performance on gross national product and they have indicated that Australia has provided contributions to the World Bank which have been consistently above what its strict obligations might have been on that relative gross national product (GNP) scale. At the moment it could be said that we should be contributing about 1.3 per cent of the bank's total capital, but in fact we currently provide 1.8 per cent. It is significant that 1.3 per cent is about 75 per cent of 1.8 per cent and that is precisely what we have offered to take up. We were allocated 10,734 shares; in this Bill we have agreed to take up 7,880 additional shares. There is the first very tangible piece of evidence that the real reason for Australia taking up only 75 per cent of its entitlement is that it now sees the opportunity to get back to its strict equivalent obligation after 20 years of letting it remain above the line. One could always argue that perhaps some people have to tighten their belts, but I categorically dispute the proposition that this Government is justified in undertaking that exercise at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that the Government has embarked on massive cuts in official development assistance in recent years. When the Fraser Government left office the percentage of gross domestic product was in excess of 0.5 per cent. It was, in fact, around 0.55 per cent. The Australian contribution now languishes around 0.35 per cent, which is barely the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee average. That in itself is deplorable. It has come about again because the Government has taken the view, quite cynically, that it could afford to make these massive cuts, that it could get away with them with minimal political pain in the electorate. The Government is aided and abetted by a disgraceful attitude on the part of the former Foreign Minister, who effectively volunteered cuts in Australia's official development assistance (ODA) contributions. I think it is fair to say that Australia now has, for the first time in six years, a Foreign Minister who at least has some sympathy and understanding for the aid community and the causes which it espouses; but, for all his bravado, braggadocio and bombast, he is still strangely lacking in courage when it comes to fighting for these constituents. I will soon come to a very significant speech of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) which I think blows that concern out of the water and exposes the Government's entirely parsimonious and niggardly attitude for what it is really worth. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have is a Government that now sees this as an opportune time to significantly reduce its contributions as a means of perhaps making a small gesture to the balance of payments deficit on current account which Senator Stone talked about earlier. It is simply in desperate financial difficulties. The credibility of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is in tatters. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is acutely aware that his own constituency will not allow any significant privatisation, any significant asset sales, any significant reduction in expenditure in the April statement. As a result, the Government is very keen to cut costs wherever possible. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of deep regret that there is an obvious conflict of interest in the position of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. He has been mouthing such soothing noises as:</PARA>
<PARA> I very much wish the overall aid budget was higher and I will push for that . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He said that shortly after taking office, in an interview published in the Melbourne Age on 9 September 1988. However, he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . although `as a member of the expenditure review committee, I'm acutely conscious of the need to reduce government spending.'</PARA>
<PARA>That is an outrage. One should not have the same Minister urging increases on the one hand and urging reductions on the other. It is an appalling situation. It calls for the Minister to stand aside from the Expenditure Review Committee when aid matters are under consideration. It certainly requires him to adopt a dramatically different attitude to that of his predecessor, who was prepared to sacrifice the interests of Australia's international reputation and its overseas development assistance budget, who had taken the view that, by and large, aid was a waste of time, that most of the infrastructure projects that Australia had undertaken were simply not performing, and who threw in the towel. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think Senator Evans is at that stage. Unfortunately, on the one hand he would like to be more generous; on the other he knows that he will be chopped off at the knees if he does anything courageous. As a result, he is not going to achieve the sorts of increases that his wish list suggests or that he has been talking about to various groups in recent months. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government is now prepared to agree to an increase of some $36m in our contribution. But the Minister's speech says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has not decided whether Australia will subscribe to its remaining entitlement of 2,854 GCI shares or relinquish them for allocation to other members of the Bank. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, no policy decision has been taken or, if it has, it has not been officially announced. There is no reason why Australia should not agree to take up its additional entitlement. I agree entirely with what Senator Messner and others have had to say about taking a more active role in the forums of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other financial institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not subscribe to the view that aid should be given without strings, but I take the view that we are entitled to see where our money goes, to ensure that we get value and that policies are not put into place as a result of those loans which are antipathetic to the economic environment that we believe will be most conducive to growth. I think there are obligations that attach to our contributions at the present time. Increased obligations should attach to increased contributions. I regard it as regrettable in the extreme that the Government seems to be obsessed with the short term financial situation in which it finds itself and is prepared to take this cheap and cynical way out with no regard at all for those in the developing countries whose needs are infinitely greater than ours. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not subscribe to the nostrum that charity begins at home because implicitly it means that charity ends at home. I think it is a dishonest attitude. It is simply an excuse for putting a circle around our part of the world and ignoring the plight of others. I do not believe we should ever reach that situation. The Fraser Government had a very proud and enviable track record. Under this Government foreign aid has become a man made disaster of massive proportions. It is an absolute disgrace. There is absolutely no justification for the sorts of cuts that we have seen in recent years. The reduction of something like 12 per cent in 1987 was simply not warranted by the economic circumstances of the time any more than it might have been warranted throughout the entire period the Hawke Government has been in office. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet the Government has taken the view that it can make these arbitrary and selective cuts because somehow the electorate is more obsessed with its own concerns. That does not do Australia's reputation much good. It ignores the fact that 90 per cent of our bilateral assistance is provided in the form of Australian goods and services and that there are very significant economic and commercial benefits that derive from an enlightened official development assistance program. It gives us a great deal of influence that quite often will assist in opening trade doors around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> One only has to look at the Japanese approach. The Japanese are certainly not motivated by altruism and yet their percentage of ODA has risen in recent years quite significantly. It is now about 0.31 per cent. I can recall when it was about 0.15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the 18 member countries of the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD seven have actually increased their percentages of aid since 1982, whilst Australia's ODA has fallen from 0.55 to 0.35 per cent. No other country has seen effectively a 40 per cent reduction as we have in Australia. In other words, Australia is now a world leader in cutting back on its foreign assistance. This further reduction in our obligations to the World Bank does not derive from any professed or synthetic concern about the World Bank getting its house in order; it derives entirely from the Government's belief that it can get away with cuts in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I now come to what I regard as a very sad commentary on the sorts of motivations and inspirations that seem to drive the newly appointed Foreign Minister. I am prepared to concede that Senator Evans has had a longstanding interest in foreign affairs and I regard him as someone who has a degree of sympathy in the area and who is attuned to the needs of Third World countries. Unfortunately, because of the pressures of the office and, no doubt, colleagues such as the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) he has entirely succumbed to the `cuts mentality'. Senator Evans gave a speech to the Ideas Centre in Sydney on 17 November 1988 which is very significant because in it he purported to set out some of the problems that beset the Third World, and then looked at Australia's situation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the sustained boom in the US . . . has brought very few benefits to developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Quoting from the report World Nutrition Situation issued by the United Nations in November 1987, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . since the early 80s widespread economic recession and droughts in Africa have reversed this trend. </PARA>
<PARA>He was referring there to global improvements in nutrition. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the situation has worsened in many countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Quoting from the World Development Report 1988, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Poverty in the developing countries is on the rise. Between 1970 and 1980 the number of people with inadequate diets in developing countries . . . increased from 650 million to 730 million. Since 1980 matters have turned from bad to worse. </PARA>
<PARA>Having adopted those comments, Senator Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA> According to estimates from the International Labour Organisation, the number of people living in extreme poverty in developing countries increased from 819 million in 1980 to 881 million in 1985. </PARA>
<PARA>So he is acknowledging the enormity of the problem in the Third World. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . developing countries have been plunged into a debt crisis that is still very much with us. </PARA>
<PARA> The third aspect of the boom to note-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, in the United States-</PARA>
<PARA>is that it is hard to believe that it can last. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . the American dollar will slide, and world interest rates will tend to rise. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the likelihood is that all of this will be bad news for developing countries. Developing countries will probably lose in two ways: world commodity prices are likely to fall . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I acknowledge that that is not very good news for Australia either because it has been the basis on which the Treasurer's whole Budget strategy has been framed in recent years. It has been the soft option that we have consistently taken to justify not taking the hard cuts in expenditure. Senator Evans went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . world commodity prices are likely to fall, and interest rates are likely to again rise. These trends will make worse their debt burdens . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to the debt burdens of Third World countries. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is hard to see how world economic trends during the next three or four years are likely to help developing countries at all. </PARA>
<PARA>So there is an explicit acknowledgment and concession that the plight of the Third World is deteriorating rapidly and there is no prospect of improvement. I simply ask in passing: Does the Minister consider that Australia's position will deteriorate or not improve over the next three or four years? If he does, that is a concession of defeat which I welcome because it means that any economic credibility that attached to this Government is now out the window. So I presume that this Government does not take that view. In fact, it argues that our economic position will improve. So, vis-a-vis the Third World, we have a much increased capacity to contribute. So there it is. On the one hand, we have an increasing need in the Third World and, on the other hand, we have an increasing capacity to pay. We all love user pays, so we can afford to do something about that; that is what Senator Evans is saying. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Closer to home, in Papua New Guinea and the South Pacific, growth is needed as well. Indeed, in many countries close to Australia income per head has actually been falling in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA>So there we have it. There is the need and there is Australia's capacity to pay. What do we find when Senator Evans defines Australia's aid objectives? This is very enlightening:</PARA>
<PARA> First and foremost, Australia's aid effort is founded on the commitment of the Australian population to basic humanitarian concerns . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is perfectly acceptable and admirable. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Within that humanitarian framework it should come as no surprise for me to say that the primary objective of Australian aid is to promote growth and economic development in developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA>I am surprised because in Budget Paper No. 4 the Minister had this to say in the foreword:</PARA>
<PARA> The principal objective of the Australian aid program is to promote the economic and social advancement of the peoples of developing countries . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, since Senator Evans has taken over this portfolio, social concern is no longer a matter that is regarded as an objective of the aid program. It is simply about economics. He went on to say in his address:</PARA>
<PARA> While the development objective is the most important, it is by no means the only goal of our aid program. Another is to advance or reinforce Australian political and strategic objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>Pretty naked stuff! We do not find that in Budget Paper No. 4. I have never seen it in Ministers' statements in the past. I always recall Andrew Peacock being very sensitive at suggestions that aid was an instrument of foreign policy, yet that is a much more respectable view than simply putting as the second object of our aid program `to advance or reinforce Australia's political and strategic objectives'. In other words, is there a vote in it? Senator Evans went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> A third main objective is commercial. </PARA>

I would have thought that Australia's political objectives were to enhance its standing and reputation and, hopefully, to pass that on to the Australian community to be reflected in increased votes. Perhaps we can discuss what Australia's political objectives are a little later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact remains that, on reading Senator Evans's very important address on aid, it is quite clear that he is obsessed only with economic and political objectives. Perhaps the most disappointing thing of all is that Senator Evans says, `I have only just come into the job but I think I will give you a bit of a run down on the way I see things and the way in which I think our aid program should proceed'. Having made the right genuflection in the direction of non-government organisations and quite properly acknowledging that they are a very cost efficient means of providing assistance, he says, `Here is my forward agenda. It is a little premature but I just thought I would give you a sketch of the main priorities. First, I would like to see a steady increase in the volume of aid, both in dollar terms and as a proportion of GNP. I am concerned that we are slipping back, both in absolute terms and relative to other major aid donors, and I would certainly like to see a significant movement in the aid ratio back towards at least 0.4 per cent within the next few Budgets'. What outrageous and sanctimonious nonsense because he then went on to say in his address that it was all going to be too difficult. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Just to maintain aid at 0.36% of GNP would, on present estimates, require the allocation of another $39 million, and to increase the proportion to 0.37% will require another $72 million. So it is going to be hard to even maintain the present ratio, let alone get any major improvement in it, but I am hopeful that we will be able to at least start moving in this direction. </PARA>
<PARA>There is not even a commitment to maintain aid as a proportion of gross national product when the Government has slashed that percentage from 0.55 per cent to 0.36 per cent in the space of six years. There is not even a commitment to maintain that disastrously low level. There is the sort of real commitment that the Minister gives. He starts off by saying, `We need a steady increase. I would like to see it go up', but, as we know, he is a member of the Expenditure Review Committee and he will be allowed to do nothing of the sort. So there it is; an absolutely worthless commitment. He also said in his address:</PARA>
<PARA> My second priority is to encourage other developed nations to expand their aid programs as well. </PARA>
<PARA>He is saying, `We will not do much about it but we will go around the world lecturing others to boost their commitments', when, as I have indicated, seven of the 18 countries have already increased their percentage over that period and Australia has reduced its proportion by 40 per cent. What we have are sanctimonious double standards and unctuous rubbish. What that means is that we will spend our time jawboning rather than contributing. Senator Evans continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia should, as a matter of policy, work to combat so-called `aid-fatigue'. </PARA>
<PARA> That is another pathetic cop-out. The community in Australia presently contributes about $60m a year to non-government organisations. That sum has not fallen in recent years despite the disgraceful cutbacks in official development assistance. It is quite clear that there is still a high level of concern. More than one million Australian citizens belong to something approaching 100 organisations interested in the field of voluntary aid, yet this Government talks about aid fatigue. The only aid fatigue is on the part of this Government which sees it as a cheap and cynical opportunity to get out of its obligations, to cut back or to reduce its Budget deficit. I regard that as a deplorable situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans's third major objective is to promote `an open world trading environment'. Wonderful stuff! Mr Dawkins got off to a good start with the Cairns Group and Mr Duffy is pursuing it. Let them do their thing. That is important, but it has very little to do with any justification for Australia continuing to reduce its official aid program. It certainly has nothing to do with providing any justification for the continued refusal to increase our contribution to the World Bank. I, therefore, regard this Bill as a very regrettable indictment of the Australian Government's attitude to the Third World and to international financial institutions and as a concession to moral and intellectual bankruptcy. It is quite clear that this Government does not even recognise the very tangible and substantial benefits to which the Minister's second reading speech pays lip service. It waxes eloquent about the substantial benefits from aid, including political benefits dependent on developmental effectiveness, and on the commercial benefits that derive. Let me give one small example in passing of the Government's deplorably cynical approach. In Budget Paper No. 4 refugees are singled out as a very important area of concern. Twenty million dollars is set aside to assist Afghan refugees. Not 1c of that money has been paid and not 1c will be paid in this financial year because of the state of flux in Afghanistan. So the linchpin of its refugee assistance is on hold, which is typical. It is saving $20m in that field alone, yet the Government is not prepared to make the sort of increases that Barber Conable has urged, that the rest of the international community recognises as essential, and it is not even prepared to give the Australian community the real reasons for our disgraceful backdown. </PARA>

In the first part of this amendment Senator Messner has referred to the alarm which he and many other senators have at this Government's lack of concern or urgency in addressing Australia's emerging economic crisis. I do not think that anyone can doubt that at the present moment this nation is facing an economic crisis of dramatic proportions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I seem to recall when I was in this chamber in 1981-82 some of the speeches of Senator Walsh in his vitriolic attacks on the then Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, and the economic record of the Fraser Government during 1981-82. I look back today at some of those speeches, and it is very interesting to see why Senator Walsh is now looking so tired, worn and exhausted as he wanders around this place. For example, on 9 March 1982 he referred to the claim by Mr Fraser that external influences were responsible for failures. He claimed that that was not so. </PARA>
<PARA> He went on to talk about unemployment at almost record levels, inflation back in double figures, growth down, record interest rates, record levels of taxation and a balance of payments crisis. What is the situation at the moment? Unemployment is at record levels. Let me tell the Senate that average monthly unemployment under the Fraser Government was 403,000. Under the Hawke Government it is 627,000, which is an increase of almost 50 per cent. Yet back in 1982 Senator Walsh was talking about unemployment at almost record levels and being critical of this. I might mention the disgraceful monthly youth unemployment levels now running at 130,000 under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I look at other speeches of Senator Walsh in those years. He talked about interest rates in a speech made on 1 April 1981. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I refer now to interest rates. It has recently become apparent from a wide variety of sources that the prevailing interest rate for overdrafts above $100,000 is 16.5 per cent. This is without precedent. </PARA>
<PARA>It might have been without precedent in 1981; it is certainly very common in 1989. It is far in excess of that. Senator Walsh, in a speech made on 29 April 1981, talked about foreign investment. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>What is being questioned in this debate is the rate at which foreign capital is coming into this country and also the type of foreign capital which is coming into the country. </PARA>
<PARA>I refer the Senate to the type of capital and the rate at which capital is coming into this country at present. What has happened to the economy is that this Labor Government has in fact mortgaged this country to the hilt. We are now in debt to the tune of $120 billion and we are going down the drain at the rate of $50m a day. Having mortgaged our future, this Government is now adopting a policy of selling off this country's assets in order to attempt, in some way or other, to overcome the massive debt which increases every day. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason Senator Walsh is looking so tired is that he clearly recognises that he has failed. He has been the Minister for Finance in this Government for six years. He has been talking for six years about micro-economic reform and macro-economic changes in order to turn the economy around. Instead of managing to turn the economy around, what has happened under the administration of his Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, his Treasurer, Mr Keating, and himself is that the economy has taken a massive downturn. Senator Walsh cannot blame outside forces because the truth is that commodity prices overall have never been at a higher rate. In fact, this is the only thing which is stopping this country from falling into a massive abyss. The prices we are obtaining for our wool, wheat and exported primary produce are now at record levels. Our revenue from the tourism industry is at a world high. It is that revenue which is stopping us from falling into the abyss of a depression, the like of which has not been seen since the 1930s. That is why there is massive fear among economists and those who have applied their minds to these problems as to what will happen to this country if there is any fall in world commodity prices. Of course, as the United States of America addresses its economic problems, the possibility of there being a fall in world commodity prices should cause us to be fearful of our position in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that Senator Walsh now realises after six years as Minister for Finance, after six years of beating his head against the brick wall of the Australian Labor Party-preventing micro-economic reform, failing to fix up the problems of transport, the waterfront, shipping, Telecom or the government business enterprises and notwithstanding the rhetoric of the last May statement-that his contribution to economic recovery has been no more than if he had stayed at home in Western Australia and grown wheat. In fact, if he had managed to grow more wheat in Western Australia for export, that would have probably been of greater value to Australia's economy than his efforts have been as Minister for Finance. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to see that I have perhaps persuaded Senator Walsh to come into the chamber to hear me say that he would have been better staying home in Western Australia growing wheat for the last six years than to have beaten his head against the brick wall of the Labor Party in relation to the micro-economic changes which still need to be made after six years of this Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Interest rates in this country are at higher levels now than in 1981-82. In addition, the prices of homes have risen such that, on my calculations, a median priced existing home now costs about $111,000 and home loan repayments as a percentage of income have increased by 30.7 per cent. Looking at the cost of an ordinary basket of goods, one sees why the women's vote has turned against the Labor Party. Women know what it costs them when they go shopping. On my calculations, since March 1983 the cost of an absolute minimum basic food basket has risen by about 44 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since this Government took office in March 1983 it has risen by 44 per cent. In the meantime, our overseas debt has increased at the rate of $50m a day. For some reason or other some commentators seem to have fallen for Mr Keating's line that he has a clever policy of devaluing the dollar. I think one journalist talked about walking the dollar down. No country which is successful in its economic activities has a declining dollar. Under the Hawke Government the value of the Australian dollar has fallen by 55 per cent against the Japanese yen, 30 per cent against the deutschmark, 22 per cent against the United Kingdom pound, and 28 per cent against the trade weighted index. Devaluing the dollar is not a solution to our economic problems. It may assist some of our exporters but it increases our overseas debt and our difficulties in meeting interest payments on that overseas debt.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And, as my colleague Senator Messner says, it raises inflation substantially. It is no solution. If it were a solution to the economic problems of a country, Venezuela would be a substantial economic success. Instead, it is reported today that there has been a 60 per cent rise in the cost of certain goods, including basic items such as petrol, and rioting in the streets as the result of a recent 40 per cent devaluation of its currency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clearly, that is no solution to our problem. On the contrary, what we need is a steadily rising dollar value-not brought about by high interest rates, which is the Government's other policy, but by very substantial economic reform, including micro-economic reform. As Senator Walsh knows, in many respects macro-economic reform-trying to look at interest rates, inflation, the big figures-is like squeezing a balloon. If the balloon is squeezed too tight in one direction it expands in another direction. What is needed is to get down to the basics. The Government has deregulated the financial market and we have congratulated it on that. However, it desperately needs to deregulate the labour market, not so that wages can fall-we are not talking about lowering people's wages-but so we can create fluidity in the labour market. Thus people can move from one job to another in order to obtain better wages in areas in which we need increased productivity and get out of those jobs which are not economically worthwhile. The Government needs to apply its mind to those areas and also to that of privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge, on the credit side, that under this Government there has been, as Mr Keating claims, an increase in the number of jobs. I think he claims 1.2 million jobs. I give the Government credit for that, but I wonder what the reasons are for that increase. I suggest that in many ways it goes back to the breaking of the drought shortly after the Hawke Government came to office in 1983 and the wage pause of the Fraser Government during its last year of office. It is certainly related to the very substantial increase in the number of immigrants and refugees this country takes. The annual intake has doubled. Under the Hawke Government there has been a substantial population increase and that has been a major reason for the increase in the number of jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> The real truth is that the Government has hocked this nation for an additional $75 billion. That is the real cost of those 1.2 million jobs. As I said before, this Government has mortgaged our assets to finance its policies and it is now selling off those assets to foreign investors as we are unable to keep meeting the insurance commitments. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thoroughly agree with Senator Messner. What happened-much to the horror of Senator Walsh-is that this Government went down the soft option route. It will continue to do so because of its relationship with the trade union movement. How can it face up to the trade union movement when it is locked into an accord as a result of which wages will rise in all industries across the nation, regardless of their productivity and profitability and the state of the economy? Wages will rise across the board. I am not opposed to wage rises where a company is profitable and increases in productivity are needed. Under this Government's very tight taxation policies-they are such that people now pay 40c in the dollar on any income they earn above the average weekly wage-there is no encouragement for people to endeavour to work a little harder to earn money in overtime. This nation's living standards have fallen dramatically.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Within the past 10 days the value of the Australian dollar has fallen by about 10 or 12 per cent. Senator Walsh, who is here, has the accurate figures. He is the Minister for Finance, not me, so he will no doubt tell the Senate what the dollar has fallen to; but it has fallen by about 10 per cent. That means that the assets of all Australians have been devalued by 10 per cent. It also means that our overseas debt has increased by about that figure and that our difficulty in meeting the interest payments on it has increased by about 10 per cent. Senator Walsh may enter into some argument as to detail and say that I have not got it quite right, but the truth is that the dollar falling in that way has created great difficulties for us in meeting our payments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government still talks about the dollar falling. I do not want to speculate on that, but while we continue to have an overseas trade deficit of about $50m a day, of course the dollar will fall. What we are doing is maintaining our living standards by borrowing money. We all know that if one wants to live on an annual income of, say, $40,000 a year and is earning only $25,000 a year, one can live at the standard of $40,000 by borrowing $15,000 a year. One can do that so long as one's assets keep allowing one to borrow the additional $15,000 a year. But sooner or later one will run out of an equity which will enable one to continue to borrow that additional money to live the way one wishes to live. When that happens there is disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> This country faces a massive foreign debt. Commodity prices, although high at the moment, have little chance of substantially increasing. Tourism is booming and bringing in substantial income, but there is no chance of seeing an economic turnaround for four or five years at the earliest, if it is possible. As I have said, under this Government the country is being mortgaged to the hilt. The Government is not taking the urgent measures which are desperately needed to rectify the problems. Until it does, we will continue to attack the Government and to expose its bluff and rhetoric. </PARA>

<PARA>As I pointed out during the second reading debate, the amendments are directed towards an annual report. We believe there is a chronic lack of regular and detailed information about Australia's participation in the World Bank. I was interested to note that Senator Watson detailed that objection during his contribution to the second reading debate. The problems we have are a lack of information and particularly, as I said in the second reading debate, our desire to know precisely where the development philosophy of the World Bank is going. Basically we are looking at: what goals is Australia pursuing through the World Bank; how effective is participation in the bank as a means of getting our development assistance goals, the ones promoted by the Australian Government; to what extent do our own bilateral aid projects through the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) link up with World Bank projects through co-financing mechanisms; to what extent do we promote opportunities for Australians to act as consultants for the World Bank and encourage Australian companies to tender for World Bank projects; how well is the bank carrying out the development tasks that the Australian community believes it should carry out; what sort of contributions do Australian representatives make towards the development of the bank's policy; and so on?</PARA>
<PARA> All of these items of information, we believe, ought to be able to be made available to the Australian public through an annual report. At the moment we have some reporting mechanisms. As I said in my earlier speech, there is the annual report of the Treasury, there are the associated August Budget Papers on Australia's overall development program, and, of course, there are the annual reports of Australia's dealings in the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). That latter report comes through the annual report which is required under the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947. Unfortunately only very basic information on the structure of the IBRD-which this Bill, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (General Capital Increase) Bill, deals with-and the other affiliates is provided in those reports. They provide information on the Australian membership and on the broad financial developments. The subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, in its current investigation of AIDAB, has taken a particular interest in this and asked Treasury to provide it with considerable detail on the conduct of policy towards the World Bank. It seems to me that it exemplifies the problem that that material has to be requested by a committee of the chambers because it is not readily available. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that what we should be doing is putting together a much more reasonable and substantive exercise. I refer particularly to the two letters that were sent to the World Bank in the last two years-Senator Messner was one of the signatories-directed towards those items which I raised in my second reading debate, that is, the alleviation of poverty, acting to prevent environmental degradation, and ensuring that the World Bank's programs take into account the views and needs of indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that an annual report to parliament, assessing the World Bank's work in these areas, would be of great benefit to those senators and members who signed those letters. If we look at the signatories, particularly to the second letter, we find that they were: Senator Alston, Senator Archer, Senator Aulich, Senator Peter Baume, Senator Michael Baume, Senator Beahan, Senator Chaney, and Senator Hill, who was instrumental in putting those letters together. There were also Australian Labor Party, Australian Democrats and independent members. There was certainly such a depth of interest in an activity quite outside the normal activities that go on in this chamber that a number of members and senators were sufficiently interested to work together and co-sign a letter to the World Bank. Obviously the annual report, set out in the terms I have suggested, would be read and used by members and senators interested in this area. I take the point that Senator Watson made, that this is not something we should go into lightly and that the various topping up exercises that we have undertaken with the World Bank, particularly with the arms of the World Bank, ought to be ones on which this Parliament makes an informed judgment which would need to go beyond Treasury's report or the annual report provided under the International Monetary Agreements Act. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note in this regard the increased activity in the American Congress. Senator Watson referred to this in his speech in the second reading debate. In consultation with the secretaries of Treasury and State, a list of the loans likely to have an adverse effect on the environment, natural resources, public health or indigenous people is required to be compiled, and this list is to be prepared and updated semiannually in consultation with members of the public. That is what the United States Congress has required of its executive. I believe we should do no less, particularly with regard to our standing in this area and our support for the World Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there are excellent reasons why such an annual report which goes more into the development philosophy ought to be presented to parliament. I believe it will not be the type of report that floats through and is not read by members because, as I have already demonstrated by quoting from those two letters sent by so many members of this and the other chamber, there is a depth of interest in this Parliament on these matters. I think the information which is currently provided by the World Bank to various government departments would make the compilation of such a report a relatively easy task. In looking as I have at the information which is provided to the government departments on an unclassified basis, it is fairly obvious that the task of putting that information into an annual report would be relatively easy. I think the enhanced flow of information to members of parliament could make for far more informed debates about what I believe is a very important item of our international responsibilities. </PARA>

Our first concern is that the terms of reference which are set down in the amendment and which the annual report will treat as guidelines when it is prepared may not go far enough. The question which did come up during the debate yesterday was whether the report would cover the question of the viability of various projects that are undertaken in less developed countries. It is not, in other words, a simple question of the World Bank being a world agency for foreign aid; rather it is first and foremost a bank which ought to be controlled and subject to its charter and the normal requirements that any bank would be required to strictly adhere to. As a result the annual report ought to have, in our view, some balance to it so that it treats the question of financial viability equally with the other matters that are of concern to Senator Macklin. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I raise-it is in the form of a question to the Minister-is whether there is any need for this amendment. </PARA>

The initial Bretton Woods agreements were given legislative sanction by this Parliament I believe back in 1947, by the passage of the International Monetary Agreements Act, and there was a requirement in that legislation for an annual report. Perhaps the Minister could advise us whether that is so and whether the guidelines and principles by which that annual report was required to be submitted and drawn up are still in force or whether they have merely atrophied or disappeared into the blue smoke somewhere in the system. Is there legislative authority for this report already set down in the statutes? If so, is there a need for us to have such an amendment as is proposed?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am just answering Senator Messner's question at this stage. Therefore I am speaking only about the third amendment, that is, the amendment concerning the annual report. As I said by way of interjection, the Government does not believe there is any need for this amendment for the following reasons: the Treasurer already reports annually to the Parliament, as required by the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947, on the operations of that Act and the operations of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund during each financial year as they relate to Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This report focuses mainly on our financial relationship with the bank and fund but also contains more general information, for example information on the roles of the two institutions and on Australian procurement and cofinancing with them, and copies of the communique issued after the meetings of governors. In addition, the Treasurer releases copies of his plenary statements at bank and fund meetings and provides further information on the bank through his replies to parliamentary questions. Specific press releases can be made when necessary on particular issues. Having said that, I am advised by the present Treasurer (Mr Keating) that it may be possible to provide somewhat more information in the report to parliament under the International Monetary Agreements Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose it is a matter of judgment as to whether there is any need to go further than that. But even if there is a judgment that it is desirable to go further than that, I do not think it is an appropriate amendment. The first couple of paragraphs are arguably superfluous anyway in view of what I have just said. There is a request for a statement by the Treasurer on the terms and conditions of any agreements, and statements describing the nature and extent of Australia's participation as a member of the bank and its affiliates during the year. I certainly argue that those two paragraphs are superfluous because that is adequately covered under the reporting requirements of the 1947 Act. </PARA>
<PARA> When we move further down the amendment, we see it requires the Treasurer to report on the activities and effectiveness of the bank and its affiliates, including its activities and effectiveness in relation to the alleviation of poverty. It is absurd to expect the Treasurer to report on the effectiveness of the World Bank in the alleviation of poverty. For a start, any assessment of its effect on the alleviation of poverty, let alone the prevention of damage to the environment, would be particularly subjective. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer to the amendment to clause 46 of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1988 which was moved by Senator Haines and passed last night on the votes of the coalition and the Australian Democrats. Does that amendment have the effect of imposing a retrospective tax liability? If so, what is the nature of that liability and in what other policy areas would it be appropriate to impose a retrospective tax liability?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="409" SPEAKER="Walsh Sen The Hon P.A." NAMEID="TJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By way of preamble, it should be noted that the issue of legislating to impose tax liability in a retrospective way is 6 1/2 years old. It is 6 1/2 years since the first such legislation was brought into the Senate. During that time, of course, people have moved into the Senate and others have moved out. But those who have remained through that period on the non-Labor side have had, to say the least, an inconsistent record on voting on retrospective legislation. In 1982 almost all of the coalition voted for Mr Howard's retrospective legislation. All the Australian Democrats who are still in the Senate voted against that same legislation. Last night the coalition and all the Democrats voted for the amendment to section 46.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Put simply, as a result of that amendment to section 46, where, at any time between September 1985 and January 1988, the ownership of a partnership, company assets or shares have been rearranged pursuant to a marriage dissolution-one partner having been effectively bought out or having withdrawn assets from the company or partnership-the remaining shareholders or partners will now be subject to capital gains taxation whenever they sell the business, shares or assets. In other words, because of that amendment-if it is accepted by the Government in the House of Representatives; I do not know what the Treasurer intends to do about it-a retrospective liability will be imposed on completely innocent people who made such arrangements regarding the ownership of a business in that period of about 28 months for reasons which had absolutely nothing to do with an intention to avoid taxation.</PARA>
<PARA> I have been asked by Senator Maguire in what cases there may be justification for application of retrospective liability. I suggest that in that case there was certainly no justification. There are other cases in which in my view there has been a justification. I refer, for example, to the tax evasion or avoidance scheme known as the cherry pickers scheme, the most notorious practitioners of which were two sleazy characters known as the Kelly brothers. For years, they had been paying into a superannuation fund and claiming for those payments deductions from their company's taxable incomes, ostensibly for the benefit of their employees. At the same time they carefully arranged their work force so that no employee ever qualified to receive the benefits from the superannuation fund into which payments were being made, ostensibly for their benefit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Women in Industry: Contraception and Health organisation has received a great deal of support from the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs since 1983. It is actually as a result of that support that the group has been able to do so much good work over the past five years. However, the grant-in-aid program does not give an automatic re-grant right to organisations that have applied successfully in the past. This is because priorities are continually changing. It is important that other organisations providing for new immigrant communities are also catered for. In a competitive environment it is not surprising that some organisations, worthwhile as they may be, do not necessarily receive automatic funding because that is not a requirement of the program, a program which has been successful and able to attract State government funding. I am advised by the Department that if the Women in Industry: Contraception and Health organisation cares to make contact with the Department it may become eligible for a grant through another area of the Department's operations in the future. I would like to stress that grant-in-aid is not an automatic right. The organisation has received a great deal of support over the last five years.

The Commonwealth had been earlier advised of the roading in 1986 in accordance with clause 27 of the memorandum of understanding (MOU) which provides for the continuation of operations in National Estate forests in accordance with forest management plans previously approved by the Tasmanian Forestry Commission taking into account the Commonwealth's view. Six kilometres of roading was identified in the forest management plan for that part of the crown forest in the Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd concession in 1986 and in 1988. On 22 February 1989 the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, approved the re-commencement of the roading.

The Commonwealth at that time made its judgment as to the area that it would nominate on the basis of a range of expert advices including, as honourable senators would know, the Helsham Lemonthyme and Southern Forests Commission of Inquiry. The area within which the roading is taking place to the east of the Picton is not nominated for World Heritage listing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Merits review is not provided for in the Migration Act. In 1982, the then Minister for Immigration, Mr Macphee, introduced voluntary concessionary administrative review-the immigration review panel. In 1987, consistent with the Government's administrative responsibility and fiscal restraint, a service fee of $240 was introduced for this concessionary administrative review. Honourable senators will know that I am very much committed to reforming this immigration review system. Honourable senators will also recall that, during the Senate debate on the Migration Amendment Bill 1987, a clause intended to provide legislative entitlement for the reconsideration of certain decisions and a mechanism for the collection of fees for this service were deleted from that Bill. It is my understanding that, in opposing the clause, the Opposition did not intend to make invalid the current administratively based appeal mechanism. It is also my understanding that the Opposition supported the continued collection of the administratively based fee for the review of decisions under the Migration Act. This course has had the support of eminent lawyers. At the same time, it has had its critics, including some in the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently, my Department sought further legal advice which adds to doubts about continuing the fee in its current form. More importantly, the Attorney-General wrote to me in December last year indicating that the better view is that the fee should have legislative backing. Upon receiving the Attorney-General's advice I considered whether it would be more appropriate to wait for the enactment of the new legislation or take immediate action by way of regulation. A strong impetus for immediate action was prompted by a report from the Ombudsman which unequivocally suggests that the fee should have a legislative base.</PARA>
<PARA> In the light of the uncertainty created by differing legal views, I am disposed to do away with the current administratively based review of migration decisions and replace it with a concept of second application. Such a second application scheme would be based on the regulation making power contained in section 67 of the Migration Act 1958. The current immigration review panel could and will be retained to advise on the consideration of second applications made under this scheme. The review opportunities currently existing would, in the main, be able to be accommodated in the second application regime. I propose to set the level of fee pay- able in respect of a second application at $240. As an interim measure, the second application regime would provide legislative support for a fee in respect of an examination of a person's claims by an independent outside body which would then make recommendations to the relevant decision maker. The introduction in this session of legislation flowing from the Government's response to the Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies, CAAIP, will enable the Parliament to decide whether it wants to provide for review of decisions made under the Migration Act. With the benefit of hindsight and in the light of the totality of advice, I can see the argument that the better view is that charging the fee should be given a legislative base. However, continuing to collect the fee, in my view, has not been unreasonable.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have tried to make it extremely clear-I know it does not suit the political agenda of the Opposition-that the National Companies and Securities Commission is in a very peculiar situation as far as ministerial responsibility is concerned. The ministerial responsibility is to the Ministerial Council, which is comprised of the Attorneys of all Australian jurisdictions. The particular part which any Attorney plays in the deliberations and the supervision of the NCSC is, as I say, collective; it is part of a general supervisory control mechanism. If this Parliament, on the basis of a Senate committee report, agrees that that ought to be changed and that there ought to be more direct minis- terial responsibility to, for example, the Commonwealth Attorney-General, I hope it will support our proposals for changes in the companies and securities area.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, relates to the recent release of water from the Ranger mine in the Northern Territory. What are the results of tests which the Office of the Supervising Scientist (OSS) has been conducting on this released water? Further, is the Minister happy with the current regulatory arrangements for the control of operations at the Ranger mine?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of some recent actions at the Ranger mine which have led me to question the adequacy of current environment protection arrangements. For example, late last year as much as 500,000 tonnes of mineralised material containing uranium ore above the prescribed limit were wrongly placed on the waste rock dump site outside the mine's restricted release zone. The Northern Territory Government described this as trivial. I am still waiting for further information from the company, which it has twice promised and still not delivered, on that mistake. The final report from the Office of the Supervising Scientist will be available shortly. I await the report before deciding just how trivial the consequences of that incident might be. What it did demonstrate was that the company had been ignoring established and agreed procedures for perhaps up to six months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two weeks ago the mine operators released water over a three-day period from retention pond 4 (RP4), which is outside the restricted release zone. I might point out that the Office of the Supervising Scientist and the Aboriginal owners of the land were given only a few hours notice of that release. Preliminary laboratory biological tests by the OSS indicate that there have been some toxic effects. I expect more definitive advice from the Office within the next week or so. The release of this water into the Djalkmara Billabong-and eventually that means into the Magela Creek-was timed to coincide with wet season high water flows. It was authorised by the relevant Northern Territory authorities, but advice from the Office of the Supervising Scientist on the best method of release was ignored.</PARA>
<PARA> There are two principal methods of water release from retention pond 4-either via a spillway or via a pipeline. The Supervising Scientist has consistently advised the company and the Northern Territory authorities that the spillway is not acceptable because it allows less control of dilution and is more difficult to test for toxicity. Over the three years 1984 to 1987 all parties accepted this advice and water release from RP4 was, therefore, always via the pipeline. It is disturbing, strange, and remains unexplained why both the company and the Northern Territory authorities have suddenly decided to depart from this established procedure. I understand that my colleague Mr Kerin is also concerned about this and has written to both the Northern Territory Government and the company concerned complaining about these occurrences. I am also concerned that the company is planning further releases from retention pond 4 via the spillway.</PARA>
<PARA> These recent actions by the Ranger mine, which have been far too readily accepted by the Northern Territory authorities, suggest that the Commonwealth's advice on environmental protection for the Ranger mine is not being given sufficient weight. The Supervising Scientist has advised me that if this process continues the high standards of environmental protection in the Alligator Rivers Region will be threatened. Accordingly, I have asked for a number of options to be examined that might enable the Commonwealth properly to fulfil its obligations in this regard. These options include the possibility of using legal powers under the Atomic Energy Act, which is administered by Mr Kerin, under the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act, or the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act.</PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, as all honourable senators will be aware, the Kakadu National Park and the World Heritage area in the Northern Territory are of unparalleled international significance, let alone domestic significance. The Commonwealth will take whatever action is necessary to prevent that heritage from being threatened. The wetlands of Kakadu will not be allowed to become a drain, to be used at the convenience of either the company or the Northern Territory Government.</PARA>

I was talking about the employment growth created by this Government over the last six years. I was talking about the advantages to families from the introduction of Medicare. I can go on to detail some more advantages, if the Opposition would like to hear them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have taken specific measures to assist low income families so that the burden of economic restraint would be borne fairly. Our concern is with fairness and equity. It is important to remember what Future Directions says in relation to equity. For example, it states:</PARA>

<PARA>Senator Hill spoke about the living standards of families, yet the Liberal Party document sets out quite clearly the intention of the Opposition in relation to families, particularly those families most in need.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by running through a few other initiatives. We have provided for an increase in rent assistance for low income families. By June 1990, families with three or more children will have had their rent assistance doubled and families with one or two children will have had their rent assistance increased by two-thirds. Medicare has saved families at least $21 per week in private insurance costs. We have increased education allowances. For example, we have more than doubled the rate for 16- to 17-year-old secondary students. We have also increased the retention rates, particularly for girls. We have boosted the year 12 retention rate to 57.6 per cent, compared to about 36 per cent in 1982. I have already talked about the dramatic increase in the number of child care places.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The sports development program of the Australian Sports Commission provides assistance to national associations for such things as the appointment of an administrator or a national coach, or the staging of international events. On occasions, it also provides funds for travel overseas to international competitions. When deciding funding levels, the Commission takes into account proposals submitted to it by the national sporting organisations concerned. Hence, funding decisions are a reflection of the requests that have been received.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The grants to men's and women's hockey under the 1987-88 program were $146,000 and $82,000 respectively. The difference is a reflection of the fact that men's hockey requested greater funding for travel assistance and also requested funds for a junior development officer. The junior development officer, by the way, was of direct benefit to both boys and girls hockey. It is important also to point out that the sports development program is only part of the Government's total assistance to sport. For example, under the 1987-88 sports talent encouragement plan, STEP as it is known, both men's and women's hockey received $64,000. This year, however, men's hockey received $64,000, but women's hockey received $80,000. The overall level of Government assistance to hockey in general in 1988-89 is $867,000. In addition to this, the Federal Government has contributed $200,000 towards the resurfacing of the Perth Hockey Stadium. I hope that adequately answers the question. There has been no discrimination against women's hockey. In any event, this year women's hockey is getting more than men's hockey.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This may be a matter of some levity on the Opposition side. In terms of animal welfare, I happen to regard this matter as serious and as deserving of some dignity in terms of my reply in the Senate. I am also aware that last December some 40 deer died on a flight between New Zealand and Melbourne. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, the service that has concern for the welfare of animals and plant life in and out of Australia, has investigated both incidents. Its responsibility in terms of these matters is to ensure that the loading and transport arrangements are such as not to adversely affect the welfare or health of animals being transported, but the responsibility for animal welfare during flight or carriage lies with the agency or the carrier in the particular circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the case of the goats, I can report to the Senate that I am advised that they were inspected by quarantine staff at approximately midday on the date of travel and were certified fit to travel. The veterinary officer concerned was satisfied that the loading densities in the transport crates were satisfactory and complied with International Air Transport Association standards. The goats were loaded into the aircraft hold 30 minutes prior to the expected time of departure. The carrier, British Airways, has reported that thereafter a series of problems with the aircraft, its fuel load and some minor repairs delayed take-off by between one and two hours. This in turn required a change of crew and further delay then occurred.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of those delays and because of human error nothing was done to open the hold, the goats remained enclosed and because of the delay were asphyxiated. In those circumstances I regard it as a tragic and avoidable event. As I have said, the responsibility of this part of travel is that of the airline and something that airlines have to pay attention to. If humans were involved in a delay of this nature they would be attended to. Transport carriers are required to see that live cargoes are attended to and receive similar consideration in those circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> With respect to the consignment of deer which were delivered dead by asphyxiation on arrival in Melbourne, they had been inspected and passed fit to travel by New Zealand veterinary officers. In that incident incorrect data on load densities had been fed into a controlling computer and as a result insufficient air was circulated through the hold during the flight. As a result of these two incidents I have taken a personal interest in this matter. Quarantine officers have met with the officials of the airlines concerned. I am advised that the Chief Quarantine Officers (Animals) in both New South Wales and Victoria have reported to the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service that they are satisfied now that the efforts of the airlines will be such to ensure that no incidents of this nature recur. However, we are taking the matter up further with the airlines involved-all airlines who may be involved with carriage of this nature-to ensure that the carriage of livestock into and out of Australia is handled in a way conducive to animal welfare practice and proper human practice and that handling, loading and loading practices and transport of animals are observed in the way in which the regulations, both national and international, require them to be.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answering Senator Childs's question-I will ignore the pathetic little rantings from Senator Chaney in this particular part of the proceedings-I should say by way of background, that it has been the long term aim of governments in this country for almost 15 years to obtain uniform credit legislation across the States and Territories. In July 1988 a big step forward was taken when State and Federal Ministers agreed, first, to achieve uniformity and, secondly, to proceed with drafting legislation to achieve this uniformity. The keenness to obtain uniformity has been shown on the part of Government, on the part of industry, which has been very keen to obtain a level playing field in this area, and on the part of consumer groups. Consumer groups can see the benefits of facilitating consumer awareness because of uniform legislation covering all legislatures in Australia. The step forward taken in July 1988 has been proceeded with. The Victorian Law Reform Commission, under the auspices of the Standing Committee of Consumer Affairs Ministers (SCOCAM) officials has been drafting legislation for some time. We anticipate that that draft legislation will be available for consideration by Ministers when they meet again in July this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At this stage I should also say that industry cooperation, in terms of obtaining that agreement amongst Ministers, was extremely vital. That was recognised at the time. The New South Wales Minister, Mr Peacocke, who was part of the agreement said two things which I believe are worth placing on the record. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I want to make our position quite clear . . . We have not taken a position where we in any way wish to deviate from a uniform approach to credit legislation. I want to make that quite clear.</PARA>
<PARA>In response to the Victorian Minister, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> May I say that I would like to congratulate you and the Law Reform Commission on an excellent piece of work. It is outstanding.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the work which he was referring to was the early drafts of the uniform consumer credit legislation. It is interesting to note a number of things in the press report of this morning. The aim of consumer Ministers was, of course, to obtain adequate consumer protection as well as to obtain uniformity. At the outset, I should say that I am pleased that both the report and the proposal, to the extent that that proposal is clear and definite, express a commitment to the agreement made in July last year at SCOCAM and a commitment to retain all existing consumer protection. There are however, some parts of the report, and of the document detailing the proposal, that place the intentions of the New South Wales Government very much on trial, giving very strong warning signals to both consumer groups and industry in respect of whether those aims which were set out are achievable.</PARA>
<PARA> For consumers, I think the basic point is that there needs to be effective, cheap access to redress mechanisms. That point is not spelled out so far in the proposal. There needs to be an effective screening of lenders. The SCOCAM meeting allowed individual States to agree on whether they should adopt positive or negative licensing. However, underlying the intention of all Ministers was the effective mechanism of screening lenders. To that extent there are doubts over the New South Wales proposal. Also, in terms of consumer interest, there needs to be very much a strong focus retained on the priority area of consumer credit for individual consumers. We want to ensure that they are not swamped by the introduction of other areas of credit.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to industry, industry at the time was concerned, as it would be concerned now, that the proposal may give deregulation a bad name. The document I have seen proposes a parallel system of both regulation and self-regulation. Parallel mechanisms to protect consumers could, in this instance, lead to a cumbersome, confusing, and even costly situation. Industry expressed concern last year at that degree of inconsistency and I suspect that it will still be concerned with that inconsistency now.</PARA>
<PARA> As it stands, therefore, the proposal which I have seen is very much a step into the unknown. I do acknowledge the commitments made by Mr Peacocke last year and which have been repeated this year. If those benchmarks which were made at SCOCAM-that is, adequate consumer protection and uniformity-are to be achieved, there is an obligation on all the players in the field, whether they be industry groups, consumer groups or others, not to react emotively to the Peacocke proposal. The obligation is to continue to make a constructive input in the area, just as the input was made last year by State and Federal Ministers, and accordingly to achieve those goals which we set one year ago.</PARA>

<PARA> That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA> The need for the Government to change its policies which are depriving increasing numbers of young Australians of the opportunity to own their own homes. </PARA>
<PARA>I bring this matter of urgency before the Senate today because of its overriding priority to millions of Australians. Home ownership has dwindled to the point where it now has the status of being a privilege. In the past it used to be the right of all Australians to have their own home. This state of affairs has occurred because the Labor Government has been in office for six years. Mr Keating has told the Australian public-I presume that he was speaking on behalf of Senator Richardson and the rest of the Government-that Australians have to lower their expectations. They cannot afford to have a clothes hoist or a swimming pool. That may be the expectations that the Australian Labor Party wants to inflict on the public of Australia, but let me say unequivocally, speaking on behalf of my colleagues, that we do not want to see those standards inflicted on young Australians when we take office. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) express his concern about the economy, and rightly so. Let us look at some of the macro-economic disasters that are having an effect on high interest rates. The result is that a number of young Australians are not able to afford their own homes. In March 1983 home loan interest rates were 12.5 per cent; in February 1989 they were 15.5 per cent. Bankruptcies have risen from the Fraser average of 4,717 to 9,421 in 1987-88. Our current account deficit has increased from an average of $4.7 billion to $11.7 billion under Keating who wants us to dry our clothes in a clothes drier and refuses to give the young people of Australia a clothes line. Foreign debt has escalated from $35.5 billion and 20.9 per cent of gross domestic product in June 1983 to $121 billion and 40.2 per cent of GDP in September. The marginal tax rate for the average income earner was 30c in the dollar in 1983; it is now 40c in every dollar. Home loan repayments have increased from an average monthly repayment of $350, or 19.2 per cent of income in March 1983, to an astounding $778 or nearly 31 per cent of income in September 1988. If members of the Labor Party do not think that there is a housing crisis in Australia that is affecting our young families, then they must be the only ones in Australia who are not aware of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I will just go through some of the headlines in today's capital city papers: In the Courier-Mail the headline is `City home crisis hits thousands, says report'. The article states that 17 people are sharing a two-bedroom house. `Mortgages up-$27 extra on average home loan', said the Daily Telegraph. `Up they go', says the Melbourne Sun; `Sydney families $30 a week worse off', is the headline in the Daily Mirror; `High home loans here to stay: PM', which admits defeat; and `House prices to jump by $32,000', are headlines in the Daily Telegraph. We are told that we have nothing to worry about, but these headlines indicate the effect on everyone in Australia as this Labor Party clears the decks in its final run-up to an election later this year before the whole economy collapses around it like a pack of cards. The Prime Minister will have to race to get to an election before the economy crashes. It will almost be a dead heat. The average household is paying an extra $49 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> Qualifying income to buy an average priced first home has doubled since early 1985 from $23,000 to $46,000. We can go on and on about those figures, but we are not receiving any response from the Government. Sixty thousand people now live on the verge of homelessness and 40,000 sleep in the open or in refuges. They are refugees from this Labor Government who seek shelter just as the refugees from Afghanistan had to seek shelter. Not I nor the papers or press or the people of Australia seem to be able to rouse any response from the Labor Government. The Government thinks that it can solve a crisis of massive proportions by holding a summit. I am not against the summit. I am not against anything that can give some type of relief to Australia's homeless people. But I think the summit needs to be put down for what it is: a desperate bid by the Prime Minister to be seen to be doing something. The Australian people have sacrificed too much. In terms of quality of life, the sacrifice has been excessive. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is taking $82.3 billion from Australians in this tax year. The loss to the taxpayer in real disposable income ranges from $41 to $72 a week, depending on whether a person is a single taxpayer or a member of a two-income family with two children. The company tax was reduced by this Government two years ago. I do not argue with that, but the workers of Australia are still waiting for their tax cuts. They have been put off for two years. Even now, on the eve of some tax cuts, no-one is sure what the figure will be. </PARA>
<PARA> There is great uncertainty amongst Government Ministers, one saying one thing, one saying another. Some Ministers say, `We cannot afford to give tax cuts', but the Prime Minister is determined to go ahead. I will be interested to see-and I will be waiting with bated breath-what those tax cuts are. </PARA>

<PARA> Second only to the Government's fondness for summits is its addiction to taxes. We have never before seen such a plethora of taxes come before a nation as in the six years of this Government's reign. Fringe benefit tax, capital gains tax, entertainment tax, company tax, wholesale taxes, petrol excise increases, wine taxes, superannuation fund income taxes, gold taxes, graduate taxes: the taxes go on and on.

I hope that we do not have to lower our expectations in this country. There is no need for us to do that. For a senior Minister of this Government to say that we have to lower our expectations is the greatest example of defeatism I have ever heard. Why do we have to lower our expectations? There is an alternative to lowering our expectations: vote for the coalition and people will return to the prosperity that they enjoyed over a number of years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been said that I do not support the summit. I do support it because I think it is bringing people together. It will create debate and awareness, and it may do some-  thing marginal to lift the awareness of the Government, although Government members should not be unaware of the problems if they read the newspapers every day. Some of the States have done quite a lot for young home buyers and new home buyers. The Queensland Government has lifted the stamp duty for first home buyers on houses costing up to $80,000. I am sure that measure has been well received and I recommend it to the other States. The maximum Housing Commission loan has been raised to $75,000. Some 122,000 hectares of land previously set aside for railway purposes has now been freed for housing and parkland development. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst those sorts of things relieve some of the pressure, they are only going round the sides of the issue. The main issue that confronts this Government is its poor economic performance over the last six years. The people who are bearing the brunt of that economic performance are the young home buyers of Australia. No wonder Australia's population growth is down to zero. This has been caused by the housing crisis in Australia as more and more people have to have two incomes. The wife has to go out to work, and the stage at which couples can have children is getting later. The only way families are able to own their own homes is for women to remain in the work force longer. This is affecting the Australian way, Australian families, and the birth rate in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Government has set up a crisis hot line which is taking over 500 calls a week from distressed families and individuals. There has been a marked increase in phone calls from people seeking help. Mortgage payments have risen because this Labor Government has used interest rates as an economic policy tool. It is not affecting the big people; they can live through it. But it is affecting Labor Party supporters, or people who were Labor Party supporters. No government could have hit the family harder than Labor has. There are pressures on family incomes through excessive home loan repayments. The need for two incomes to sustain the high level mortgage repayments needed to meet today's housing crisis puts great pressure on family life. </PARA>
<PARA> The main problems facing first home buyers are tied into the state of the national economy: affordability, the increasing cost of land, interest rates, the deposit gap and inadequate savings. As Senator Stone has informed me, housing cannot be isolated from the rest of the economy. Senator Stone has told me, and he is quite correct, that anything else we do will be a stopgap measure. Unless we can get the economy under control, get interest rates down and set macro-economic policies on a course for development, we will only be going round the edges. From the mid-1970s this Government has seen a levelling off of real income, an increased number of welfare dependants and interest rates escalating to historically high levels. The hardest hit in the current crisis have been the least able to pay the price-the young single income families wanting to buy a home and those on low incomes consigned to the private sector. That is the reason that I raise this matter of public importance today. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall be interested to hear what the Government has to say about this crisis that is affecting most young married families. I shall be listening to what Senator Cook puts down. I hope that he is not just busily scribbling notes down now on the run. I hope he has put some thought into this. I hope he has gone to see the Treasurer and the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples). I hope he is going to present to the Senate a plan that will give some hope to the people who are struggling under the burden of high interest rates inflicted by this callous Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Bank of Australia-Housing Industry Association index for all capital cities over the last 12 months to December 1988 showed that the median price for an existing home has risen by 44.6 per cent, from $77,000 to nearly $112,000. At the same time average household disposable income rose by 4.9 per cent from $32,500 to $34,000 while the affordability index declined from 132.7 to 99.0. That is why young families in Australia are having to live with their parents, which creates tremendous pressure, to live in flats under their parents' homes, live in caravans or, if they are fortunate enough to be able to afford it, in a unit or a flat. But it is stopping them from achieving the dream of owning their own house. </PARA>
<PARA> When Labor came to power in 1983 the average home took 19 per cent of disposable income of the Australian home buyer. The situation now is that the average home loan grabs a massive 30 per cent of household income, and that percentage is continuing to rise. In 1988 the average home loan cost $733 a month. It is going to increase by the end of this year to $1,000 a month. That is the legacy that this Government has inflicted on the Australian people over the last six years. It has been economically irresponsible. The Government is not paying the price. It is not big business that is paying the price. It is the average Australian family that the Government has neglected. The Government has walked away from its base, its political grass roots, its heartland, and has left those people to suffer. It has let interest rates escalate, and the people have had their housing reduced. The standard of housing is shocking. People are now reduced to living in a little eight-square brick box when the average standard of a working man's dwelling eight to 10 years ago was a nice 13-square home. So not only are people not able to afford a decent standard of home, but when they do get into a home the standard has well and truly been reduced due to the Labor Party's shocking handling of the economy. </PARA>

It is nothing short of a petty, tawdry and, above all else, carping and transparent attempt to deflect public attention from what is going on in the Cabinet room as we speak-a national summit on housing, a national summit which has been created, driven, and I believe will be acted on by this Government to address problems in housing supply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In his opening remarks Senator Boswell made two interesting comments which should be focused on for a second, but no longer than a second, because that would waste time. Firstly, he said that if members of the Australian Labor Party do not think there is a housing crisis they are the only ones in Australia who do not think so. Secondly, he said that the Opposition did not seem to be able to rouse any response from Labor on this issue. Labor thinks that there is a problem and it is doing something about it. We are not carping; we are not being petty; and we are not trying to turn this issue into a political football. We are being constructive and proactive. We are trying to reach a solution to meet what is not an interest rate problem but a supply problem in terms of the availability of land for housing. </PARA>
<PARA> As we speak, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) are meeting the Premiers at a special out of session Premiers Conference for the purposes of looking at how we can put more land on the market so that there will be more availability, land prices will be brought down, and people will have more access to building blocks, and so that we can look at any obstructions there might be in the labour market to make sure that there is a supply of skilled labour to meet any further demands on what is already an overheated housing construction section. We are also looking at building materials supply so that any blockages in the supply of building materials can be overcome. We are talking to the Premiers about zoning problems and are looking at how servicing of blocks can be made more efficient so that those blocks can become available and so that the market, which is overheating, will be met-not in the way it would have been met in the bad old days of the Fraser Government, that is, by damping down, blocking and stopping it and throwing the economy back into recession, which Senator Stone knows all about, thus killing demand and putting people out of housing, but by looking constructively at what needs to be done to overcome the blockage. That is the distinct difference between our two parties and one of the reasons that just a few weeks ago a Labor government won a State election in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not going to the Premiers just on the basis that the Commonwealth is not doing anything. We have already announced, as a prelude to the summit, a release on the market of 27,000 building blocks over the next five years, which is equivalent to the creation of 15 new suburbs. Commonwealth land which we can make available for housing construction will be progressively released over time in order to take some of the heat off the shortage of land supply. Obviously we are not going to release it all at once and create a major bottleneck. We are going to release it over time. It will be a phased-in meeting of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I expect real change and improvement as a result of the initiative of the Hawke Government being conducted today in this building. There is a problem, and it is the proper course for government to recognise when there is a problem and to say so honestly. It is also the proper obligation of government then to address the problem, which we are doing. The mechanisms to answer the problem are available to us and we are putting them in place. To take a cynical view, there are likely to be three State elections this year: in Tasmania, Queensland and South Australia. So there is real electoral impetus on two conservative governments and one Labor government to make sure that the supply side problem is met in political terms. That is why I think this initiative of the Hawke Government will be successful. The Opposition's tawdry, pathetic and transparent attempt to deflect attention from it will not work. It did not work for Mr Downer yesterday; it will not work for Senator Boswell today. Most of the news tonight will not be about what Senator Boswell said in this debate; it will be about the positive outcome of our initiative because Australian people want to see a positive outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> Having dealt with that, let me go to some analysis of the problem-something that Senator Boswell refused to undertake. He talked vaguely and generally about interest rates, he waffled about tax and then he beat his breast about the Queensland Government. That does not frighten us in terms of an urgency motion. All of those things can be dealt with properly. All of those things, in the way in which the honourable senator put them, are beside the point in this debate. They are not at the core of the issue. The problem is that we need to improve the supply of building blocks in Australia and get them on to the market. We need to overcome problems in zoning and servicing which prevent those blocks being taken up. We need to recognise the difficulties in the labour market and in building materials supply. The affordability problem, which has gained a lot of focus and attention in this debate, seriously afflicts Sydney more than all the other capital cities, though it also affects Melbourne to some extent. But elsewhere there is not the same problem. If one looks at the national affordability statistics one will see that the problem is most chronic in Sydney and slightly less so in Melbourne. The national affordability average is much lower than the average for those cities. </PARA>
<PARA> What we recognise as a government, with a hands on responsibility and an orderly way of dealing with these problems-not driven by hysteria but by rational analysis-is that Australians seek by choice to live in three different types of housing environment. The first choice, often referred to as the Australian dream, is to own one's own home. Not all Australians seek to do so, but most do. We want to set our policies to encourage those who aspire to that dream to achieve it. We also recognise that some people seek rental in public housing and in private housing. That is a choice that they make. Not in all cases is that choice an easy one, and sometimes the cost of moving into owner-occupied housing delays the transition. But if that is their choice, the obligation of a government with responsibility for housing in a democracy is to make available the realisation of the choice individuals want to make. So we recognise those three choices. I repeat, however, that the burden of our policy settings is to enable Australians to move into home ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> We have in place a series of mechanisms-we do not need the summit for this-to ensure that that Australian aspiration, in whatever form it takes, is met. The first and most important mechanism that we, as a government, have put in place to rectify this situation is the first home owners scheme. Since we introduced the scheme in 1983, and swept aside the ill targeted, ill conceived tax measures that the previous Fraser Government had in place, which, during the Fraser Government-led recession, were proved not to have worked very effectively at all, we have injected $1.4 billion into home purchasing and the paying off of home loans for low income Australians. That has enabled 318,000 households to benefit directly from that scheme. We recognise the difficulties of overheating. Nonetheless, we have focused on making it possible for low income Australians to achieve the outcome in home ownership that they desire. We have been outstandingly successful in that and we will persist with it. </PARA>
<PARA> The second important alteration we have made to the landscape of home ownership is the deregulation of the financial market. I would be interested to hear what Senator Stone has to say on this later; he is writing something at the moment and if his scribblings in newspapers and his speeches in this place are any indication, I think he would have wanted the Fraser Government to deregulate, but it lacked the will to do so. When the Fraser Government had control of the levers of the economy and sought to do things, what did it do? When money was tight, the banks could limit the amount of money on loan by keeping interest rates low. Therefore there was not sufficient money available in the pool for home loans. That is how the Fraser Government did it. By deregulating the market we have guaranteed that housing finance will not dry up and that money is available. Under the Fraser Government it dried up and it was not available. </PARA>

That is the key reason why we are facing an overheating of the market. More loans are being taken out.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The population has not varied greatly since then. If anything, the age structure of the population is beneficial to this analysis. Because of the deregulation of the financial market, more people have been able to borrow despite the level of interest rates. Therefore, there is pressure on supply. If honourable senators want me to give further comparisons of figures, I shall.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Opposition senators talk about interest rates. They should answer those statistics I have given on this occasion. As I have said, that is why there is an access problem and why there is overheating. Thus we have the housing summit and the efforts to alleviate and moderate that overheating. It is an indication of success in the economy, not of failure, that that has occurred. I do not, however, want to sit down in this debate before I have focused on one of the key elements which differentiates us from the Opposition. What is the difference between a solid, good, effective and delivering Labor Government and the ineffectual transparent and carping Opposition? The one thing that has traditionally differentiated us and which remains as a key differentiation is our concern about public housing, our concern about how battlers in Australia get into housing and our concern about providing a roof over their heads.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one wants to look at what the Opposition did when it was in government compared to what we are doing now, one will see that the statistics belie any allegations or pretence that the Opposition may wish to make. Let me go in an orderly way, therefore, through the comparisons in terms of public housing. Commonwealth assistance for public housing has in real terms under this Government doubled from what the Opposition provided when in government. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Opposition wants to espouse itself as a champion of the poor and underprivileged, why did it provide only half the funds that we will provide for this section of the community, in real terms, in inflation adjusted terms? In public housing 250,000 households have been accommodated under us compared with 165,000 under the Opposition's five years of government. Home loans were provided to 70,000 low income households by us compared with 50,000 by the Opposition over a five-year comparative period. An additional 70,000 rental dwellings have been provided by us compared with 40,000 by the Opposition over a comparative five-year period. </PARA>
<PARA> Our record in almost every aspect of meeting demand and of providing housing for low income earners in this country is almost twice as effective as the Opposition's-in real terms, adjusted for inflation. The Opposition should not come in here pretending that somehow or other it will be trying to represent the voice of the people who are in low income circumstances. One has only to look back to how callous and non-compassionate the Opposition was in the period in which it was in office. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me go on with this comparison a little further. I know the Opposition will not wish me to because it is the key point which shows us in sharp contrast. This Government has also targeted assistance to low and middle income earners in the private rental market. Rental assistance has been increased to $15 a week and has been extended to those receiving the family allowance supplement and to parents on unemployment benefit. This is the first time that any Federal government has provided rent assistance to working families on low incomes. Further changes to rent assistance announced in the 1988 Budget will also help reduce the incidence of housing related poverty in the private rental sector. Rent assistance for pensioners, beneficiaries and family allowance supplement recipients will rise progressively to a maximum of $30 a week for large families by June 1990. By June 1990 pensioners and beneficiaries without children will have received a 100 per cent increase in the maximum rate of rent assistance since 1983 while those with children will have received an increase of between 150 per cent and 200 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Our concern about how the problems of housing in Australia impact upon the lower end of the income scale has, by the statistical test, by the real terms test, by the inflation adjusted test, proven to be twice as compassionate and as concerned as the Opposition's. This is not only the case in the public housing sector. We have delivered the goods in the private housing sector with rent supplements and assistance to people in real need. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not to say that we do not recognise the ongoing difficulties. But we have delivered the goods in a vastly superior way to anything that the Opposition has considered. Let us not have this political posturing, this petty transparent carping and the sort of slander that Senator Boswell has come out with. Why not concentrate on using this chamber to promote a positive debate in the summit, wait until we see the outcome of it and wait until we see what the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the State Premiers have been able to put forward? If, then, the Opposition has some criticisms, let us hear them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say to Senator Stone that that indicates that the differences are very subtle. Certainly, they would be lost on people in this country who are in dire straits with respect to housing. One might support this matter of urgency merely on the grounds that had the Opposition been in government, I am quite sure it would not have dared to go as far down the road of deregulation as the Government has or implemented the other policies-which I will deal with in a moment-that the Government has implemented. The situation might well have been better had the Opposition been in government or had this Government stuck closer to its traditional policies and supported ordinary people. It has not done that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The situation is very serious. The figures speak for themselves, despite what Senator Cook has said. Median house prices in the State capitals and in Canberra rose by an average of $9,200 during the September quarter last year. During the same period, average household disposable income dropped by $200. By the mid-quarter last year, bank mortgage rates had risen to 14.5 per cent. As we know, they have now risen further. In the last quarter of last year, a person who wanted to borrow money to buy a house costing the national median price of $103,000 needed to earn $46,000 per year to meet the Commonwealth Bank's loan criteria, assuming a 25 per cent deposit. If one takes out the figure for inflation, this amount is double the $23,000 a buyer needed in 1985, only three years ago and two years into the period of office of this Labor Government. Those figures speak for themselves. The situation is getting progressively worse, and fewer and fewer people can afford housing. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to address two broad areas. In regard to both of those areas I point out that there is absolutely no difference between the Government and the Opposition. I refer to the themes pursued by both major parties of growth for growth's sake-undifferentiated growth, growth without thought to the consequences of growth-and the processes of deregulation. Dealing first with the problem of population growth, in the September 1988 quarter our migration program added more people to Australia's population than the natural rate of population increase. Fifty-seven per cent of the population increase in that quarter was due to the migration program. Of the 66,000 people who were added to the population at that time, 37,700 were migrants. I do not in any sense blame migrants; I blame the policy of the Government, which seeks to pack more people into Australia without thought to where those people will live and their impact on the urban centres of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Migrants generate added pressure for housing. It is quite clear that most of the children born during the September quarter will live with their parents, whereas most of those 37,700 migrants will be adults. They require not only houses but also schools, recreation facilities, sewage disposal facilities, roads, water catchment areas, garbage disposal, et cetera. The pursuit of population increase for its own sake-nobody has established that migration is of any net economic benefit to this country-is one of the major factors adding to the strain on housing. I point out yet again that the Opposition would pursue policies of population growth greater than those of the Government. It is committed to a greater migration program than that of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook said that we are in need of skills. One of the claims for the migration program is that we need to bring in people with skills. We have had a migration program since 1947. If we still do not have enough skilled people here to build houses, it reflects very badly on our educational system and our ability to train young people in the housing area. It is about time we did something about that rather than simply trying to pack more people into the country. Eighty per cent of population increase since 1947 has accrued in urban areas. That situation continues today. That applies both to the natural increase and to the increase due to migration. That is the primary source of pressure on the urban areas and the demand for housing. If one takes the market view of the economy, which both the Government and the Opposition do, then prices go up when there is a demand for a limited supply. When one adds to that the deregulatory programs which have been pursued by the Government the situation is exacerbated. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent days the Treasurer, Mr Keating, has said that the answer to this problem is to pack more people into our cities; we need higher density housing. What right does Mr Keating or anybody else have to dictate to Australians the way in which they will live when they have made it quite clear that they would prefer to live in more open cities? In most cases, they would prefer a quarter acre block. It has been identified that there are enormous advantages in terms of safe areas for children to play in, the ability to grow vegetables in the back garden, exercise, isolation from neighbours, less noise pollution and so on. It has been identified that people want to live on quarter acre blocks. That is not to say that we should not be building more high density housing for some people, but it should not be forced on an unwilling population because we have a population explosion. The figures show quite clearly that the majority of Australians are not in favour of the high migration rates which are being pursued by this Government and the high migration rates which would be pursued by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> There is substantial decay in our urban infrastructure as a consequence of population increase. The figures which were given by the South Australian Government to the FitzGerald Committee to advise on Australia's Immigration Policies indicate that the South Australian Government will need to spend $800m over the next five years on urban infrastructure. But in the next five-year period the Government will need to spend $3 billion on the maintenance of urban infrastructure, which will totally soak up all the public funding in that area leaving no money whatsoever to provide new infrastructure for the new population. In just the last couple of weeks we have seen three major water mains burst in Adelaide which have obstructed roads and traffic for days at a time. Infrastructure in Adelaide is simply wearing out. The pressure for population increase can only reduce the quality of life for people living in our major cities. </PARA>
<PARA> In the press in recent days there has been a call for South Australia and Western Australia to bring water in from the Ord River-build a pipeline right across Australia at a cost of $8 billion. That water would cost every single family about $3,500 per year simply to pay the capital cost on the pipeline, the amortisation of that capital cost and the interest payments without ever pumping one single drop of water through that pipeline. That is the end product of this blind pursuit of growth for growth's sake which is the policy of both the Government and the Opposition. The growth model, as I have indicated on several previous occasions, has a large number of faults. </PARA>
<PARA> It is perhaps appropriate at this point to interpolate that Senator Walsh has admitted that many of the things which are costs are put down as benefits. When I asked a question relating to motor vehicle accidents and where those costs appeared, pointing out that they appeared on the positive side of the national accounts as an addition to gross national product, and that the money we would spend on a pipeline across Australia to pump water would not appear as a cost but would appear as an addition to gross domestic product, Senator Walsh pointed out that if we were to exclude some of these costs it would `require more fundamental changes to the accounts-indeed, to the extent where it could touch off a spiral in which all the gross domestic product gradually disappeared'. Senator Walsh recognises that, if we did our national accounting correctly, the apparent conflict between the perception which ordinary people have-that they are becoming worse off-and the claim by the Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) that, because the gross national product is increasing, we are becoming better off would be adequately explained. </PARA>
<PARA> The second major policy direction being followed by the Government and supported by the Opposition is the policy of deregulation. There is, of course, a fundamental flaw in the market system on which this philosophy is based. It is based ultimately on the idea of Adam Smith that there is an invisible hand which will mean that the operation of unfettered competitive greed will somehow serve the common good. That is absolute nonsense. It has been nonsense since the days of Adam Smith, and it is surprising to me that economists and politicians in this place can still mouth such absolute stupidities. There is absolutely no a priori reason why the operation of competitive greed should serve the common good. One can build mathematical models which show that the so-called level playing field-a term much used in this place-the sine qua non of the market system that everybody is equal within the market and all competing together, is the most unstable position in a market system. It will hunt very rapidly towards monopoly positions. What we find in practice is that it hunts very rapidly towards monopoly positions. The players who get a slight advantage on that level playing field very quickly determine that that is the way it will go. </PARA>
<PARA> We have deregulated the interest rate system, and we have allowed foreign speculators to come in and speculate against our currency. I do not know what the figure is now, but several years ago it was suggested that $50 trillion was sloshing around in the international money markets, speculating substantially against the Australian dollar. This has meant that financial institutions have been able to get an advantage over ordinary home buyers. We find that there is no shortage of building activity. But where is the building activity going on? It is going on in our major cities. Every skyline in Australia is festooned with giant cranes building office space while people are desperately short of housing. We have a 17 per cent vacancy rate in office space at present. The Government has allowed speculators to go into the market. Thirty per cent of dwelling transactions in Australia now are going to investors. Investors are heavily involved and they are speculating against those who desperately need housing. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has introduced negative gearing, and it has allowed speculators in that system to speculate even more unfairly against genuine home buyers. For instance, if the interest rate is 16 per cent, a person who pays 50 per cent tax is effectively paying 8 per cent interest rate on his home loan, whereas the person who buys a house to live in is paying the full 16 per cent. Moreover, the speculator, if he or she makes a loss, simply writes the loss off against that tax. The well-off are being given an advantage over the poor. Shame on this Labor Government for allowing that to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> We have allowed foreign ownership to be completely unregulated. I notice that even the Australian Council of Trade Unions is calling for action to close foreign investment loopholes and to stop foreign investment and foreign speculation in Australian real estate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I point out to the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), who led the debate for the Government in response to this urgency motion, that the crisis in housing is a matter of urgency. He tried to pretend that our bringing the matter forward was a stunt and that it ought not be a matter for discussion while the housing summit is taking place. He used a range of words to describe our interest in this crisis-petty, tawdry, carping and transparent. He obviously lacked anything of substance to say if he had to resort to accusing us of raising the matter at the time of the mighty summit. We have had summits before. We are used to finding out exactly how little we get out of them. We have had a tax summit, an economic summit and a drug summit, all of which have been great talkfests. Such summits provide a great opportunity for people to say a great deal, but not much comes out of them. Senator Cook confirmed that when he indicated that today's housing summit was focusing on the supply of land. He said that that supply was a matter that was being addressed. Of course land is important, but he made no mention whatever of the cost of servicing land and making it available to people, not to mention the cost of buying houses to put on the land to those who might want to provide their families with homes. The Minister made no mention of the burden of interest payments that such people would have to pay if they were to provide a home in that way. Talk about the supply of land is merely the tip of the iceberg. Why does the Government not get around to talking about its economic policies, which have driven interest rates to their present level? High interest rates mean that many people are not able to maintain the payments on their homes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister indicated that the burden of Labor policy, to use his words, was to enable Australians to move into home ownership. He then went on to talk about the first home owners scheme and to boast about the amount of money that Labor has put into it. He spoke of the number of households to have benefited from it, and referred to it as being outstandingly successful. It is a pity that he has fled from the chamber and is not here to answer my question. If Labor is doing so much, how is it that the first home owners scheme now provides only 5 per cent of the cost of buying a first home, although when it first started it provided approximately 11 per cent of the cost. Honourable senators who consider that fact in conjunction with the interest rates that have to be paid on the mortgage will get some appreciation of how little benefit the first home owners scheme confers under Labor. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to reflect a little on the housing situation. In 1942, when Robert Menzies gave the speech that has now been referred to as his `forgotten people' speech-even that phrase is worth remembering at a time like this-he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The material home represents the concrete expression of the habits of frugality and saving for a home of your own. Your advanced socialist may rage against private property . . . but one of the best instincts in us is that which induces us to have one little piece of earth with a house and a garden which is ours: to which we can withdraw, in which we can be among friends, into which no stranger may come against our will. </PARA>
<PARA>It is the belief of the Liberal Party that people still want their own homes. It is very interesting to consider the way in which the Minister dealt with the topic; I will return to that a little later. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer specifically to the realities of the Australian Capital Territory, the area that I represent. In June of 1988, not so long ago, the average loan on a house was $60,386. The repayment on such a loan over 25 years at the then interest rate of 13.5 per cent was $704 a month-quite a lot of money out of one's wage. Total payments on that $60,000 loan amounted to $150,772. In just six months-to December 1988-with the same average loan of just over $60,000, with the interest rate that had gone up in six months to 15 per cent, the monthly repayments had gone up to $773, bringing a total for that house of $171,653 or an additional $20,881. There are few in this community who have been able to find easily the extra money to pay that increased monthly repayment of an additional $70. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of ways have been found to try to meet this problem-extending the loans, rewriting the loans, maintaining the payment at the original figure and just writing the rest of it on to the loan-but few people have any real appreciation of the actual consequence to their property of doing that. The amount that one owes escalates, not just at the amount of $70-odd a month, if, in fact, one has elected to pay the original rate and not the new rate. Within a very short time one can finish up owing more on one's mortgage than the house is worth. There have been houses sold in Canberra where that has been the case. Normally if one sells a house one hopes to go to another one. There are many people who have had to sell, who find they are in debt and then are left at the mercy of trying to find accommodation when their credit rating is at its lowest, when they have no prospects of finding a deposit for a new house-even that meagre 5 per cent to which I referred earlier-and when they are not a first home loan purchaser. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been referring so far to those who have a home. What about those who are just starting out? It is worth spending a minute or two looking at the plight that they are in. Again, as recently as 9 February the Canberra Times reported that in relation to homes the Australian Capital Territory's figures were the worst. The paper reported in some detail the research of the Commonwealth Bank and the Housing Industry Association. I shall refer briefly to it. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> The outlook for new home buyers worsened considerably throughout Australia in the three months to December-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, of 1988-</PARA>
<PARA>with the situation deteriorating most in Canberra, according to a survey by the Housing Industry Association and the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> The worsening of the already gloomy outlook for would-be home buyers occurred as housing prices and interest rates rose. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpose to remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that interest rates have risen even further since then. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Canberra experienced the biggest rise in the price of established houses in any capital city during the last quarter of 1988, with prices jumping 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> And reflecting the way new home buyers have been priced out of the market, the price of newly built houses-those which are bought predominantly by new home buyers-slumped in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to talk about the prices of houses in the median and lower end of the market and points out that it is not that people do not need homes, but that they just cannot afford to purchase them. That is one aspect of it but few would have failed to have been moved by the article in the Sydney Morning Herald in November last which was headed `The new price of a home-no kids for 10 years'. That is the gloomy prospect that many young people embarking on marriage face at this time. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> Many young couples are agreeing to put off having children for up to 10 to 15 years to qualify for a home loan in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA>That applies to Sydney but similar sorts of stories relate to other markets around the country. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>More than two-thirds of borrowers were relying on both incomes to repay their loan. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to refer to other aspects of the matter including the rise in the median price of houses. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The coordinator of Credit Line, Mrs Betty Weul, said many couples were committed to such a heavy outlay that they had to cut expenses for food ``down to rock bottom'', had no money for entertainment and could not afford a family for up to 15 years. </PARA>
<PARA>Can honourable senators imagine the stress and strain that that places on a relationship, the stress placed on a family which cannot afford to continue to retain the house in which it lives, the stress which is placed on a marriage where the couple know they cannot embark on having a family for 10 to 15 years? It would be bad enough if we were merely talking about the increased cost of housing, but in fact that is not all families have had to face. </PARA>
<PARA> In Canberra, for example, one would be foolish indeed not to have private health insurance if one wanted to protect one's family adequately. Since 1983, under the Labor Government, the state of the hospital system is such that one cannot rely on getting health care in Canberra when it is needed. Certainly, in the case of a major accident, one would be admitted to a hospital. But how many people have had to go to Sydney for treatment, causing great disruption to their families? How many have had to go to Wagga to have bones set? How many aged are living in very difficult circumstances because of the shortage of nursing home beds in Canberra? I could go on and on for the rest of the afternoon recounting the health services plight in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other ways in which families have suffered as a consequence of Labor policies apart from having to pay for private health cover. To return to that, the Minister for Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women (Senator Reynolds), when answering a question today, referred to the advantages families have had from Medicare. She should hang around Canberra a bit longer and find out exactly what families do not get under Medicare. She also claimed that Medicare had saved families $21 a week. If one just relies on Medicare, that is fine if one is fit and healthy and does not need health care. But what about the extra cost of having to pay a Medicare levy and having to provide private health cover so that a family can be sure to get the assistance it needs when needed?</PARA>
<PARA> There is a whole range of other taxes which have been referred to already in this debate. One might say that these taxes relate to other people and not to families, especially low income families. But the cost of sales tax, fringe benefits tax and superannuation taxes flows into the community and is finally paid for by consumers. To pretend that that is not the case is to fly in the face of the reality of the situation. This is the highest taxing government in peacetime. That fact is also reflected in the report which, interestingly enough, the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women had not read this morning. The report, prepared by the Institute of Family Studies, is titled Families and Tax in 1989. Time does not permit me this afternoon to refer to the references it makes to all the ways in which families have been disadvantaged, particularly in the area of tax. It mentions that tax has gone up by 107 per cent for most taxpayers-not high income earners, but most taxpayers, and that is the reality. </PARA>
<PARA> At last Senator Cook got down to the thing he was really boasting about-the difference between Labor and Liberal. He referred to public housing and what is being spent in that area. I am glad he did, because it is not our business to keep people in rented accommodation. Our aim is to enable people to purchase their own homes. He did not refer to the 60,000 homeless: he did not refer to the 40,000 people who sleep in refuges or in the open at night. He talked about the number of people who had been put into rental accommodation by this Government. I talk about the number of people who aim for their own accommodation. He did not talk about the fact that whereas, in 1982, to our shame, there were 110,000 people on public housing waiting lists, now, some seven years later, under Labor there are 160,000 people on public housing waiting lists. He avoided that issue. He did not refer to the study of Pugh and Catt, conducted in South Australia in 1984, which said that every $1m spent by government would provide 162 public houses. But if the same money is spent on private ownership, 280 people would be assisted. These are the realities. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1982-83, 56 per cent of the housing budget went to public housing; last year it was 77 per cent. The Government has got it all wrong in every respect. It is incapable of keeping inflation under control. It is incapable of arresting interest rates. I wonder whether it is capable of delivering tax relief. We are entitled to doubt it because the Government is certainly not able to provide an environment where young Australians are able to get their own homes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason why the coalition's solutions to the housing problem, which we acknowledge, are poles apart from the Government's solutions is really in the concepts it has of the housing problem. Its concepts are fundamentally different from those of the Government and so its solutions are consequently different.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, members of the Opposition are focusing on the symptoms of the current housing problem, not the causes. For example, they see high cost housing as related uniquely to interest rates and, as a result, suggest a relaxation of interest rates. Apart from the broader economic effects of such a decision in an overheated economy, the effect would simply be to increase price pressures further. The simple fact is that if we want to see the cost of housing drop we have to attack it from the supply side. We cannot attack it from the demand side unless either the level of household disposable income drops-does the Opposition really want a recession?-or the expectations of the community are reduced and this is something over which governments have little direct control in the short term. </PARA>
<PARA> The broader economic implications cannot be ignored. The Commonwealth Government has a limited range of options in dealing with economic problems. Its main tools are fiscal policy, wages policy and monetary policy. If pressure is taken off interest rates, which effectively excludes the monetary policy option, it puts greater emphasis on the other two-fiscal and wages policies. I would like somebody on the Opposition benches to tell me how a greater emphasis on wages policy, which means a reduction in wages, not an increase in wages, or fiscal policy restraint, which means reductions in expenditure, can help the housing affordability problem for the average Australian. I do not see too many willing to answer that. </PARA>
<PARA> The second significant difference is in the Opposition's narrow concept of housing. I notice that this is shared by the Australian Democrats as well, if Senator Coulter is a true spokesman for them. I might say that I am surprised at his views. A reading of the Liberal Party's waffly and superficial document, Future Directions, which I think might be more aptly described as `Looking Backwards to the Future', leaves two impressions. The first is one of vagueness and lack of direction. It is so generalised as to be almost meaningless. But in so far as it does come to grips with specifics in relation to the housing industry, its narrow concept of housing involving home ownership in a stereotyped traditional form is, I suppose, what leads to the policy pronouncements that are being alluded to today. There is no recognition in that document, there is no recognition in the many statements that have been made to the media since that document was produced, of the growing complexities of housing needs in an increasingly diverse and complex society. Some of those matters have already been alluded to by Senator Cook. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition policy revolves around two half-baked ideas: firstly, the concept of mortgage insurance cover for 100 per cent mortgages, and, secondly, repayment assistance, but with no indication at all of how much that would be. Let us look first at mortgage insurance cover for 100 per cent mortgages. Assuming that press reports are correct-and we have a difficulty here because the document tells us nothing and the press releases dribble out giving us little bits of information, but it is very hard to get to grips with what the Liberal Party's policy really is-and this cover is limited to people on $15,000 incomes or less, the obvious conclusion must be that for these people repayments must be unacceptably high as a percentage of income, or that the government repayments subsidy must be very large indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look more closely at the 100 per cent mortgage insurance concept. While no deposit 100 per cent mortgages assist home buyers to bridge the deposit gap, repayments on a typical house would represent a prohibitively high proportion of low income earners' incomes. For example, a 100 per cent conventional mortgage on a $80,000 house would require monthly repayments of $1,083. Low income borrowers with no deposit-that is, with 100 per cent mortgages-could be forced to pay well above 25 to 30 per cent of their income in repayments. To give a very specific example, for a first home buyer in Sydney buying a medium priced house for $117,000 on no deposit at 15.5 per cent interest over 30 years, the monthly repayments would be about $1,526 or about 70 per cent of average weekly earnings before tax. </PARA>
<PARA> That is far too high to be contemplated in any realistic government policy and makes nonsense of the Opposition's policy pronouncements on housing, which are fairly vague at this stage. Mortgage insurance might be very useful to the lender but is not of much use to the borrower faced with these sorts of repayments. The Government recognises that there is a problem, but sees the nature of the problem differently from the Opposition. Firstly, it recognises that this is a supply side problem, and it must be dealt with in economic terms that address that reality. Secondly, it recognises the complexity of the housing question in what is, as I have said, a rapidly changing society with different values from the stereotypical values that are presented in the document that I referred to before, Future Directions. </PARA>
<PARA> Its response is measured and appropriate, and contains essentially two elements. The first is that land is to be released. This was announced before the Premiers Conference as an offer of goodwill to show that the Commonwealth Government is not simply going to sit back and avoid any responsibility. I must say that I am a little amused at some of the implications of what the Opposition has been saying, because it seems to propose giving the Commonwealth Government an awful lot more power in this question of housing than its States rights attitude would normally allow it to support and which it demonstrated in referendums such as those we have just had. </PARA>
<PARA> Housing is essentially a State problem. We recognise that. We recognise that we are limited in what we can do about it. Other than just adjusting the broad economy or doing such things as releasing land, we can do what the Commonwealth Government often does, and that is to assist State governments by means of exhortation, by means of drawing them in and trying to develop, in consultation some sorts of creative solutions to what are pressing and difficult problems. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the Government's response is, I believe, a measured and appropriate one, comprising two elements. The first is the releasing of land. It needs to be said that this is no mean offer to the States. The land that we are talking about releasing is equivalent to 15 new suburbs and will go a long way towards overcoming one of the problems on the supply side, and that is the shortage of land. The second, of course, is encouraging by means of the Premiers Conference and by other means at the Government's disposal creative ways of providing the changes that are needed in the approaches that governments are taking to housing, recognising that we are a rapidly changing society. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, we need to recognise that demands are no longer uniform or stereotyped. They are very varied, in fact. The quarter-acre block is by no means a universal desire. It might be widespread, but attitudes are rapidly changing. Many people I know would far prefer to live close to the city in smaller apartment units where they have manageable gardens and are able to use public transport. This is a growing trend in the larger cities but even in my city of Perth there is a great pressure on governments, particularly at the State and local level, for that sort of housing. Unfortunately, in a lot of the things that local governments are doing I do not see any attempts being made to meet those sorts of changing and specialised demands. Paddy McGuinness in this morning's Australian drew attention to the fact that the biggest failure in the area of creative solutions to the housing problem is at a local government level-not at a Federal or State government level. That is where the creativity is needed. So it may ultimately be that, as part of this debate that we are having across the nation on housing, we need to draw in local government and try to get it exposed to some of the ideas that we are talking about here and the ideas that I hope the Premiers Conference will address. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to recognise also that we are an ageing society with a growing number of single parent families and families of a smaller size than they formerly were. So changes are occurring there. The housing needs of those various groups are quite different from the housing needs of the stereotypical family in Future Directions outside the front of their quaint and outmoded mansion with their FJ Holden beside it. It is all idealised and nice, and I can understand how the Liberal Party hopes that it will have the public relations effect of making people feel soft and mushy about its policies. But I think people are a little wiser and they will want to see some substance there before they are prepared to change their vote. </PARA>
<PARA> We need also to recognise that as a result of all these things, our lifestyles and housing needs are changing rapidly. Unlike the Opposition, I welcome the Premiers Conference to discuss the housing question. I do not shy away from the fact that we have a problem, but I do not believe that we will solve that problem by the sorts of nonsensical solutions or the vague generalisations that I have heard from the Opposition benches. I think we will solve these problems by hard-headed, economic, rational decisions, on the one hand, and some divergent creative thinking, on the other hand, to try to meet the changing demands of a very rapidly changing society which the Opposition just does not seem to want to face. As I have said, I welcome the Premiers Conference to discuss the housing question. I trust that it will put aside political point-scoring and make a genuine attempt to meet some of those creative needs that I have talked about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in support of the urgency motion which is in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA> The need for the Government to change its policies which are depriving increasing numbers of young Australians of the opportunity to own their own homes. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a self-evident truth. Nothing that Government speakers have said so far denies the fact that an increasing number of young Australians are being deprived of the opportunity to own their own homes. That point has been conceded effectively by every Government speaker. The only point on which they are in disagreement with us is the manner of resolving that problem. The last speaker, Senator Beahan, admitted that we have a problem. It is a massive, mounting problem that strikes at the very heart of one of the major beliefs that all Australians have-that is, that they are entitled to own their own homes. It is an entitlement that this Government is destroying by a deliberate set of massively high interest rate policies which it is using to try to resolve the economic problems it has created for this country. The Government's policy of high interest rates is a deliberate economic policy and that policy is playing a major role in pricing Australians out of the housing market and forcing Australians out of their homes. </PARA>
<PARA> The interesting thing that the Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, said was that this motion-which on the Government's own admission and, in effect, from its own speakers, is basically right; young Australians are being deprived of the opportunity of owning their own homes-was simply a political stunt. Of course, the reality is that the only political stunt on today is the so-called housing summit. It is a stunt that has been put on after the latest inflation figures showed that Mr Keating was wrong again. We have continually seen Mr Keating being wrong in all his Budget forecasts ever since he lost his previous economic adviser, Professor Barry Hughes, who had the good sense at Budget time to say that the Treasurer was going to be wrong on all these matters. Of course, Professor Hughes was exactly right, along with the Opposition, which also indicated that all those forecasts were absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple reality is that the recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying a home beyond the reach of most Australian families. Since last June savings bank home mortgage interest rates have risen from 13.5 per cent to a record 15.5 per cent and are expected to go even higher. While the phoney housing summit called by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) today in Canberra avoids dealing with the real housing crisis, there has been a genuine discussion of the real issues going on in Sydney. It was a protest rally in Martin Place, appropriately enough outside the Reserve Bank of Australia. That meeting did deal with the major issue which speakers here from the Government have ducked and avoided and which the Prime Minister is ducking and avoiding at the so-called housing summit, and that issue is the Government's huge and deliberate policy of massive interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> I can assure Senator Cook that that rally will receive far more publicity in Sydney, where people recognise the threat to their homes of this massive high interest rate policy, than Senator Cook's pathetic contribution to this debate. The rally reflects the growing across the board anger at the way interest rates are killing off home ownership hopes of so many Australians, apart from lowering everyone's general standard of living. That rally, organised by the Australian Small Business Association and held in Sydney at lunchtime, is the first stage of a major campaign against high interest rates involving, ASBA says, a nationwide petition to the Federal Parliament so that the Australian people can give the Hawke Government a clear warning that excessive and damaging dependence on a high interest rate policy will not be tolerated, especially in an election year. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times. Many of them will never pay off their mortgage and will go further and further into debt under these high interest rates unless the Hawke Government stops this damaging and offensive policy. But the trouble is that the Hawke Government's present policy is to keep interest rates high and possibly push them even higher to try to fix up the mess it has made of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Today's housing summit in Canberra is a farce. It is not aimed at solving the real home ownership disaster of record interest rates. The Hawke Government simply does not want more Australians buying their own homes. I stress that: it is not the Hawke Government's policy at the moment to want Australians to buy their own homes. That aspiration to buy one's own home is totally in conflict with the economic policies of the Hawke Government at the moment. Mr Ross Gittins explained in the Sydney Morning Herald yesterday that increased home ownership conflicts with the economic policies of trying to dampen things down. So the Hawke Government will continue to do what it can, through record interest rates, to dampen down demand for housing. `Dampen down' means in effect to pour cold water on the hopes of Australian families of owning their own homes. That is what dampening down means-pouring cold water on the proper aspirations of all Australians, particularly those young Australians seeking to have a home of their own for their families. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government has deliberately chosen high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon to deal with our balance of payments and inflation crises. Mr Hawke himself has warned that interest rates will stay high-of course they could even go higher-until the economic crisis is resolved. Six weeks ago Mr Hawke said, `I don't think there's any purpose in holding a national housing summit', even though official and private surveys showed the extent of the housing crisis. But two weeks later he called the summit simply as a political stunt to shift the blame for the latest disastrous inflation figures onto Sydney's high house prices instead of his Government's failed economic policies. The most important causes of the housing crisis-particularly huge interest rates-are not even on the agenda for today's housing summit that Government speakers have pretended is addressing the main issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Who are the people being hurt by huge interest rates? It goes across the whole spectrum. It involves not just the home seekers, people who want to buy a home and are confronted with 15.5 per cent interest rates for building society and savings bank loans; people with existing mortgages who bought their home particularly in the last 12 months when interest rates were down to 13.5 per cent are suddenly finding that they face a far bigger mortgage interest bill than they believed they would. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at home seekers, who are being priced out of the market. They would face monthly mortgage repayments far beyond their earning capacity simply to buy an average home. For example, the repayment would be $1,320 a month-that is, $308 a week-on a 15.5 per cent, 25-year savings bank mortgage of $100,000, which by the way is about $154 a month more than it would have been last June. The only families who can afford that, according to affordability surveys based on 25 per cent of family income, would be those Australians earning more than $63,000 a year. That is way above the average Australian family's income. Yet an average Sydney home now costs $160,000. Therefore, the average Sydney new home buyer would need a mortgage of at least $100,000. The fact is that unless one is earning $63,000 a year one cannot afford to get a mortgage to buy an average Sydney home. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent home buyers with mortgages also face this terrible problem because their mortgages were taken out at lower interest rates and they now face either huge increases in monthly repayments or the extension of their loans. They will never own their own home. For example, the interest-only cost of $100,000 mortgage at 13.5 per cent taken out last June is about $1,125 a month, which is well covered by the monthly repayments of $1,166. But at 15.5 per cent-the new Hawke rate-the interest-only cost rises to almost $1,300 a month, or almost $130 a month more than the monthly repayment rate if it were maintained and the length of the loan extended. This means that after a year of repayments in which the home owner has paid $14,000 in mortgage costs, he would end up a further $1,500 in debt and would never own his own home-that is, unless interest rates fell or he eventually faced up to huge rises in his monthly repayments. </PARA>
<PARA> Most home owners with mortgages have been temporarily protected from the full impact of the Government's high interest rate policies by banks and building societies, which hope that the problem will go away sooner or later. But borrowers will have to pay the full bill sooner or later. Relatively few home owners with mortgages have been hit with increased monthly mortgage repayments that fully reflect the Hawke Government's huge interest rate rises. Instead, the banks and building societies have hidden the impact of higher interest rates by extending the length of the loan. In other words, the Government should be very grateful to the banks and building societies for protecting so many Australians from the harsh and immediate reality of these hugh interest rate rises. But they cannot do that forever. </PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile Australian home owners are going further and further into debt. Lenders are not increasing monthly repayments because thousands of Australians would be forced out of their homes if repayments matched the interest rate rises. The banks and building societies unfairly cop much of the flak from this, instead of the people who are directly responsible-this Hawke Government. The Hawke Government is entirely to blame for this disaster. It is a disaster not only in economic terms but also in social terms. The Marriage Guidance Council, for example, has made the point very strongly that the number of people seeking guidance due to the housing crisis is putting a strain on the Council's resources. Soaring house prices and interest rates have taken a heavy toll on marriages. </PARA>
<PARA> The crisis facing housing has been caused largely by this Government. Certainly the interest rate crisis has been entirely created by this Government. This Government must cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead must use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market and many Australians out of their homes, so that the traditional right of ownership is returned to average Australian families. I have great pleasure in supporting the urgency motion. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Question No. 575 has already been answered, in general terms, by a response to a question without notice asked by Senator Sanders on 30 September 1988 (see Senate Hansard dated 30 September 1988, pp. 1135-36). A more detailed response to Question No. 575 is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The fishing methods employed in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) tuna fishery are the most serious cause of marine mammal mortality in the world. Since the inception of the fishery in 1959, it has been estimated that more than 6 million dolphins have been killed as a result of purse seine fishing for yellowfin tuna which swim beneath and behind schools of dolphins. Incidental deaths of dolphins for the years to 1983 to 1987 reportedly have been 24,000, 29,400, 56,700, 129,500 and 115,000 respectively.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Federal Government has, through its diplomatic missions abroad, expressed its concern to all Governments whose fishing fleets are involved in the incidental dolphin kill. This concern was also raised at a meeting between the then Foreign Minister, Mr Hayden, and the Foreign Minister of Mexico, Mr Sepulveda, held in Canberra, on 27 July 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Federal Government believes that the incidental dolphin kill would not cease or be reduced simply by banning the import of yellowfin tuna caught in the ETP. The most likely outcome of any such ban would, in fact, be economic hardship for blameless parties, particularly the less developed countries in which most of the world's tuna is processed. Moreover, it is almost impossible to determine whether or not tuna processed outside Australia has come from the ETP tuna fishery due to the industry practice of mixing together the tuna caught from various tuna fisheries throughout the world.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Federal Government has, in addition to the representations referred to above, expressed in general terms at the 40th meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) (Auckland 30 May-3 June 1988) its concern at the incidental dolphin kill. The Federal Government will continue to use diplomatic channels in its attempt to bring about a cessation or reduction of the incidental dolphin kill.</PARA>
<PARA> The concern of the Federal Government reflects its policy of seeking protection for all cetaceans (dolphins, porpoises and whales) worldwide. It is not possible for Australia to directly enforce this policy in external waters such as the ETP. In Australian waters, however, cetaceans are protected by the Whale Protection Act 1980 which prohibits the killing, taking, injuring or interference with any cetacean (including dolphins). The Act recognises, however, that in licensed commercial fishing operations cetaceans may be unintentionally killed or captured. The Act specifies that in these circumstances, captured cetaceans must be released immediately and that any incident of a cetecean being taken, killed or injured must be reported to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories as soon as practicable.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="439" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Australia's aid program to Fiji for 1988/89 is budgeted at $22 million. This is made up of two components; the regular aid program of $12 million and an additional ``one off'' $10 million special assistance program. The regular program is being implemented in accordance with priorities set by the Government of Fiji and the Australian Government and concentrates on projects of benefit to the entire Fiji community including the development of public utilities, agriculture, training and staffing assistance and small grants for village level development.</PARA>
<PARA> A phased implementation of the special assistance program was announced on 22 November 1988 with initial expenditure of $4.84 million. The package is directed specifically at the most obvious and urgent humanitarian needs of the community in Fiji and has a particular emphasis on health, education and welfare. The special assistance program will be reviewed again in early 1989 to consider whether implementation of the $5.16 million balance of the program is feasible and warranted.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There has been a change in the amount and nature of Australian aid to Fiji since the military coups in 1987. In summary Australia's aid to Fiji for F/Y 1986/87 was programmed at a level of $14 million and concentrated on the agriculture, fisheries, engineering and welfare sectors. As a result of the freeze put on new aid activities following the first coup actual expenditure for 1986/87 totalled $11 million.</PARA>
<PARA> After the second coup in September 1987 all aid activities were terminated with the exception of sponsored students studying in Australia. Following the return to civilian government in Fiji certain activities which focused on support for disadvantaged groups, rural people, health services and training, were resumed, and expenditure for F/Y 1987/88 totalled $11,050,000. The answer to (1) sets out the current situation concerning the amount and nature of Australia's aid to Fiji.</PARA>
<PARA> The change in Australia's aid activities in Fiji since the coups reflects the Australian Government's concern that the aid program:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) benefits all the peoples of Fiji regardless of their ethnic origin.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) focuses on activities that are not directly or indirectly of a military nature nor provide support for military activities.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Australian Government deplored both Fiji coups and took action to suspend the provision of aid to Fiji (with the exception of training assistance). However on the return to civilian government in Fiji selected aid activities were resumed in early 1988, as outlined in (2).</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government has a firm and continuing commitment to a constructive relationship with Fiji and day to day dealings are an important aspect of continuing to rebuild the relationship. The reinstatement of the bilateral aid program is an important part of this on going process.</PARA>
<PARA> The interim Fiji Government has given firm assurances that equipment and materials supplied under the Australian program will not be diverted from intended purposes nor used to assist military activities in any way. The Australian Embassy in Suva monitors closely the implementation of Australian aid programs.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) In view of advice from the United Nations Information Office in Sydney that the organisation has no permanent contingency fund to grant immediate financial relief in the event of large-scale natural disasters, can Australia use its diplomatic and political influence within the United Nations to initiate a permanent contingency fund.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Is it appropriate to suggest that member nations should contribute according to their means.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) In my view the concept of a permanent contingency fund for disaster relief under the auspices of the United Nations is not a practicable one.</PARA>
<PARA> In the event of large scale disasters donors, including Australia, would like to have the choice of whether to make a contribution, the amount and the form of that relief, and the channel through which it should be provided in order to gain recognition for the contribution and ensure that it is used effectively.</PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore unlikely that such a proposal would attract the necessary universal support from the international community.</PARA>
<PARA> The United Nations, in particular through the Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Co-ordinator (UNDRO), does provide funding for an immediate, though limited, response to natural disasters. The information reports prepared and circulated by UNDRO during the initial emergency phase assist donors in determining the appropriate level of response required.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) and (2) In my address to the Ideas Centre in Sydney on 17 November 1988, I expressed a desire to see a significant movement in the ODA/GNP ratio towards 0.4 per cent within the next few bud- gets, a difficult achievement under the current tight budgetary constraints. I did not intend the 0.4 per cent figure to be interpreted in terms of either a minimum or maximum goal.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) With respect to the Parliamentary Brief of 24 November 1988, published by the Australian Council for Overseas Aid which is the co-ordinating body for about 80 organisations working in the field, has Australia fallen well behind comparable countries, such as Canada, France, the Netherlands and the Scandinavian nations, in its level of aid funding to less fortunate countries.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Has Australia now been overtaken by Italy in donating aid, as expressed in terms of a percentage of Gross Domestic Product, and is Japan now the world's largest aid donor.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Are figures available to the Australian Government on the aid levels provided by these countries in comparison with Australia; if so, what are they.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="441" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="QLD" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) According to the 1988 Annual Report by the Chairman of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of OECD, Australia's level of official development assistance (ODA) in calendar year 1987 was 0.33 per cent of GNP which was only slightly below the ratio of total ODA to total GNP for all DAC member countries (0.35 per cent in 1987).</PARA>
<PARA> However, some caution should be used in interpreting aid statistics published by the DAC. The DAC figures are compiled on a calendar year rather than financial year basis. The difficulty for Australia and other donors who report on a financial year basis is that the DAC figures are often distorted by the bunching of expenditure in one or another calendar year. The DAC figures do not reflect recent changes in Australian aid outlays announced in the 1988-89 budget. The 1988-89 budget provides for overseas aid outlays of $1,093.5m, an increase in real terms of 1.2 per cent on the previous financial year. Australia's overseas aid outlays for 1988-89 are expected to reach 0.36 per cent of GNP, slightly above the ratio of total DAC ODA to total DAC GNP.</PARA>
<PARA> Also there are two different methods of measuring official development assistance, either by an encashment or deposit basis. The difference relates to the method of recording certain contributions to international financial institutions. Some contributions are made in the form of promissory notes deposited in a bank and upon which the recipient institution can draw when it requires the funds.</PARA>
<PARA> The contribution may be counted as an aid flow at the time of the deposit of the promissory note in the bank (called the deposit method) or when the institution draws on the promissory note (known as the encashment method). Australia adopts the encashment approach for most reporting purposes whereas the DAC uses the deposit method for reporting international ODA statistics.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) According to the 1988 DAC Chairman's Annual Report, Italy's ODA/GNP ratio has fallen from 0.40 per cent in 1986 (lower than the Australian ODA/GNP ratio in 1986 of 0.47 per cent) to 0.35 per cent (slightly higher than the Australian ODA/GNP ratio in 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> In his 1988 Annual Report, the Chairman of the DAC stated that Japan was likely to become the largest DAC donor in either 1988 or 1989.</PARA>
