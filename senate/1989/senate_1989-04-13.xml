<PARA> Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1988-89, together with Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2), which I shall introduce shortly, comprise the additional estimates for 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> In these Bills, Parliament is asked to appropriate moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures additional to the appropriations made for 1988-89 under Appropriation Acts (Nos. 1 and 2) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> These additional appropriations are required to meet commitments that have been approved by the Government since the Budget as well as requirements of an on-going nature. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal factors underlying the requirements include certain unavoidable cost and price increases and other parameter changes since the Budget was prepared. Although the Budget figuring contained allowances for prospective wage and salary increases, those amounts were not then appropriated, and funds are now required to meet the impact of the national wage case decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the additional appropriations in the three additional Estimates Bills totalling $683.9m, $609.9m is sought in Appropriation Bill No. 3, $68.4m in Appropriation Bill No. 4 and $5.7m in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill No. 2. </PARA>
<PARA> These amounts are offset in part by savings in the appropriations made by Appropriation Acts (Nos. 1 and 2) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act, 1988-89 reflecting the Government's continued determination to improve the efficiency of ongoing programs. These savings, amounting to $425.7m are detailed under the relevant appropriation headings in the document, ``Statement of savings expected in annual appropriations'', which has been distributed to senators. In addition, a clause which has the effect of reducing an appropriation for the Defence Service Homes Corporation made by Appropriation Act (No. 2) by $40.5m is included in Appropriation Bill (No. 4).</PARA>
<PARA> After allowance for this reduction and prospective savings, the appropriations now sought represent a net increase of $217.8m in expenditures financed from annual appropriations. As a proportion of total estimated outlays-encompassing both annual and standing appropriations-this increase amounts to 0.3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I now outline some of the main areas in respect of which the Government has found it necessary to seek additional provisions in the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1988-89 to meet expenditure for the ordinary annual services of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> One hundred and thirty million dollars is included to cover the costs of the national wage case. Other significant amounts provided in the running costs appropriations include $35m for early retirement; these funds have been `borrowed' by departments and agencies under the negative carryover provisions of the running costs appropriations. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the defence portfolio, gross additional estimates of $241.2m are sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 3), significantly offset by savings of $145.5m giving a net increase of $95.7m in Consolidated Revenue Fund expenditures. </PARA>
<PARA> The gross figures included $122m for running costs, reflecting the impact of the national wage case and other awards on civilian and defence personnel salaries and allowances; a provision of $14.9m for redundancies; and $20.6m increase in the provision for fringe benefits tax. Other costs of $47.7m not provided for at Budget time are associated with the establishment of Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd. The additional funding of $9.1m provided for defence housing, largely reflects increases in market rents to be paid by defence to the Defence Housing Authority. In summary, and taking account of all transactions contributing to the defence function, total defence outlays are estimated to increase by $79.6m. </PARA>
<PARA> Appropriation Bill (No. 3) also provides $50m for the Australian Trade Commission to meet eligible grants under the Export market development grant scheme. The additional funds are estimated to be sufficient to enable settlement of all grants that are expected to be processed and hence payable by 30 June. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

The proposed appropriations are needed to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures for which provision was not made in that Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The additional appropriations are sought to meet certain cost and price increases which have occurred since the Budget and other requirements which the Government has considered it appropriate to meet this financial year. Areas where significant increases are sought over amounts provided in Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1988-89 are the provision of $9.1 million under the Department of Administrative Services for Buildings and Works-Departmental, which principally relates to the Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney Commonwealth office projects; an amount of $10.0 million under the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of which $7.3 million is a contribution to the United Nations Transitional Advisory Group, and $2.2 million is for costs associated with the United Nations Iran/Iraq Military Observer Group; and $8.6 million under the Department of Primary Industries and Energy for the Commonwealth/Tasmania forest industry package which includes an ex gratia payment to the Tasmanian Government following the decision on World Heritage nomination for the Lemonthyme and Southern Forest areas of Tasmania.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In April, I thank the honourable senator. I want to get it right. There is nothing that can be construed from the Treasurer's statement, when he refers to past tightening of fiscal and monetary policy, that there will be no further tightening of either of those policies if it becomes necessary. But the Government does not believe that it will become necessary because it is already considered that demand in the Australian economy is slowing. It has been made clear all along that each of those policy weapons will be used if we have to achieve a slower rate of growth than is now anticipated.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is addressed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, concerns two notable omissions from last night's economic statement, namely, the failure to address interest rates as they relate to home loans and the failure to move to encourage savings. In view of the Treasurer's concern, when in his expenditure cutting mode, about the level of savings in Australia, the Economic Planning Advisory Council's observation in December last year that `without a significant improvement in the incentive for savers framework private saving is unlikely to make a major contribution to the further adjustment in domestic savings that is needed', and Senator Button's own statement as reported recently, `I said the other day that I think we ought to do something about savings. I think we've got to look at that and I think we probably will', why has the Government taken no action to encourage savings, for example, by exempting from tax some of the interest people earn, or to protect home buyers from the likelihood of further interest rate rises, for example by introducing some form of tax deductability for mortgage repayments?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1499" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did say something about the desirability of doing something about the savings ratio, I think about three months ago. That was before the publication of the national accounts figures which showed an improvement in the savings ratio, the household savings ratio increasing by 9.9 per cent and reaching its highest level since the December quarter of 1981. Those figures were published last week or the week before. That is encouraging. In regard to the first part of the question, which relates to interest rates, Senator Haines seems to have been labouring under a misunderstanding for the last few months about the purpose of monetary policy in reducing the levels of demand. One area where there has been excessive demand, of course, has been the housing sector. We will not be embarking on any funny little scheme which might emanate from the Democrats or somewhere else to distort that process.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I wish to ask a supplementary question. Is the Minister saying that savings are now sufficiently high that there is no need for people to curb their expenditure, as the Treasurer has been demanding of them in recent months? Further, is the Minister therefore also going to recommend that the recently reintroduced negative gearing capacity for investors in the housing market be removed to further curb housing expenditure?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the second part of the question is no. I cannot answer the first part of the question as to whether savings in the community are sufficiently high. I do not know what the optimum level of savings in the community is for the most desirable results. What I did say was that there has been a considerable improvement in the household savings ratio, according to the national accounts figures.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1G4">Senator DEVEREUX</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Resources. Is the Minister aware that an outbreak of foot and mouth disease could cost Australian agricultural production in the order of $1.6 billion per year, with an estimated cost of eradication of around $4 billion per year for some years? What sort of mechanism has the Government got in place to allay fears about the possible introduction of these diseases? What is the Government doing to ensure that first time arriving passengers and, indeed, returning passengers are made aware of the importance of quarantine controls?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1500" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="RESOURCES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the Government is concerned that Australia, as a country with a very healthy farm stock and agricultural base, could disrupt that base quite considerably, affecting our trade balance and the standard of living of all Australians, if we did not ensure that we protected this country from the importation, either accidentally or deliberately, of exotic pests and diseases. Senator Devereux has referred to foot and mouth disease. An item as innocuous as a pork sausage brought into Australia without proper quarantine screening could, through the introduction of foot and mouth disease, lay waste to our entire pastoral industry. It is estimated that an outbreak of this disease in Australia would cost about $1.6 billion per year, with flow-on effects of eradication and reconstruction costing the national economy over $4 billion per year for several years. That is just one type of disease. There are other diseases. Screw-worm fly is a disease that could have a similar effect to foot and mouth disease if it came into Australia. Newcastle disease could destroy our poultry flock. There are diseases that affect grapes, wheat and citrus that would have a devastating effect on our position as a trading nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) conducted research during 1988 on the public perceptions of quarantine in this country and found that there is negligible awareness of the range of quarantine services provided in Australia by the Quarantine and Inspection Service. Knowledge of its existence virtually does not penetrate the public consciousness at all. It must be observed that no amount of vigilance or expertise on the part of the officers of the AQIS can protect us from a quarantine breach in the face of this apparent public apathy. Thus it is that the Quarantine Service has embarked upon a series of advertisements to try to lift public understanding of what the potential threat to Australia is, not just in economic terms but, as well, in environmental terms, if any of these diseases should pass the barrier. Honourable senators would have seen some of these advertisements in the newspapers recently. Mr President, I display for the Senate one of them. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>Want it so bad you'd kill for it?</PARA>
<PARA>This is an advertisement that refers to the potentially damaging effects of sausages, meats and cheeses that could be host to the exotic diseases I referred to or woodcarvings and other artefacts that may be purchased in foreign countries and brought into Australia that could be hosts to other sorts of diseases that would affect our housing or our forests.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that point since you raise it, because it is a very good point. There is the question of what flowers can be brought into this country that would affect our population and industry as well. All those things are aimed at encouraging ordinary Australians to take responsibility themselves, as travellers coming back to this country, to work with our Quarantine and Inspection Service to prevent the importation of those diseases. There is some lightness being made of this in the chamber. I am terribly disappointed about that, because it is an extremely serious thing. One mistake in this area can be of devastating cost to the economy. I hope that the lightness that is being made of this by Opposition senators will not continue in their more sober moments and that they will be examples to the rest of the country of how we, as a trading nation, should conduct ourselves.</PARA></TALK.START>

Indeed, I understand that he became quite passionate about it. Sure, we could put out a forecast. Last night we could have said that we expect inflation to be 3 per cent next year. If we did that, we would have been as believable as Senator Stone was when he said, in November 1987, that there was absolutely no doubt that there would be a worldwide recession in 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From time to time enthusiasts advocate that we vote via computer in order to speed up election counts. It is probably overlooked by many of those enthusiasts that, in countries where computers are used overseas, the first past the post system applies. That is a fairly simple system. It is a little more complex in the Senate voting system and even a little more complex again in the modified d'Hondt system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Part of the difficulty is the initial investment. The Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform, some years ago, looked at the question of costs. Evidence was given that, because we have 8,000 polling booths, the cost would be $40m to $50m. That is based on a simple first past the post system. The more sophisticated software and other requirements to have those things in polling booths make it basically an uneconomic proposal.</PARA>
<PARA> A more novel suggestion of course is that we do not have a race meeting on one particular day of the year and we use the totalisator agency boards (TABs) around the country in which to vote. There are some difficulties with that. First, TABs tend to cluster where the punters are; not where the electors are. Secondly, I have noticed, at least in New South Wales-only by driving past them-many of the TABs are in pubs. I do not know that we necessarily want people going into pubs to vote, especially if they are of the more puritan strain.</PARA>

<PARA> After the New South Wales election results had taken a little while to be counted, Mr Nick Greiner got impatient, as people often do, and said, `Maybe we should computerise'. A team that he sent overseas, which included the current Electoral Commissioner and a previous one, investigated this matter and came up with pretty much the same conclusion as everyone else; that, at this stage, computerised voting is not practical and is not a wise investment of public money.</PARA>
<PARA> The probable answer is to make the voting system less complicated rather than go to computerisation. That is something we will have to look at seriously. There will come a time-either in the Senate or in the d'Hondt system-when it will take more than two months to count. We should take that into account before we pass legislation here to make voting systems more complex.</PARA>

If people, including Senator Baume, want some assistance in evaluating last night's statement, let me say that it produced enormous tax cuts and a very strong family package. It produced considerable concessions for pensioners. It leaves a very significant surplus such as this country has not had for 30 years, I suspect. It came about after four years of falling Government spending. Government spending has been lower than at any time during the period of the previous Government. There was never a surplus under the previous Government.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What is the typical Australian family? I am not sure, so I will give about three examples of representative Australian families. I take it that a family, by definition, comprises at least one parent and at least one child. For a family comprising two children and two parents, but with a single income of $24,000 a year, which is a little below average weekly earnings, the gains from the increase in family allowances, dependent spouse rebate and the changes to the tax rate scale will give them an extra $23.50 a week. As the Treasurer said last night, a dollar in tax cuts or, in this context, one should add tax-free payments, is worth more than a dollar in increased wages. For that family to get the same net benefits from a wage increase, a wage increase of $40 a week would have been required. A very important component of the statement last night, as Senator Button said, is that, as a result of last night's statement, the potential wages explosion that could have occurred because of the very strong demand in the economy has now been headed off. The reason that it will be headed off is that that single income family in receipt of less than average weekly earnings, with two kids, is getting, because of last night's announcement, the equivalent of a $40 a week wage increase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will give very briefly a couple more examples. For a two-income family with two children, with the principal income earner on an income of $24,000 and the secondary income earner on $10,000-making $34,000 in total-the net increase, because of the tax cut and family allowance increase, would be $23 a week; the equivalent of a $36 a week wage increase, a wage increase distributed in that same proportion between the two income earners. For a sole parent family with two children on an income of $24,000 a year, the net increase would be $23.35 and the wage equivalent required to deliver that net income is almost $40 a week. I will give two other examples. For a single income family with two children and a dependent spouse on a low income-about the bottom of the award wage area-of $17,000 a year, the net increase will be almost $20 a week, or just over $28 a week in pre-tax terms.</PARA>

Since there are many average families under stress in Australia, who might be listening, with great interest, to the Minister's answer, he might turn to the average family, say, in New South Wales with an average mortgage.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said before, it is a bit difficult to say with any conviction what is average. We can work out an arithmetical mean. Senator Chaney has raised the question of people who are paying off housing mortgages. For a start such families are not average families or typical families-30 per cent of Australian families are renters; Another 30 per cent are outright owners; 40 per cent are paying off housing loans; and 60 per cent of that 40 per cent had loans prior to the deregulation of housing loan interest rates, in 1987, I think.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is certainly more than 50 per cent. They, of course, are not affected by recent interest rate changes. These are not average families or typical families: It is true that people who have recently taken out a housing mortgage loan, particularly those in Sydney where housing prices have escalated very rapidly, are having a struggle. It has always been the case that people who have just taken out a loan to buy their first house in the first few years of repaying that loan always have a bit of a struggle. There is nothing unusual about that. Because interest rates have been somewhat higher than normal in the last six months or so, they are having a bit more of a struggle. However, to such people last night's economic statement will provide them with significantly more disposable income in order to meet their obligations. The alternative to last night's statement would have been a wage explosion. The Opposition knows all about wages explosions. It presided over one in 1981 and 1982.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The importance of last night's statement is that, in essence, it is an historic announcement. It is one that this Government is extremely proud of. It is historic because it gives on-going benefits to most Australian families; it is historic because before last night no government and no parliament of this country had placed children first; and it is historic because we have done so. Not only have we done that but we are also committed to maintaining the value of payments to families with children. The basic strength of our commitment is that all child payments will be automatically adjusted for inflation. Whether it be the family allowance, family allowance supplements, additional pensions and benefits, the mothers/guardians allowance, the child disability allowance, double orphans pensions and multiple birth payments, they will all be automatically adjusted for inflation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a nation I think we like to pride ourselves on putting our children first. But I do not think we can fairly say that before last night's statement we have actually done so. Not only have we now achieved benchmarks but we have also indexed the child-related payments to ensure security and protection. We are the first government in the history of Australia to commit ourselves to maintaining the real value of payments of families with children.</PARA>
<PARA> In recent days the Opposition has made a number of claims that it is the party for ordinary families. But our performance can very easily be compared with that of the Opposition. In seven years in government the coalition made only one increase in the family allowance and that was in 1982 in a period of economic disaster. In this context, the Government's package is quite historic. It is historic because it is the largest increase in the family allowance in our history; it prevents the erosion of payments ever occurring again. But more importantly than that, it is part of this Government's long term commitment in this area, a commitment which was very well spelt out in Social Security Review Paper No. 1 in 1986. That paper committed this Government to achieving short term measures to accommodate people most in need and long term measures to restore fair income distribution to families with children and, more importantly, to protecting from inflation families with children.</PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the start, this is an historic package and we are proud of it. We have delivered in terms of achieving the benchmarks that we set out to achieve for low income families; we have delivered, as I said, because it is the biggest increase in family allowances in our country's history; and we have delivered in the sense that we are protecting child-related payments from inflation. In closing, I stress the point that all these achievements have been made in the context of a long term commitment by this Government to achieve protection and reform in this whole area.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lewis can make these comparisons at any time. Last year the Opposition was hot to trot on making comparisons between the inflation rate in Australia and the inflation rate in the United Kingdom. It has dropped off that this year because it does not serve its purpose. Last year it was also hot to trot on making comparisons in the inflation rate between Australia and the United States of America. It has dropped off that, too, because it does not suit it this year. Now the honourable senator asks me whether the rate of wage increases in Australia is higher than in Japan. I believe it is. But the wage outcome is sensible in the sense that it takes account of existing situations in Australia and does not ignore them, as the stupid wages outcome under his previous Government did in 1981 and 1982. They sent this country into a recession and sent hundreds of thousands of people on to the streets unemployed. That is the difference between a sensible wage outcome and a silly wage outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator wants to make comparisons in terms of wages, particularly in the manufacturing sector. It is true that the rate of growth may be higher than in Japan under this wage outcome. The fact of the matter is, however, that wages in manufacturing in this country are about one-third of what they are in Japan. If we have a competitive disadvantage against Japan, I do not believe it is because of wages; it is for a variety of other reasons in terms of management competence and a whole range of other issues-including productivity, which the honourable senator might like to ask me about.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get to my role. As for the Chairman of Noranda, he has been attempting, in the last week in particular, to cover up the history of intransigence that has marked his company's attitude to the Wesley Vale story. I want to quote what Premier Gray and his Minister, Mr Groom, had to say only a few weeks ago. On 1 February the Launceston Examiner reported the Premier as saying that the guidelines that his Government had developed for the Wesley Vale pulp mill were achievable and not for negotiation. The Premier accused the joint venturers of `holding a gun at the Government's head'. He questioned whether they were serious about the project. The next day the Deputy Premier in Tasmania, Mr Groom, went even further. According to a report in the Examiner on 2 February Mr Groom:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>suggested the developers were trying to sabotage the pulp mill, by employing tactics which he described-</PARA>
<PARA>that is Mr Groom, Senator Archer's man-</PARA>
<PARA>as ``extraordinary'' and an indictment on their bona fides.</PARA>
<PARA>The report stated that Mr Groom:</PARA>
<PARA>revealed that experts from the joint venture Canadian partner, Noranda, had told a full Cabinet meeting this month that the environment guidelines-NBH says can't be met-could in fact be met.</PARA>
<PARA>In case anyone wants to doubt the veracity of those reports in the Examiner, let me turn to the Hobart Mercury of the same day, 2 February, which carried a very similar report. Mr Groom accused the company of `underhand tactics'. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Groom would not specify what those tactics were, but said if the project was called off it would be for some reason other than the environmental guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA> ``I sense they are not particularly keen to get a result,'' he said.</PARA>
<PARA>That assumes greater significance now that the companies have walked away. I think the question to be answered is what really happened in the two days after the Tasmanian Premier, the Deputy Premier and the environment Minister, Mr Hodgman, all confirmed that the guidelines were achievable and were not for negotiation.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to that is pretty obvious. North Broken Hill and Noranda applied the corporate blowtorch and the Tasmanian Government went to water-a craven capitulation if ever there was one. Forget concerns for the environment, the fishermen and the farmers! Forty changes of definition were then made to the guidelines, all to suit the companies. No longer were these reinterpreted guidelines the toughest in the world. Senator Button, Mr Keating and I took all of 10 minutes to discover that in a meeting with the joint venturers when they admitted they could go further. That was not hard; they admitted the guidelines were not the toughest. They admitted there was better technology and they could go further. They just did not want to be required to do so. When Senator Archer talks about who is telling the truth let me say that on the record from the Tasmanian Premier and his Deputy Premier, it is obvious where the untruths were being told. It is also obvious where the truths were being told; they have only come from the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 18 October last year Senator Button announced a package to assist that mill. The Commonwealth always wanted to do that. It included confirmation that the project would qualify for accelerated depreciation and approval for the Tasmanian Government to borrow extra loan funds to pay for various infrastructure. There was an attempt by the Commonwealth to speed up the process by agreeing to the Commonwealth and Tasmania conducting the environmental impact study concurrently. The Commonwealth did all it reasonably could to get the project off the ground, but from the Tasmanian Deputy Premier's own lips came the words, `If the project does not proceed, it will not be because of tough environmental guidelines'. Maybe Noranda ought to be asked what the real agenda was. Was it the fact that in Canada the Government was closing in on it as well and it did not want tough guidelines here that may one day be imposed on it at home? Unfortunately I have sad news for it-the Canadian Government is catching up with it and tougher guidelines are on the way.</PARA>

Has the Minister seen the article in today's Sydney Morning Herald by Daryl Dixon which shows that some middle income taxpayers will need more than what the Government provided by last night's tax cuts merely to compensate for the impact of inflation since 1982-83?

I believe that is the basis of the Treasurer's statement, but I will check it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In closing, last night this Government announced the biggest tax cuts, the biggest family package in history, there were major concessions to pensioners, and we will still bring down a Budget surplus in excess of $5 billion. Until last year nobody in Australia very seriously contemplated there being a Federal Budget surplus. The reason that we have been able to do all those seemingly incompatible things is that we have kept expenditure nailed right down for four years-four years of falling Commonwealth Government expenditure, the sort of thing those opposite talk about and were never able to do.</PARA>

As I said in answer to Senator Puplick yesterday, on 11 July last year officials of my Department met representatives of the joint venturers. On 25 July last year again those officials met with the joint venturers and officials from the Tasmanian Government.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These were guidelines for the environmental impact statement. By the time the period of public review of the environmental impact statement closed in early December, it was clear that there were some major environmental questions that remained unanswered-not just to the Commonwealth, but at that time to the Tasmanian Government. On 7 December, after consultation with the Commonwealth, the Tasmanian Government wrote to North Broken Hill Peko Ltd outlining 85 matters which the State and Federal governments considered had either `been inadequately addressed or not addressed at all' in the environmental impact statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The joint venturers replied with a letter on 3 January and provided what could be termed answers in an addendum. I shall provide Senator Aulich with one example of just how inadequate these answers were. The joint venturers had been asked to outline the studies which would be done to determine the final design and location of the outfall site-not an unimportant or insignificant matter in this mill, given that the proposal was to dump 13 tonnes of organochlorins into the sea in Bass Strait at a point where there was very little tidal movement. It was a serious matter. The Government got a seven-word answer: The assumed depth is about 20 metres. That was the whole answer to that question about what studies would be done.</PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the letter that the Commonwealth sent to North Broken Hill on 8 February, we sought clarification again on what one could call some pretty important matters: dioxin emissions, chlorine dioxide substitution levels and the emission of odours. The Department asked for a response as soon as possible. That letter of 8 February was never answered. That was totally ignored. One wonders what sort of attitude is being displayed by the company when it ignores both the Tasmanian Government and the Commonwealth Government in the pursuit of their legitimate concerns. The joint venturers knew what information the Federal Government and the State Government required and simply refused to supply it. They admitted that the guidelines could be tougher. They did not want to accept either Government's right to impose those tougher guidelines on them. The companies and the Tasmanian Government simply did not take seriously the firm and proper process that was in place for assessing the project. The Commonwealth took the process seriously. I only wish that others involved in negotiations had taken it in a similarly serious vein.</PARA>

Major-General Sanderson's review is being coordinated with a second but interrelated review being conducted by Rear-Admiral Ralph. The aim of the Ralph review is to develop a case for submission to the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal seeking to address the compression of salaries to senior officers of lieutenant-colonel equivalent to major-general inclusive within current wage fixing principles. The case is to conform with the structural efficiency principle enunciated in the national wage case decision of 12 August 1988.

Since May 1987 there has been a reduction of eight Senior Executive Service positions in Defence, exclusive of the Government Aircraft Factory and the Williamstown dockyard, which have been severed from the Department.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>I shall make some very brief remarks because I know there is pressure of other business. In asking the Senate to take note of the report, I draw attention to the fact that the report is the result of nearly two years of work. There are 46 major recommendations. In my view, the report should be taken in conjunction, in many respects, with the report of the Committee that was tabled recently on Australia's overseas aid. There are in a sense cross-references in that area. I also draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that, in the near future, the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade will begin a reference on Australia's relations with Papua New Guinea, which is an ongoing area of the Committee's work generally with Australia and the South Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA> I also draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that the Committee had the opportunity in June of last year to visit eight countries in the South Pacific in 18 days. That delegation of some nine members plus the Secretary of the Committee was extremely worthwhile. The Committee appreciates the assistance the Australian Government gave in providing a plane to take us to some of the smaller countries of the South Pacific to make it an efficient trip as far as time was concerned. I believe that visit to those countries proved the advantage of standing committees being able to get first-hand experience. In major reports such as this, in the future, though it is obviously costly to the Parliament and the Government, those trips should be funded. I would point out that the trip was not a junket around the South Pacific. The Committee worked extremely hard in visiting those countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I place on record the appreciation of myself and, I am sure, other members of the South Pacific Subcommittee for the assistance of the secretariat of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, and in particular the Secretary, Joanne Towner, who worked very hard to put into some order all the many ideas and views that members of the Committee had, in helping to draft the report, and in her role as Secretary of the Committee in assisting in preparation for the visit to the South Pacific countries in June of last year.</PARA>
<PARA> I mention that, although under the Standing Orders the Subcommittee effectively goes out of existence with the tabling of this report. Members of the Committee, under another name or an informal description, will be visiting New Zealand and New Caledonia next week for a period of about eight days. Again, I think that the Parliament and the Australian Government, in providing the funds for that visit for the members of the Committee, will get very good value in further enhancing our contacts and relations with New Zealand and the developing situation for independence in New Caledonia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak to the motion that the Senate take note of the report. Whilst I do not intend to speak at length, as the Senate is pressed by its Estimates responsibilities, I think it is important to make a few points. The first is that I commend the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade as a whole for the work it has done in this regard. Of course, in doing so, I commend the staff, the officials and all of those who contributed by representation or otherwise to what I think is a most important reference work. I also concur with what Senator Schacht said, that the report ought to be read in conjunction with the previous report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on aid, and I commend the fact that the Committee is now going to consider Papua New Guinea (PNG) in greater depth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to me that in many ways the Committee is doing the work that the Government itself should have done. One sees in this report a detailed explanation of the problems that are facing the island states of the South Pacific, the problems in the relationship between Australia and those island states and the constructive attempt to put forward positive proposals and actions that Australia might take for the benefit of both the island states and us. That would be a useful tool at least for the next government if this Government is not prepared to take action. It is a matter of regret to me and the Opposition that the Government, even under the new Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), whose first trip was to the South Pacific, is not prepared to put down detailed statements in this chamber of its acknowledgment of the difficulties facing the island states and its proposals on what action should be taken to improve the situation. So I believe that this document produced by the Parliament will be of benefit to governments. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall that when this Government first came to office the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Hayden, said-and I was present at the speech he gave at the Australian National University-that the focus of the Government in foreign affairs would be on our own region. Of course, in practice, that was not the focus of the Government. It focused on the world stage, on the major international fora, and in many ways neglected the South Pacific region, which is obviously our most immediate concern and responsibility in international relations. There were signs at that time of growing problems within the region, problems which have now been detailed in many ways in this report by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. There were ongoing problems concerning health issues, educational inadequacies and poverty, all of which this Government should have been aware of. Equally, the signs were there of growing political strain. Frustrations had developed out of the fact that the states were now legally independent yet in many ways remained dependent, particularly upon Australia, and conflicts arose out of our failure to understand the need, in our education of them, for them to comply with our democratic institutions-the Westminster system and so forth=mand to balance that against their respective histories and cultures. I regret to say that these strains were ignored by this Government. It was a situation of benign neglect at best. </PARA>
<PARA> The position was even worse with Papua New Guinea. It went beyond benign neglect to actions that were positively taken to affect detrimentally the political and economic stability of that country. I refer, of course, to the decision of the Government in 1986 to slash unilaterally $10m off the agreed aid program between Australia and PNG just after that aid program had been renegotiated with reductions. So we saw a situation where PNG, our closest neighbour, had developed a loss of confidence in Australia which it was prepared to project internationally. I was present at a speech given in Washington DC where the Deputy Prime Minister of PNG said that he would not have expected that of Australia. The extent to which the island states were losing confidence in Australia and in what they thought was Australia's special relationship with them came through to me. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to benign neglect, we have to put this report into the context of the Government's ignorance of what was occurring in Fiji. The report focuses to some extent on Fiji, but in the case of Fiji the Australian Government was totally ignorant of the political developments as they were occurring and was unable to predict in any way the first coup. In fact, our head of mission was out of the country at the time. Then, of course, after receiving assurances from this Government that everything was going well, the second coup occurred. That was a major indictment, I would respectfully suggest, of this Government's intelligence resources and understanding of what was happening in the region. The Government had no idea-which is probably worse-of how to respond to the events. That demonstrated again how out of touch it had become. We found in the press that the Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, wanted to send troops into Fiji. Goodness only knows what the troops would have done when they got there-even if we had had the capacity to get them there, which we did not. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not seem to have understood the significance of the development of ethnic groups within the region. It dismisses the Melanesian spearhead group. But that group is evidence of growing ethnic solidarity and frustration by the island states with the big powers of the South Pacific Forum, the principal player within the forum being Australia, and with the paternalistic approach that the Government has shown. </PARA>
<PARA> I move to the difficulties that have come out of the Government's poor judgment of our relationship with France. There has been a refusal for a long time by this Government to recognise that France is a major player in the Pacific. One can say what one likes in the United Nations, but France is going to remain a major power and an influence upon peace, stability and economic development within the Pacific. It was continually condemned in relation to New Caledonia by this Government in a simplistic and very shallow way. The Government had to end up eating humble pie when it found, because of our economic strife, that there was no alternative but to reinstate uranium sales to France. Then the Government had to address how it would relate in a new relationship with France in the Pacific. What we had been saying all along was that if the Government had related to France in a more sensible and mature way we would have had a greater capacity to influence events in New Caledonia, particularly for the benefit of the Kanak people. Instead of that, we were in fact locked out of the debate by this Government's approach. </PARA>
<PARA> Continuing to put this report in its context, we then had the appointment of a new Foreign Minister, Senator Gareth Evans, and I very quickly welcome the fact that he chose to make his first trip as Minister to the South Pacific. But the Opposition was disappointed when he returned that he did not put down a statement in the Parliament but chose instead to speak to the foreign correspondents club in Sydney and tell them what had suddenly apparently become a newly thought out policy on the South Pacific. This was his policy that he called constructive commitment, a policy which is clearly a play on words on the Crocker American policy on South Africa of constructive engagement. However, apparently during the course of his trip around the South Pacific, Senator Evans decided that our new approach should be that of constructive commitment. The Opposition thought that he should have come into the Parliament and explained what he intended by that, how the policy would develop and how it would be of benefit to the island states and our relationship with the island states, But we were not afforded that courtesy. There is no evidence that that policy has been thought through. It seems to be just another example of `it seemed to be a good idea at the time'. After having got a copy of the speech Senator Evans gave in Sydney I was surprised but pleased to see that he was prepared to acknowledge his lack of knowledge of events in the South Pacific. What surprised me was an acknowledgment of the Government's failure to properly comprehend what was happening in the region. Senator Evans repeated the sort of assurances--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a disappointment. I stress again that this is a very important report in relation to a region that is critically important to Australia's interests. As Senator Harradine knows, by the time we come back in a fortnight, the Parliament will have moved on to new business and someone such as Senator Harradine, who has had a long involvement in a positive way in relation to the region, should have the opportunity to see the advice that we are giving to the Parliament and to respond to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will continue with what I was saying. I will not be too much longer. I was trying to compare the positive, constructive efforts of this Committee with the Government's neglect and failure in relation to the region. I am referring to the best information that I can get-Senator Evans does not report to the Parliament on these matters-and that is a speech he gave in Sydney in which he outlined the Government's new approach to the region: that of constructive commitment. In that speech he repeated the sort of undertakings that Mr Hayden gave some years before that there would be a focus by this Government on the region. He said that it is the most important international responsibility of Australia. He used the words `our most immediate priority' in his speech. All I can say to that is that we hope that in due course there will be much greater substance added to his rhetoric than we saw added to the rhetoric of his predecessor, Mr Hayden. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that this report helps the Government in its approach to Fiji. The Opposition is concerned that we see no signs of an improving situation in Fiji, whether it is looked at economically, politically or constitutionally. Honourable senators will remember the Government advising the Parliament that a new constitution would soon be enacted in Fiji. That new constitution has not come to pass and the situation remains as worrying to us as it was at the time of the unfortunate overthrow of democratic government. Senator Evans cancelled his visit to Fiji at the last moment when access was not given to its former Prime Minister. Of course, we all remember Mr Hawke saying that Australia would not be threatened in this way. Because of the inconsistencies we now do not know exactly what the Government's policy is on Fiji. Parts of an aid program were given on the basis of positive changes which were said to have occurred but which have not occurred. The other half of the aid has now not been given because the Government says that those positive changes have not occurred. Our approach to Fiji seems to be a mess. </PARA>
<PARA> Of greater concern-I hope that the Government will get some use and guidance out of this report-is Australia's approach to the problems that are occurring in Papua New Guinea (PNG). We are much more concerned than this Government-this is apparent from an answer that Senator Evans gave to a question of mine in the last few days-at events occurring in PNG. The concern on our part is that Australia is not using its best endeavours to assist continued economic and political stability in that country. Last year, after returning from a brief fact finding visit to PNG, I advocated that we could do more to help with the law and order position that the Government of PNG wanted; we could do more to help with economic development, particularly in legal ways-PNG was drafting a new mining Act. We have the experience to help in this regard. We could assist it with its tourism, help it to build its economic base and particularly be of much greater assistance in relation to education. These are positive programs that receive, I regret to say, no positive response from this Government. We are disappointed in the Government's record in relation to the Pacific states in our region. I hope the Government will read this report in relation to Fiji and Papua New Guinea and the problems in Vanuatu and Nauru, which this Government seems to be totally overlooking. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government needs any further help, I can only commend to it the Opposition's new foreign policy statement. Senator Evans, in answer to a dorothy dixer the other day, decided that he would have a bit of a go at our foreign policy. I presume that the Senate will extend to me the same courtesy. I will remind honourable senators of the key points in relation to the South Pacific, interestingly most of which have been developed in this Parliamentary Committee's report on the region. We are not the only ones who have recognised the shortcomings and are putting forward ideas. Upon coming to government, which does not seem to be far off, we will be examining the establishment of a South Pacific development bank to strengthen regional investment and economic cooperation. We will also be considering special programs of assistance for the smaller states. When Senator Harradine gets the opportunity to read this report, he will find that the Parliament says there should be special programs in relation to Kiribati and Tuvalu. </PARA>
<PARA> We will be working in close consultation with the island states to provide shared facilities for diplomatic representation in Canberra. Honourable senators know the diplomatic assistance that Australia has given under policy that was initiated by former Prime Minister Fraser to help with facilities for the island states in New York, in relation to the United Nations. We will also give support for regional networks concerned with information gathering on maritime surveillance, commercial use of the seabed, drugs and arms trafficking and terrorism. We will be moving to give increased training opportunities for island states officials, particularly in such areas as diplomacy, negotiations with foreign commercial enterprises, public administration and management, exploitation of ocean resources, parliamentary and legal processes, and encountering terrorism, drugs and arms smuggling. We will be upgrading our defence assistance programs to the South Pacific. We will be offering increased consultation, more frequent exchanges at ministerial and senior official levels, interchange of senior public servants, exchanges of parliamentary delegations and education and training programs. I commend the ideas and initiatives of the Opposition to the Senate. I thank the Senate for giving me the opportunity to speak to this most important report. </PARA>

The report relating to the Army's Logistics and Training Complex at Bandiana, Victoria, represents the first stage of a major redevelopment of this complex at an estimated cost of $68m at August 1988 prices. Phase A of stage 1 will commence in mid-1989, while phase B will commence in 1992-93, with completion of both phases scheduled for mid-1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In recommending the redevelopment to the Parliament the Committee has drawn attention to two matters which it believes require further examination by Defence and Australian Construction Services. </PARA>
<PARA> These are: the need for Defence to examine and review security arrangements at the Bandiana complex; and the need for Defence and Australian Construction Services to re-examine the location of the distribution centre as the Committee is concerned that it is proposed to be built over an existing water channel. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's report relating to the upgrade of living-in accommodation at HMAS Cerberus, Crib Point, Victoria, at an estimated cost of $15.7m at September 1988 prices is the second report the Committee has tabled this year relating to the Navy's main training establishment. The Committee's second report of 1989 related to the construction of new communications and recruit schools. The objective of this proposal is to upgrade accommodation buildings at HMAS Cerberus to provide a standard of living-in accommodation which is as close to current service scales and standards as the existing building layouts permit. The conversion of existing four-bed rooms to two single cabins will create a shortage of junior sailor accommodation which will be overcome by the construction of an additional junior sailor accommodation block. </PARA>
<PARA> The final report I have tabled relates to the development of RAAF Base, Wagga, New South Wales, at an estimated cost of $23.6m at April 1988 prices. RAAF Base Wagga is the RAAF's main base for technical training and the proposal reported on by the Committee allows for the construction of a number of new buildings, the refurbishment of a number of existing buildings and the upgrading of engineering services. In recommending the construction of the work in this reference the Committee has commented on a number of issues which require examination by Defence and Australian Construction Services. The Committee believes that Defence should commence negotiations with the State Rail Authority with the aim of resuming the rail easement through the base. The Committee is concerned regarding the location of the proposed fire station and the apparent lack of an adequate fire and emergency service to the airfield and has recommended that this matter be further examined. The Committee has also drawn attention to the fact that the flammable goods bulk store appears to be located too close to accommodation blocks and has recommended that either it be relocated or appropriate mounding and landscaping be provided. I commend the reports to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>The Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation was established by the Parliament on 17 October 1988 to inquire into and report on the 16 Bills that go to make up what is known as the corporations legislation package. Collectively, they encompass the regulation and operation of corporations and securities law in Australia. The Attorney-General, Mr Lionel Bowen, whose brainchild the Bills are, claims that they collectively comprise the largest single legislative package since Federation-some 1,200 pages of drafting by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. </PARA>
<PARA> These Bills were introduced into the Parliament in the House of Representatives on 25 May 1988, at the death knock of the conclusion of the autumn session. They were debated, if that is the right word, by the House of Representatives on 28 and 29 September 1988 and passed, along with no fewer than 280 amendments moved by the Government. The amended Bills were introduced into the Senate on 14 October 1988. They have not been debated here, pending completion and presentation of the Joint Select Committee's report. They are currently listed for debate in the next sitting week of the Senate, commencing 2 May. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Bills were introduced into the Senate, the Opposition sought to refer them to a joint committee with wide ranging terms of reference. That motion was defeated by the Government with the support of the Australian Democrats. Instead, the Senate approved more narrow terms of reference for the Committee. In the event, and for reasons explained in the report, the Committee decided not to take too narrow an approach to these terms. </PARA>
<PARA> The 16 Bills that were the subject of the Committee's inquiry comprise three principal Bills, the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) Bill, the Corporations Bill and the Close Corporations Bill, plus 13 Bills relating to various levies and taxes. The submissions to the Committee and the evidence that it took at public hearings were concerned overwhelmingly with the ASC Bill and the Corporations Bill. The Committee's report reflects that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporations Bill, which is based largely on the existing Companies Code but with many significant differences, is by far the larger, more technical and detailed Bill of the two. With one major exception-namely, where the power to make a declaration of unacceptable conduct in the course of a takeover should lie-the Committee was generally, though not always, unanimous in its views on the proposals relating to the Corporations Bill. I emphasise that all members of the Committee agreed that there was need for some significant changes in the legislative framework for the regulation of the companies and securities industry in Australia and were agreed on what many of those changes should be. </PARA>
<PARA> By far the greater difficulties in reaching agreement within the Committee lay in its consideration of the Australian Securities Commission Bill. This Bill proposes a completely new institutional framework for the regulation of corporations and securities law in Australia. It would establish a national centralised body, the Australian Securities Commission, to replace the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC). The cooperative arrangements which have operated during the past near decade would be abandoned; in particular, the Ministerial Council, which comprises the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, the six State Attorneys-General and the Attorney-General of the Northern Territory, would cease to exist. The ASC would be supported and accompanied by several other bodies, notably an advisory committee and a corporations and securities panel. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic question with which the Committee was confronted was whether the agreed desirable changes which are contained essentially in the Corporations Bill required the fundamental structural changes contained in the ASC Bill or whether they could be satisfactorily accommodated within the existing cooperative scheme based around the NCSC and the Ministerial Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's recommendations on all aspects of the proposed legislative package are contained in the second chapter of the report. A majority of the Committee, the five Government members plus Senator Macklin, strongly supported the fundamental structural changes proposed. The four coalition members of the Committee were equally strongly of the view that the cooperative scheme should remain in place and that the changes proposed in the Corporations Bill could readily be embraced by the cooperative scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The views of the coalition members are set out in a dissenting report to the main report. In that dissenting report we state that to establish a completely new structure, as proposed by the Attorney-General, `would be to embark on a legislative adventure of monumental folly'. We also make it quite clear that we believe that improvements can and should be made to the cooperative arrangements. For example, we would support a proposal that the Federal Attorney-General be the permanent chairman of the Ministerial Council. We also support the establishment of a parliamentary standing committee on corporations and securities. </PARA>
<PARA> Today is not the occasion to go into detail about the specific provisions of either the ASC Bill or the Corporations Bill. First, I am mindful of the need for Senate Estimates committees to commence their hearings as soon as possible and, secondly, detailed debate on the essentially technical proposals contained in the Corporations Bill would better await the debate at both the second reading stage and the committee stage of the Bills when the Senate resumes its consideration presumably in early May. The report will provide a major input into those debates. Thirdly, I am very mindful that other senators, including my Joint Select Committee colleagues Senator Alston, Senator McMullan, Senator Cooney and Senator Macklin, may wish to speak to the motion before the Chair. </PARA>
<PARA> With one diversion, I propose to confine the remainder of my comments to the reasons for my strong rejection of the ASC Bill proposal. In doing so I will draw heavily on the dissenting report which I and my three coalition colleagues signed and which I commend to all senators and members before the debate on the Bills resumes. The diversion is to place on record a tribute to the Chairman of the Committee, Mr Ron Edwards, for the courteous, even-handed and efficient manner in which he conducted our business at all times. I also want to give particular thanks to the Secretary of our Committee, Andrew Sneddon, and his team, especially Peter Short, John O'Donovan and Annette Fisher, for their absolutely herculean efforts in handling the administrative requirements of the Committee, and the initial drafting of the Committee's report and its preparation for presentation today. I believe we set them an almost impossible task. The results indicate that the almost impossible can prove possible. The Committee also benefited greatly during its deliberations from the assistance and advice it received from Brian O'Callaghan of the Attorney-General's Department, Mark Dickens of the NCSC, and Michael Heffernan of the Australian Stock Exchange. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to the dissenting report. I emphasise that it relates only to the ASC Bill. However, that is the key Bill because it will determine the structural framework within which the regulation of companies and securities will operate in the future. The first thing to be said about the ASC Bill is that it bears all the hallmarks of a Lionel Bowen memorial. It is no secret that Mr Bowen does not propose to contest the next election. He is retiring from parliamentary politics after a very long innings. It is, therefore, not unusual, I guess, that Mr Bowen has for some time now been searching desperately for a legislative memorial to leave the nation. He has had several tries; the most recent and infamous was his absolutely disastrous attempt to force down the throat of the Australian electorate four dangerous referendum proposals last year. The people of Australia showed unequivocally what they thought of that idea-they rejected all four referendums by the greatest margin in Australia's history. The overturn of the highly regarded and respected cooperative scheme and its replacement with a centralised, bureaucratised, Canberra dominated, so-called national scheme is Mr Bowen's latest attempt to build a temple to his political career. No matter what the cost, no matter what the disruption, no matter what the uncertainty, no matter what the damaging effects to the Australian economy, Mr Bowen relentlessly pushes ahead to construct his temple. I believe he must not be permitted to do so, because for Australia Mr Bowen's temple would be a temple of doom built on shifting sands. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, we have the war crimes legislation, as my colleague pointed out. So desperate was Mr Bowen to have his temple that he permitted little or no genuine meaningful consultation to occur before introducing the legislation into the House of Representatives 11 months ago. True, he set up a steering committee and, subsequently, a consultative group to assist him in developing his proposals. However, the steering committee was not sufficiently broadly based, and the consultative group did little by way of consultation. The full consultative group met only once and achieved little except an agreement to subdivide into four more manageable groups, only one of which, the legal subcommittee, could be described as having been active. No indication was given that it had made any genuine attempt to canvass issues outside its own professional circle, let alone explore the views in the smaller States. State governments had little involvement in the consultative process. The Victorian Government, for example, told us that it did not see the Bills until after they had been introduced into this Parliament. It seems the same was the case with the other States. I also find it extraordinary that the existing corporate watchdog, the highly regarded NCSC, was not formally consulted until two months after the legislation had been introduced into the House of Representatives. It very quickly became apparent to us as we took evidence that there was a very high level of concern and unease about the inadequacy of the consultation process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A matter of similar grave concern-all geared to Mr Bowen's grandiose wish for a temple in which to house his political epitaph-was the totally unrealistic timeframe for the Joint Select Committee's report. Although the Committee was established by resolution of both Houses on 17 October last, the practical situation was that the Committee could not hold its first public hearings before 30 January. It received some 58 submissions totalling 1,000 pages. On top of that, it took evidence at public hearings which filled another 1,500 pages. Yet it was supposed to complete its report in time to present it to the Senate on 28 February. The Senate granted an extension of time until today, 13 April. But this was still a completely unrealistic deadline if the report were to be as high quality as such an important subject demands. As is said in the dissenting report on page 198, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the attitude of the Federal Government in relation to these bills seems to have been that a uniform national scheme must be fully implemented as soon as possible, irrespective of the validity of any objections. Such was the tightness of the deadlines faced by the Committee that it was necessary for the Secretariat to commence drafting the report on the basis of written submissions, before having heard the relevant oral evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> One outcome of . . . this unreasonably short period of time was that the Committee was unable to give proper consideration to a number of important issues. These included the report of the investigation into Rothwells and the transcript of the NCSC hearing into the Bell Bond SGIC matter. Both of these would have thrown considerable light on the practical operations of corporate regulation in Australia. Furthermore, the shortness of time meant that the Committee was unable to deal with a number of issues raised in the submissions or to ensure the technical adequacy of some of the recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was also unable to deal, other than in the most perfunctory manner, with such major subjects as the regulation of insider trading or the shield of the crown. So great has been the time pressure that printed copies are not yet available for all senators and members-a fact for which I apologise on behalf of the Committee. Copies will be available later today. The Government has steadfastly refused to admit that there are serious doubts about whether its package has constitutional validity. It has relied greatly on a positive advising by Sir Maurice Byers. The Government has sought no private opinions on the matter. The Committee received a good deal of evidence which, at the very least, raises serious doubts about the constitutional backing to the package. These are contained in the dissenting report. They include the unanimous view of the States' Solicitors-General, the Law Institute of Victoria, and many reputable lawyers and commentators. At the very least, it is quite certain that there would be High Court challenges to the legislation, and that the challenge process would be lengthy. The resultant uncertainty in the companies and securities industries during this process would be destabilising and damaging. The loss of business confidence would be severe. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government and other advocates of the centralised approach appear to rely on three main arguments for support. These are, firstly, that if Australia is to compete effectively in the international arena, a centralised national scheme for companies and securities law is necessary; secondly, that the existing cooperative arrangements diffuse ministerial responsibility and reduce accountability to parliament; and, thirdly, that the cooperative arrangements cause administrative inefficiencies and duplications and general inefficiency. The dissenting report deals with each of these arguments at some length. I believe that each of them is seriously flawed. The first argument-that Australia needs a centralised ASC because of the increasing globalisation of financial markets-whilst superficially appealing, can be demonstrated on closer examination to be nothing more than a straw man. Indeed, if one looks at the operation of Australian companies overseas and the general operations of our financial and securities markets under the existing arrangements, there is no evidence at all to suggest that we are running into any difficulties because of the lack of a more centralised scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument about diffusion of power can be put both ways. The Committee received very little substantive evidence to indicate that this has in reality been a major problem. Indeed, there are powerful arguments to the contrary. As the dissenting report points out, the dispersal of power is by no means unhealthy. On the contrary, it constitutes a valuable and necessary safeguard to protect the integrity and independence of the regulatory authority. The following statement is made on page 204 of the dissenting report:</PARA>
<PARA> The spread of responsibility amongst State Attorneys-General of different political persuasions makes it infinitely harder to subvert or deflect the corporate watchdog and the, at times, anguished criticism of the NCSC by certain affected persons is eloquent testimony to its independence and effectiveness. A cogent example of the potential for political considerations to influence the conduct of corporate regulation occurred in the wake of the provisional liquidation of Rothwells. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite having the power to order a special investigation, the Attorney-General, Mr Bowen, declined to do so in the lead up to the Western Australian election. His suggestion that it was a matter for the States was disingenuous and was directly at odds with the thrust of the present legislation. Indeed, the decision by the NCSC not to disclose the name of Mr Laurie Connell in the wake of the October crash seemed to have been taken as a result of pressure being brought to bear by a person, whom Mr Bosch described as having ``considerable political connections.''</PARA>
<PARA> These examples highlight the necessity to avoid placing sole discretion in the hands of any politician. </PARA>
<PARA>On the third argument, namely, the duplication and resulting inefficiency alleged of the existing scheme, it seems clear from the evidence we received that the new scheme would not change to any marked extent the present administrative arrangements which, in any event, have generally been considered to work effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a great deal more that needs to be said about the report and the Bills to which it relates. That discussion and debate will occur when we consider the Bills in a few weeks time. I urge the Government to take very serious note of the recommendations in this report, both in the main report and in the dissenting report. Setting aside for the moment the type of scheme to be adopted, there are many good recommendations in the report for improvements to the Corporations Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as the particular scheme to be adopted is concerned, I want to emphasise in the strongest possible terms the following views outlined in the dissenting report: that the proposal to abolish the cooperative scheme and replace it with a centralised scheme with an Australian securities commission as the linchpin should be rejected; that the existing cooperative scheme has served, and continues to serve, Australia well; and that the NCSC is widely respected and regarded as an effective regulatory agency. The dissenting report also found that, to work, the ASC proposal of the Government needs the cooperation of the States, yet every State is bitterly opposed to it. Further, the dissenting report points out that the proposal would centralise power in the hands of one Minister, and the Federal Attorney-General, and one government, the Federal government, and would thereby make the regulation of Australia's highly sensitive and vitally important companies and securities law dangerously subject to political influence and interference. It also points out that the Government's proposals will face extensive High Court challenge, during which lengthy period the companies and securities industries would be subject to great uncertainty and the undermining of investor confidence at a time when it is essential that that confidence be strengthened. </PARA>
<PARA> The dissenting report put the view that the existing cooperative scheme can and should be improved, and my coalition colleagues and I fully support changes to achieve this. However, it found that no compelling case had been produced to support the need for the quite fundamental structural changes to the regulatory framework that are contained in the ASC Bill. On the contrary, there are strong arguments against such fundamental change. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Joint Select Committee's report to all senators and members, to the business community and to the financial media. It is an important report which I hope will be widely read and carefully considered. </PARA>

<PARA> As we are to have a considerable second reading debate and, I am sure, a very extensive committee debate on this legislation, I thought in speaking to the report I would concentrate on questions of underlying principles. As one of the members of the Committee who, not being a lawyer, had to do more fundamental research than some of my colleagues, I approached this matter from an outcomes point of view. I will make some comments about secondary matters in a moment, but the principal matter we are pursuing is the question of economic efficiency. It is about micro-economic reform throughout Australia; it is about establishing a corporate fund raising regime and an administration of corporate law which will be appropriate for the present and be ready for the demands of the remainder of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first century. That is the reason why we are at this stage moving to a unified national system. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the cooperative scheme was a substantial improvement when it was introduced. It did enhance significantly the proper administration of corporate law in Australia and the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) has in many ways played an outstanding role. But time is passing. We are moving into a more international economic and business environment and the era of 24-hour trading is with us. The major corporations in Australia, the corporations that trade internationally, support this initiative for that reason. They also support it, quite correctly in my view, because it simplifies the conduct of business on a national scale and guarantees uniformity and consistency of administration from State to State. It should also provide the opportunity, as is reflected in the majority report, for prompt and consistent rulings. I will not dwell on that as it is covered in the report. There is also the important question of the principle of parliamentary accountability, which was challenged by the minority. I understand the argument, but I do agree with it. It is only the establishment of parliamentary accountability which will create the framework for effective continuing parliamentary scrutiny. The report recommends the establishment of a joint standing committee to monitor this new legislation and the operation of the Australian Securities Commission (ASC). Such a joint standing committee could not possibly be effective under the cooperative scheme because the NCSC would not be accountable to the Federal Parliament. It could not operate. </PARA>
<PARA> The time has come-in fact I think it is long past-to mark the end of the lowest common denominator approach to corporate regulation. It is that which killed off the compromise proposal, which was an interesting proposal emanating from the Attorneys-General of Victoria and South Australia. It had substantial merit, but the inherent flaw in the cooperative scheme, that it depends upon the cooperation of the weakest link, was exhibited in the reaction to that proposal. It was killed off and therefore did not warrant any further consideration. That lowest common denominator approach, and the problems associated with it, were clearly exhibited in the extremely unsatisfactory evidence given to the Committee by the New South Wales Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Peacocke. It was a contribution that smacked of the bad old days of the Bjelke-Petersen regime in the early 1970s. It was uncooperative, ill-formed and unsatisfactory. I think that reflects why the cooperative scheme cannot operate in the future in the way in which its advocates might wish. </PARA>
<PARA> The minority, in its dissenting report, said two things that are important at this stage-one with which I agree and which Senator Short referred to in his comments, and one with which I disagree. The first, which is very important, is that the Committee was unanimous in most areas of its recommendations about the way in which corporations should be regulated, whether by a national scheme or a cooperative scheme. Equally interesting in that area is that the dissent crossed party lines quite substantially. Three of the five Labor members, one of the Liberal members and an Australian Democrat voted differently to the majority-that majority being a majority on the casting vote of the Chairman. I will not bore the Senate with the detail of that. It is clearly outlined in the report and it would more appropriately be debated in the committee stage. My point is that that bipartisan, or multipartisan, approach to the detail, while reflecting well on the Committee-which is not a point of any significance-is important in terms of the benefit that can be gained from an analysis of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> But that point in the report of the Committee with which I do not agree reflects the problem with the cooperative scheme. Page 216 of the report states that the Bill reflects changes which are required in corporations law. I agree with that. It states also that the cooperative scheme can be rectified without difficulty to achieve this objective. That is where we part company. Its sensible assessment that those changes need to be made, which reflects the majority report with which I concur, falls down at the implementation stage because I do not believe the cooperative scheme either can or will achieve those objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee strayed into the constitutional area. It was outside our terms of reference, and I do not intend to stray into it in making my comments, other than to say that I think the transitional arrangements on which the Committee makes recommendations are important. A prompt resolution of the major constitutional questions, which is guaranteed by the Attorney-General, is also important, and I look forward to that. I am confident about the outcome but that, of course, is a matter for the High Court of Australia to decide. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee in its approach-and I as a member of it-had to balance a number of competing demands. One was the balance between the effective policing of the marketplace and the civil liberties of the participants in the marketplace. I pay tribute to my colleague Senator Cooney for his consistent advocacy of the civil liberties of almost everybody, which he undertook at great length and with great expertise. This is the area in which the dissent finally emerged. It is a difficult balance, although it is not a unique balance, to achieve. It is not dissimilar to that which has to be dealt with in the area of the National Crime Authority and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. For that reason we have parliamentary committee scrutiny of those two bodies. Therefore it is appropriate that a committee should continue to scrutinise this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> But here we have a third element of the balance. We have the question of effective policing of civil liberties and of market efficiency. It is a difficult balance to achieve but I think it is a balance which the report strikes and which the Bill will strike if it reflects the recommendations in the report. For example, recommendation 6 on page xvi of the summary of recommendations refers to the need to maintain effective day to day market surveillance. The report also mentions empowering the ASC to proceed for recovery of profits in a number of areas particularly, for example, insider trading. The Committee, significantly, recommends enhanced pre-vetting of prospectuses, a view which I supported and which was ultimately unanimously supported. </PARA>
<PARA> Readers of the report will also note that in a bipartisan way Senator Alston and I disagreed with the rest of the Committee about the question of pre-vetting of part A statements in takeovers. Once again, that is a matter that can be discussed at greater length later. My view is that that is fundamentally another area of secondary trading. We have made appropriate unanimous recommendations for the regulation of secondary trading on the market, and I believe those will also adequately cover the circumstances in regard to takeovers. It is distinctly differently from the prospectus situation, where the relative strength of the players in the market is so disproportionately different. That is the case for continuing regulation of corporations law in the way that is proposed in the report, which is somewhat more regulatory in its tone than some elements of the Bill, although it is slightly less so than the current system in the main. But it is a market that requires regulation because of the disproportionately different resources available to, and strength of, the participants in the marketplace. It is a market in which there are an enormous number of very wealthy players and a lower number of smaller players. In this instance the smaller players are not those people who were mentioned in last night's economic statement, the poorest of the poor. There are not-or there should not be-too many recipients of the family allowance supplement participating in the stock exchange. </PARA>
<PARA> The survey done by the Australian Associated Stock Exchanges, as it then was, of Australian share ownership in 1986 showed that 17 per cent of share owners listed their occupation as executive and professional. Grouped in with those who were either retired from that category, or probably linked to it by family circumstances, is a group of 35 to 40 per cent of share owners, whereas only 5.5 per cent are identified as blue collar workers. Of course it is vastly different from the distribution of those occupational groupings in the work force as a whole. The interests of most of those people at the lower end of the market, the employees, who are represented to some extent in the share market through their superannuation schemes, are taken care of by rather big players in the marketplace, the superannuation companies. Therefore, some of their interests do not necessarily have to be protected in that way. The National Mutual Life Association of Australia Ltd and the Australian Mutual Provident Society are certainly big enough to take care of themselves. But evidence will show the continuing reference to the little old grandmother who participates in the market. Whether that is ageist and sexist is beside the point for the moment. There are people who are not informed, professional and powerful figures who purchase shares on the stock exchange. They are entitled to be treated fairly. They are entitled to be well informed. They are entitled to have as equal a chance as we can give them to participate on a footing comparable with the more powerful players. I do not want to say any more about the report than that by way of preliminary remarks. There are some things I want to say in the second reading debate and the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The report does contain-I say this by way of conclusion-some other clarifications, some of them quite minor and some more substantial, but all of them unanimous, of matters raised by witnesses. The legislation is enormous and complex. I do not pretend to have become an instant expert because I have been on the Committee for two or three months, but it has been a very steep learning curve. The conclusions one should draw from reading this report are that the legislation should proceed. The legislation should be, and, if the recommendations in the report are adopted, will be, substantially enhanced by the report. There is a need for continuing monitoring, which should be done by the Joint Parliamentary Committee. It should assist in ensuring the balance of those competing demands of efficiency, equity and civil liberties in a way that would not be possible in the cooperative scheme. I am happy to join in the discussion on the motion and I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the report from the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation, which was set up following my motion, as set out in the opening pages of this report. When I first approached the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) with the suggestion that there ought to be a committee of inquiry into this subject, he readily accepted that view, and for much the same reason that I put to him-that is, that since these Bills are the largest group of Bills ever to be introduced into the Federal Parliament since Federation, it would be odd if they went through both Houses without a committee inquiry. That Committee has now met. It has met under a very tight timetable. However, I do not agree with the remarks made by the Deputy Chairman of the Committee, Senator Short, that a vastly extended exercise would necessarily have done anything other than produce more amendments to particular items. I think what we have done is suggested not only the immediate amendments that need to be undertaken-with the unanimous agreement of all members of the Committee-but also a method by which those subsequent items may be able to be taken up, that is, by the continuation of a joint committee of members of parliament to be known as the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee worked extremely well. In fact, I found it to be a committee where one was able to listen to expertise and views from members of all political parties and take them on the basis of argument and expertise and not on the basis of which political party people belonged to. Fairly obviously, that particular atmosphere has departed already now that the report has been tabled. I wish to refer to that because I think it was a most constructive exercise. That is not to say that the Liberal and National Party members of our Committee departed from the view that they did not believe that these Bills should proceed. But they were able to suspend that on a conditional exercise: if they were to proceed, whether they could be made better. Hence the report was able to be signed by every member of the Committee no matter which party they came from-under that rubric, that if the Bills are to proceed, then these are the recommended changes. I believe that the Government certainly has to look very closely at these recommendations. I would go so far as to say that I believe the Government ought to take on board every one of these recommendations, that it would be advised to do so and in doing that the Bills will be far better and will be the best we are able to achieve at this stage in terms of proceeding. </PARA>
<PARA> There was another method we used in the Committee which I originally suggested to the Chairman of the Committee and which the Committee itself was happy to take up-that is, that we should seek to have attached to our Committee a number of experts who would travel with us, who would sit in on the hearings and who would then be able to make comments from their various points of expertise. These people-Brian O'Callaghan from the Attorney-General's Department, Mark Dickens from the National Companies and Securities Commission, and Michael Heffernan from the Australian Stock Exchange-performed an extremely valuable task. I would certainly recommend to the Senate that in terms of all of its committees, it look at this particular innovation and talk to the members of the Committee as to how that worked to see whether that additional aspect might aid in other technical matters before various committees. The procedure we had was that those three people from various areas, but with deep expertise and professionalism, were able to comment immediately to us on witnesses' answers and submissions. At the end of each day we were then able to undertake a much more in-depth debate than we would otherwise have been able to do. The alternative method would have been for us to then leave the Committee room and seek the type of input from experts that we were able to gain immediately and on the submissions made. </PARA>
<PARA> I also take some point with the other comment made by Senator Short when he got into some fairly high-blown rhetoric with regard to the temple of doom. I must admit that I have never seen the Deputy Prime Minister very much as an Indiana Jones figure. I doubt whether he has ever seen himself in that light. Whether this particular Bill is seen by Senator Short as building some type of temple to the political career of Lionel Bowen is really quite beside the point. The fact of the matter-it is substantiated in the evidence-is that all of the major companies and the members of the Business Council of Australia are in support of this scheme. The vast bulk of companies in Australia, the overwhelming majority, are in support of this scheme as is evident by the support given by the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia in evidence. Those two facts-the fact that the major companies are in support of this scheme and that the vast majority of companies support it-would suggest that what is going on here is a very interesting exercise. They are looking at this in a similar way to the way my Party has looked at this particular piece of legislation-that is, that this particular legislation is not for the past; it is not really for the present. I think the point is that the cooperative scheme could limp along in the present. This particular piece of legislation, quite frankly, is for the future of Australian business. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a totally different perspective. It is one that is not met in the minority report. This legislation is for the future of Australian business. I would suggest that if this legislation fails as a result, for example, of an election and a change of government which would not proceed with the legislation, then at some time in the future, probably within a 10- to 15-year time frame, the pressure for a similar scheme to this will be almost irresistible. </PARA>
<PARA> That can be looked at by merely looking at the trends in Australian business and in our trade. We have to think as a nation, as a country. We will survive only by thinking in that way-a nation that is interested in and committed to trade in the international arena. In doing that-in the same way as yesterday the Senate passed a Bill in regard to international arbitration-we need not just to have regard to the brawls that take place in the day to day business of political parties in this place, but to appreciate that the economic future of this country depends on the legislative regime that we put in place for our companies. We will be long gone, and only names appearing in Hansard, when the real benefits of this legislation will be seen. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One hopes that one will but, like most people in the past, one tends to disappear in the footnotes of history. I suppose if one can range through history as a footnote it is something. This legislation will stay there and will be a hallmark to the fact that we were able to look ahead. I urge honourable senators to examine this legislation in that vein. Although it is true that we could get by today and tomorrow on the cooperative scheme-and there is no doubt about that-we will not be able to do that in the foreseeable future. It is far better to take the opportunity now to make these changes so that we can put in place the type of legislative regime that will be necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The final point I wish to make before closing is that I hope that the Senate and the House of Representatives adopt the recommendation in regard to a joint committee on corporations and securities. The reason I say this-which probably will not come as much of a surprise to many people in this chamber-is that I have an abiding interest in the future of parliamentary democracy. I believe that we need to give a reason for the continued existence of parliament, not just simply because of the fact that it was here yesterday, or because of King Charles or somebody else. The reason that parliaments should continue is that we are relevant to the day to day lives of the people of Australia. To do that we have to stay with the times. </PARA>
<PARA> This House first came into session in 1901, and what else has continued since that time in its original form? There is hardly anything else. In other words, we have an obligation not just simply to preach to everybody else that they have to remain with the times, but parliamentarians have to keep up with the times also. One way in which this chamber pre-eminently in this Parliament has chosen to do that is through its committees. I believe that that has a twofold effect, particularly as to this recommendation. The first is that it will provide access to a group from all parties for business. Where business feels that this legislation is pinching or needs to be changed, or where business has a problem with some decision on which it needs to express its view; business will be able to talk to a committee of all political parties. It will not just talk to bureaucrats or to the Government, but also to a committee of all political parties. </PARA>
<PARA> The second aspect-this is where the benefit flows to us-is that it will require a number of members of both Houses to be continuously involved in an ongoing learning way with operations of corporation securities in this country. I believe that would be the marked benefit of the debates in this chamber. I believe that we should look at that as an exercise not only for the corporations but also for our own benefit and for the benefit of parliamentary democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> In recommending the report of the Committee, may I delineate basically what we have. We have a fundamental dissent expressed by the minority report with the concept that has already been aired; it has not changed. Indeed, it would be remarkable, in terms of the evidence presented to us, if it had changed. There is a fundamental difference, it continues, and it is expressed by members of the conservative parties on the Committee in that minority report. That aside, the Committee was unanimous on every point except one. Once one puts aside the fundamental political differences, the members of the Committee was in agreement on every point except one. When one turns to the report to look at where that disagreement occurs, one finds a dissenting report signed by Senator Alston, Senator Cooney, Senator Macklin, Senator McMullan and Mr Kerr. In other words, on only one point was there any disagreement. That is evidence of how well the members of the Committee worked together, how well we were able to listen to one another's arguments. We were very lucky to have the valuable input of a number of members on that Committee who were lawyers and who had expertise in this area. I found their input personally invaluable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee worked in a way that is characteristic of Senate committees in working for the betterment of legislation. We will return to our political debates now, but I do not think any of us who have gone through this exercise could in any shape or form believe that it was useless. I think that we are all committed to the propositions contained in the report. We have put our recommendations which-when accepted rather than if-will vastly improve the legislation. We will then be left with that still fundamental dissent as to whether we should proceed, but that is still a matter for politics. I believe that if we were having this debate in 15 years' time or possibly even in five or six years' time, this argument would be put to us by a conservative government urging this scheme. I urge all honourable senators to read the report because it will enlighten them on many issues. It was an experience for me for which I am very thankful. I hope that our work will assist the people of Australia, particularly those in business, well into the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to address the Senate on what is undoubtedly one of the most significant reports tabled in the Parliament. I regard it as a great privilege to have served on the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation. Indeed, I congratulate Senator Macklin in particular for persuading the Government that this matter should be referred to a parliamentary committee. As a result of that exercise we have had perhaps the most intelligent, yet technical, discussion of issues relating to administration of company law that has ever taken place in this Parliament. I commend all my colleagues on the Committee, in particular its Deputy Chairman, Senator Short. It is fair to say that almost all members of the Committee-and I do not include Senator Cooney in the exceptions-attended every meeting and played a very constructive role. I thought that Senator Cooney did his best and in his attempts to provoke me and others he was singularly unsuccessful. In retailing his experience of life at the Victorian Bar, we were all vastly entertained. There were even times when I suspect that he might have done a bit of company law in an earlier life. Overall, we did address the issue seriously and sensibly. I think, as other speakers have said, there was a large measure of agreement on the need for improvements in the area dealt with by the Corporations Bill. It is really in the area of the concept of the Australian National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC), the need for national legislation to replace the current cooperative scheme, that I think the parties diverge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to reflect on the views of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, as it then was. I think many of the broad-brush statements contained in that report commended themselves to a number of those who made submissions. They did not really get down to the detail that our Committee certainly did. I found that a fascinating exercise. Perhaps I could just take one example. I know Senator Macklin has been driven by the desire for Australia to become more competitive, to find its place in the international arena, to ensure that we are not hampered by any outmoded regulations. I think that is a perfectly commendable point of view. Certainly it was a view put to us by players such as the Business Council of Australia. But when I examined that particular argument in favour of a national scheme and all of the accompanying rhetoric about the need to replace outmoded schemes by approaches that would take us into the twenty-first century, it became apparent to me that really there was no evidence at all that would demonstrate that companies were presently hampered in their international operations by the scheme under which we operate. After all, only a very small proportion of companies operate in the international arena, and none of those has ever suggested that their entrepreneurial endeavours have been hindered to any extent by having to operate under a ministerial council and a cooperative scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at some of the assertions made on behalf of the Business Council, such things as the need for a national computer base and the ability to assess quickly and easily corporate records throughout the country, it becomes apparent that these were shibboleths that have been around for many years and which have been overtaken by events. The fact is that there will be a national corporate data base in the very near future and people will have that sort of instant access to which they are undoubtedly entitled. So I found that argument singularly unpersuasive. It is certainly one of those slogans that were bandied around, but I think the commentators and others made it fairly clear that, once you got beneath the surface, there was really no evidence to suggest that companies were being restricted. There are a number of leading Australian companies that are major players on the international scene that have to cope with many vagaries, including fluctuating prices, exchange rates, language and cultural barriers and adequate access to capital investment resources, but none of them ever suggest that the method of regulating company law in Australia has somehow limited their opportunities. I found that one argument that was really a red herring. </PARA>
<PARA> The second argument in favour of a national scheme was that somehow the ability of this Parliament to influence the shape of regulation was limited to the point where we were irrelevant. Those who place great store on the sovereignty of the Parliament felt somehow insulted that we were not in there making all the changes. The reality is, as I think was clearly demonstrated to us, that the Federal Parliament does have the ability to amend legislation, to adopt or reject recommendations of the Ministerial Council. It is then a matter of whether the States are prepared to accept those changes. But I think there is little doubt that the Federal Government is legally free to reject or amend legislation. If that is the case, one wonders what the fuss is about. Again I was struck by the conspicuous lack of examples of any actual or proposed changes that either the Commonwealth or the States have proposed which have proved unacceptable to the other. I think one can say that, far from it being undesirable that there has not been what is described as direct accountability to the Parliament, there is a very good and valid reason why the cooperative scheme has proved very worthwhile: it minimises the opportunity for political influence. In many ways I think this goes to the heart of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1979 company law in Australia has been administered within a framework of a Federal-State cooperative scheme presided over by the Attorneys-General of the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory. Under that regime the National Companies and Securities Commission has been Australia's national corporate watchdog. Over the past decade the Commission has established a reputation as a vigorous and determined all-rounder. Its activities have covered not only technical areas such as accounting standards and regulations but also crucial areas such as investor protection and law enforcement. Its most visible and contentious activities have centred on its efforts to ensure a level playing field for both investors and companies. This has involved continuous market surveillance, being constantly on the look-out for market manipulation, especially in the area of takeovers. Amongst its most important powers has been the ability to inquire into allegations of unacceptable conduct and to obtain court orders for forfeiture of shares and restraint on market activities. It has issued a steady stream of press releases designed to keep the public and the market informed on its attitude to corporate behaviour. It has done all that despite being provided by the Federal Government with a niggardly shoestring budget of the order of $6m. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not share the criticism that I know Senator Cooney has voiced on occasions of the way in which Mr Bosch and his colleagues have taken a media-oriented approach to the activities of the regulator. I think they have been in part driven by the fact that they cannot afford to embark on the more traditional approaches, which often involve long and costly litigation. I take the view that there is nothing more salutary than the spotlight of media attention to discourage those who might otherwise be fringe operators from engaging in activities which we would regard as unacceptable conduct. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the shortness of time and the lack of opportunity for the Committee to consider very important reports, one being the report into the Rothwells Ltd matter, the other the Bell-Bond-State Government Insurance Commission takeover deal, we were not provided with the opportunity to analyse the effectiveness of the NCSC in the way that I would have liked. I regard it as unfortunate that in that particular instance the NCSC felt constrained to arrive at a commercial settlement, which meant that it did not proceed to make a definite finding of unacceptable conduct. I think Mr Alan Bond should be very grateful that the NCSC found itself in that position. In part that was contributed to by the defence of the shield of the Crown, which I regard as quite outmoded. I think it has allowed a number of government instrumentalities to operate effectively outside the law so that it has become a matter of discretion whether they comply with vital legislative requirements such as the takeovers code. </PARA>
<PARA> It is simply not acceptable, in my view, that old-fashioned notions of sovereignty of the Crown should operate to deny investors and the wider community knowledge of the commercial activities of governments in the marketplace, in the same way that they are entitled as of right to knowledge of the activities of private corporations. Because of that continuing availability of the shield of the Crown argument, commercial settlements have been arrived at when they would not otherwise have been quite so compelling. Certainly I think the Bond Corporation was one of those against whom an unacceptable declaration ought to have been made, on the evidence. If that had been the case, I think there might have been some other harsher views taken of the activities of the Western Australian State Government Insurance Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> If I could return to the central point, by and large the NCSC has got a number of runs on the board. I will not run through some of its achievements in recent years, but it certainly has forced a number of players to disgorge profits-in effect to put money into the poor box, as Senator Cooney would appreciate-to the tune of $1m as far as the IEL Property Trust was concerned. Even the Bond group was required to pay an extra $580m to minority shareholders in the Bell Group. I think the Commission's achievements in respect of forcing FAI Insurances to reverse its sale of a stake in Cumberland Credit Corporation, forcing Alexander Laing and Cruickshank to sell a disputed parcel of Humes Ltd shares, are all very good and recent examples of the effectiveness of the NCSC. It has been able to do that against a background of niggardliness on the part of both Federal and State governments. It is quite clear that the Federal Government could have provided resources if it had chosen to, but simply has not. That is a very regrettable state of affairs. Clearly it has limited the Commission's options. It is a disincentive to pursue litigation, which is often a necessary weapon to keep the main players in line. </PARA>
<PARA> Another thing I regard as regrettable is a very important takeover which has gone largely unnoticed. I refer to the great victory by the public sector unions in ensuring that all staff of the regulator will come within the Public Service Act. At the moment, the NCSC is not constrained by Public Service requirements. It is able to employ its own staff. Subject to the availability of funds, it is not really required to operate under a pricing cap either. What will happen now is that everyone employed by the regulator will have to be a public servant, a career bureaucrat, subject to all the limits imposed by award restrictions. If that is the case, then it will be a much less attractive place for aspiring corporate lawyers to go. Those often fired with enthusiasm about the role that can be played by an honest and effective regulator and who are not particularly concerned about wages will be very concerned about the dead hand of bureaucracy. If this is going to be a sheltered workshop for public servants, then that is a very unfortunate and unhealthy development. It is to the Government's great shame that it has capitulated to those pressures. It was not necessary and, in many ways, it has become just an excuse for its failure to provide the necessary funding. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also concerned that a national scheme might provide the Australian Democrats with an opportunity to influence the course of corporate law in this country. I regard that as a fairly frightening prospect for the commercial community. Senator Macklin, who has been a voice of relative rationality in this debate, is shortly to depart this place. What we are likely to be left with is a clutch of anti-business prejudices, which are constantly trotted out in this place by popularists and demagogues like Senator Haines. They bitterly oppose any notion of takeovers, resent companies offsetting borrowings for takeovers against income and, indeed, distrust any foreign investment in this country. Companies rank high in their demonology. That is very unfortunate if the Democrats have the balance of power in deciding the shape of company law in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a separate issue in one sense; the major issue is the unfortunate capacity for influence and the level of influence that will be available to some of the major corporate advisers and players, in particular the Sydney Mafia, from whom I exclude Mr John Green. I certainly regard it as an unhealthy development if we find the NCSC, which is beholden to a ministerial council composed of politicians of various persuasions, replaced by a single avenue of approach. The Attorney-General's Department is very keen to get its hands into the area, and we have an Attorney-General who already has a prior conviction for political interference, or non-interference, in his conscious decision not to conduct an inquiry into the affairs of Rothwells prior to the Western Australian election. Given the very unsatisfactory evidence presented to the Committee in Sydney particularly by Mr Vrisakis, who put forward what I regarded as a self-serving, fulsome and dishonest statement about consultation, one can only have a great level of concern about the quite obvious lack of consultation and real awareness on the part of other than a very small clique. If that is the case, it augurs badly. It means that that situation is likely to be aggravated by a system that will allow people a fast track to Canberra to influence decisions, most of which will never see the light of day unless they are actually decisions not to prosecute. But, in subtle ways, they will have a very deleterious effect on the way in which company law is shaped in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been a very worthwhile exercise. The report has been very constructive in many aspects. On the fundamental need to replace the present cooperative scheme, I think that the majority has simply got it wrong. Those members have been seduced by simplistic notions. If they examine carefully the implications of that sort of a takeover, they will find that it will not serve the community well, will not be in anyone's best interests and, indeed, that there are very many ways in which the administration of the present scheme can be improved and made to operate quite satisfactorily. I hope that is the way that the Government and the Democrats will go, but I fear the worst. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The speeches so far have pointed out the importance of the report of the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation. I endorse those remarks. I also endorse the thanks that have been given to the staff who prepared the report. In particular I thank Andrew Sneddon, who has worked under extreme pressure and has presented a very good and comprehensive report and a report to be praised. No doubt there may be, as one reads through the report, the odd error, but that would be as a result of the pressure under which he has had to work. There has been some criticism of that pressure. On the other hand, this is legislation that is before the Parliament and has already been through the House of Representatives. It is important from the Government's point of view that it does proceed. I think a proper balance has been struck between the need to get a good and comprehensive report and the need to get the legislation through the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Alston praises the report in so far as it is a comprehensive analysis of the legislation. He, along with Senator Short and no doubt other members of his Party, criticises the report because he considers that this legislation should not be introduced at all and that the present cooperative scheme is the appropriate way to go, although it ought to be improved. That differs from the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, which gave rise to this legislation. It was tabled in this Parliament on 28 April 1987 and was entitled The role of Parliament in relation to the national companies scheme. It is proper to refer to that because many of the issues that are now raised were then anticipated. It was recommended unanimously by the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee that the Commonwealth Parliament should enact comprehensive legislation covering the field currently regulated by the cooperative scheme. That Committee was made up of people of great force. The Chairman was Senator Nick Bolkus, who is now a Minister of the Crown. May I say that he is a man of outstanding experience in the law and has filled his position as a Minister with great consequence and great distinction. Senator Margaret Reynolds, who is also a Minister, was also on that Committee. Senator Michael Tate, who was the Chairman of that Committee until 25 February 1987, is now a Minister. The members of that Committee from the other side were Senator Robert Hill, Senator Richard Alston and Senator Chris Puplick. If the Opposition ever becomes the Government--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very remote, but if that happened, Senator Robert Hill, Senator Richard Alston and Senator Chris Puplick would fill the front bench; they would be Ministers.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, one never knows. It is said that there is no need for a Commonwealth scheme. The reality is that that report was a unanimous one made by those very outstanding people. They unanimously recommended that the Commonwealth have a comprehensive scheme. Senator Alston said that there was no evidence that that should be the situation. In paragraph 5.1 of this report it is pointed out that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Mr Halstead, a committee member of the Business Council of Australia and one of the Council's representatives at the Committee's public hearings, summarised the Council's submission as being `that the Commonwealth Government should make a bid for the whole field'. </PARA>
<PARA>The report points out that the Australian Merchant Bankers Association also appears to have come to this view. Paragraph 5.2 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Mr Bill Beerworth, a member of the executive committee of the Australian Merchant Bankers Association, commented that he had `always had doubts about the co-operative scheme' and that the Association `is on record as preferring national legislation in this area'. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 5.3 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Company Directors Association characterised this as the `next step' in a natural progression. According to the Chief Executive of the Confederation of Australian Industry, Mr Darryl George:</PARA>
<PARA> The present system of State and Federal cooperation on company regulation has now proven its limitations and should be abolished. </PARA>
<PARA>Significantly, paragraph 3.52 of the report of the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs states:</PARA>
<PARA> In a statement to the Victorian Legislative Council in 1985, the Victorian Attorney-General, the Hon. J. H. Kennan, MLC-</PARA>
<PARA>an outstanding legal mind-</PARA>
<PARA>described the co-operative companies and securities scheme as `a unique constitutional creature'. His successor as Chairman of the Ministerial Council, the Hon. T. W. Sheahan, has taken a negative view of the scheme. He described it as a `hybrid institution' which `imposes severe limitations on developing of necessary policies. </PARA>
<PARA>That man was Chairman of the Ministerial Council at that time. He said that the scheme was not working well and that we should move to a national scheme run through the Parliament of Australia. That is consistent with the fact that the Australian Stock Exchange has become a national body and that there is international trade in securities. This demands more and more that there be a single body to regulate the exchange of securities in various countries. So, a national scheme has been asked for and given by this Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen). This Attorney is to be praised for his moves in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Time is short and we want to finish as soon as we can. There is one other point. There was a split in the Committee-five all-with the majority being formed by the casting vote of the Chairman, Mr Ron Edwards, who chaired the Committee with great distinction. That split in the Committee took place over the role of the proposed Australian Securities Commission and the panel. It is a fundamental concept in the legislation that there be a separation of functions. There are those which are, according to the minority report of five, to be performed by the Australian Securities Commission, which is an investigative body that collects intelligence, establishes evidence and then produces it. That function is distinct from an adjudicative one, from one where judgments are to be made. The scheme in the legislation presently before us proposes that that adjudicative function be performed by a panel. It is my strong belief that that is how it should remain. As I understood it, that is what the industry wanted. The panel will include people from the industry who can be chosen from a wide pool. It is proper that that is where the decision as to whether there has been unacceptable conduct is made. </PARA>
<PARA> It is undesirable in any institution in a democratic society that people who investigate and collect intelligence also be allowed to judge an issue on the basis of the material that they gather. With great respect to the majority-a majority because of the casting vote of the Chairman-I am unable to accept that, even in an industry where it is suggested, often times with insufficient evidence, that there is a need for severe control, that control should be so severe as to run those two functions together. That sort of thing is the basis for the addendum I made on page 191 of the report about the tendency, not only in this sort of legislation but also in legislation generally, to allow citizens of this community to be punished, to have consequences delivered to them, by bodies which seem to run together functions that should not be run together. In other words, it is wrong for bodies that collect evidence or intelligence and investigate matters then to go ahead and make judgments upon that material. The legislation as it presently appears is the correct approach. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Alston talked about Rothwells Ltd and Bell-Bond. He has been vigorous in his pursuit in bringing to the light of day what happened with those companies. That is correct. No doubt the opportunity will come his way. He has spoken of the shield of the Crown and the need to look at it. I agree entirely. I go on record as saying that, were Senator Alston to put forward the suggestion that some committee such as the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee look at it, I would support that wholeheartedly. </PARA>

<PARA> Mr Bonner's entitlement to severance travel ceased on 5 March 1988. However the Prime Minister agreed to a request from Mr Bonner for continued access to Commonwealth funded travel so that he could accept invitations to participate in events around Australia in connection with the Bicentenary. Such travel was to be undertaken on the same conditions as apply to severance travel and extended to 1 January 1989. The Department of Administrative Services met these costs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 28 February 1989:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I refer the Minister to his response to my question without notice of 28 November 1988 as to whether `the department is enforcing financial rules and guidelines for the administration of these (unacquitted) grants' to which the Minister's response (see Senate Hansard dated 6 December 1988, p. 3571) was `yes'.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1533" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator Tate</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following response to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) Officers of the Department considered the matters disclosed by the Dunlevy/Lyne report on the Derby Regional Office to be isolated in nature and not indicative of the general situation in relation to grant administration. I am informed that the then State Director, Western Australia, in forwarding the Dunlevy/Lyne report to Central office on 22 September 1988, indicated that remedial action had been taken or was being implemented.</PARA>
<PARA> I am satisfied that the answer provided was correct. The answer was based on previous information from officers about the Department's grants administration process, specific actions undertaken on a number of projects, and also on information provided in the Department's 1987-88 performance report which had earlier been provided to Senate Estimates Committee ``E''.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Parliament was not misled.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) The Special Audit Report of the Auditor-General on the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. In addition, in relation to the Western Australian Office, I am informed that the Department has reports of internal reviews of its Kununurra and Geraldton Regional Offices.</PARA>
<PARA> (f) No. I am informed that these reports are internally generated with the aim of assisting State Office management to identify and rectify problem areas and thereby improve performance and are not normally provided to the Minister as a matter of course.</PARA>
<PARA> (g) I am informed that the report is critical of aspects of administration of the Geraldton Office.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) Yes. I am informed that funding to the organisations concerned is, in most cases, directed to the provision and maintenance of essential services which are basic to the health and well-being of the communities in question. In each case, and before approving further grants, the delegate considers circumstances relating to the particular community or organisation. These circumstances include:</PARA>
<PARA> whether the non acquittal of previous grants was due to circumstances within the control of the organisation concerned or otherwise</PARA>
<PARA> whether approved expenditure commitments needed to be met</PARA>
<PARA> whether a need existed to meet the costs of essential services as outlined above</PARA>
<PARA> whether the community as a whole, including support service employees (teachers etc), pensioners and children are likely to suffer due to the cessation of funding</PARA>
<PARA> whether there were other alternative methods of providing the service-State/Local Government.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) In all cases organisations had presented audited financial statements, up to and including the 1987-88 financial year, to the Department. Many of these, however, were qualified mainly due to expenditure relating to voluntary community contributions (chuck in money). Regional officers have given priority to the acquittance of grants. However, many grants have not yet progressed to acquittance because of other competing priorities for Regional Office resources.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (a) In some aspects it does. However, the major factor in the non-acquittal of the 151 grants cited related to the shortage of staff to handle other day-to-day grant administration work and to also complete the necessary procedural steps to review documentation presented by the organisations, pursue outstanding requirements, if any, and formally acquit the grants.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The answers to all questions raised by Senator Crichton-Browne on 28 November were answered on 6 December. There was nothing further to add at that time.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) (a) No. Audited financial statements for the 1987-88 financial year were due by 31 December 1988. As at 23 March 1989 the following organisations had not provided statements:</PARA>
<PARA> Ngurawaana Aboriginal Corporation</PARA>
<PARA> Pupunya Aboriginal Corporation</PARA>
<PARA> Punmu (CDEP) Aboriginal Corporation</PARA>
<PARA> Tjalka Boorda Aboriginal Corporation</PARA>
<PARA> Lundja Aboriginal Corporation</PARA>
<PARA> Woolah Aboriginal Corporation</PARA>
<PARA> Muliarkar Aboriginal Corporation</PARA>
<PARA> Wyndham Amenities Club</PARA>
<PARA> Barula Action Group</PARA>
<PARA> Pandanus Park Community</PARA>
<PARA> Kimberley Land Council</PARA>
<PARA> Imintji Community</PARA>
<PARA> Wangan Ngari Resource Centre</PARA>
<PARA> For the financial years 1983-84 to 1986-87, audited financial statements have been received for all funded organisations located in the North Eastern, Northern and North Western Regions which have received funding from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in those years.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) No. The amount of work required to extract the material and copy it would require a significant redirection of staff resources and I am not prepared to approve such a redirection. Honourable Senators will be aware that all of those reports were available on file for Australian Audit Office staff involved in the recent Special Audit of the Department's operations in WA.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) (a) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Department's contributions were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 1987-88-$68,224 grant</PARA>
<PARA> 1988-89-$192,193 grant</PARA>
<PARA> (Note: these grants were not for the Caravan Park) Information relating to the ADC is being pursued.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) No. The organisation has overexpended on some items such as travel and other operational expenditure. Further funds releases are being withheld and legal opinion is being sought on some of the activities of the organisation.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) A report on the Balgo Audit report was brought to my attention.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The books of account have been withdrawn from Balgo and placed with an accountant (previously the Auditor for Balgo) who will assist in the administration of current and future grants.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Departmental field officers do not control funds-they are controlled by the grant recipient in accordance with self management principles. Departmental field officers simply administer grants in accordance with conditions outlined in the Department's letter of offer. Departmental job specifications, which detail the criteria to be used in selecting staff for field positions, include the requirement for a ``sound knowledge of departmental policies, Ministerial Directives and Programming and Project Control procedures'', as one of a number of requirements. Field staff are also expected to have a detailed knowledge of the programs of Commonwealth and State departments, the ability to devise and develop strategies for the advancement of Aboriginal communities and organisations, skills in human relationships, good oral and written communication and the ability to communicate effectively with Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) The Department of Aboriginal Affairs' financial rules relating to grants contain a number of requirements which are directed to ensuring the integrity of Government grants. These include requirements relating to the use of funds only for the purpose for which the grant is provided, limitations on release of funds in advance of need, quarterly and annual accounting requirements and a number of other conditions consistent with the proper accounting for public money.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) and (f) The information required is not readily available and the amount of work required to extract and collate the data would require a significant redirection of staff resources which I am not prepared to approve.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) I am informed that an amount of $22,000 was approved in June 1986. I have also been informed of the following answers by Departmental officers:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Yes; the writer is Mr S. Hawke and the photographer is Mr M. Gallagher.</PARA>
<PARA> (d)-</PARA>
<PARA> Articles published in various newspapers and journals 1987-88.</PARA>
<PARA> Experience in the preparation of major submissions and documents 1982-88.</PARA>
<PARA> A close knowledge of the subject.</PARA>
<PARA> The confidence and support of the Noonkanbah Community.</PARA>
<PARA> (e)-</PARA>
<PARA> Freelance photographer for ten years.</PARA>
<PARA> Work represented in exhibitions including the National Gallery of Victoria, Curtin University and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies.</PARA>
<PARA> Work published in a range of journals and books including the bicentennial publication Photography and Australia (1839-1988) edited by Gail Newton.</PARA>
<PARA> (f) Drawn in full:</PARA>
<PARA> (g) The normal grant condition from the Australia Council.</PARA>
<PARA> (h) It is understood that they have.</PARA>
<PARA> (i) and (j) The manuscript has been completed.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) (a) Aboriginal organisations in remote areas throughout Australia are likely to experience difficulty in obtaining the services of an auditor at some time. The situation in particular locations will certainly vary according to the number of registered auditors in practice there.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Aboriginal organisations are expected to make their own arrangements for the auditing of their financial statements. The Minister would not, in many cases, be aware of difficulties these organisations are encountering unless these difficulties are brought to his notice.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) This information is not readily available for the last five years. For 1987-88 thirteen of the audited financial statements received to date by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs have contained what would be regarded as ``serious qualifications''.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) This information is not available for the past five years. For 1987-88 two of the audited financial statements received to date by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs indicate a possibility of misappropriation of funds.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) A curtailment of the release of funds and an insistence that remedial action is undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA> (f) At various times.</PARA>
<PARA> (g) This information is not readily available.</PARA>
<PARA> (h) Each case is considered on its individual merits. A possible head of public interest is involved in knowing how public funds are disposed of or accounted for, and the interest in promoting informed public debate. The strength of each claim is a matter for individual assessment in accordance with guidelines from the Attorney-General's Department.</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Grants unacquitted in Western Australia as at 31 December 1988 were:</PARA>
<PARA> Outstanding 5 years-Nil</PARA>
<PARA>4 years-1</PARA>
<PARA>3 years-2</PARA>
<PARA>2 years-25</PARA>
<PARA>1 year-70</PARA>
<PARA> (j) In Western Australia no unacquitted grants have been outstanding for six years.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) Audited Financial Statements for the Oombulgurri Association Inc. for the 1987-88 financial year did not contain any qualifications.</PARA>
<PARA> The current bookkeeping service is regarded as satisfactory. However, the Department plans to withdraw the accounts to a centralised accounting service in Kununurra in the future, which will provide a better co-ordinated service for a number of communities.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) (a) Steps have been taken to:</PARA>
<PARA> have the organisation's activities evaluated and reviewed,</PARA>
<PARA> appoint an independent body to oversight its accounting activities, and</PARA>
<PARA> provide training assistance to the community.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) (a) Mr Peter Ross is not now employed at Junjuwa.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) For Ngalinjatji only.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Departmental records do not indicate that these communities have so written.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) In respect of Ngalinjatji the community is small and does not have the resources to adequately administer a grant.</PARA>
<PARA> (13) (a) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Not to all the communities in the Region.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Three small outstation groups who did not have sufficient resources to administer CDEP grants were included in Junjuwa's CDEP with the concurrence of the groups concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> Junjuwa had and has the capacity to provide the support required.</PARA>
<PARA> (14) (a) A copy of the Departmental guidelines for the engagement of consultants is at Attachment A.</PARA>
<PARA> (b), (c) and (d) The consultants engaged, what they have done and what they were to report on, is outlined at Attachment B.</PARA>
<PARA> (e), (f) and (g) The information sought is substantial and is still being collected and collated by officers. I will arrange for that information to be passed to the Honourable Senator as soon as it is available.</PARA>
<PARA> (15) (a) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) No. The records were lost or destroyed by persons unknown.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) Not applicable in view of answer to (d).</PARA>
<PARA> (16) Yes; No. The most recent Audit report relating to Oombulgurri has no qualifications.</PARA>
<PARA> (17) (a) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Yes in relation to one creditor only.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (18) (a) Mr Cedric Wyatt.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Positions concerned are at the level of Administrative Service Officer, Class 6, 5 and 4. Together, the duty statements for these positions include 33 items. Those items relating to an ability to read and understand financial statements are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> ``In conjunction with other sections of the Department, monitor and review the effectiveness of approved projects and ensure compliance with financial and operations management control procedures.''</PARA>
<PARA> ``In conjunction with other sections of the Department, monitor and review the effectiveness of AEDP and ensure compliance with financial and operations management control procedures.''</PARA>
<PARA> ``Supervise and direct staff in the compilation of the Region's financial program and in the provision of management and administrative support services within the Region.''</PARA>
<PARA> ``Participate in the evaluation of the achievements of completed projects.''</PARA>
<PARA> ``Provide assistance to Senior Project Officers and officers from other Sections of the Department as required, in monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of approved projects.''</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (19) In order to withdraw block funding, the contracts between the organisations and the Department need to be renegotiated. Progress is being made in this regard and, to date, two major organisations have had block grants withdrawn:</PARA>
<PARA> Wangkatjunka-on 11 October 1988</PARA>
<PARA> Bayulu-on 23 November 1988</PARA>
<PARA> (20) The cumulative totals were:</PARA>
<PARA> 1 September 1988-NIL</PARA>
<PARA> 1 October 1988-28</PARA>
<PARA> 1 November 1988-65</PARA>
<PARA> 1 December 1988-112</PARA>
<PARA> (21) I am separately arranging for details of the organisations funded through the Derby Office to be forwarded to the Honourable Senator. Details of the funding by the Aboriginal Development Commission are being sought.</PARA>
<PARA> (22) Audit Office staff examined the report in the course of their audit in November and December 1988. In view of this, there was no necessity to formally bring the report to Audit notice.</PARA>
<PARA> (23), (24) and (25) The matters have been taken up with the organisation and inquiries are still continuing.</PARA>
