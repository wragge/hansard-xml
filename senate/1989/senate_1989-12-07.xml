<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>The Honourable President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA> Medicare cannot pretend to be a universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hardest hit by proposals to restrict access to items 6469, 274 and 275 on the Medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners humbly pray and request that the Senate will vote against any attempt to restrict access to abortion or any abortion-related items on the Medicare schedule.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate. We, the undersigned registered medical practitioners of Australia, oppose changes to general medical practice contained in the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act. We believe that:</PARA>
<PARA> There should not be two tiers of medical insurance rebates for General Practice.</PARA>
<PARA> Undergraduate training in general practice should be upgraded, and continuing medical education should be an independent activity controlled by the profession.</PARA>
<PARA> The mechanism for establishing the vocational register proposed in the Act is unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA> Vocational training for general practice should be structured so that appropriate skills can be acquired in a reasonable and not an excessive time.</PARA>
<PARA> The present and proposed Medicare rebates for general practitioner services are inadequate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I table the explanatory memorandum and move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the purpose of the Bill is to reduce the quorum of the Senate from one-third to one-quarter. Section 22 of the Constitution lays down that, unless the Parliament otherwise provides, the presence of at least one-third of the whole number of the senators shall be necessary to constitute a meeting of the Senate for the exercise of its powers. This Bill proposes that the number of senators required to form a quorum should be 19, rather than the 26 which are currently required. </PARA>
<PARA> There is little doubt that over the years there has been considerable growth in the demands on senators' available time outside their chamber responsibilities. First and foremost has been the dramatic growth in the Senate committee system. Most people accept that this has significantly increased the quality of Senate chamber scrutiny and, through that, the effectiveness of government. I remind senators that, by and large, Senate committees do not meet when the Senate itself is sitting, and that senators have to reserve substantial time outside sitting hours to fulfil their commitments to the various committees upon which they serve. This places concomitant pressure on the use of their time when the Senate is sitting. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that anyone would seriously suggest that all senators should be in attendance for every minute that the Senate is sitting. We have long accepted that there are many genuine demands on a senator's time which are quite a legitimate expression of the role of being a senator. The pairs system is a tangible illustration of such acceptance. </PARA>
<PARA> Ministers are heavily involved in the administration of their portfolios, and the tasks associated with representing in the Senate their colleagues in the House of Representatives. They have many calls on their time from Cabinet and Cabinet committee work. The Opposition front bench is similarly involved in the work of shadow cabinet, and other party office holders face like responsibilities. All senators must give up time to the demands of party and back bench committees. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to this, senators face an ever increasing volume of correspondence for their attention, and must meet with a wide variety of delegations and visitors. It is now more than ever the case that they have statewide constituencies. It is important, therefore, that we ensure that senators can carry out these activities without frequent and unnecessary disruptions, and that they can plan their schedules with as much certainty as possible. Reducing the size of the quorum and, hopefully, the frequency with which quorums are called, is one way of so doing. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal in this legislation is not designed to lessen the importance of the chamber. Attendance in the Senate and participation in its deliberations will still remain the most important role that senators perform. But it must be recognised that the quorum requirement does not of itself keep senators in the chamber. The standard of debate, the interest of senators in matters before the Senate, the level of importance or controversy-all these factors determine the attendance of senators. The quorum merely sets a minimum attendance level on the basis of what is thought to be a reasonable number of the total number of senators to take decisions on behalf of their fellows. </PARA>
<PARA> Altering the number of senators required to constitute a quorum will not affect the ability of any senator to call for a division of the Senate to decide a question. And the calling of a division, as we are all aware, invariably results in an attendance in the chamber substantially exceeding that required by the quorum provision. Section 22 of the Constitution envisaged that the quorum requirement could be subject to change in the light of senators' experience of the demands of their office. I believe that we have now arrived at the time when it is appropriate to make such a change. </PARA>
<PARA> The House of Representatives quorum was recently reduced from one-third to one-fifth. The Senate Select Committee on Legislation Procedures, in its report on 1 December 1988, found that, for the Senate, a quorum based on one-quarter of the senators-19 senators-seemed more reasonable than a quorum requiring the presence of only one-fifth. The Senate on Tuesday passed a resolution agreeing in principle to that recommendation of the Committee, and this Bill is designed to bring that recommendation into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The acceptance of this proposal will result in a quorum requirement which compares favourably with those operating in other legislatures both within and outside Australia. It will in no way diminish the power of the Senate, but will, to the contrary, assist in improving the working environment of senators. I commend the Bill to the Senate</PARA>

<PARA>(1) Page 1, clause 2, lines 8 and 9, leave out the clause, insert the following clause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``2. (1) Subject to subsection (2) this Act commences on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent. </PARA>
<PARA> ``(2) Subparagraph 78 (1) (a) (xcvi) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 inserted by section 9 of this Act is to be taken to have come into effect on 10 November 1989.''. </PARA>
<PARA>(2) Page 5, clause 9, after proposed subparagraph 78 (1) (a) (xcv), add the following new subparagraph:</PARA>
<PARA> `` `(xcvi) the Nursing Mothers' Association of Australia;'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The substantive amendment is to page 5, clause 9, which will add the following subparagraph:</PARA>
<PARA> `(xcvi) the Nursing Mothers' Association of Australia;'. </PARA>
<PARA>The first amendment is to have an addition to the Act to come into force on 10 December this year. The campaign to add the Nursing Mothers Association of Australia to the list of those associations that are granted tax deductability status has been running for quite some time. About six months ago I moved a motion in respect of this proposition which was defeated. The reasons that I set out at significant length on that day still stand. We are dealing with the second largest women's organisation in Australia and one which contributes-if one wants to put it in dollar terms-an extraordinarily large amount to the health and well-being of the Australian community. The Nursing Mothers Association of Australia has 1,700 counsellors in a very large number of local groups spread over the whole of Australia. The aim of the Association is to promote breastfeeding as being a desirable start to a baby's life. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be very much aware that the trend and the feeling in years past have moved very strongly in favour of bottle-feeding. Medical evidence showed very clearly that the significant increases in children's diseases, particularly infections, were such that there was a problem with bottle-feeding. This is not only an Australian problem but a world wide problem. The World Health Organisation mounted a very strong campaign in recent years to try to reverse the trend with regard to bottle-feeding, particularly in Third World countries. In those countries the very large number of infant deaths was attributable directly to bottle-feeding, mainly because of the inability to sterilise the bottles and to weigh and prepare sterilised amounts of formula for bottle-feeding. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia, while there would be very few cases of infection attributable to non-sterile bottle-feeding, undoubtedly the medical evidence is overwhelming that in a whole range of areas, breastfeeding is an extremely desirable healthy activity. In Australia it has led to a decreased mortality rate. There are long term health benefits, particularly in respect of the cardiovascular system, the digestive and respiratory functions and even, as suggested by the most recent material, brain functions. We can attribute quite clearly-quite a number of studies have done this in an incontrovertible way-enormous savings in the areas of hospitalisation, education and a whole range of other types of treatments. Not only does breastfeeding benefit babies, but recent studies have shown a decreased rate of breast and ovarian cancers in women who breastfeed. Since approximately one in 15 Australian women will contract breast cancer at some stage in their lives, the benefits of breastfeeding are clear. </PARA>
<PARA> This organisation is operating on its own funds, and provides a free service to Australian women. I suppose that I should declare my own interest in this matter in that my wife has been a long term member of the Association and a nursing mother's counsellor. So I am familiar with the enormous number of hours that these 1,700 women put in by counselling other women on the phone with regard to the first days, weeks and months of a baby's life. The Association's activities are not limited to the notion of breastfeeding. Given the way in which our society is structured in terms of the nuclear family and given that people in Australia move so often, as often as not, young women who have children do not have the support of their extended family. Whereas in the past in our society, almost every woman having a baby probably would have had a sister or some other near relative available to counsel her on the types of problems that she would meet in those early days and months, the types of difficulties and ways of overcoming them, that, now, is not available. When a baby has been crying, probably for hours on end, often enormous stress is placed on the woman. The ability to phone somebody, talk to that person about the problem and get reliable, factual, detailed information from somebody who is familiar with the difficulties and who has children and babies of her own, is of enormous comfort and help. I believe that it can be shown, quite correctly, to assist in the reduction of violence against children and babies.</PARA>
<PARA> In these amendments we are simply looking to allow the Nursing Mothers Association, that saves the community such a very large amount of money, the ability to raise funds and to have a tax deductable status while doing so. A large number of groups have such a status. I think it would be very difficult for a considerable number of them to be able to show that they provide anywhere near the benefits that this Association gives to the community. There is always a cost involved in these exercises. Now that the Government has withdrawn its grant from this organisation-it was given $73,000 in the last grant-the Association is operating with a deficit in the current financial year and is seeking to move into a large fundraising activity to try to cover that amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Lactation Resource Centre, which has been acknowledged as one of the best in the world, needs to be housed. An inventory, a library and training facilities need to be made available so that the centre can be of use. In doing that, the Association wants to get corporate and individual sponsorship. Undoubtedly, tax deductability in this situation will mean a far better response from the public. I believe that the type of funds that this Association needs to continue its very good work will be forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA> Since I last moved this amendment, the campaign by the Nursing Mothers Association has been a very active one. The Association contacted its members and asked them to write to the Government and to their local members about this issue, drawing attention to the benefits that would be accrued through its having a tax deductable status for donations. Some 10,000 letters have been written by Association members on this matter in the last six months. In response to that, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) issued a statement last Sunday in which the Government reversed its previous stance, having now decided to amend the tax law. The Treasurer in the press release said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has decided to amend the income tax law to allow deductions for gifts to the value of $2 or more made on or after 10 November . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The first part of my amendment starts from 10 November so that it coincides with that statement, made last Sunday, by Mr Keating. I think that all the members of the Nursing Mothers Association welcome the Government's decision in this regard. Fortuitously, since this is the first opportunity to legislate with regard to this issue, this Bill, which probably would have been debated last week except for the pressure of business, was actually held over so that it is available for us to amend. I urge total support for this amendment. My understanding is that the Government intends now to look in detail at the list of associations that have tax deductability status. That is a good idea. Some of the points made in the debate last time this matter was before us are worth looking at. But in any review, undoubtedly, this Association would be either at the top or very near to the top of the list of organisations that deserve that type of support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise not to speak against the amendments-indeed, the cause is most worthy and desirous of recognition-but to mention the lack of appropriateness of choosing the debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5), a contentious Bill about massive changes to corporate and superannuation taxation, in which to move them. Only yesterday we had a more appropriate avenue, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4), an omnibus Bill which dealt with a wide range of issues. Senator Macklin of the Australian Democrats is not correct when he says that this is the first occasion that he has had to bring his amendments forward. Yesterday was certainly an occasion when he could have brought them forward, and it would have been a more appropriate time to have done so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These very worthy amendments have effectively taken away the cut and thrust of one of the most horrendous pieces of taxation legislation that has ever come before this place. Indeed, the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) this morning chose not to continue his remarks in the committee stage because he wanted the issue to lapse as conveniently as possible. But I am not prepared to allow it to lapse. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, in his response yesterday concerning a dialogue between the Commissioner for Taxation and certain outside bodies, mentioned that there must be an outcome to those sorts of discussions. That outcome must be seen by the Senate to be manifested in tangible ways. It must be reflected in changes to both the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Taxation Administration Act. The Government must then demonstrate to us its bona fides and those of the Commissioner of Taxation so as to give full effect to the concerns of such outside bodies as the Australian Society of Accountants, the Taxation Institute of Australia, the Chartered Institute of Accountants and others. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier I raised the issue of the discretions of the Commissioner of Taxation under the Income Tax Assessment Act. They do not fit easily with self-assessment. Something has to be done about that in a tangible way. There has to be a mechanism by which it can be ensured that the internal arrangements within the Australian Taxation Office can cope with self-assessment and that those arrangements are fair and reasonable so far as taxpayers are concerned. We know that the Tax Commissioner is reviewing the question of an avenue, by means of a remission of interest payable where an assessment is amended, to encourage businesses subject to the new self-assessment arrangements to lodge requests ahead of their returns. That is fine, but we must go a lot further. This is just one of the myriad of areas that must be acknowledged and looked at. </PARA>
<PARA> The new ruling in this area masks a major problem with the new self-assessment program. Many tax practitioners believe that the Tax Office will be swamped with requests for rulings and will be unable to provide clarification within a reasonable period, thus leaving companies in the dark. With only a short time to go before the new mechanism is in place and no binding rulings as yet issued, companies have no guarantees of protection. Companies are likely to want to lodge requests for advice on any doubtful aspect as an insurance policy against paying both the interest penalty and the more severe culpability penalty which apply when a taxpayer withholds relevant information. The present legislation offers no protection for a company that makes a full and true disclosure of contentious issues in its tax return. Given that the Australian Taxation Office currently handles about 40,000 queries per annum from corporate entities and others, I ask what assurances can corporations receive from the Minister and from the Australian Taxation Office that this body has actually changed its structures in order to handle the mountain of queries that must surely eventuate from the introduction of self-assessment. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, there are a number of areas that need looking into. I note that the Government is not even listening to these questions, so we cannot expect a thorough response. Will the Government consider replacing the present system to provide options to the present harsh, unreasonable penalties which appear to apply in all circumstances? For instance, should a culpability penalty apply only in circumstances where there is no reasonable basis for the stance taken in the preparation of the return? Could not both the United States and the Canadian system of self-assessment be considered in the administration of penalties for so-called honest mistakes? There is a need for a taxpayer's right of appeal on a penalty, for example, where the penalty is less than 20 per cent of the tax imposed. We are looking at a new system of taxation, and the Government has changed only part of the system rather than the complete system as would be required in an open and democratic review. </PARA>
<PARA> In the name of open government, will the Minister advise the Committee of the recommended changes within the Australian Taxation Office to ensure that the system of self-assessment is fair and reasonable so far as taxpayers are concerned? In other words, will the Government table a copy of the minutes, or a portion or precis of those minutes, between the Australian Taxation Office and that selected group of so-called professional advisers that he has-we do not know who they are-that he referred to earlier when responding to similar legislation? The Minister is relying on this professional advice and making rulings on it when at the same time members of the profession are putting up their hands in horror and saying, `Yes, we like the thrust of it but, by cripes, you are killing the profession in the meantime and giving us a bad reputation'. There has to be a more open mechanism where these discussions can be put on the table of this chamber so that honourable senators know what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA> Under proposed new section 166a of the Bill, the current assessment notice for corporations will disappear as from next year. There are suggestions-they are only suggestions-from the Taxation Office that there will, however, be a form. Can the Minister advise the purpose and the likely contents of such a form and at what stage it will normally be issued? After all, we have legislation for self-assessment before us but no proper mechanisms so that people know where they are going and what rights they have. There is an uneasiness about the extensive use of discretionary power under the legislation. The question that must be asked is whether, under self-assessment, this discretionary power should be minimised or replaced with specific legislative enactments to ensure absolute certainty. Absolute certainty is associated with full disclosure because the penalties for failure are so horrendous. There needs to be proper and appropriate protection. What sort of government do we have here? Do we have a dictatorship which forces things down people's necks, giving them no right of appeal, and with no justice in the system? There must be justice. I hope that this chamber is the last bastion of justice in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> With subsequent administrative changes to both the Taxation Administration Act and the Income Tax Assessment Act, today's legislative changes put excessive discretion and decision-making power in the hands of bureaucrats rather than with the legislature. Merely saying that the Government is having discussions with some advisory group or another tends to diminish communication with this Parliament. It is up to the Minister to re-establish an appropriate communication to tell the people of Australia what is going on. He should not have discussions behind closed doors and issue, at a later date, legislation that is not appropriate to protect the rights of ordinary decent citizens. </PARA>

I will speak briefly and will not repeat Senator Macklin's thorough explanation of the reasons for the amendment, the worthiness of the Nursing Mothers Association of Australia and the valuable work that its members perform. The Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) has indicated the Government's support for the amendment. As has been mentioned, it was moved about six months ago but was not adopted because there had not been a chance at that stage to fully consider the proposal. In the meantime there has been fuller consideration, plus the campaign in support of it that Senator Macklin referred to, and much work within the Government in support of it.</PARA></TALK.START>

In the normal course of events, given the Treasurer's announcement last Sunday, deductability effectively would have come in from that date but presumably the provision for it would have been in a tax laws amendment Bill in the early part of next year which would have been passed at the time. However, it just happens that the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) is before the chamber at present. I hope that everyone will acknowledge the reasonableness of the Government in accepting a Democrat amendment rather than standing on its dignity and saying that as it was a Government decision it must be the Government which moves to put it in its own Bill. Again I express my support for the decision and the quick implementation of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to address some remarks and questions to the Minister under clause 1 of the Bill, the short title, because they are of a general nature and can therefore be best treated under that clause. As Senator Watson has very properly pointed out, this Bill is an extremely important Bill. The Bill when initially announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the Budget Speech on 15 August, purported to change quite dramatically the timing of payment of company tax by all companies except those with a tax liability of less than $1,000, which roughly speaking means companies with an income of less than $2,500, to cause all such companies to pay their income tax in respect of the previous income year very much earlier than previously. As the subsequent furore has very clearly demonstrated, that had the most horrific consequences for all companies, particularly small businesses. We all know that the Government does not worry much, or does not seem to worry much, about small businesses. It continually attacks them in one way or another. Nevertheless, that proposal would have had very significant consequences for them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My first question to the Minister is: why did the Government originally announce this legislation incorporating a major change of this kind without any prior consultation with industry? I can understand that there are occasions when governments do have to announce measures without prior consultation because to consult in advance may lead to the possibility of leaks, insider information and so on, which could have certain market consequences; therefore it would not be proper for government under those circumstances to undertake a consultation process. But no such arguments obtained in this case. This is a general change in the timing of tax provisions. I suppose one could say that, if the Government had consulted and word had got out, there could have been a fall on the stock exchange generally in terms of the impact of such changes on company profits and so on. But I regard that as a rather thin argument, if that is the kind of argument that the Government will advance. Why was there no consultation?</PARA>
<PARA> My second question is: given the palpable stupidity-I do not apologise in this context for using that word-of setting that initial threshold of $1,000 tax liability, which is roughly equivalent to a taxable income of $2,500, for companies and other related funds, et cetera to which the Bill is applicable, why did the Government originally propose a threshold of that kind in the Budget Speech?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Walsh" NAMEID="TJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of what kind-$1,000?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator STONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. That is my second question. The Minister does not have to take it from me that it was a stupid threshold; the Government subsequently admitted it. On 2 November the Government backed off the $1,000 threshold and substituted a $20,000 tax liability threshold, which is roughly speaking equivalent to a taxable income of $50,000 per annum. I simply ask: Why did it take the Government 2 3/4 months to arrive at such an obvious conclusion-that the original $1,000 threshold was wrong? Why did it not arrive at that conclusion in the first place? One reason, which I suppose is implicit in my first question, is that it did not consult anybody. My third question is: did the Government simply fail to understand the effects of such a measure on small companies?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My next question is: when the Government did start beating a retreat on its budgetary pronouncement through its statement on 2 November-that was its first retreat-why did it confine the exemption at that time to a threshold of company tax liability of less than $20,000? That would cover basically sole proprietorship-and not a very well-to-do sole proprietorship-because any sole proprietor business with a taxable income of more than roughly $50,000 would be over the threshold anyway. In other words, the Government's first retreat on 2 November still left the great majority of small businesses, including a lot of sole proprietors, exposed. </PARA>
<PARA> I make that point not merely because I want the Minister to answer the questions that I have asked, but also because it is important to note, as was noted in the second reading debate, that the $20,000 threshold still remains there for the future, apart from the so-called transitional year of 1990-91. So my questions about the applicability or suitability of a threshold of tax liability of only $20,000 still remain valid, under the Government's proposal under this Bill, for years after the next transitional year. I think the Australian Democrats will move an amendment on that, which we will no doubt debate in due course when we come to clause 36 of the Bill. I will reserve my remarks on the Democrats' amendment until that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Opposition announced on the morning of 22 November that it proposed to move an amendment in the House of Representatives to increase the $20,000 threshold to $80,000, I think-in other words, to quadruple it-which is the equivalent of a taxable income of roughly $200,000. Only then, later that afternoon, did the Government panic and put out what one might call its final position, or its position as finally reflected in this Bill. It went one better, so to speak-I do not object to that-and produced an even larger threshold of $400,000 tax liability, which is roughly equivalent to a taxable income of $1m. So hurried was that response by the Government to the Opposition's move earlier on the same day that in the Minister's statement he did not even include at that time an estimate of the revenue effects of the measure. That has since been rectified, as the Minister correctly pointed out yesterday morning, in the newly circulated explanatory memorandum. But, at the time, the Government was in such haste that it could not even put out a revenue estimate accompanying the change. I ask the Minister whether I am right in my belief, supported by that string of evidence, that what we have seen in this Bill is a catalogue of ill thought out, hastily conceived, hastily executed and inadequate-and I would almost say, unworthy-proposals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to Senator Stone's last question is: I do not believe so. To forestall Senator Watson getting excited again, the questions that he raised are not relevant to the clauses of the Bill that are under consideration right now. Therefore, I will not deal with them right now; I will deal with them later. In response to Senator Stone, the underlying purpose of this section of the Bill is to put incorporated enterprises on a more comparable and equal basis, in respect of the timing of the payment of their tax liabilities, to the great majority of taxpayers-that is, pay as you earn taxpayers. I am sure that Senator Stone understands that. Therefore, on those grounds, I do not believe that there is any in principle reason for exempting from the provisions of the Bill any incorporated enterprise at all, including what is virtually a sole proprietorship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As is often the case with tax legislation, judgments are made about the point at which the financial effects of dragging a large number of people under the coverage of a particular change are worth the additional administrative costs entailed for both the Australian Taxation Office and the people concerned. That is always a judgment. I do not think this is the first time that governments have changed the judgments they initially made about what is an appropriate cut-off point. I do not think the Treasurer, or anyone else, would claim that the cut-off point which the Government has now proposed is an infallible judgment. Therefore, people such as Senator Stone can dispute it and say that it should be something else. They may be right or they may be wrong. But somebody has to make a judgment about what figures actually get written into the legislation such as this and that is the prerogative of the Government, subject to it getting the legislation through the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Stone criticised the Government for not consulting the accounting profession prior to announcing the legislation. That is probably true; there was no consultation. But Senator Stone cannot have it both ways in saying, as he does, that the Bill will have catastrophic consequences for some businesses and also that it is so insignificant and trivial that there was no valid security bar on prior discussion with people within the accounting profession or with some businesses. In other words, if the position is really as catastrophic as Senator Stone claims it will be for at least some businesses, there are advantages available to people who have prior knowledge of the possibility of legislation. Senator Stone cannot have it both ways. </PARA>
<PARA> I was asked why the Government took so long-from, I think, Budget night to 22 November-to change the figure that was originally announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). Senator Stone might as well have asked me, `How long is a piece of string?'. Senator Stone implicitly says that the Government is incredibly stupid to have taken two months to announce that change. I could put a question to the Opposition like this: Given that the Opposition bases its capital gains policy on a presumption that that policy will change saving and investment behaviour in the right way, why is the Opposition so stupid as to fail to realise that behaviour cannot be changed retrospectively? It not only proposes to bring in legislation which makes an heroic assumption to underpin it; it also intends to make it retrospective. Behaviour cannot be changed retrospectively. I do not want to have a debate about that now. Senator Stone asked why the Government was so stupid that it took two months to change its mind about something. I might as well ask the Opposition why it is so stupid that it embraces a piece of legislation, or proposes a policy to be enacted, that is so stupid that it does not recognise that behaviour cannot be changed retrospectively. The last point I make is that we are indulging in another second reading debate rather than what is properly committee stage consideration. I hope we will not continue to do that for too much longer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the Minister's closing comment, I can assure him that there is no intention on the part of the Opposition to prolong these matters. The Minister would acknowledge that this is a very big and highly complex Bill. It is simply not possible for any speaker, including me, to cover in the course of a 30-minute second reading speech all matters which one would wish to address. I am taking advantage of the fact that we are now dealing with clause 1 of the Bill in committee to take up one or two additional points-one or two only-which I think bear further scrutiny. I ask the Minister to maintain his patience while we continue and conclude that process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am glad the Minister said that he was not proposing to debate the Opposition's capital gains tax. I am sure you would rule him out of order if we were to do so, Mr Temporary Chairman. We will debate that next year when the legislation repealing the capital gains tax is brought before the Parliament by the new Government. I do not want to be diverted further by the Minister in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I come to my second point, I want to say in response to the Minister's remarks that I have not made any claim that the Bill, as now constituted, will have catastrophic effects-I think that was the Minister's claim-because it has now been very considerably corrected. Indeed, as the press statement by the then Acting Treasurer on 22 November made clear, the Government's proposals, so far as they concern the transitional year at any rate, which was the immediate concern, will effectively exempt from the application of the Bill 98 per cent of companies. We would accept that if only 2 per cent of the companies are left to be affected by the Bill in that time one could hardly claim, and I have certainly made no such claim, that it will produce a catastrophe. The only companies that will be left, by definition, will be rather large companies. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator STONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I will accept that. Nevertheless, we are concerned here with small companies. I know that the Government is always concerned with big business but the Opposition concerns itself with small business, particularly. What I did say, in talking about the question of consultation, was that I saw no reason why the Government could not have consulted because I do not believe there were any such market sensitivities in relation to this matter. Had there been, they could have been resolved immediately by the Government making an announcement that it was consulting, thereby informing everybody. The whole point about markets is that, as long as one has a level playing field so far as information is concerned, there can be no question of people being placed in privileged positions by the consultation process. I do not accept what the Minister said about that. I think, on reflection, he will agree-I hope he would-that perhaps he was a little intemperate in that part of his remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will leave that matter there and come to another aspect I wish to raise under this clause of the Bill-the revenue or the financial impact. When these proposals were initially announced in the Budget Speech it was said that they would result in dragging forward-these are not quite the words of the Treasurer (Mr Keating), but they have this impact-into 1989-90 some $885m of revenue on a one-off basis and that in 1990-91 they would have an ongoing effect of saving $330m in public debt interest. That is because of the bringing forward of the time within the financial year at which company tax payments would have to be made, thereby relieving the normal Budget arrangements whereby the Budget is in deficit in the first six to nine months of the year and temporary financing-the issue of treasury notes or, in previous days, government bonds-has to be undertaken and interest costs are incurred by the Government in that process. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government says that in the initial financial estimate, because company payments would be made earlier in the year it would have to borrow less in the early months of the financial year than it had previously and that would relieve it of those temporary financing costs to the extent of a saving of $330m a year. I say that by way of background before going to the point I want to make because it is quite a complicated matter. From discussion with people outside I know that not everybody understands that sort of public debt interest saving point. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, when the Government beat its first retreat on this matter by announcing the initial increase in the threshold from $1,000 tax liability to $20,000 tax liability it announced that there would be very little loss in revenue gain this financial year. Again that is rather a puzzle to many people but it is actually perfectly logical because most of that revenue gain this year comes from so-called early balancing companies-that is, companies which balance not later than 31 May. The biggest of those companies is none other than Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, which balances on 31 May and which pays a very large amount of tax. Under the provisions of this Bill and the final Bill it will have to pay twice this financial year. It will have to pay 85 per cent of its tax liability before this financial year closes. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason the Government has amended the 15-day rule to the 28-day rule is to allow the transactions from 31 May balancing companies still to come within this financial year. Otherwise the Government would have lost the cosmetic benefit to the Budget of ripping $850m of revenue this financial year. It is purely cosmetic-one of the sleight of hand things that the Treasurer is renowned for and is so good at. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to speak more about the public debt interest estimate. In the 2 November statement the Government estimated that the public debt interest saving would now be reduced from $330m a year to $150m a year. I see an adviser shaking his head but I think I am correct that that was a statement made at the time. However, I am puzzled by one matter. I think Senator Short raised this in the second reading debate but did not get any response-although, to be fair, the Minister perhaps was not called on to make a response at that time. Senator Short pointed out that the revised explanatory memorandum, now based on the Government's final position of 22 November-not 2 November-still contains a somewhat reduced estimate for the revenue gain this year, which has now been reduced to $855m. That is a further loss of $25m from the position of 2 November. We accept and do not challenge that. It has to do with the fact that the Government has not made much difference to at least the big early balancing companies. But the estimate in the explanatory memorandum still has a revenue gain of only $150m in 1990-91 instead of the original $330m. </PARA>

I agree with the Minister when he says it is a public debt interest saving. In fact, it is not a revenue gain at all and so should be placed on the other side of the Budget. It is an outlay saving, not a revenue gain. But I will not take a point on the looseness of the language; it is just a technical oversight or slip. But I cannot explain-and I hope the Minister will explain to me-why the significant change between 2 November and 22 November has produced no apparent change in the estimate of the public debt interest saving.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The officials have just confirmed that Senator Stone has misunderstood the reference to $150m. That is the effect in the next financial year of companies being obliged to pay their tax liability on the day on which their assessment is lodged rather than 28 days afterwards. The amount of $880m or whatever it was in the Budget figure to be brought forward for this year is a one-off figure. On the revenue side there is an additional one-off figure of $150m in the next financial year because the companies will be obliged to pay on the day the returns are lodged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Stone raised some other matters. Other than to take account of the various relatively small changes that have been made, the Government has not changed its estimates of either the revenue enhancement this year or the public debt interest (PDI) savings flowing therefrom. I think the following is an exhaustive list. This year there is a $25m cost to revenue of the transitional provisions for companies with taxable incomes of up to $1m or thereabouts. The amendment which the Australian Democrats intend to move-to increase the limit for exempt companies from $20,000 to $80,000 tax liability-would cost an estimated $2m in revenue. The Government's decision announced last month, to increase the limit from $1,000 to $20,000 would be ongoing, not one-off, and would cost, at the outside, $5m, and probably somewhat less than that. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from those three matters, the revenue and PDI estimates that were put out in the Budget remain the Government's estimates. Like all such estimates, they will probably be shown to be wrong in the end. Indeed, it would be quite amazing if they were shown to be precisely right. But we have not seen any reason to change them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not detain the Committee for much longer on this matter. I thank the Minister for Finance for clarifying the explanatory memorandum's reference to the $150m figure. It is true that I-and Senator Short in his remarks yesterday-misunderstood that figure and thought it referred to the public debt interest saving. I am glad to have that clarification. It raises the question as to why the explanatory memorandum makes no reference to the public debt interest saving, unlike the Budget Speech. If I understood him correctly, the Minister has now said that the estimate has not changed, although I find that very difficult to understand.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The $25m is the saving because this financial year the Government will not get quite so much from the early balancing companies. As I understand it; there is no argument about that. But I am puzzled by another claim by the Minister, or the officials beside him, that there will be a very significant change in the timing of payments, from 15 days after balance date to 28 days after balance date for all companies between the day the Budget was brought down and 22 November, the date of introduction of the Bill into the Parliament. For a very great number of companies there will also be an extension of time to pay. According to the advisers and the Minister, this will not make any difference at all to the speed with which revenue is received into the Treasury and therefore the extent to which the Treasury is required to call on temporary financing, with the interest costs of doing so. I hope that I have not misrepresented the Minister in recapitulating what I think he said. All I can say is that I do not understand how that can be. But I will not detain the Committee further on the point. I would be grateful if the Minister, out of charity, could perhaps let me have some explanation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise a matter in relation to clause 8 of the Bill. There seems to be a good deal of confusion about this. As honourable senators would well recall, clause 8 of the Bill deals with tax-related expenses. This clause picks up what I call the Watson proposal, named after Senator Watson whose recent private member's Bill advanced the proposition which the Government has in effect accepted in this area of the Bill. I do not want to talk further about that as such. But I am sure that the Minister is aware that this has raised in the public arena the whole question of the deductability of interest on borrowings used to make payments of taxes. Yesterday's Australian Financial Review contained a report by Mr Barry Dunstan, who is a financial journalist of some repute. Mr Dunstan used to be the Finance Editor of the Melbourne Herald some years ago before he went to work for the Australian Financial Review. He is, therefore, not some cub reporter. Mr Dunstan has reported a statement by Mr Boucher in a manner which has left me, at any rate, more than a little confused. I have taken the trouble to get hold of Mr Boucher's press release dated 5 December, on which Mr Dunstan's report was apparently based. Although I think it is an attempt by the Commission of Taxation to clarify the public debate, I have to say that it still leaves me more than a little uncertain as to whether it totally does clarify it. I will come back to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I conclude my remarks on Mr Boucher's statement, I refer to the fact that this matter was touched upon in the press statement of the then Acting Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, on 22 November. I quote one short paragraph under the heading `Deductibility of Interest on Loans Used to Pay Company Tax' on page 3 of the press release. Mr Dawkins said:</PARA>
<PARA> Representations received on the company tax collection arrangements have also focussed on the issue of whether interest payments on loans taken out to finance income tax payments are deductible for tax purposes. In view of the submissions received from business organisations and tax professionals, this issue is being reviewed. The findings of the review will be announced in due course. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to make two comments about that. The first is that if there is no doubt about this matter, one wonders why these representations received should have given rise to the question and why the Minister should have seen it as necessary to include that paragraph in his press statement. The matter is clear either one way or the other: on the one hand, interest payments on loans taken out in order to pay company taxes are properly deductable as an expense of doing business, which I should have thought, on the face of it, they ought to be. If that is the case, I would have hoped that it could have been stated clearly at the time or simply been ignored. It would have been better to have it stated but the other course was available. If, on the other hand, they are not deductable, again I would have hoped that the Minister could have clearly stated that at the time. It would appear from the Minister's statement that there was genuine uncertainty. Otherwise, there would have been no need for the Minister to say `this issue is being reviewed'. So that is my first point, that there did appear on 22 November to be genuine uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA> The second comment I want to make is that this is now 7 December-which is 15 days later-and, as far as I am aware, there has been no definitive statement from the Government giving us the outcome of that review. I have to ask: Why not? We are referring to a ministerial statement; not a statement by the Commissioner. Given the rather keen interest, shall I say, of the business community in whether such interest payments on loans used to pay company taxes are or are not deductable, I would have hoped that the Minister would have taken early steps to remove the uncertainty. But so far at least, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has not seen fit to do that following his return from overseas. What we have had-if this is the response in lieu-is a statement from the Commissioner, who, of course, is perfectly appropriate; he administers the tax law and it is he, in the first instance at least, who would make such a ruling. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the Commissioner's press release of 5 December. It is a public document. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>COMMISSIONER SLAMS MISLEADING STATEMENTS</PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Trevor Boucher, today criticised misleading media comments on the deductibility of interest paid on borrowings to pay income tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The comments arose in the context of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1989, which is now before the Parliament. it has been suggested that paragraph 69 (5) (c) in clause 8 of the Bill proposes to make such interest charges non-deductible. </PARA>
<PARA> ``The proposed section 69 has no such effect,'' said Mr Boucher. ``All it does it give effect to the Budget measure to allow a deduction for expenses incurred by taxpayers in connection with the management or administration of their income tax affairs. Paragraph 69 (5) (c) is necessary to ensure that the payment of income tax and related financing costs is excluded from the operation of this section, and remains to be considered under the general deduction provision; section 51.''</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Boucher noted in this context the generally accepted view that interest charges on borrowings raised to pay income tax are non-deductible. </PARA>
<PARA> ``But in real terms,'' he continued, ``there is no practical basis for disallowing deductions for interest on borrowings forming part of a general pool of business funds from which tax is paid. And nothing in the Bill changes that either.''</PARA>
<PARA> In making his comments the Commissioner also drew attention to the review of this aspect of income tax law which was announced by the Acting Treasurer on 22 November 1989. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Committee. The Commissioner began by saying that he criticised misleading media comments on the deductability of interest paid on borrowings to pay income tax. He goes on to say that proposed new section 69 (5) (c) in clause 8 has given rise to this debate and what he calls `misleading media comments'. He points out-and I do not wish to challenge this in any way:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Paragraph 69 (5) (c) is necessary to ensure that the payment of income tax and related financing costs is excluded from the operation of this section . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is the section of the Bill relating to what I call the Watson amendment. That is fine; we have no quarrel with that. The press release then stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Boucher noted in this context the generally accepted view-</PARA>
<PARA>underline those words `the generally accepted view'-</PARA>
<PARA>that interest charges on borrowings raised to pay income tax are non-deductible. </PARA>
<PARA> ``But in real terms,'' he continued, ``there is no practical basis for disallowing deductions for interest on borrowings forming part of a general pool of business funds from which tax is paid. And nothing in the Bill changes that either.''</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with that-nothing in the Bill does change that. But I have to say with respect to Mr Boucher that his statement of 5 December leaves that uncertainty unresolved. He refers to `the generally accepted views that interest charges on borrowings raised to pay income tax are non-deductible'. He does not say that view is wrong; he does not controvert that view. He simply says:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . in real terms . . . there is no practical basis for disallowing deductions . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, I would have to agree with that, in a sense, too. It is obvious when one thinks about it that a company which has working capital involving borrowings, overdraft, or other forms of borrowings on which it is paying interest in the normal course of events, it does not, so to speak, corral its income tax payment and say, `I can't exclude from by business expenses that part of the interest payments on my overdraft which relates to the payment of my income tax'. It could do that, no doubt, if the Commissioner had a ruling which required it to do so, but I would wager that there are no such procedures. As a matter of practical business operation that will not happen and the Commissioner, in effect, acknowledges that in the penultimate paragraph of his press statement. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that is rather unsatisfactory. The Commissioner has acknowledged a `generally accepted view' that interest charges on borrowings raised to pay income tax are non-deductable, but in the next breath, in the very next paragraph, he says that `in real terms there is no practical basis' for disallowing them. I suggest that it is high time that matter was cleared up and a clear ruling given including, if necessary-in fact, preferably-changes to the law. I would have hoped that that was exactly the process that the then Acting Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, had in mind when on 22 November he made a statement that the issue was being reviewed and that the findings of the review would be announced in due course. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister to tell us how far advanced the review is, whether we are to take it that the Commissioner's statement of 5 December represents the formal outcome of that review, whether we can expect something more in that regard-I would hope so-and whether he has any other comments to make in relation to my general comment that, even as discussed in the Commissioner's statement, that leaves the issue basically in abeyance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I noted the Minister's comments earlier that he did not want to have a full second reading debate at this stage. The Minister can prevent a repeat of the second reading debate in the committee stage by answering the points that were raised during the second reading debate. I intend to raise a couple of points that were brought out then and to which we have had no satisfactory answers. The two points relate to true and full disclosure and the extension beyond the four-year period on which the Commissioner can amend an assessment, whether by increasing or decreasing it. As honourable senators are well aware there has been provision for full disclosure in the tax Act for a long time. If a person has shown true and full disclosure an adjustment could be made later to the effect that he is not liable to pay heavy penalties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As we move towards self-assessment and abridged tax returns, it may be a bit hard for a person to make a full disclosure; nevertheless, the disclosure may be truthful, to the best of his ability. Taxpayers will no longer be protected in that regard. In the case of the deductability or otherwise of an item, two answers could be given. The return could be contentious, and thus could be held over for three or four years. If a tax audit is conducted and an underpayment of tax is picked up, the person has to find not only the money to pay the tax but also the money to pay the penalty. The money to pay the tax may have been reinvested in the business. I believe that is an important point. There is no mechanism by which a person can ask for a spot assessment. I know that rulings can be asked for, but I think the Australian Taxation Office will be kept busy all year if rulings were asked for on every point. One has to ask: Does the ruling necessarily stick? As I said in my second reading stage speech, a commissioner may give an opinion this year, but a vastly different opinion may be given in four years time. </PARA>

The Commissioner, for some reason or other, can apply to the Federal Court to have the four-year period extended. I think it is reasonable for him to have that right, as long as it is not used when the Department has a backlog of cases to consider. It worries me that there is no provision-as far as I can see, unless someone can show me where it is-for the taxpayer to appear before the Federal Court and put his argument as to why that period should not be extended.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is taken from the Commissioner's press statement. It has been described to me as an interpretation of the law which, as far as I know, though, has never had the status of a formal ruling, but it has been the Commissioner's interpretation of the law that that is the case. It is a bit like wrestling with a column of smoke; it does not really mean anything, as the Commissioner's own statement in the second last paragraph suggested, because one cannot unscramble the egg. This is not the only example where it applies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Interest costs for personal housing are certainly not deductable from taxable income. Somebody may buy a farm-it is probably applicable in other circumstances as well, and it is certainly applicable in this circumstance-which costs $500,000. There may be a house on the farm that is worth $50,000 in which the new owner lives. The new owner may borrow $250,000 to pay the $500,000 total purchase price and claim interest on that $250,000, as a tax deduction. That deduction is allowed. Implicitly the taxpayer says, `I bought the house with my own money and I borrowed the money to buy the land', even though it probably has a common title deed. That happens, and some of us have known for a long time that it happens. I do not know whether anything could or should be done about it. Deductions from income tax for interest paid on one's own house are unequivocally not deductable, but there are certain circumstances under which that principle or that law is effectively unenforceable. I think the same applies to the question of whether interest paid on money borrowed to pay tax is tax deductable. The Commissioner's press statement does not constitute the Government's response to the review, which I think Mr Dawkins announced on 22 November, and I am afraid that I cannot tell the honourable senator when there will be a formal response. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Panizza asked me a couple of questions, firstly about whether the Commissioner will be seeking an extension of the four-year amendment period to five years, and secondly whether the same privileges would be available to an individual. I think that was the point of the honourable senator's question. </PARA>

In other words, it is not under the specific provisions of this legislation but under a more nebulous concept of natural justice. So I do not think the honourable senator has anything to worry about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the other question that Senator Panizza raised impinges somewhat on, or has some commonality with, the matters that Senator Watson raised earlier and focus on the fact that, under the provisions of this Bill, the assessment is made at the time the return is lodged; therefore, it is subject to immediate payment. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a self-assessment. If a taxpayer seeks a ruling or an opinion from the Tax Office prior to that, and the Tax Office can respond in time, there is no problem. But the fact that the lodgment of the return is now virtually the same thing as the assessment and the liability to pay means that the Commissioner cannot consider-I think I made a similar point yesterday; indeed, there is a fair bit about this in my second reading speech-the request for information, for a ruling, or for a de facto ruling, if he does not get the request prior to the lodgment of the assessment. I do not think that is entirely soluble unless the taxpayer requests the Commissioner for advice prior to lodging the return.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make a couple of other points. There may well be some problems in the administration of this-and I do not think there is anything unusual about that when taxation law is changed-but I do not believe that the problems will be as horrendous as Senator Watson's tone suggested. Senator Watson, Senator Stone and I are probably all old enough to remember when provisional tax was first introduced in 1951. Some extreme rhetoric was thrown around about that. The tax was likened to theft, confiscation and all that sort of thing and it was suggested that this was the sort of thing we would have expected if Hitler had won the war instead of losing it. It required non-pay-as-you-earn taxpayers to bring the timing of their tax liability closer into line with the timing of PAYE taxpayers, which is the same purpose that this part of the Bill has. Some of the people affected by those sorts of changes are always going to complain about them. But I guess that self-assessment is part of that as well. When self-assessment for individuals was introduced, I think in 1986, there were dire predictions of the unmanageable consequences of it. I do not think it was trouble-free, but I do not believe that the problems that arose were nearly as severe as the critics or commentators suggested. I believe that the same will happen in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Watson asked me to guarantee, to him and to the Opposition, that they will be satisfied with the outcome of the consultations which have already taken place and which the Commissioner has indicated will continue to take place. I cannot give him that sort of guarantee and I do not really think there is much point in talking about it any more. We will just have to wait for the outcome, and if Senator Watson is right, or is close to being right, he can belt the Government around the ears next year over it. But there is not really much we can do about it at this stage. </PARA>

I wish to further this debate on this question of the deductability of interest to finance income tax payments. I ask the Minister for Finance to clarify not only his statements but also the press statement of the Commissioner of Taxation. It appears from that statement and from the Minister's response this morning that we have another example of what I would refer to as target specific taxation, which is quite reprehensible. It appears from the Minister's example and the Commissioner's press statement that those large companies that are drawing their lines of credit in such a way as to cover a multitude of transactions, including the raising of taxation, will be able to deduct the interest paid on those lines of credit. In essence, that is what the Minister has told us. However, if a person who owns a small business goes along to his bank manager at a point in time and raises money for the purpose of paying this tax, that is not tax deductable. I ask the Minister to clarify that point.</PARA></TALK.START>

There may be ways of making it applicable if there were extensive amendments. The current review may take account of this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Watson mentioned small business. The usual line that comes from the Opposition is that every small business person is up to his neck in debt, but Senator Watson now proposes that few or none of them are in debt. Conceptually, I do not think it matters much whether they are in debt or credit. If someone who has a credit-an interest earning deposit-and no business debt gets a tax assessment which wipes out his cash deposit, he no longer earns interest on that. So on the other side of the coin, he is getting the equivalent of a tax deduction for his interest payments, that is, he is no longer being assessed for the interest that he is no longer receiving but that he would have been receiving if he had not had to pay his tax assessment. In both cases, and in almost every case that I can think of, the underlying reality is that it is unenforceable, regardless of what the law might be. That has been the case for a long time. Perhaps some government, decades ago, should have acknowledged this and decided whether it would explicitly acknowledge that the law is unenforceable and tried to make it enforceable. I find it difficult to see how one could do that without huge administrative problems and discretions, which normally the Opposition, and other people, do not like. I do not see any point, Senator Watson, in pursuing it further. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the attention of the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) back to self-assessment. I am fully aware that, when one lodges a self-assessed tax return, that is the assessment. As the Minister said, one can get a ruling beforehand if there are any contentious issues. I totally agree with that, but unfortunately it takes a long time to get a ruling from the Australian Taxation Office. There are certain deadlines one has to meet when lodging a tax return if one does not want to receive a penalty. I will give an example of a case of a tax ruling that has taken a long time and, I believe, has not been resolved yet. It is to do with pre-harvest and post-harvest wheat payments. That case has been around since September in the Australian Wheat Board letter. There was one opinion. Then I believe that opinion changed and now it has changed again. So one can see the time that it takes to come up with a ruling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Where there cannot be any other safety measures implemented which prevent those penalties being imposed-when there is a case of two answers on a contentious issue-one may be able to look at the idea of lodging a self-assessment return, subject to a Commissioner's ruling which has been asked for: not a Commissioner's ruling on the assessment lodged, but one that has been asked for before the assessment was lodged. One may be able to lodge an assessment subject to that. If the Commissioner's ruling goes in a way which it was not expected to, then one may have the right to amend one's assessment without incurring penalties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I meant to say before-and it is relevant to what Senator Panizza said-that, if there is some claim for a deduction which a taxpayer believes will be allowed but which may not be, then ideally the taxpayer gets a ruling from the Australian Tax Office before lodging the return/assessment. It may not always happen, either because the taxpayer was too late in lodging the request or because the Tax Office cannot respond quickly enough. I believe that this is correct and, if it is not, I will ask the officials to tell me so. In such a situation the taxpayer lodges the return/assessment on the assumption that the taxpayer's interpretation of the particular claim for deduction is correct. If it is subsequently disallowed by the Commissioner, who then increases the assessment, he may impose interest on it for late payment, and impose a penalty. But the Commissioner also has the discretion to waive both. I would expect that in that sort of case that is precisely what the Commissioner would do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know that various members of the Opposition criticise the extent to which the Commissioner's discretion is available. While I can see some merit in that, it is often the best way to resolve those issues. If the Commissioner does something really outrageous there are other appeal mechanisms available, including the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, although some of us may have reservations about whether that should be used. I suspect that Senator Stone shares my views on that. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Commissioner does have this discretion to waive penalties and interest in that sort of situation. On the other hand, if the taxpayer is just putting up try-ons or worse, the purpose of which is pretty clearly to defer the payment of the taxpayer's tax liability, I would expect the Commissioner to apply both interest for late payment and some sort of penalty. In those circumstances, I believe that the Commissioner should do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I go back to the question originally raised by Senator Stone and also addressed by Senator Watson-the question of interest being deductable. I would like to be a little more specific, because the answer that the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) seems to be giving is that it would be wise for all people who find themselves obliged to meet the new timetable for paying taxation to maintain a pool of borrowings so that they may be able to have deductable interest payable on moneys raised to pay that tax. What happens in the grey areas? What happens where there is a facility to raise funds but no funds are raised, and the borrowing of the funds or the drawing on that facility coincides with the need to make the tax payment? What happens where people clearly do go and raise loans which match the sums that they have to meet by way of taxation payments? Does that mean that there is one rule for some and one rule for others? When will there be a definite ruling so that people who are obliged to make those decisions can do so with a clear conscience?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The hypothetical situation that Senator Bishop has put up, if I have understood it correctly, is: what happens to a company-it could also be an individual-which is neither in credit nor in debit and it gets its tax assessment, say $10,000, and it goes out and borrows $10,000? I suppose the number of people who would be in that exact position would be negligible anyway. But I think what the Commissioner is saying in the press statement is that the law really has been unenforceable. While not attempting to read the Commissioner's mind or speak on his behalf when I am not authorised to do so and, indeed, do not feel competent to do so, I think that what is being said in that press statement is that the interest paid on money borrowed to pay the tax liability would in one way or another become tax deductable. If Senator Bishop would like an answer from the Commissioner on the question she has put, I will ask the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to get a definitive letter from the Commissioner on that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With respect, it seems to me that the press statement that has been incorporated by Senator Stone seems to be, in the first paragraph, firstly an intimidation saying, `It would be better if you don't claim it', and then further down in the statement `If you do claim it, it will probably be okay'. Far from Senator Walsh, in his answer, covering the answer to my so-called hypothetical question, the situation could be that a corporation or an individual is in debt to the tune of, say, $100,000 and they get a requirement to make a payment requiring a borrowing of $20,000 and the Commissioner decides that that extra raising was very simply done for the purpose of meeting the taxation payment. Is it within his discretion to so do, or is he saying in that press statement that he simply will not do it? It seems to me that he is wanting to have a quid each way.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to reinforce what Senator Bishop has said. In effect, what she is doing is simply drawing out a further conclusion, and a very important conclusion, to the point I originally raised. I am sure the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) is correct when he says that in practice, probably, in most cases, the Commissioner of Taxation will not, shall I say, strike out as an expense an interest cost incurred by a taxpayer who actually borrows to pay his or her income tax; company tax in the case we are referring to, but income tax generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hope the Minister will agree with my earlier comments that the situation we now seem to have, which is well distilled in the press statement that has now been incorporated in Hansard is totally unsatisfactory. On the one hand, the Commissioner refers to the `generally accepted view' that such interest costs are not properly deductable. He does not say that that general view is wrong. On the contrary, the clear implication is that it is a `generally accepted view' within the Tax Office as well, and if people actually come to the Commissioner and ask for a ruling, that is the generally accepted ruling they will get. But then the Commissioner goes on to say, in the immediately following paragraph-I am quoting from memory now-`In real terms the practical effects are as follows'-namely, that since money is fungible and one has borrowings for a multiplicity of purposes and interest payable on all of those borrowings, it is going to be difficult for the Commissioner to sort out those which are made for purposes of paying tax and those which are made for other purposes. That was the Minister's example about somebody buying a farm on which a dwelling house exists. I think he was right in what he said in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> I just put it to the Minister that this is a pretty unsatisfactory state of affairs. Here I pick up a point which I think Senator Watson was making earlier-and I hope I am not misinterpreting his comments. I think he was saying that when this Bill becomes law companies will be required to self-assess but they will no longer have, under the new provisions, a course open to them of putting before the Commissioner a true and full disclosure of a doubt in their minds arising out of their own self-assessment processes, including the doubt in this area. I put it to the Minister: When this Bill is law, what if a company draws up its own assessment of its income tax liability for the year in question, but in the year in question it actually paid its income tax for the past year and did so on the basis of having made some borrowings and incurred some interest as a consequence? Does it include that interest as an expense or does it exclude it? Let us assume that it includes it. Under the present provisions, it would, I presume, say to the Commissioner, `We have included this interest cost but we are not absolutely sure that that is the way the law stands. Therefore, we bring it to your attention that we have included it so that if you rule otherwise, you can exclude it'. That would protect the company from any penalty if the Commissioner did in fact vary its own assessment. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem, which we will come to in more detail when we get to clause 36 in a formal sense, is that the new provision does not allow for that kind of protective process on the part of the taxpayer. The example we are talking about now, which is the consequences in that regard of the continuing uncertainty as to whether or not interest payments on borrowings which are in practice used to pay income tax bills is deductable, is one of the uncertainties against the taxation consequences of which a taxpayer can no longer protect himself in terms of the new section 36. So I hope the Minister will understand that there is a genuine problem. I am not expecting him to be able to solve the problem today in the Committee, but it would be nice if he acknowledged that the problem exists, and if he were to tell us that, in his opinion at least, he will be advising the Treasurer that the problem does exist and that he ought to get it settled. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no good the Minister saying that, on the one hand, the Commissioner has a generally accepted view of the law but, on the other hand, he does not enforce the law. That is rather like saying, `We could have in this country a uniform speed limit of 30 kilometres an hour applying throughout the whole country, but that nobody would enforce it because it would be a stupid law to have; but we should not worry about it on that consequence because nobody would enforce it'. That simply brings the law-in the case of speed limits in that analogy-into contempt. I suggest that if we have a `generally accepted view' of the law, to quote the Commissioner, which says that interest costs in respect of borrowings made to pay income tax payments are not deductable, but that he is never going to enforce it or will do so very rarely, that also brings the tax law into contempt. I think that is undesirable. </PARA>

I am trying to make the point to the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) that all the points that have been raised here are of very great significance. But we have added this complication of introducing the self-assessment system and, consequently, setting up a situation where, as Senator Stone has just pointed out, there is no finality that can be established in favour of the taxpayer or otherwise. The problem is that there is a continuing in-limbo situation where there is no understanding of the final effect of the law and where the Commissioner of Taxation himself, according to his press release, is not prepared to say one way or the other what the law is. We think that is a very unsatisfactory situation which goes to the heart of the parliamentary debate on this piece of legislation. Quite frankly, unless we have a clear indication from the Minister as to what the law is intended to do and what it really means, why should Parliament support a law that is so faulty in its effect and its application and which clearly has not been explained properly by the Government?</PARA></TALK.START>

I think it has been a general understanding in the accounting and legal professions for a long time, but now we have the comments of the Taxation Commissioner, as reported in his press statement yesterday, which raise serious doubts about that. The more important question I wish to add to Senator Stone's remarks is this: What is the intention of the Government in including in the Bill clause 8, which sets down a specific prohibition on deductions of interest in these cases? Does this have a retrospective effect? Does it apply because of the new self-assessment provisions? Is it intended that it apply to all taxation paid by corporations or is it only to apply to that corporation tax which is incurred as a result of the application of the new collection system? What is the Government's intention in this regard? I think it has a bearing on how we understand what the Commissioner of Taxation is trying to say about the deductability of interest under section 51.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am amazed to hear Senator Watson say that, because implicit in that comment is the idea that, if there is a bit of a hole in the tax law somewhere and a few people in the know are exploiting it, then that is all right. There is a problem; the Government has acknowledged that there is a problem. I think it was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, whom Senator Stone has already quoted, who said on 22 November that there was a problem and that we were having a review. I think the Commissioner's press release acknowledges that there is a problem, but I do not think we should rush into hasty commitments about what will be done about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is not a new problem. This problem was also applicable-although it may be more obvious now-in the days of a taxpayer putting in his or her own return and the Commissioner making the assessment. The treatment of interest paid on money borrowed to pay tax, like last year's tax, would depend on whether the taxpayer who submitted a tax return specified whether he or she had paid the $10,000 tax assessment six months ago. That applied before self-assessment. Senator Messner may be right in that it is perhaps more obvious now, but it did exist before. He can be sanctimonious about this Government's negligence and the present Commissioner's negligence and the negligence of every commissioner and every government for the last 50-odd years. It has become more obvious and we are reviewing it, but I repeat that I do not think we should rush to any hasty conclusions. </PARA>

It seems to me that there is a need to be very careful in giving a precise, detailed response to this problem in case we open up other loopholes in the tax law.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This will be my last point on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1989. The Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) admitted that there has been a slight awakening of the sleeping dog. But in this case he has to admit that this Bill treats taxpayers differently in regard to their cash flow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One can take the case of the average wheat grower in Australia who starts laying out expenditure around 1 April-coincidentally, just after the tax bill is due to be paid, which is generally 31 March. That is the time at which the wheat grower will normally commence to go into debt. The highest point of debt, or the lowest state of one's finances, is when seeding is finished; then, in August one sells the wool clip and the harvest then comes in in November; and the highest point of cash flow-the highest amount in the bank-is in December-January. Following that one starts paying expenses, including overdraft and that is when the tax bill comes in-while one is still in credit. One pays the tax bill but by doing so, in theory, one's bank account is run down to almost zero. That year is finished, another one starts and one starts borrowing again. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that such a taxpayer can legitimately claim every cent that he has paid in interest. He has paid tax out of his farm income and borrows later so that he still has a cash flow to plant the new crop. That is vastly different from the case of people who have an average cash flow, whereby money keeps flowing in as it is flowing out. Such a taxpayer has to borrow when there is suddenly a lump sum tax bill to pay, and obviously cannot claim the interest. The point I am making is that in this legislation that distinction is not drawn, and such taxpayers should not be treated in the same way. </PARA>

As far as the taxpayer is concerned, he must be spot-on at the time he lodges his return. Could the Minister catalogue the items and the areas which he intends to change-either by legislation, internal procedures or taxation rulings-to ensure that there is a greater element of certainty to enable the taxpayer to prepare his return in the knowledge that he understands the law completely?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to follow up Senator Bishop's question and the answer given by the Minister. I go back to some of the earlier remarks that he made in respect of whether there has been full and true disclosure of interest claimed as a deduction in respect of tax payments. Apart from clause 50 of this Bill to which Senator Bishop just referred, we should perhaps remind ourselves of the present procedures which the Commissioner for Taxation adopts for the amendment of assessments under the present law, which apply until this Bill is adopted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, as I understand it, the Commissioner cannot attack an assessment where there has been full and true disclosure by the taxpayer of all the relevant facts and circumstances. Secondly, if there has been an innocent error by the taxpayer in claiming an expense, then there can be a reopening of the assessments by the Commissioner, going back three years. The third situation is where there has been fraud or evasion of taxation liability by a taxpayer. Of course, then the Commissioner has total power to reopen the assessments. Those are the three categories of circumstances which are set out in section 170 of the present Act. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill seeks to change that by introducing a single test-that is, the return having been lodged, it is assumed that everything has not been cleared by the Commissioner and, therefore, he has a right under this Bill to go back and amend assessments for a period of up to four years in whatever circumstances. If there has been fraud or evasion, naturally the old principle applies-the Commissioner can open up the assessments as far back as he wishes to go. The changed situation applies to most companies. As the Minister has now pointed out, under clause 8 of the Bill this applies to all taxpayers, not just corporations. With the changes to the self-assessment system and the changes to the way in which the disclosure principles will apply, it seems to me that the effect of the law is that the Commissioner will now be able to attack the situation of any taxpayer where interest has been claimed in the past, up to four years, by virtue of the inclusion in this Bill of clause 8, which specifically denies deductions for interest payments in respect of taxation borrowings. That is the point which we are concerned about. Quite clearly, if the answer to the question that I am now raising with the Minister is yes, surely this is a backdoor method of reopening assessments for four years in respect of taxpayers in whatever category. By every stretch of imagination, it is something that would have to be regarded as an unintended consequence of the Government's Bill. I therefore seek the Minister's response to those points. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I return to the point that we were discussing, which Senator Bishop first raised in connection with clause 50 of the Bill. With respect to her question, the Minister responded-I think I have it right-that interest in respect of tax borrowings would be tax deductable under section 51 of the principal Act. Therefore, clause 50 of the Bill would have no effect in respect of those items which had been previously deducted and which may, by virtue of her argument, have been subject to the re-opening of assessments by the Commissioner of Taxation under the new amended provisions regarding self-assessment. I subsequently asked further questions about that, but I just want to be certain that I understand the Minister correctly.</PARA></TALK.START>

I heard the Minister say that they would have been deductable not under clause 8 of this Bill but under section 51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Does the Minister see the point I am making? The Minister was saying, as I understand it, that because the interest has been claimed under section 51 there is no prospect of the assessments being re-opened. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the attention of the Minister to the Scrutiny of Bills Alert Digest No. 16, dated 22 November, in which the Scrutiny of Bills Committee states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The effect of the amendment-</PARA>
<PARA>to an assessment-</PARA>
<PARA>is to authorise the Commissioner to amend determinations to decrease or increase an amount of credit for any reason within four years of the date of the original determination. The period was previously three years. </PARA>
<PARA>It is important to draw it to the Government's attention that the Committee regards a possible decrease of taxpayers' credit after four years rather than three as being one of considerable detriment to taxpayers. That view confirms, in a way, the general spirit of the points that the Liberal and National parties have been making during this debate as to exactly what the intention of the Government is in these amendments. Quite clearly on reading this Committee document, taxpayers are going to suffer a detriment. The Minister has just told me that clause 8 of the Bill will apply only from 1 July 1989, but there will still be some detriment because it will be possible for the Commissioner to re-open assessments back to at least 30 June 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that these points need to be made because it is not at all certain that we on this side of the chamber can conclude that this Bill does not have some ulterior purpose which has not yet been properly understood or divined by the Senate. As a result, I have to remain very much outside of those who would support this legislation because, quite apart from the general principles we have debated in the second reading stage about the new system of collection of corporate taxes, we now find that clause 8 will affect all taxpayers and not just corporations. That raises very significant questions about what the Government intends in respect of the self-assessment procedures as outlined in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, Senator Bishop has raised her concern in respect of clause 50 of the Bill, which appears to have some retrospective effect. On top of all this, we have the very dubious press statement from the Commissioner of Taxation in respect of this situation, which entirely clouds the issue, as Senator Bishop pointed out, by taking a bob each way on the outcome. It is totally unsatisfactory for the Parliament to be asked to pass a Bill which is lacking in certainty. One of the prime principles of legislative practice, surely, is to ensure that the law has certainty. I believe that we in the Liberal and National parties have done our best this morning and this afternoon to draw out from the Government its intention in respect of these various clauses. But even the Minister would have to admit that there is very considerable doubt still remaining as to the exact effect of certain parts of the Bill which we have been discussing. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this Bill is a bad Bill. It ought to be opposed not just on the general grounds that we have raised at other times, but because it appears to have inherently faulty areas which are not consistent with the general understanding of the law. This opens very significantly the question as to whether we are putting into law a clause and a new principle which has not previously been accepted and which may very well have a retrospective effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Those things need more debate and more concentration of legal minds, in my view, before we proceed with this Bill. It is not in the best interests of the country that we proceed with this Bill until these questions are finally ironed out. I add that it is capable and competent for the Government to excise the relevant clauses of this Bill concerning self-assessment and clause 8, which covers the deductability of interest, without affecting the general thrust of its Budget measure, which was to provide for a new collection system for corporations. It has been made clear that the Bill has a wider effect: it does not just apply to corporations. It applies to individuals and other business entities. The Bill appears to go far further than was contemplated. As a result, it does not deserve the Opposition's support. I believe that the Government should act to remove those very questionable clauses from the Bill, with our support, and proceed with its Budget measure as it wishes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-In speaking to clauses 43 and 49 of the Bill, I raise a matter brought to my attention by Senator Tambling, from the Northern Territory-a letter sent by Chief Minister Marshall Perron to the Treasurer (Mr Keating) concerning the superannuation contributions tax. I also refer to page 6 of the second reading speech presented by Minister Walsh. The first paragraph under the heading `Taxable contributions to superannuation funds' reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill will also correct a technical deficiency in the superannuation tax provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>I presume that that is a euphemism for saying, `We got it wrong'. Marshall Perron's concern is this: he says in his letter to the Treasurer that he is writing to express his concern at the amendments being made, particularly to section 274 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, because of certain unintended consequences resulting from earlier amendments in June 1989. Mr Perron states:</PARA>
<PARA>In announcing the changes on 16 October 1989 you emphasised that these further amendments to Section 274 would not alter the intent of your original commitment outlined in a press release on . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The letter states `11 August 1988'. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> At that time you stated that where a benefit paid by a concessionally taxed superannuation fund is financed by a one-off contribution from the employer when the employment ends, the fund, in conjunction with the employer, would be able to elect to have these payments treated as tax exempt contributions, with end benefits referable to such payments taxed at the 15/30 per cent scale (for retirement at age 55 or over). This provision, which was developed following consultation with the States and the Territory, is of particular importance to public sector schemes which provide employer-financed benefits on an unfunded basis. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Perron states further that the amendments proposed in the Bill do not fully accord with the earlier commitment given by the Treasurer and do not suit the financial arrangements underpinning a number of public sector superannuation schemes. Specifically he states:</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments appear to be predicated on the assumption that there will always be sufficient pre July 1988 unfunded liabilities to compensate for the removal of the exemption for the pre July 1983 component of benefits funded by `last minute' contributions. This is not a well founded proposition. The extent of pre July 1988 unfunded liabilities depends on the date a superannuation scheme commenced and whether any prior service is recognized for benefit purposes. Recently established schemes may have minor or no pre July 1988 unfunded liabilities although they may easily have members with a pre July 1983 component to their Eligible Service Period as a result of recognized employment prior to scheme membership or as a result of a rollover from another scheme. The blanket withdrawal of the tax exemption for the pre 1983 component of benefits is therefore considered inappropriate and unjustified, particularly, in the context of public sector schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>The final paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA> I would urge you to review the amendments now before the Federal Parliament to ensure that they retain the full intention of your earlier commitment. </PARA>
<PARA>To the best of my knowledge, that letter has not been replied to. Will the Minister tell me what consideration has been given to the undertakings that were given by the Treasurer to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory during the negotiations which took place between the Federal Government and the States and Territories?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, the Senate is dealing with two companion Bills, the Marine Navigation Levy Bill 1989 and the Marine Navigation Levy Collection Bill 1989. The Opposition supports these Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Marine Navigation Levy Bill proposes to substitute a levy for the current light duties imposed on commercial ships, introduce a sliding scale of levy and transfer the authority to raise revenue from the Lighthouses Act 1911 to the levy Bill. Clause 3 of the Bill covers definitions, including the definitions for tonnage, necessary for the interpretation of clause 7 which deals with the amount of levy. The levy is to be imposed on commercial ships to fund the Commonwealth provision of navigational services and is covered by clause 6. </PARA>
<PARA> To date, light dues of 53c per net registered tonne per quarter have been imposed under the Lighthouses Act 1911. Under this Act, marine navigation aids are provided by the Commonwealth and are financed by their light dues. Since 1915 the light dues have been collected by the Australian Customs Service. At that stage they were levied at a rate of eight pence a net registered ton payable each three months. Clause 7 sets out the actual amount of levy to be paid. It has been calculated on a sliding scale following reference to the ship's tonnage. The scale is 63c for the first 5,000 tonnes; 53c for each tonne over 5,000 up to 20,000; 43c for 20,000 to 50,000 tonnes and 33c for each tonne over 50,000. As is clear from the scale, the levy reduces as the tonnage increases-the smaller vessels paying about 20 per cent more and larger vessels 20 per cent less. A vessel of 72,000 tonnes will pay $6,900 less per quarter and a 200-tonne coastal vessel will pay $20 more. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1973 a system of cost recovery has been instituted. Prior to that the Government carried about 20 per cent of the cost which effectively represented a degree of assistance or subsidy to the industry. It also covered non-commercial users, such as the Government's own non-commercial ships, pleasure craft and the fishing industry. Under the new levy rate the above group remains excluded from the levy via the regulations, just as it was under the Lighthouses Act. Historically, light dues were based on earning capacity. Since 1983 the light dues have remained unchanged. The changes to the dues contained in this Bill have their origins in the Department of Transport and Communications investigation two years ago into a fairer way to institute cost recovery amongst those who benefited from the provision of navigational aids. </PARA>
<PARA> There are about 380 navigational aids around the coast of Australia which cost in the vicinity of $39m per year. Nearly one third of those are located in the Great Barrier Reef and Torres Strait areas. The cost of operating the aids has fallen over the past few years, mostly as a consequence of improved technology. With this in mind, clause 8 (2) provides that the rate cannot be increased by regulation more than 15 per cent per annum. I must comment that with the fall in maintenance costs I would have thought that a more realistic maximum level would have been in line with inflation, but perhaps this 15 per cent is a brief insight into what the Government thinks the inflation rate might be next year or the year after under its economic policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The companion Bill is the Marine Navigation Levy Collection Bill. The authority to raise the marine navigation levy was transferred from the Lighthouses Act 1911 to the levy Bill and this Bill to ensure that there were no constitutional problems following the High Court's decision on the Air Caledonie International case concerning the valid way of legislating to collect such levies and taxes. This Bill provides for the administration of the levy imposed by the levy Bill. The system itself, according to the Government, does not change with the transfer. The levy remains related to the commercial activity of the ship. The liability to pay the levy is covered by clause 6 and when the levy is payable, by clause 7. In terms of the payment, the levy is to be paid quarterly on the first day of each quarter for a regular coastal ship. Dependent on the circumstances, other ships are liable either on the day of arrival or the day of departure. Clause 7 (4) exempts ships from paying the levy when they call at an Australian port for shelter, repairs, to change crews or to seek medical assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The power to make regulations is contained in clause 12. The items to be covered by regulation include those ships which are exempt for the purpose of clause 6 (1). These ships, which are exempt under the Lighthouses Act, will be the same and they include military ships, government ships other than those in commercial use, a ship under 24 metres in length and missionary and hospital ships. </PARA>
<PARA> I would just like to make the point that, according to the Government, this is one of the planks in the Government's reform of the waterfront-reform which I am sure you, Mr Deputy President, would agree is long overdue. Not long ago the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) identified the fact that inefficiencies within our coastal shipping industries are costing the Australian economy up to $550m a year. Further, various investigations have estimated that the cost of coastal shipping is between 20 and 50 per cent above what it should be if the necessary reforms were instituted. The IAC in a report released recently noted:</PARA>
<PARA>Notwithstanding the important efficiency gains which should flow from the coastal shipping reforms, the nature and pace of change may be inadequate to address current inefficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA>It continued with a full appraisal of problems of the waterfront and in regard to coastal shipping it stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The inefficiencies of the waterfront and lack of competition in the provision of shipping services remain major impediments to a competitive Australian shipping industry. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the Government will turn its mind to the fundamental and very large cost penalties that are being imposed on Australian commerce and on the nation as a whole by the persistence with these gross inefficiencies on the waterfront. The Opposition supports these Bills and wishes then a speedy passage through the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce to his clarifying statement yesterday in which he tried to tidy up the bother he caused the Government with his honest comments at a news conference where he suggested that interest rates in Australia were likely to be higher than in the rest of the world until the end of the century. I ask the Minister to clarify that part of his clarifying statement in which he referred to the potential for interest rates to `fall substantially next year as a response to the current business cycle downturn' by telling the Senate, firstly, whether he is predicting that rates will fall next calendar year or next financial year; secondly, whether he believes, in line with his comments about the dismal 10-year outlook, that if they do come down they will most likely go up again some time later; and, thirdly, when the downturn is likely to occur and how long it is likely to last.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have repeatedly said in this chamber that I will not predict interest rate levels at any particular time. However, in terms of the current business cycle, as I have said on numerous occasions in the Senate, monetary policy will not be relaxed until such time as there is better control of demand in the Australian economy. I believe that the signals are such now that they are getting more persuasive than they were earlier. Last month we were talking about totally different signals being given by different indicators. In so far as the clarifying statement is concerned, it needs some clarifications even in the light of Senator Chaney's question. For example, Senator Chaney suggested that I said yesterday that interest rates would remain higher than interest rates in the rest of the world until the end of the century. I said no such thing. I quote from what I did say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is not going to be easy here in the next 5 or 10 years and I believe that relative to some other countries we will have relatively high interest rates for some time.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what I said. There were numerous reports of what I said, some accurate and some inaccurate. For example, the report in the Melbourne Sun News-Pictorial by a journalist who did not attend the press conference-and who did not even bother to look at the transcript, I would say-is extraordinary indeed.</PARA>

It is not unusual, I suppose, to look at comparative periods of history.

In light of the recent shocking events in Sydney and the apparent increase in attacks on elderly women, has anything been done to assist local councils in attempting to protect urban communities through planning and service delivery?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator REYNOLDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Local councils are very much aware of their responsibilities in regard to assisting and protecting their communities. They are involved in a wide range of planning and service delivery functions. Over recent years, many councils have increasingly become concerned about issues relating to crime prevention. While this obviously is seen as primarily a State and police matter, nevertheless councils have become aware of work that has gone on overseas and of ways in which in the local government sphere they, too, can become involved. Many councils have initiated and been involved in Neighbourhood Watch and safety house schemes. Under our local government development program this year, I was pleased to be able to fund a program which involves the Fairfield and Waverley councils in a pilot scheme to look at crime prevention in those urban areas. The work they are undertaking will provide a very useful guide to many other councils throughout the country which are concerned about crime, vandalism and other issues that are making many communities very unsafe, particularly for women but for all people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to the tragic series of attacks on elderly women in North Sydney recently, both Mosman and North Sydney councils are working to find ways to offer further protection to elderly women and to the communities generally. Mosman, as I am sure honourable senators will be aware from reports in the press, has offered escorts to elderly women so that they are not obliged to go out alone. North Sydney has taken the initiative of convening a meeting with senior citizens groups and they are working towards a major forum to look at this issue along with a number of other issues affecting elderly residents in the area. That will involve the police as well.</PARA>
<PARA> My office is currently working with both Mosman and North Sydney councils to produce a booklet aimed at providing practical ideas for women, councils and community organisations to bring together a range of measures which can offer greater security to women living or travelling alone. While the booklet which we are working on with those two councils will be particularly concerned with issues affecting the personal security of women, we believe that by bringing together a range of information and suggestions from councils around Australia the booklet will provide a great deal of information for everybody and, indeed, will offer protection to men and women-anybody who lives or travels alone. I look forward to the release of that booklet. It is a very important project and I commend North Sydney and Mosman councils on the work that they are trying to do.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister and Minister for Industrial Relations. I refer to the Minister's previous response to Senator Chaney in which he said that he thought the economic figures now were a good deal less strong than they were a month ago; I think he actually called them `very different signals'. Against that background I refer the Minister to today's Australian Bureau of Statistics figures showing very strong growth in full time employment last month, only slightly offset by a marginal decrease in part time employment-in other words, a very strong total employment growth-and also showing that the work force participation rate, that is, the propensity of people actually to take jobs, is at a record level. While increased employment is always welcome, I ask the Minister: First, how does he reconcile those figures with what he said a few moments ago in response to Senator Chaney; secondly, is the continuing strength of the labour market likely to delay interest rate relief even further?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I saw those figures. Of course, employment is always a lagged indicator of economic activity. Employment starts to fall usually several months after demand, and it does not necessarily measure demand. Whereas many indicators such as retail turnover, for example, reflect demand pressures, the labour force figures also reflect increasing supply. If we in this country are to redress our balance of payments problems, we need to maintain production while reining in demand.

I am certainly happy to take this opportunity to add my own very sincere congratulations on this occasion. The Government considers that the award of the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize to the Dalai Lama was a very fitting recognition of his patient efforts to find a peaceful solution to the problem of Tibet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Government's position on Tibet is well known. Australia acknowledges that Tibet is part of China; no country recognises Tibet as an independent state. At the same time, we consider it important that universally accepted standards of human rights are observed in Tibet, including the right of Tibetans to practise their cultural and religious traditions. We are particularly concerned about reports from Tibet of detention of people engaged in peaceful demonstrations, ill-treatment of prisoners and harsh sentences for dissidents. We have conveyed to the Chinese Government on a number of occasions our deep concern over the human rights situation in Tibet. Mr Hayden did so during his visit there some time ago. I have raised Australia's concerns with the Chinese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, on several occasions, most recently at the United Nations General Assembly in New York in October.</PARA>
<PARA> We have also made representations to the Chinese Government seeking the lifting of martial law in Lhasa and on behalf of Tibetan prisoners of conscience.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator McLean for giving Mr Humphreys and me notice of the question. I am advised that the article in the New Scientist was about an explosion in 1953 in a chemical plant in West Germany. Although Justice Evatt considered studies of the effects of the explosion the article is not about the studies referred to in the Royal Commission report. The researcher referred to in the New Scientist article is disputing a 1985 report by a German industry association that is responsible for liability claims. Disputes over liability claims are to be expected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The explosion was only one of several industrial accidents considered by the Evatt Royal Commission. The Commission studied reports on the 1953 explosion and many reports on other industrial accidents. Given that the discussion of the 1953 explosion occupied about six pages of the Royal Commission report, it is hard to see how this formed a major basis for Justice Evatt's conclusions. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs will investigate whether the new study is significant. However, the article is based on a paper presented at a symposium rather than a report published in a scientific journal and the matter could take some time to clarify.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean also referred to the Ranch Hand study. This study was subjected to extensive review prior to its commencement. Nearly 100 government, academic and industry scientists have guided and contributed to the study. It is one of the authoritative studies on the possible health effects of phenoxy herbicides and dioxin. Recently developed blood tests have confirmed that Ranch Hand veterans had significant exposure to dioxin. In November 1988 the United States Congress made $3m available to the Ranch Hand study for the development of further blood testing. That is not the sort of commitment that is given to studies that are seriously flawed. Perhaps Senator McLean would like to take up these issues further directly with the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA> On the question of how Australian Vietnam veterans have been treated, the Minister would like to emphasise that the repatriation system is generous and the determining authorities are required to grant claims by Vietnam veterans unless they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they have no relationship with Vietnam war service.</PARA>

In the Minister's defence White Paper, the two zones clearly had different implications for defence capability. The first closer-in zone-the 10 per cent zone-was one where we would have direct military capability; the second was one where we would have an area of strategic interest and we would, of course, follow what was happening in the region, but that would not necessarily involve our having military capability to reach to the outer limits of that second zone.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A glimmer of a light is beginning to come through the fog, Mr President. What Senator Vallentine is doing is mixing up a number of different considerations. In terms of referring to an ability to defeat an aggressor, what we are talking about is a capacity-and that is clear in the substance of the report later on, just as it is clear from the White Paper-to defeat an aggressor on Australian soil or within our maritime jurisdiction-the capacity to defer or defeat attacks on Australian territory in that sense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The larger concept of security, which involves doing our best by the use of a variety of policy instruments, not just military ones but diplomatic ones and so on, means preserving, so far as we can, stability-positive security and strategic environment-in that larger region. It is in the latter sense that it is relevant to talk about the scope of this particular paper, just as it is relevant in that sense to talk, as the defence White Paper did, of an area of primary strategic interest. But that does not mean we are not talking about, or have any inclination to have, a capacity to exercise that military capability over the entire larger geographic area.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is rather hard to ask a question after that last one from Senator Michael Baume. I am not as offended as he is about being ignored by the cartoonists. My question is directed to the Minister for Resources. Has his attention been drawn to reports of a statement by the Leader of the National Party which says that the Government has adopted a new quarantine policy which-I will quote it, because it would be unbelievable otherwise-`reverses the policy of the last 200 years'? Can the Minister advise honourable senators of the details of this new quarantine system and of the 200-year-old system to which Mr Blunt is so attached?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I saw in yesterday's Orange Central Western Daily newspaper a continuance of the campaign by Mr Blunt of shameless scaremongering in his untrue campaign to portray the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service as doing less than justice to the needs of this country. He said, or at least he was quoted as saying, in the newspaper, `We are relaxing quarantine standards in Australia'. That is just not true; we are not; we never have; we do not intend to. He said in the paper, `Changes to protocols'-he referred to fruit as being one of them-`places Australia at great risk'. This was said in a fruit growing area. He is obviously referring to fire blight and that is the context of the report. We have not signed a protocol on fire blight. For Mr Blunt to stump this country pretending we have is mischievous. He has said, as Senator McMullan has quoted in his question, that he supports essentially a no risk policy, that we have a minimum risk policy and that reverses the policy of the past 200 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Either Mr Blunt is deliberately misleading people or he just does not know what in fact the case is. There has never been a no risk policy in this country. There was never a no risk policy during those long Rip Van Winkle years in which the Liberal and National parties held government in this country. There was no policy of no risk then. There is no policy of no risk now. There is a minimum risk policy. To have a no risk policy would be to call the ocean surrounding Australia a moat, draw up the drawbridge, shoot anything that comes into our airspace or catch anything that comes into our waters. The only way that we could have no risk would be to admit no travellers and allow no interchange between Australia and any other country. That is entirely fallacious.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Blunt, as a spokesman for a country party but with an urban base, obviously may not know what major rural organisations in Australia think. In 1988 the National Farmers Federation told the Lindsay quarantine review committee that it opposed a no risk policy because it would `prevent imports of necessary animal and plant material, disrupt trade and passenger traffic and encourage illegal traffic of potentially dangerous materials'.</PARA>
<PARA> I think the words from Mr Blunt in his continuing campaign as the Leader of the National Party have to be nailed once and for all. I have publicly warned Mr Blunt that if he continues this campaign he will bring Australia's exports into question by consuming countries overseas, and that will rebound badly on agricultural producers in this country. That remains the case. But it waxes odd and strange for Mr Blunt to make these allegations when, in the Economic Action Plan, the Opposition proposes to cut between $23m and $26m off the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and at the same time trumpets that it will be more effective. The Quarantine and Inspection Service has been closely reviewed by this Government. It is a tight, lean and mean organisation that does not have any spare money. If the Opposition cuts $23m to $26m from its Budget it will be rendered ineffective and the quarantine protection that is available in Australia will be reduced.</PARA>
<PARA> Before I conclude my answer to Senator McMullan, I need to make one other comment. An article that appeared on 5 December this week in the Central Western Daily newspaper of Orange was headed `Fire blight big issue in the election'. Next to the article was a photograph of the Liberal candidate John Loneragan, with Ewen Cameron, David Hawker and Neil Andrew, saying that this was an election issue. I repeat in this chamber that the Government or the Quarantine Service has not signed any protocols about fire blight. To continue to try to turn this into an election issue is to promote the idea of the big lie.</PARA>
<PARA> This Government has published a discussion paper about how we could recognise areas in New Zealand which are free from disease, take imports from those areas and not use our quarantine laws as a non-tariff trade barrier. That is what we have done.</PARA>
<PARA> To turn that into an attack upon the Quarantine and Inspection Service is read in international newspapers by consumers of agricultural produce coming out of Australia in a way which is detrimental to our total trade effort. Yet, this John Loneragan, supported by the Liberal Party, intends to make this an election issue. If he does, it will be to the detriment of Australia. He is joined in that idiotic pursuit by Mrs Joanne Lewis, the National candidate for the seat, who is promoting this myth as well.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my answer by saying that the Quarantine and Inspection Service maintains an open stance, is available for consultation, acts according to the best technical advice and makes assessments after it has consulted with the affected organisations. We make those decisions so that the world trading community can see that we have a service that acts to protect Australia from exotic disease. It is not a non-tariff barrier. People who complain about greater competition should not complain that our wool is prevented from penetrating international markets, that our wheat equally is guarded against free market competition and that other rural products, including beef, are being so thwarted in free competition internationally. I think the conservative Opposition should pause, think about this campaign and stop it.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the decision of the High Court in the Park Oh Ho case it was unanimously held that the detention of applicants was illegal. Custody was found to be unlawful for two reasons. The first was that the deportation orders were found to have been signed for an improper purpose, which was to maintain the prohibited non-citizen in custody to be a witness in a prosecution. Those deportation orders were therefore void from their inception. The Koreans were not deportees. The provision allowing for the custody of deportees could thus not be relied upon to authorise their detention. Secondly, custody pursuant to section 39 of the Immigration Act must be pending deportation. Custody for the purpose of keeping a person in Australia as a prosecution witness was found to be not pending deportation. On the other hand, the New South Wales Supreme Court has recently handed down a decision which stated that it would be a contempt of court to deport a person who was a witness subpoenaed to appear in a criminal prosecution. The court granted an injunction preventing the Department from executing the deportation order against that person.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These two decisions create difficulties for a departmental officer in cases where the deportee is a witness in a criminal prosecution and where there is a significant risk that that person will abscond. According to the Supreme Court decision, the department officers face the prospect of being held in contempt if they attempt deportation. However, according to the High Court, they also render the Commonwealth liable to civil claims for unlawful detention. Rather than maintaining custody, because of the risk of civil claims, the Department may be left with no choice but to release the deportee regardless of the risk of absconding.</PARA>
<PARA> The decision in the Park Oh Ho case has other implications. The possibility also exists that the Commonwealth may face actions for unlawful detention as a result of the deportation order subsequently being set aside by the Federal Court for other reasons, for example, for reasons of natural justice. In many cases it is appropriate to detain deportees prior to their deportation. It would be extremely difficult for custodial officers to predict whether, at some future time, the Federal Court may decide that an order is void. The Department also faces the dilemma that the custody, which was initially lawful as the purpose was pending deportation, may become unlawful if it is found that the purpose has changed. My Department is seeking further legal advice on these questions. It may be necessary to appeal the State Supreme Court case or amend the legislation in order to meet the legitimate State and Commonwealth needs.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the statements made by Mr Peter Collins, which I have to characterise as being blatantly untrue. They in fact show the New South Wales Government's total lack of sensitivity on this issue in a crude attempt to score some political points. The acquisition of the three cemeteries within the airport site is being arranged as part of the Government's decision to acquire all properties within the airport's site boundaries. The first stage of the proposed airport development will not disturb the cemeteries located on the airport site. Development of the airport is proceeding in such a way as to avoid, as far as possible, intrusion into the cemeteries. However, the Catholic Church has nonetheless indicated that it wishes to move quickly to relocate the cemetery to a new site and has sought the Commonwealth's assistance to enable this to happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The parish priest, Father Evans, is of course concerned that the matter be treated with sensitivity. He has asked in particular that he handle all the discussions with relatives of the deceased and all necessary discussions and negotiations with the State Government. The Commonwealth has agreed to this request, accepting that he is better placed than anyone else to undertake these arrangements, given their personal, sensitive nature. Father Evans has indicated all along his desire to have the relocation take place with as little publicity as possible and is most concerned and annoyed that the New South Wales Government, through Mr Collins, appears to have ignored his wishes and instead has chosen to make a political issue of the matter. Father Evans has also expressed his appreciation for the sensitive way in which Commonwealth officials have dealt with the matter. Let me quote what he said on PM last night:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . they've been bending over backwards to be as understanding as possible, so much to the extent that in our agreement they've said that because I pastorally know the people and care for them, they've been quite happy to allow me to do the negotiations with the people.</PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, in answer to Senator Collins's question about Mr Peter Collins, I think it is up to Mr Collins and the New South Wales Government to act in a little more dignified and compassionate way. The track record of the New South Wales Government is always to be the maverick, always to go to the press before it has proper negotiations with Ministers or anyone else. That is its style. Thank goodness it has only two years to go.</PARA>

That includes the ownership arrangements and the areas of activities which are currently designated for each of them. Such a review was foreshadowed at the time of my statement as Minister for Transport and Communications in May 1988.

I hope that this issue can be resolved as quickly as possible. That is commonsense. In most industrial sites, certainly most new industrial sites, agreements are being reached which provide for one union, or two unions at the most, on site. An alternative course is a place with a long industrial history, many different employers involved at that site and many different unions. The objective of reaching fewer unions is to be supported.

To the contrary, President Ceausescu recently confirmed that there would be no deviation from the kinds of what are, essentially, totalitarian policies that he has pursued to date.

In the United Nations Commission on Human Rights Australia recently co-sponsored the resolution which expressed concern at human rights abuses in Romania and appointed a special rapporteur to investigate the situation in Romania and, in particular, the campaign of forced assimilation of Romania's ethnic minorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This campaign increased in tempo in early 1988 with the decision to proceed with a program of so-called systematisation, calling for the demolition of over 7,000 villages to make way for so-called agro-industrial centres. Most of the villages affected are in Transylvania where the population is predominantly ethnic Hungarian. Australia shares Hungary's concerns over the Romanian Government's program of systematisation and the inherent human rights abuses that entails.</PARA>
<PARA> Coming to the last part of the question, the Soviet Union has also expressed concern at the situation in Romania but, in line with its commitment to allow the countries of eastern Europe to pursue their own policies, has not taken any direct action. We have no information or evidence to suggest that any such action might be imminent or likely.</PARA>

The industry representatives had raised with me the problem that industry sees in being able to plan future investment. As they see it, there is a never ending increase to the National Estate and, that being the case, investment decisions for a lightweight coated paper mill are difficult. I indicated to Mr Bain-my understanding is that the Prime Minister indicated something similar-that I could understand the difficulty that industry was having. The best illustration of this is in the south-eastern forests of New South Wales. Senator Cook is going through the process of identifying prudent and feasible alternatives to logging in National Estate areas. Now we have discovered that there are some further nominations for areas which we were considering as prudent and feasible alternatives. If that process continues, obviously it will be difficult for Senator Cook to find any prudent and feasible alternatives.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen a number of statements attributed to the Australian Mining Industry Council (AMIC) criticising the Government on several grounds. Inventively, AMIC has chosen Eureka Day, the anniversary of the insurrection at Ballarat with the Eureka Stockade, to act as a counterpoint to its announcements. This throws up very interesting mind images of major executives of leading mining houses in Australia identifying with raggedly and bearded miners at Ballarat. I do not know whether we should cast Hugh Morgan as Raffaello Carboni or Peter Lalor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I understand that the motivation of the criticism of the Government is dissatisfaction with the Government's decision about Kakadu. But the criticism has gone much further than that. I applaud AMIC's commitment to the concept of sustainable development. But in arguing, as it does excessively, that areas of Australia are locked out of mining, it overstates its case quite dramatically. No more than five or 10 per cent of this country is closed off from mining and that is because of urban development, nature conservation and Army or Defence lands.</PARA>
<PARA> As well, AMIC criticises our economic policy in general terms. At least we have an economic policy to be criticised, unlike the Opposition. But the mining industry has been a massive beneficiary of deregulation, of structural adjustment, of the improved industrial relations climate, and of the micro-economic reform that the Hawke Government has instituted. Indeed, if we look at an index of mining performances we see that there has been a massive improvement in the export index for resources; massive improvements in foreign earnings for mineral exports; and company profits, comparing 1984-85 to 1989-90, have improved in the mining sector from $3,593m to $5,350m-an increase in 1988-89 of 14 per cent over the previous year.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Archer asked me a question on 6 December about a directive issued by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) regarding the use of side-facing seats and whether those used in the RAAF Hercules aircraft complied with that directive.</PARA>
<PARA> I have obtained the following information for Senator Archer.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1986 the CAA issued an airworthiness directive specifying that side facing seats must be fitted with a suitable occupant restraint system. This was in accordance with international practice and recognised that in the event of emergency deceleration or impact, occupants of these seats are at greater risk than occupants of forward or rear facing seats.</PARA>
<PARA> The restraint system would have to include features that protected occupants from the forces involved.</PARA>
<PARA> The recent amendment to that directive formalised an arrangement whereby, if the side-facing seat was not to be used during take-off or landing, a placard would be placed on the seat stating this prohibition. The owner would not then be faced with the cost of the upgraded restraint system. This covers the situation, for example, where the side-facing seat may be used only in flight as part of a lounge or sleeping arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA> RAAF aircraft are operated to military standards and are therefore not subject to the CAA directive.</PARA>
<PARA> Many of the Honourable Senators would have travelled in the RAAF Hercules recently and would know that the aircraft are fitted with seat belts, and that RAAF personnel take great care to ensure that each passenger's seat belt is securely fastened before the aircraft takes off.</PARA>
<PARA> As the CAA directive does not apply to the RAAF aircraft, there is no basis for the suggestion that there would be difficulties with insurance in the event of an accident.</PARA>
<PARA> While the Hercules aircraft obviously do not provide the level of comfort provided in airline aircraft, I am certain that there are a large number of people in the community, particularly those travelling for compassionate reasons, who are grateful to the RAAF for providing services during the disruption to the airline industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Calvert asked me a series of questions on the proposed air transport trials to Antarctica. I informed the Senate yesterday that the 1985 report, which had recommended against the use of air transport to the Antarctic, had investigated a different system from the one which is now proposed to be used. I can now confirm that. The 1985 report assessed a proposal based on the use of a compressed snow runway 25 kilometres inland from Casey. Last summer, a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) team inspected an area where it is possible to construct a combined ice and snow runway at a distance of about seven kilometres from Casey. This site has the advantage of allowing operational support from Casey. The RAAF team concluded, therefore, that air operations are feasible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The United States of America decided to withdraw from the McMurdo-Casey flights for two reasons: first, the United States was concerned about the preparation of the skiway, which it felt was too rough and hard for ski-equipped aircraft-mind you, we are not proposing to use those-and, secondly, United States officials were unhappy that the flights were being used to carry people not directly involved in scientific research when the original purpose of the arrangement had been to provide mechanisms for short-term visits by scientists. In fact, politicians were the overwhelming percentage of passengers.</PARA>
<PARA> The cost of constructing a runway at Casey is estimated at $316,680. Given the proximity of the runway to Casey, the Casey doctor will provide medical services. Rescue services will be provided by the Casey search and rescue team. The 1985 report estimated that up to 30 per cent of flights might have to return due to deterioration of the weather after the flights commence. The Bureau of Meteorology advised that, on the basis of the procedures which it now proposes, the number of return flights due to a deterioration of the weather after a flight commences should be substantially less than 30 per cent and probably of the order of 10 per cent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Tambling asked me a question concerning a party of Hong Kong travel agents visiting Kakadu. As I indicated yesterday, when one sets fees for Kakadu, Uluru, or anywhere else, they are expected to be met. The honourable senator will recall that, when it was decided to introduce park use fees at Kakadu at the commencement of this year, I reduced the fee to $5 per person from the $10 originally announced. In my media release of 18 November 1988 advising of this decision I indicated that the lower charges were aimed at softening the impact on the tourism industry. Given the relatively low park use fees charged and the magnificent attractions that Kakadu offers, it was not considered necessary at that time to provide for the waiver of these charges in special circumstances. Therefore, Professor Ovington, the Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS), has no authority to waive the payment of charges which I have approved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Regarding the recent visit by the party of Hong Kong travel agents, I am advised that the Darwin Tourist Promotion Association was able to give only a couple of days notice of the visit to the ANPWS. Professor Ovington was made aware of the visit and the request for waiver only the day before the visit. As there was inadequate time to refer the matter to me, the National Parks and Wildlife Service had no option but to advise that it could not agree to the request for waiver.</PARA>
<PARA> I recognise the present difficulties of the tourism industry in the Northern Territory and, naturally, I wish to assist in its recovery as much as possible. With this in mind I have asked the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service to make an assessment of the implications of waiving park use fees for bona fide travel agents on genuine familiarisation tours to Kakadu and Uluru national parks. In the light of this assessment I will make a decision on whether to authorise the Director to waive fees in such circumstances.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I was asked a series of questions by Senator Short regarding the Buy Australian-Made campaign. I made some inquiries yesterday and I can inform the Senate that Senator Walsh, Mrs Kelly and the Prime Minister have never spoken to Bob Hogg or any other senior Labor figure about the awarding of the Australian-Made campaign to John Singleton Advertising Pty Ltd. I have their word. The Prime Minister has also assured me that he has never spoken to John Singleton about this contract at any time. Senator Short asked whether John Singleton had contacted the Prime Minister, members of the ministerial committee, or other mysterious Australian Labor Party members once he became aware that the evaluation committee had recommended against his agency and before he presented his revised submission to the ministerial committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My office contacted Mr Singleton yesterday to check the facts. He confirmed the statement that he had made on national television recently that he was totally unaware of what any evaluation committee had recommended until the matter was raised in the Senate last week. Appearing on the Today program with Senator Bishop on 29 November this year, John Singleton, when he was asked by Terry Willesee about the committee's recommendation, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Yeah I found yesterday that there was a committee who recommended, well I don't know whether it was unanimous, but they recommended the Luscombe campaign to the Ministers and the Ministers knocked it on the head.</PARA>
<PARA>I apologise to the Senate as I do not think I have done John Singleton's character justice. In relation to a supplementary question asked about some mysterious letter to `Neil' that appeared in the revised submission of John Singleton Advertising, there was a hint of some big conspiracy because it was sent on the Government Whip's facsimile machine. However, Senator Short's paranoia has got the better of him. The simple facts are that the letter of 21 May 1989 is from Mr Norm Spencer of the Advance Australia Foundation to Mr Neil O'Keefe, the Federal member for Burke. Neil O'Keefe contacted the Foundation in May seeking information on the success of the previous Australian-Made campaign. The reason he had done so was that he was moving a motion in Caucus the following week requesting the Government to renew the Australian-Made campaign and he wanted the information for that purpose.</PARA>
<PARA> In mid-August Neil O'Keefe appeared on Peter Couchman's television show praising the virtues of Australian-Made campaigns. He drew upon the information provided to him by Mr Spencer in that interview. Shortly after that program Mr Singleton rang Mr O'Keefe and asked for a copy of the figures Mr O'Keefe had used on the show about the success of the campaign. The figures were in the letter sent by Mr Spencer on 21 May and Mr O'Keefe saw no problem in forwarding John Singleton this information and subsequently faxed him the letter. He used the Government Whip's machine because his own machine was broken. At no stage did Mr Singleton attempt to solicit support from Mr O'Keefe for his campaign and at no stage did Mr O'Keefe ever raise this matter with any member of the ministerial committee. Those are the facts on this matter and I hope that Senator Short takes a few deep breaths and relaxes.</PARA>

Consideration for the needs of Customs' clients, both private and commercial, was foremost in the deliberations. It is a fact that the majority of customs matters at the Gold Coast have always been handled from Brisbane, and customs officers are always available to attend at the Gold Coast where personal attention is considered necessary. A toll-free 24 hour telephone service to the Brisbane customs office has been installed for local residents.

It is worth noting that in this report there is basically major disagreement between the Government and the Auditor-General about the Government's approach to his office and his effectiveness in auditing governmental bodies, particularly government business enterprises, and about the whole question of efficiency audits. It is worth noting, as the Auditor-General does in the overview, that the enormous amount of work done this year and the issues raised are against a background of continuing uncertainty over the audit mandate of the Australian Audit Office-that is an uncertainty generated by this Government, I believe; of continuing high levels of staff turnover-once again generated by difficulties created by the Government; of the evacuation from the head office in the Silverton Centre in Canberra at an hour's notice in January 1989-that, of course, emerged from the disastrous structural inadequacies of that building, which had to be evacuated; and of the intensive negotiations with staff associations associated with the introduction of the audit manager concept. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take Senator Puplick's point. One would think that a Minister would be sufficiently concerned about the Government's own Audit Office. The Audit Office has been contributing significantly to the capacity of this chamber to deal adequately with matters of a major concern that emerge out of departments and out of government business operations. This is largely due to the further refinement during the Budget session of the Auditor's practice of tabling separate reports on audits of significance-not only to the Executive, but also to the Parliament, the Public Service, the media, and the general public. The Auditor-General says in his report that this should further enhance the usefulness and timeliness of his reports.</PARA></TALK.START>

It will be condemned to limbo, because we have a massive Notice Paper to deal with before we rise. Yet this is a report of major significance. It may well be that some of us who are concerned in this area-for example, Senator Bishop-may well decide that the only way to deal with this is on the adjournment, which will not appeal to many of our colleagues. This creates a real problem. The method of presentation is grossly inadequate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to deal very speedily with some of the Auditor-General's responses to the Government's response to the recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts about how the Australian Audit Office should be conducted. On page 22 the Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's announcement concerning the Auditor-General's efficiency audit mandate is inconsistent. </PARA>
<PARA>We ought to stress that there is now clearly a lack of understanding by the Government on what the proper function of the Auditor-General should be. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts did an excellent job in setting up a series of recommendations which the Government has responded to inadequately and which, the Auditor-General has pointed out, are unsatisfactory. I am glad to see that Senator Bishop has at last been given her copy of this report. Maybe there are matters that she would like to raise at this stage. The Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government accepts the JCPA's recommendation that the Auditor-General continue to have responsibility for efficiency audit but, in fact, reduces the efficiency auditing mandate by suggesting that in the ordinary course of events there is little to be gained by subjecting GBEs, whether they are companies or statutory authorities, to efficiency audits. </PARA>
<PARA>To me this is incredible. This Government is pushing those bodies into immune zones, protecting them more and more from examination by this Parliament. It seems to be a device, in many instances, to get rid of embarrassing matters from public scrutiny in this place. The Government's response to recommendations about the Auditor-General's involvement in efficiency audits seems to be going down that track. The Auditor-General notes:</PARA>
<PARA> This decision ignores:</PARA>
<PARA>the limited nature of the marketplace for GBEs</PARA>
<PARA>the inefficiencies that can exist within any profit-oriented private-sector business (the bottom line does not guarantee efficiency, even in the private sector)</PARA>
<PARA>the conflict that can arise between private- and public-sector objectives</PARA>
<PARA>the absence of the competitive pressure experienced in the private sector based on stock exchange listing and borrowing requirements</PARA>
<PARA>absence of choice by the public-sector shareholders-the taxpayers, and</PARA>
<PARA>the Parliament's right and role in a democratic society. </PARA>
<PARA>All these points are absolutely accurate. There is a special need for scrutiny in the area of these government business enterprises. The Government is clearly keen to diminish the Auditor-General's existing capacity to have efficiency audits in that area. I am very tempted to take notice of a remark by Senator Puplick that this is an example of government AIDS-auditor immune departmental stuff-ups. I regret to say that there is a fair amount of merit in that point. The Auditor-General goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> The AAO's approach has been to place the highest priority for efficiency audits in those areas of the public sector furthest from the discipline of the market, but it is an unwarranted step backwards to exclude GBEs from efficiency audits unless there is a Ministerial request. It is inconsistent with acceptance of other recommendations of the Committee and, in the light of recent events in some States, exposes Ministers to potential allegations of attempts to obscure the conduct of individual GBEs. </PARA>
<PARA> This step is against the trend both internationally and nationally, which has been to strengthen the Auditor-General's mandate, not weaken it. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the essence-this Government is seeking to weaken the mandate of the Auditor-General, and the Auditor-General is the person on whom we have been relying more and more for revelations, if you like, about what is really going on in the multibillion dollar business and other activities of the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to briefly mention that the Auditor-General is very unhappy indeed about the Government's response to the report of the Public Accounts Committee concerning the resourcing levels of the Australian Audit Office, because the Government has indicated that the Committee's analysis of the resource issue left something to be desired. In fact, as I recall, it said that the Committee had made a simplistic sort of comparison between the number of government bodies audited by the Auditor-General and the level of Australian Audit Office staffing. The Auditor-General says that these comments by the Government cannot be allowed to stand without comment. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Before commenting on each of the above points, it should be made clear that the Committee's recommendations concerning the funding of efficiency audits and the cycle of coverage were an attempt by the Committee to rectify an historical inadequacy in the legislation introducing the efficiency audit mandate. </PARA>
<PARA>He continues:</PARA>
<PARA>To concentrate on the level of funding proposed by the Committee rather than the principle of establishing some legislative quantum does a disservice to the Committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA>There are pages and pages of these matters of major concern which I simply do not have the time to go into at this stage, largely because I have not had the opportunity to examine this report in any great detail. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My remarks will be brief on this occasion but I think it is important to place on the record some comments regarding the section in the annual report of the Auditor-General entitled `Communication with Parliamentary Committees'. Having been a member of both the working committee and the Public Accounts Committee itself, where we do have such close working relations with the Auditor-General, and having been part of the authorship of the report The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament, I take a particular interest in the way the Auditor-General reports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst I find it commendable that on pages 28, 29 and 30 the Auditor-General reports upon the various inquiries in which his office has been present and able to assist when necessary the Public Accounts Committee inquiry, I think it is necessary to say that we have been successful as a committee in ensuring that the presentation that the Auditor-General does provide to the Public Accounts Committee has, shall I say, been upgraded in recent times. The point I specifically wanted to raise is this: There is a stress placed on the need for the Auditor-General to have good communication with parliamentary committees and to acknowledge that his fundamental obligation is to see that full and proper information comes to the Parliament. It is therefore, I think, important to again state my disappointment in the report that the Auditor-General has furnished to the Parliament concerning his investigation of the Parliamentary Information Systems Office (PISO) within the Department of the Parliamentary Library. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken in the Parliament on this matter on a couple of occasions concerning the Estimates committees and the tabling of our report. As I said then, and I will say it again now, it was with a grave sense of disappointment that I found that the findings in the report, which was furnished, firstly, to the President, who then in turn furnished it to the Committee, who furnished it to the Parliament, did not substantiate the conclusions which the Auditor-General drew. Indeed, I have termed that report a whitewash. I have said that, if the Auditor-General cannot be that strong, independent linchpin between the operation of the public sector and the reporting to the Parliament, then the whole system collapses. Indeed, it did cause me to look at whether or not there was some avenue by which the Auditor-General's report could have been further scrutinised. I did indeed look to see whether the matter could have been referred to the Ombudsman, but, of course, the Ombudsman is precluded from investigating the Auditor-General. However, the Committee did come up with a recommendation on the whole matter concerning the creation of the illegal and secret $88,000 account that was set up and operated by officers of PISO. One of the beneficiaries of the operation of that account was a Mr Mullane, who subsequently wrote to members of Estimates Committee A admitting that he had lied to the Committee, quite frankly. Only days ago in this chamber the Chairman of that Committee said that he could never again believe what that particular man had to say. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a concern that, while this report looks to be a thorough workmanlike report, it draws attention to important matters such as the practice of government business enterprises being able to elect not to use the Auditor-General as the auditor but to go into the private sector when the Public Accounts Committee has recommended that the proper way to go is to have the Auditor-General as the auditor, who is then free to use private sector auditors by way of contract as a correct way of proceeding. Many important issues are raised in this report, and I would reflect upon Senator Michael Baume's remarks that it is simply not satisfactory to have a report of this importance in one's hands only as the report is presented to the Parliament and then be expected to have some sort of understanding of what is in it. It just will not do. I seek leave to continue my remarks because I particularly will want to read the report more thoroughly, and I know other members will wish to speak on it. </PARA>

I have confirmed that this particular report was delivered to the office of the Leader of the Opposition at 1 p.m.-that is, more than two hours before tabling-and to some extent the problem of late delivery to Senator Michael Baume would appear to be an internal matter for the Opposition. Nevertheless, I will draw the attention of the President to Senator Baume's remarks, and the President might like to look at whether the arrangement of two hours before for a report of this nature is appropriate for debate in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr Deputy President, I had the honour the week before last to lead a delegation of senators and others to the Third Commonwealth Conference on Delegated Legislation, hosted by the United Kingdom Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments and held in London from 20 to 23 November. The Australian delegation consisted of me, in my capacity of Deputy Chairman of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, Senator Patricia Giles, a member of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee and Chair of the Committee of Privileges, Senator Kay Patterson, a member of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee and Deputy Chairman of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, and Senator Rosemary Crowley, a member and former Chair of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. We were accompanied by Anne Lynch, Deputy Clerk of the Senate; Emeritus Professor Douglas Whalan, Legal Adviser to the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee; Mr Ken Jasper, MP, Chairman of the Subordinate Legislation Subcommittee of the Victorian Legal and Constitutional Committee, and Ms Pauline Ireland, Research Officer to the Victorian Legal and Constitutional Committee. The delegation will be presenting a full report to the Senate, including a transcript of the proceedings of the Conference, when such proceedings become available. The delegation considered, however, that I should make this statement to the Senate as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As with the previous conferences, held first in Australia in 1980 and second in Canada in 1983, this conference brought together representatives of a wide cross-section of Commonwealth countries. Delegates from a number of countries which had not been represented at the previous conferences attended the London conference. In particular, note was taken at that conference of the representation from Pakistan, the first Commonwealth-wide conference that country had attended since rejoining the Commonwealth. In all, 61 delegates attended from 17 countries. </PARA>
<PARA> As with previous conferences, the commonality of problems confronting all delegated legislation committees was evident. The resolutions agreed to unanimously at the conference give a brief indication of the matters which were discussed during the four days of the conference. I seek leave to have this incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The resolutions read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>RESOLUTIONS OF THE CONFERENCE</PARA>
<PARA>1. That this Conference:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) expresses its deep regret at the death, on 30th March 1986, of Senator Alan Joseph Missen, Australia, Chairman of our first Commonwealth Conference on Delegated Legislation, hosted by Australia in 1980, and inaugural Chairman of the Commonwealth Delegated Legislation Committee; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) places on record its appreciation of the crucial contribution made by the late Senator Missen to the establishment of this Commonwealth-wide institution, and to the enhancement of parliamentary democracy by emphasising the importance of scrutiny of all legislation to good government. </PARA>
<PARA>2. That a continuing coordinating Committee be appointed by the Conference to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) arrange the next conference</PARA>
<PARA> (b) bring up to date the Comparative Study prepared in Canada. </PARA>
<PARA>3. That the Committee shall consist of representatives for each of the following geographical groups of delegations, each group electing its own representative on a one delegation one vote basis:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Europe (Cyprus, U.K.)</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Asia (Maldives, Pakistan)</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Africa (Botswana, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe)-two representatives</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Americas (Belize, Canada)</PARA>
<PARA> (e) Caribbean (St. Lucia, Trinidad &amp; Tobago)</PARA>
<PARA> (f) Pacific (Australia, New Zealand)</PARA>
<PARA>4. That the Committee shall appoint its own Chair and determine its own procedures; that the immediate past Chair (currently Hon. Perrin Beatty P.C., M.P., Canada) shall be entitled to be coopted ex-officio; and that the hosts of the next conference, if not already represented, shall be entitled to nominate a representative to be coopted. </PARA>
<PARA>5. That the United Kingdom will provide a secretariat for the Committee until the hosts of the next conference are identified; and that this function will be transferred to the hosts of the next conference. </PARA>
<PARA>6. That the next conference will be held in a jurisdiction willing to host it, not less than 3 years and if possible not more than 5 years after the current conference. </PARA>
<PARA>7. That the Conference authorises the United Kingdom delegation to circulate a record of its proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA>8. That the following issues, common to a number of Commonwealth countries, arose from the 3rd Commonwealth Conference on Delegated Legislation; and that therefore it would be a profitable exercise for each member country to examine its scrutiny procedures in relation to the issues set out below, and to be prepared to report to the next conference the results of such examination and, should modification or reform be deemed necessary, any progress made to achieve change. </PARA>
<PARA>The allowing of the executive takes power to amend or repeal primary legislation without further reference to Parliament (``Henry VIII Clauses'');</PARA>
<PARA>whether those responsible for scrutinizing delegated legislation have access to the best and most independent legal and technical advice;</PARA>
<PARA>whether the language of legislation, including delegated legislation, is accessible and comprehensible to the ordinary citizen;</PARA>
<PARA>the scrutiny of delegated powers contained in bills or proposed bills;</PARA>
<PARA>the weeding out of outdated, over-amended or inaccessible regulations, whether by ``sunset clauses'' or other means. </PARA>
<PARA> In preparation for the next conference, a survey of the information from each country should be collated, perhaps by the host country, and presented to the Fourth Conference. </PARA>
<PARA>THE CONTINUING CO-ORDINATING</PARA>
<PARA>COMMITTEE:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Mr Bob Cryer, M.P. (U.K.)</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Mr Abdur Rauf Lughamani (Pakistan)</PARA>
<PARA> (c) (i) Hon. Bahiti K. Temane, M.P. (Botswana)</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Mr Philip S. Marmo, M.P. (Tanzania)</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Mr Tom Wappel, M.P. (Canada)</PARA>
<PARA> (e) vacant</PARA>
<PARA> (f) Senator Bronwyn Bishop (Australia)</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Senator BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Significantly, the conference resolved that each member country would examine its own scrutiny procedure concerning the following issues: firstly, `Henry VIII clauses', whereby the Executive takes power to amend or repeal primary legislation without further reference to Parliament; secondly, whether those responsible for scrutinising delegated legislation have access to the best and most independent legal and technical advice; thirdly, whether the language of legislation, including delegated legislation, is accessible and comprehensible to the ordinary citizen; fourthly, the scrutiny of delegated powers contained in Bills or proposed Bills; and, fifthly, the weeding out of outdated, overamended or inaccessible regulations, whether by `sunset clauses' or other means.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is well to note that extreme use of Henry VIII clauses, which is of relative insignificance at the Federal level in Australia because of our Regulations and Ordinances Committee and Scrutiny of Bills Committee, was of great concern to a number of our colleagues, particularly in Britain. The model of our Scrutiny of Bills Committee met with great enthusiasm from Lord Rippon from the United Kingdom, where there is no such equivalent. Many features of the Australian system, both at a Federal and State level, were the subject of some envy by our Commonwealth colleagues. The most important feature at Federal level, which has also been commented upon at previous conferences, is the capacity of either House to ensure that motions of disallowance, whether on behalf of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee or by any member of either House, are in fact dealt with. Some legislatures, notably Victoria and New Zealand, are moving in this direction; others are frustrated by their lack of capacity to ensure that their reports and recommendations for disallowance are debated and determined. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem of quasi-law, that is, guidelines, manuals, rulings and the like which can be given the force of law and are not subject to parliamentary scrutiny, met with considerable concern from delegates, who noted the growth of such practices. Discussion over the week ranged widely, as indicated by the subject matter of each session. The first session, on 20 November, was based on a paper commissioned by the second conference and prepared by the Parliament of Canada, entitled `Drafting and Scrutiny of Legislation in the Commonwealth: a Comparative Study'. As the first speaker on this paper I gave an account of the current operations of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. As mentioned above, the question of quasi-law was one of such concern to the conference that it was the subject of a full discussion on 21 November following an address given by Professor Gabriele Ganz from Southampton University. Senator Patricia Giles delivered a paper which addressed this question. </PARA>
<PARA> On Wednesday, 22 November, under the general heading `Uses and Abuses of Delegated Powers', three papers were given. The first was by Mr Andrew Bennett, MP, of the United Kingdom, who spoke in general terms on the topic; the second by Mr Doug Graham, MP, of New Zealand who spoke to a paper on fees and charges, with particular reference to the use of delegated legislation to raise taxes without full parliamentary authority. The third paper, on the overuse of Henry VIII clauses, was given by the aforesaid Hon. Lord Rippon of Hexham, a former Secretary of State for the Environment, who, as I said earlier, drew specific attention to the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills as a model which might, with profit, be followed by other parliaments. It was therefore timely that the speaker at the next session on that day, Senator Rosemary Crowley, gave a paper on the scrutiny of enabling legislation, with particular reference to the operation of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The afternoon session was devoted to discussion of court supervision of delegated legislation, the subject of a paper by Mr Louis Blom-Cooper, QC, from the United Kingdom, whose paper was supported by a contribution from Professor Douglas Whalan. This was followed by a panel discussion on relationships between executive government and the Parliament, with United Kingdom representatives from the Department of Education and Science and the Home Office, Parliamentary Counsel, and the Law Advocate's Department, together with Counsel to the Chairman of Committees of the House of Lords and Counsel to Mr Speaker. Indeed, we were privileged to have the opening ceremony of this conference conducted by both the Lord Chancellor and Mr Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA> On 23 November, Senator Kay Patterson delivered a paper on the review of existing regulations, which gave a succinct account of general scrutiny practices in the Australian States. Mr Ken Jasper, as a representative of the States, spoke of the practices in the Victorian legislature. The last paper delivered at the conference was by Professor St John Bates, Clerk of Tynwald, the Isle of Man. He examined different models of scrutiny, covering matters such as whether such scrutiny is best undertaken by a committee of members or by officials, and powers of committees in relation to delegated legislation. Anne Lynch made a contribution on behalf of the Australian delegation. </PARA>
<PARA> The conference proceedings concluded with a panel discussion of which I was privileged to be a member, the panellists having been selected in the course of the conference from the delegations. These panellists emphasised the importance of parliamentary scrutiny of the Executive and executive accountability to the Parliament. The conference concluded with a discussion of future proceedings and with agreement to the resolutions which I have had incorporated in Hansard. It is noteworthy that the first resolution of the conference was a recognition of the contribution made by the late Senator Alan Missen to the establishment of the conference and the enhancement of parliamentary democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, on behalf of the Australian delegation, I wish to thank you and the Senate for the support given to the delegation. This support was continued in London by Mr President's predecessor, His Excellency the Hon. Douglas McClelland, and Mrs McClelland, and the excellent staff at the Australian High Commission, to whom we express our appreciation. We wish also to place on record our sincere thanks to our hosts, the United Kingdom Committee on Statutory Instruments, for the splendid organisation of the conference, and the wonderful hospitality which we all enjoyed. As the brief outline of the program indicates, all delegates actively contributed, both through the presentation of papers and through their participation in the vigorous discussions that followed the presentation of the papers. There seems little doubt that the discussions were fruitful, and the Australian delegation looks forward to being represented at the next conference, which by resolution will be held within the next three to five years at a venue yet to be determined. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take a few moments to make some comments about the Third Commonwealth Conference on Delegated Legislation at which I was a member of the Australian Delegation. I add my support to the words of Senator Bishop and, in particular, thank the people who assisted us on this delegation. From Doug McClelland to the Chairperson of the Joint Statutory Instruments Committee, Mr Bob Cryer overseas; to Anne Lynch and Professor Whalan, who accompanied the delegation. In summary, I think the conference was very constructive and useful. It was also very enjoyable, but I understand that the rules of the game state that by and large that is not reported to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would also like to support the motion commending the work done by the late Alan Missen. I had the pleasure and privilege of serving on the Scrutiny of Bills Committee at a time when he was a member. Indeed, I think Senator Tate was Chairman of that Committee at the time. I think this Parliament has acknowledged on a number of occasions Alan Missen's contribution to the protection of rights in Australia. I wish to add my own personal support to that motion. His interest in this area was never anything but utterly genuine and clearly very committed because it took a long time to persuade people in this place to move in the way of a Scrutiny of Bills Committee. If one considers to what extent that was driven by Alan Missen, I think we can all appreciate and benefit from the work he has done. </PARA>
<PARA> I made a few points at the conference which I would briefly like to refer to. I made three points in respect of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. The first was that if we are talking about the protection of the rights of citizens-in other words, I suppose, the importance of remembering what a fragile flower democracy is-we should remember, from time to time, that that is, in fact, what the work of that Committee is about. It is too easy to get caught up in the substance of the work of a committee and forget what it was established for and what its business is. Its business is about the rights of citizens, and I felt it was very important to make a few points about those rights. </PARA>
<PARA> Most honourable senators will know that I keep a weather eye on things to do with women. I was particularly interested to check the history of the law relating to women. I found that, even though many of our Acts of Parliament state that `he' is taken to mean `she', that was the case if `she' was to carry a stick of dynamite but it was not the case if `she' wanted to fill out a ballot paper. Women were denied the right to vote despite a law which, theoretically, allowed them the right to vote. I was very pleased to see that there is now no doubt at all that women have equal rights to vote and stand for parliament under the Westminster system in the United Kingdom and under our own system here. Although I have been going around the world saying that New Zealand was the first country to give the vote to women-that was in 1893-I was advised by a gentleman from the Isle of Man, whose name I have forgotten, that the Isle of Man gave the vote to women in 1884. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is true. This matter is important and particularly interesting. I cited the battle that women on this side of the chamber have had since 1983 to have Hansard record exactly what we say rather than correct it, as it did for some 18 months after I came here in 1983, into single sex, male language. Apparently, they were the guidelines under which Hansard operated and this seemed to me to conflict with the practice of taking down every word that was said in the chamber. I was delighted to find on my desk shortly after I returned a media release dated 22 November, which stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Senate on Tuesday adopted a new set of standing orders-the rules which govern its proceedings-to replace those adopted in 1903 . . . Masculine pronouns-references to Senators and office-holders as ``he'' and ``him''-have been eliminated, a reflection of the presence of 17 women in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>The battle may have to continue and some of us will remain ever vigilant about all these things. However, for the record, I was pleased to see in England that women's rights are more guaranteed and more protected. But it is very important to know that sometimes we have to insist that the word `woman' be used in legislation, because in the past the interpretation of the law by judges has actually denied women the right to vote and denied them their rights under some legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point we talked about, and Senator Bishop has referred to it, is the use of language that is understandable. If the work we are doing is devoted to allowing citizens the right of access to the law and the knowledge of how it affects their lives, it is important that citizens understand it. If these laws affect their lives, there must surely be, as a matter of basic right, understandable, clear English language within those laws. It is important that they understand what those laws say, particularly if they impinge on their lives. Sometimes a person says, `I am a law-abiding citizen and the law does not affect me very much'. Any examination of, for example, social security or health legislation, let alone tax legislation, will reveal that most law-abiding citizens are still affected by the law. </PARA>
<PARA> Partly by way of entertainment-certainly it got a good laugh in England, so I will risk it again in another chamber-I read a piece of legislation to illustrate that sometimes the law is not clear at all. The source of this appalling legislative prose is hopefully lost in the realms of time, although I understand Professor Whalan could give me its origin. I apologise to the Senate that I do not have it. Perhaps at a later time I will. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>In the Nuts (unground), (other than ground nuts) Order, the expression nuts shall have reference to such nuts, other than ground nuts, as would but for this amendment Order not qualify as nuts (unground) (other than ground nuts) by reason of their being nuts (unground). </PARA>
<PARA>I have read that quite often-it still causes much merriment-but I have no idea what it means. We made the point, and reinforced it with other examples, that law must be understandable, and I think that point was widely appreciated by all the people who attended the conference. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point I wish to make concerns the very constructive contribution by David Magang, who was recently elected as the Minister for Finance in Botswana. The aforementioned Professor St. John Bates, the Clerk of Tynwald of the Isle of Man, told us that the Parliament of the Isle of Man was the longest continuing parliament in the world. I am advised that it had its millennium in 1979, so it certainly has a claim for being somewhat aged. That parliament addresses the legal needs of the 70,000 residents of the Isle of Man. While we were talking about delegated legislation, the significant bits and pieces of regulations and ordinances and so on, the Minister for Finance from Botswana got up and asked why one would be bothered with delegated legislation in a country that has 70,000 people; why not just round them up and tell them? This was a particularly appropriate and succinct comment. It is open to misinterpretation, but I would certainly not want to make that meaning part of my contribution. The point that the Minister for Finance from Botswana raised is very pertinent and important. What do we mean by the `community' when we talk about citizens who are affected by our legislation, and what methods and mechanisms do we have for providing that information to our citizens and to our community?</PARA>
<PARA> Australia is trying to address that need for something like 17 million people. The population of the United Kingdom, while it is crowded more closely together, is much larger than that and I am quite sure that many people in London, let alone northern Scotland, are not at all aware of the legislation which affects them. The challenge of how we inform citizens is a very significant one and the point raised by the Minister for Finance from Botswana is very pertinent indeed. What we must do is ensure diversity in the way we provide that information to the community. What might be appropriate in the United Kingdom or Australia may be entirely inappropriate in the Maldives, Trinidad and Tobago, Pakistan or Botswana. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very telling point for us to think about in terms of the rights of citizens-their right to know the ways in which they can have access to information. I sincerely hope that delegates from Botswana, which has very different methods of getting information to people in the community, will be considered as speakers at the next conference on delegated legislation because I believe that their contribution would be different, very pertinent and useful for the rest of the delegates from the Commonwealth countries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Senator Bishop's statement and wish to make a brief comment. I, too, was a member of the delegation which attended the Third Commonwealth Conference on Delegated Legislation. I would like to take this opportunity to thank those Senate staff members who assisted in preparing the delegation for the conference. In particular, I would like to put on record the delegation's appreciation of the Deputy Clerk, Miss Anne Lynch. I will let the Senate into a small secret and say that in a moment of tiredness and jet lag I actually referred to her as `Deputy Lynch'. She then became affectionately known to the delegation as deputy linchpin. That may be a nickname that will stick. Miss Lynch gave us enormous support and help and was ready at all hours-even in the middle of the night when we had a fire alarm-to assist us in many ways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My thanks also go to Emeritus Professor Douglas Whalan, our legal adviser, for the role that he played in the conference and the advice and assistance he afforded the delegation. He was on hand to help. As we weeded out bits and pieces of our papers as they were dealt with throughout the Conference, I thought that some of the other people at the Conference got a little indigestion from overindulgence of the Australian pie of regulations, ordinances and scrutiny of Bills. I guess that that occurred because of our experience in the area. I hope that we did not dominate the Conference too much. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of quasi laws that Senator Bishop raised came out at the Conference over and over again. Each of the legislatures was experiencing a proliferation of guidelines, directives, rulings and so on. Most, if not all, of the delegates expressed concern at this proliferation and the fact that they were being used increasingly instead of delegation in the form of regulations which are subject to parliamentary scrutiny. I take this opportunity to reiterate what I have said before in this chamber-that this Parliament should be mindful of the increasing use of quasi laws. We should set in place procedures for these to be subjected to scrutiny, to indexing and to publication so that citizens are aware of them and have ready access to them. It is something that we have talked about a number of times. I believe that we should continue to act to ensure that there are ways and means brought about to make sure that members of the public have access to legislation and to quasi laws. </PARA>
<PARA> I very much appreciated the opportunity to be part of what may have been-because of its makeup-an historic delegation. It was a privilege to share our experiences with other Commonwealth countries and also to learn from them. Despite the fact that we are quite a way down the track in the scrutiny of primary and secondary legislation, the Conference was a very timely reminder that there are always improvements to be made so that the rights of individuals and the elected parliament are properly protected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to place on record a tribute to the officers of the Senate who prepared the papers for our meeting. My colleagues have probably covered most of the other matters that we would want to recognise in relation to the excellent hospitality, the splendid arrangements made for us, the quality of the Third Commonwealth Conference on Delegated Legislation generally and the degree to which we believe it contributed to the debate on delegated legislation and the scrutiny of legislation generally in the Commonwealth. I come back to the quality of our papers. These were prepared for us to use as a basis for discussion. On each occasion they were apt, comprehensive and ideal for the purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was particularly grateful to have the opportunity to deliver the paper on quasi legislation in Australia. I have been reminded continually since then of how important this is in the Australian context. Incidentally, my paper included an appendix with a catalogue of all the different types of quasi legislation that Peter O'Keeffe, an officer attached to the delegation, was able to identify. We came to a score of about 30 different types of quasi legislation. Amongst those, there were many different types of orders, for example, and numerous declarations, determinations, zoning plans, plans of management, principles, guides, guidelines, notices, proclamations, directions, instruments, rates of levy, et cetera. Last night during a public hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs I was very interested to hear Julian Disney of the Australian Council of Social Service refer to the proliferation of these `strange animals'. If one could carry the analogy a little further, I suppose that one might comment that it is time that many of these strange animals' tendency to reproduce was brought under control as far as our legislative procedures are concerned. </PARA>

On the following day Anne was able to meet with the secretary of the privileges committee of the United Kingdom Parliament. We found these discussions to be of considerable interest and value to us. We have common concerns, despite the minor differences in our procedures. We were able to learn from each other and I think we have managed to secure a budding association to the mutual advantage of the United Kingdom committee on privileges and our own Senate Privileges Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Like Senator Patterson, Senator Bishop and Senator Crowley, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I found it extremely rewarding and feel honoured to have had the opportunity to participate in what was a valuable experience and which was, and I will emphasise this for the benefit of Senator Tate, an historic delegation: the first ever all women delegation from this Parliament with, as our officer, Anne Lynch, the Deputy Clerk of the Senate. It is a pity that we cannot include in Hansard the photographic proof. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report is the first which gives details of the operation of the Australian Film Finance Corporation Pty Ltd, the new body established by the Government to deal with the provision of finance for making Australian films. The Film Finance Corporation, in my judgment, has not served the industry as well as one would have hoped. One can see from page 9 of the annual report that two essential criteria are introduced by the Film Finance Corporation in deciding whether to fund and how much funding to provide for individual projects. The two essential criteria are noted in the report to be private sector participation and demonstration of market interest through presales and distribution agreements or commitments. This is a way of saying that the Film Finance Corporation has decided that the primary test of a film should be its acceptability in overseas markets. As a matter of cultural policy, I think that is quite reprehensible. It is a formula for the internationalisation of the Australian film industry in the worst sense of that term-that is to say, making films in Australia which are almost indistinguishable from films made anywhere else in the world rather than seeking to bring about a situation in which uniquely Australian films are promoted in international film markets. It is most regrettable that this tendency has occurred because it means, in effect, the production of lowest common denominator films rather than those which are genuinely innovative and exciting and genuinely reflect a unique Australian idiom.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Similarly, on page 13 of the report the Corporation indicates that it will now implement two new policies. It says that it will target proven industry performers and thus take a more pro-active approach within the industry. Secondly, it will seek to match talented but relatively inexperienced film-makers with experienced personnel in a number of supportive projects. The former of these, the targeting of proven industry performers, will in my judgment further erode the capacity of new young film-makers to get a start in the business. It will further discourage people from taking risks, being entrepreneurial, being exciting and being innovative in films. It will rather result, as have the funding policies of the Australia Council in recent years, in the same old people continuing to appear on the gravy train year after year. </PARA>
<PARA> I finally mention one thing which concerns me considerably, that is, the reference to the legal advisers and the legal work undertaken by Allen, Allen and Hemsley on behalf of the Corporation. That is a most distinguished firm of lawyers of whom I make no criticism. I regret, however, that the fee which has been established for the preparation of what are, in fact, word processed contracts is as high as it is. As I understand it, before a film-maker gets his grant he has to fork out $25,000 for a standard contract, which is simply a matter of the word processor spewing out the contract with the necessary particular details about the contracting party and the sum of money involved being written into the contract. For that the film-maker has to find $25,000 up-front to pay for the Corporation's legal expenses. I think that is absolutely outrageous. It is typical of the way in which the film business has fallen progressively into the hands of lawyers and accountants in the most negative sense. It is very unfortunate that these sorts of things occur. I intend to pursue, at some later stage, the question of the legal fees which are attached to the operations of the Film Finance Corporation and which are imposing a very significant and quite unnecessary up-front cost, particularly on small independent film producers throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other reports in this group of papers to which I would like to have made reference but I believe that, with 92 reports on the Notice Paper, it would be better to try to constrain our remarks somewhat. Therefore, while I would like to have made reference to others, I will defer at this stage to my colleagues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I congratulate the Australian Tourist Commission on its annual report and the tremendous work it does in trying to promote Australia. In the Chairman's review of the report on page 6 he states:</PARA>
<PARA>Predominant among the highlights of 1988/89 was that Australia and ordinary Australians began to realise the huge potential of our tourism industry. The Bicentennial celebrations and World Expo 88-</PARA>
<PARA>which was held in Brisbane-</PARA>
<PARA>gave all Australians a new found sense of pride and a desire to share our good fortune with the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> These two events-coming on top of the solid marketing base built up by the ATC over recent years-focused world wide attention on Australia and motivated thousands of people to travel here. For the first time, we attracted more than two million overseas visitors in a year. </PARA>
<PARA> 1988/89 will also be remembered as the year Australia stopped riding on the sheep's back and leapt forward with tourism. </PARA>
<PARA>We are having a little trouble at the moment riding on the sheep's back, unfortunately. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA>International tourism generated a massive $6.5 billion in foreign exchange, surpassing wool as the nation's biggest export earner. It also continued to provide employment for more than 100,000 Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>The work of the Australian Tourist Commission includes working not only to increase the number of overseas visitors to Australia and to maximise the benefits to Australia from those tourists but also to monitor the environmental and social impact of tourism. However, if any monitoring needs to be done, it should be in the light of the current pilots dispute, which has forced the Australian Tourist Commission to slash drastically its estimate of the short-term future of Australia's tourist boom. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year the Commission was confidently predicting in its 1987-88 report that 2.7 million foreigners would travel to Australia for holidays in 1990, but I note in this report that it has had to change that figure downwards to 2.23 million visitors. There can be no doubt that this slashing of estimates is the result of current Government policies and the disreputable part it has played to prolong the current pilots dispute. As the report noted on page 44:</PARA>
<PARA>During the second half of 1988/89, Australia's tourism industry was hit by the inevitable post-Bicentennial slowdown . . . Despite this, the industry was expecting a strong turnaround in the last quarter of 1989, traditionally the busiest period of the year. </PARA>
<PARA> However . . . soon after the close of the period . . . all scheduled domestics flights (were grounded) . . . International tourists were forced to cope with restricted services, with many remote areas virtually inaccessible . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I know that far north Queensland has been having a very hard time because of this cut down in air services, and the same applies to the Northern Territory. The Chairman continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . It was apparent that Australia's reputation as a reliable tourist destination had been damaged in many overseas markets, particularly Japan and the United States. Any chance of a turnaround has been dashed. </PARA>
<PARA>In an indictment of the Government's failure to acknowledge that its actions in the current dispute have left much of the industry in tatters, the report said:</PARA>
<PARA>The dispute was one of the factors the ATC took into account when it drew up its visitor arrival targets for the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA>Certainly, the effects of the dispute as far as tourism is concerned cannot be underestimated. It is estimated that tourist receipts could be down by $3 billion if the dispute extends into next year. Twenty thousand casual and permanent jobs have already been lost in the hospitality industry. Major Japanese travel wholesalers have deleted Australia as a destination in their 1990 programs. Australia has been deleted from German travel programs and United States retailers have stopped selling Australia. These are very sad facts. I know that north Queensland tourist operators are very upset about the whole matter. They have recorded a fall from 76.4 per cent to 35.8 per cent in room occupancy rates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak to the Australian Tourist Commission's annual report because during the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) I asked Senator Richardson a series of questions which he simply did not answer. The questions go to the heart of the issues which Senator Bjelke-Petersen has just raised; that is, the impact of the pilots strike-or the dispute that does not exist, according to the the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)-on tourism. As Senator Bjelke-Petersen pointed out, the report states that the dispute was one of the factors which the Australian Tourist Commission took into account when it drew up its visitor arrival targets for the next decade. These involve a substantial cut next year in the level of tourism from that of the previous year. It is the first overall cut in tourism that has taken place since 1982. These targets represent a 3.6 per cent reduction as against the continual rises in previous years-of 11.6 per cent last year, 25.2 per cent the year before, 25.8 per cent the year before, 19 per cent the year before that, and so on. Those rises have been reversed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I raised this issue with Senator Richardson he concentrated entirely on the increase in costs involved for tourists as a result of higher hotel prices among the leading first-class hotels in Australia. I simply do not know whether or not his criticism of those hotels was right, but it seemed to me to miss entirely the point that is made in the Tourist Commission's report. The Commission has conceded, without quantifying it, that the air pilots dispute-and, I might say, the Government's incompetent handling of it-has resulted in a reduction in expected targets of tourists. </PARA>
<PARA> We deserve to be told-I asked Senator Richardson but I did not get an answer-what the volume of reduction is in the number of tourists that the Tourist Commission now expects to get next year, by how much its target has been reduced, because of the airline pilots strike? This is a simple factual matter. The Parliament is entitled to know on what figures one of its bodies-an organisation paid for by the taxpayers-has based its views. What is the reduction? Perhaps Senator Tate, who is in the chamber, will be more reasonable than Senator Richardson and seek these figures from the Tourist Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw his attention to a table on page 45 of the annual report. It reveals that total tourism for Australia in 1989 is forecast to be down by about 80,000 tourists overall and that from New Zealand there will be a 14 per cent fall; a one per cent fall from Japan; an 8 per cent fall from the United Kingdom and Ireland; a 15 per cent fall from the United States; and an 18 per cent fall from Canada. Once again I ask: Please may we have the courtesy of a reply to a simple factual question? By what amount has the Tourist Commission altered its target levels for next year because of the pilots strike?</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I make one brief point. One sees the benefits of immigration in these tourism figures because the biggest single item after holidays that encourages people to come to Australia is to visit relatives. For about 20 per cent of tourists their main purpose in coming here is to visit relatives. That is one of the hidden benefits involved in a substantial and continuing immigration program. That is why the Japanese market is at risk. Only 1.6 per cent of visitors from Japan come here for that purpose; 83.1 per cent simply come here for a holiday. That is an area of great vulnerability unless we can get our internal airlines and our cost structure in order. </PARA>

<PARA>In light of the time constraints, I will try to be brief in speaking to the annual report of the National Library of Australia. A large number of the things that I want to say about this year's report of the National Library of Australia I said about last year's report, because of some overlap in the timetable for presenting the two reports. I will not duplicate my remarks but I do, again, want to extend my congratulations to the Director-General, Warren Horton, and his Deputy, Eric Wainwright, for the excellent job they do in running this very fine national institution. With Senator Hill, who is a member of the Council--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill says that he has retired from the Council. Senator Reid and I, being the local representatives of the area in which the National Library is located, have more opportunity to have first-hand knowledge of the National Library. However, I emphasise that it is not a Canberra institution; it is a very important national institution. I want to emphasise some of the important national roles that it plays. Earlier this year, when speaking to last year's annual report, I referred to the library summit and the significant role that the National Library played in that. The report of the proceedings of the summit and of the National Library's role is incorporated in the 1988-89 annual report. Page 5 states, and I agree entirely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Summit made major advances towards the better development of the nation's library services in the interests of their users, and the unanimous agreement reached by delegates on all major issues discussed has set a new national agenda for improved cooperation and service. </PARA>
<PARA>At page 9 the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the resolutions have set a new agenda for the next 3-5 years and beyond, covering every sector of the library industry and all the major current issues. </PARA>
<PARA>I make those points not merely to say that the summit was important, which it was-I said that when I spoke to last year's report-but to highlight the fact that it is playing an important role in the development of libraries throughout Australia. There are all sorts of other examples one could draw of the service which the National Library provides to the industry. The summit is the example I use to make that point. It was an outstanding success and those involved should be congratulated. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Library operates beyond the normal boundaries of what would be regarded as the role of a library because it takes a broad view of its responsibilities. As an example of that I refer to the exhibitions reported in appendix 10 at pages 87 to 90. A series of impressive and important major exhibitions are visited by a large number of people. People from all around Australia visit them and it is a significant part of the tourist trade in Canberra. People from all around Australia visit the National Library and see the exhibitions. More importantly, as page 89 states, material is lent for exhibitions and is displayed all around Australia. As page 90 states, there are important travelling exhibitions. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by referring to the role of the National Library in the international library movement which is reported under the heading `International cooperation and coordination'. On another occasion I will seek to speak about the overall role of Australia's cultural exchanges with other countries. The National Library has made a substantial contribution in the Asia-Pacific region. It is developing a role as a regional centre. I know that its assistance to Indonesia is particularly welcomed by people in that country. It was a very valuable contribution. I take this opportunity of recording my appreciation, and I am sure that of everybody in Canberra and all honourable senators, to the staff of the National Library for the excellent work that it has done again in the last 12 months. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>On page 9 of the annual report of the Independent Air Fares Committee for 1988-89 there is a very interesting quotation. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Published statistics show that Ansett and Australian-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Australian Airlines-</PARA>
<PARA>achieved very high passenger traffic growth and loan factors during the initial six months of 1988-89  . . . due to the Bicentennial celebrations, Expo 88 and the continued strong growth in international inbound tourism. </PARA>
<PARA>The impact of this report, of course, is for the financial year 1988-89. The quotation I have read out probably underpinned the various considerations that were made for that financial year with regard to air fares. What a different and sorry story the next report of the Independent Air Fares Committee will be. There will be no way that Ansett and Australian will be able to report or achieve high passenger traffic growth in a similar six-month period in the next financial year, because of the very sad and sorry saga of the current pilots strike or dispute, or whatever the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) wants to call it because he cannot solve it. </PARA>
<PARA> The principles that have been adopted by the Independent Air Fares Committee impact considerably on the economy of Australia, particularly over air traffic routes that have long distances or service the remote communities of Australia. All the principles that have been built up and adopted over such a long period will now have the rug pulled from under them. The impact on future air fares around Australia of the pilots strike/dispute will affect not only this current financial year but also many years to come. The role and function of this Committee will be crucial in ensuring that the Government is kept honest and that Australian Airlines and Ansett are also kept honest in the areas that must come under the very close and proper scrutiny of this Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The report makes very clear that the capital investments of the companies are taken into account, as well as wages and salaries and associated on-costs, which represent some 33 per cent of trunk route airline costs, movements in other costs which are outside their direct control, such as fuel prices, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and increases in government authority charges, which it is important also to settle. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that the Independent Air Fares Committee in the 1988-89 financial year endorsed and supported a number of very special discount fare initiatives which, as its report very properly points out, enhanced the competitive environment of domestic air services, stimulated the growth of tourism in Australia and improved the overall viability of airline operations, resulting in benefits to the travelling public and the airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> This rebuilding and restructuring of the airline industry-or, as I have called it in other places and at other times, the perestroika of Ansett and Australian Airlines-that Mr Hawke is so intent upon is only necessary because we are now at about day 115 of this dispute, with its catastrophic effects on tourism, small business and the remote and regional parts of Australia. All of these consequences could well have been avoided had the Prime Minister shown more determination and gall to solve the problem in the very early days of the dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> It is pleasing to note that the Independent Air Fares Committee closely cooperates with the State and Northern Territory governments in reaching its determinations. Obviously, we will have to rely on the State governments and the Northern Territory Government to make submissions that will carefully isolate and insulate the effects of the strike, or the dispute, so that they are not portrayed as an automatic flow-on and consequence of the action and so that any costs the airlines might attribute to them are not passed on to the travelling public, particularly as all the effects have been occasioned by the lack of will and the impotence of the Prime Minister. </PARA>

<PARA> The new Anzac frigate project is a matter of major concern to New South Wales in general and to the Newcastle area in particular. The Government has given various undertakings that 40 per cent of the work will be done in New South Wales, and a large proportion of that in Newcastle, even though the contract was won by Amecon Ltd, which is headquartered in Victoria. At Senate Estimates committees I asked many questions seeking to get hard and fast guarantees from the Government that that work would be done in Newcastle. After all, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) wrote a letter saying that it would be available to Newcastle. But none of the contract material indicates any sort of commitment to that objective. At Senate Estimates committee hearings it was repeatedly stated by spokesmen for the Department of Defence that it was impossible to give that hard and fast guarantee. </PARA>
<PARA> That prompted me to ask a question in Senate Estimates, to which I have only recently received an answer, about what happened to the submarine contract. As I recall, the submarine contract also involved some undertakings that New South Wales would get a certain proportion of the contract. My recollection was right. I have received a reply from the Defence Department, saying:</PARA>
<PARA>Based on the contracts awarded to date by the Australian Submarine Corporation and excluding the construction facility being established in South Australia, the distribution of work by State is: Australian Capital Territory, one per cent; New South Wales, 24 per cent; South Australia, 60 per cent; Victoria, 7 per cent, and work not yet placed, 8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate that this is very different indeed from the proper expectations that New South Wales had much earlier. During the project definition study, Australian Submarine Corporation advised that the likely distribution of work by State was as follows-and this is excluding the work to be done at the Australian construction facility; in other words, exactly the same criteria as the table I have just read out: New South Wales, 40 per cent; South Australia, 15 per cent; Victoria, 30 per cent; Queensland, 10 per cent; Western Australia, 3 per cent; and Tasmania, 2 per cent. The undertaking was that New South Wales would get 40 per cent of the work and, in fact, it is now getting 24 per cent of the work. In other words, undertakings from this Government to New South Wales are simply not worth the paper they are written on. That is why I have been pressing the Government for something better than simply a letter from the Prime Minister saying that the work will be done in New South Wales. Quite frankly, why should anyone believe the Prime Minister, of all people, a man renowned for breaking his promises?</PARA>
<PARA> The experience of the submarine contract indicates how uncertain the situation is for the people of Newcastle who have been inadequately represented in the Parliament in seeking to ensure that they get a fair deal. The local Labor members of parliament-and all of them in that region are Labor members-have simply failed to get anything worthwhile from this Government. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to raise a couple of matters with respect to the annual report of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. First, I want to congratulate the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) for not having proceeded with his original intention to grant Mrs Hilaly, the wife of Imam Al Hilaly of the Lakemba Mosque, permanent residence at a time different from consideration of her husband's application. I assume that the rumours that seem to be around Sydney at the moment that something may be done by 13 December when, apparently, some significant formal occasion is to take place, will not involve any action on that front. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to raise once again the question of what arrangements are being made to facilitate applications to migrate to Australia of those people who have left the Eastern bloc and who will be looking for some place to settle. There is no doubt that many skilled people who would make outstanding migrants for Australia may well find that the new freedom to move that has emerged with the destruction of the Berlin Wall will provide them with an opportunity to come to a place like Australia to start a new life. I first asked Senator Ray a question along these lines some time ago when East Germans were using the escape route via Hungary. When I asked him at that stage what arrangements had been made to facilitate applications by those people-I am not necessarily saying as refugees; I mean facilitating normal applications-he responded that there were no special arrangements. I do not think I am doing him an injustice. I hope that the Government will give consideration to fixing the situation. I really believe that there is an opportunity for a major contribution to be made to Australia's migration intake by a group of highly skilled people who would fit into Australian society without major disruption to it. </PARA>
<PARA> I say this in the context of a table on page 19 of the Department's annual report which indicates the top 10 source countries of birth. It is interesting to note just how the numbers appear to have changed substantially. For example, the United Kingdom and Ireland remain the major sources, with something like 19.3 per cent of the total intake. New Zealand is second with 16.2 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the annual report of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, I want to address that section dealing with local government and, in the short time that is available, particularly address three of the subheadings in the report dealing with financial assistance grants, Telecom and Australia Post rates, and rationalisation of administrative functions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Specifically on the question of financial assistance grants, once again this year we saw the Government change the formula for making available general purpose grants to local government because the formula which has tied local government grants to State government general purpose grants would have meant that local government got even less than it did by way of the special Act that was brought in. It was interesting to hear Senator Reynolds say in a fairly recent debate that she believed that it was better for local government grants to be tied to State government grants because Tom Uren, under the Whitlam Government, had decided that that was the way it ought to go. I thought the idea that somehow we were still living under Whitlamesque principles in the local government area was, to say the least, quite peculiar. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite clearly, the function of the Government has been to try to make State and local governments together wear the collective pain of a screw-down of expenditure in the pubic sector. Local government, in particular, is being made to suffer for the failure of the Hawke-Keating economic policies. So, whilst in effect in the last Budget the Federal Government effectively increased its own general purpose grants by some 5.5 per cent, local governments and State governments had their share of general purpose grants reduced. This results in councils being forced either to put up rates or else cut services. This is so despite the promises by the Hawke Government that there would be no reduction in the payment in money terms from one year to the next. The Government promised that it would provide a financially stable base from which local government would be able to plan. Quite clearly, the way the Government is operating on an ad hoc basis from year to year, simply deciding to select a sum and then introduce special legislation to make that the general purpose grant to be then distributed via the States Grants Commission, is doing nothing to provide predictable funding for local government. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of Telecom Australia and Australia Post rates, I read with interest the following words in the report:</PARA>
<PARA>During the year, considerable attention needed to be given to the equity problems which would have arisen among councils as a result of the Government's decision in May 1988 to recoup, from 1 July 1989, 90 per cent of the local government rates to be paid by Telecom and Australia Post. </PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The decision was rescinded in April 1989 following the extensive consultation with local government representatives and the Grants Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact that the Federal Government tried to claw back the equitable decision that both Australia Post and Telecom should be obliged to pay council rates and was ultimately defeated by the pressure of local government, and others who had the interests of local government at heart, is somewhat underplayed by the simple statement in the report that the decision was rescinded. Indeed, Senator Reynolds, on the same occasion that I mentioned before, chose to claim somehow that it was a success of the Government that it had managed to defeat its own policy. I found this line of reasoning quite quaint. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of the rationalisation of administrative functions is also one that is worthy of comment. It does start to address, and only start to address, the problem of how a service is best delivered to the public, at what level of government, the competition that occurs between those levels of government and, indeed, the absolute need to avoid not only duplication but also triplication. Clearly, there is need for a mechanism, which the Opposition has undertaken to provide in government, to determine the best level at which a particular service can be delivered and to ensure that, whichever level of government is determined to so deliver that service, it has the resources to do that which can be predictable and long term. The resources should not be cut off or determined from above. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak to two annual reports of the Merit Protection Review Agency-the annual report for the year to 30 June 1988 and the annual report for the year to 30 June 1989. Very rarely do we get this exciting double with a report being exactly a year out of date. I am glad that on this occasion the authorities have provided a justification for this extraordinary delay. Mr Gifford, the Director, wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on 31 October 1989 apologising for the inordinate delay in the submission of the report and accepted personally the responsibility for that delay. I commend him for doing it. I must say that I am concerned, when reading the reasons for the delay, about the judgments that were involved and the matters that caused it. He says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Early in 1989, the Director's time was diverted substantially to, among other things, managing a series of shortfall in funds for the agency arising from unforeseen events earlier in the financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know what the unforseen events were but it seems an interesting situation. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> The failure to seek an extension of time for the lodgment of this report occurred because, the Director of the agency expected to finalise the report very early in 1989 and then, when directed to the other priorities mentioned above, omitted to follow the guidelines required in the seeking of an extension. </PARA>
<PARA>All I have to say about this is that I believe there is a requirement on all these bodies to report promptly. It is most unfortunate that this one did not.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also a bit sloppy that in the report that we are dealing with now, the one to June 1988, the date given for the correspondence to the Prime Minister is June 1989 whereas the covering letter, which is submitting the report for his consideration, is dated 31 October 1989. I think that after a year it could have got it right. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report covers a subject that the Waste Watch Committee, when I was Chairman of it, dealt with in some depth. It was evident at that time that there was an inordinate proportion of Commonwealth public servants retiring because of so-called invalidity. In fact, this report, which shows a considerable improvement in that situation, nonetheless still reveals that of the pensions in force on 30 June this year 37,920 resulted from age or early age retirement and almost as many, 32,713, resulted from invalidity. I think it is worth noting also that invalidity retirements in the Australian Capital Territory-that is, in the Commonwealth Public Service here in Canberra-constitute only 0.4 per 100 but in South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania the rate ranges between 0.92 and 0.96, which is more than double the rate in the ACT.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been asking over many years why there is this continued disparity in invalidity rates between the various States. Is it because public servants in the ACT live a pure, healthy and good life and are well represented in this place or is it because there is a fiddle going on in invalidity which is costing Australian taxpayers multimillions of dollars? I draw attention to the fact that, for example, in Victoria there were 620 retirements in the latest year for invalidity and only 609 people retiring because of age. In other words, there were more invalidity retirements than age retirements, whereas in New South Wales there were 987 age retirements and only 530 invalidity retirements-a little over half. In the ACT, there is the same sort of situation. There were 551 retirements as a result of age and only 250 as a result of invalidity. </PARA>
<PARA> We have here a curious situation persisting; in particular, it can be seen from the nature of the invalidity retirements. In New South Wales last year 72 people retired as a result of neuroses and 186 retired in Victoria as a result of neuroses--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly, there we have a Labor State government. These are Federal public servants but they obviously are being driven mad by having a Labor government there. Is it not incredible that we have so many more Commonwealth public servants working in New South Wales-79,663-and only 67,109 working in Victoria but we have at least two and a half times the number of people retiring in Victoria from neuroses than in New South Wales? Without making any comment about it, I must say that more people suffering from neuroses seem to manage to retire in Queensland than in New South Wales but it is a matter of concern that some kind of racket seems to be taking place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also interesting to note that the next biggest item concerns disorders of the spine, known as bad backs. However, the Government's activities seem to have diminished the volume of disability retirements on that score from the ludicrous levels that existed in previous years. But it has not yet conquered this neurosis question. I wonder whether this has something to do with deliberate departmental policy to try to get rid of people. In Victoria the number of retrenchments in the latest year was 1,900-many more than in New South Wales, where the comparable figure was 1,536. It seems that the organisation is using invalidity retirement as an excuse, as a way to get rid of people, when there are large retrenchment requirements in the Commonwealth Public Service. I think it is an improper use of the system. We are being ripped off either voluntarily or involuntarily. In either case it should stop.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This report gives us the details of the operation of the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986, which was designed to prevent the export from Australia of cultural items which it is believed in the national interest should not leave this country, or only under certain circumstances. Interestingly enough, the Act needs to be read with one of the treaties which is listed as paper No. 97, which I think is now not on the list for today. The treaty, which was tabled the other day, the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property 1970, is a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation convention to which we are in the process of becoming a party. I welcome that very much. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer only to two matters regarding cultural heritage under this Act. The first is that the report, for the first time, gives us a comprehensive list of the specific applications made for export permits. I am glad that people will now have the opportunity to note the extent to which the major applicants are in fact galleries and libraries. The main purpose of the permit deals with the export or import of items to be shown to the public in these galleries. The report draws attention to the very significant work that our major galleries do in promoting the opportunity not only for Australians to see significant overseas works of art but also for sending significant Australian works of art to reciprocal galleries and museums, which gives us a far greater exposure to these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Hill said yesterday in the debate on the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Australian foreign policy under this Government, has been quite negligent in failing to make effective promotional use of our unique cultural identity as part of Australia's foreign relations program. I take this opportunity to draw attention to the fact that in both the arts policy and foreign affairs policy documents issued by the Opposition we make a significant commitment to the upgrading of the cultural relations branch of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. </PARA>
<PARA> During this year one notable decision was made-the refusal by the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding) to allow a John Glover painting, the Bath of Diana, to be exported from Australia. It had been purchased by an American citizen at auction in April 1989 for $1.76m, the highest price ever paid for an Australian painting. This painting was not permitted to be exported. Such a case demonstrates the precise reason that this Act was passed. I hope that it will make people aware that, if they are seeking to purchase works of art and cultural property in Australia, it is no longer simply an open market where things can be purchased and removed at will. I hope that people will understand that. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point to which I wish to make reference concerns the return of the Paracas mantle to Peru by Australia. It is interesting that this mantle was returned in October. It had been improperly acquired overseas and brought to Australia. It is a wrapping cloth, a mantle, from the Paracas culture in Peru, allegedly some 2,500 years old. We made a great fuss about the return of this mantle from the Australian National Gallery, despite the fact that on 26 September 1988 the Gallery issued a statement saying that there was a case of mistaken identity and that the mantle which had been identified was not the Paracas mantle. It took another 12 months or so to work out that it was the mantle originally referred to, and it has now been returned to the Peruvian Government. As I said in a debate about cultural policy quite recently, I believe that it is important that there be some mechanism for the return of goods which have been improperly looted from their original homelands. I am glad to see that the operation of this Act now facilitates that. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend all of those who have been working as advisers to the Minister on this piece of legislation. It is an important piece of legislation which had the active support of the Opposition when it was introduced in 1986. I am pleased to see the success that it has had to date. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Only 12 private members' Bills have passed through the Federal Parliament since Federation. This one, the Smoking and Tobacco Products Advertisements (Prohibition) Bill 1989, therefore deserves close parliamentary scrutiny, especially as the Government has foreshadowed some 22 amendments. It would be utterly cynical and insulting to the democratic process to gag or guillotine legislation without adequate time for debate. However, the Opposition is conscious of the limited time available for this general business debate and some unfounded accusations of stalling. For that reason I will speak on behalf of the Opposition and place on record some of our views and concerns. A coalition government was responsible for the partial ban on the advertising of tobacco products, which has operated in this country since 1976 by virtue of section 100 of the Broadcasting Act 1942. It is clear that such limitation on the traditional freedom to advertise legal products is widely supported in this country and it is not seriously proposed that the clock should be turned back in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill in question was introduced into the Senate on 31 August and it is fair to say that it then contained a range of provisions which were unacceptable to some of my colleagues, particularly those matters which could be broadly described as relating to the non-print area such as advertising on billboards and posters, in cinemas or on perimeter signs at sporting events. We were conscious of the furore surrounding the inept handling of the Motorcycle Grand Prix issue in Victoria by the Cain Government, which eventually saw the race transferred to New South Wales. We took the view then, and we still adhere to it, that those matters were clearly within the constitutional provinces of State governments and ought to be allowed to be determined individually by them. There was also a body of concern within our own ranks that, before any legislation to introduce a total prohibition on all forms of advertising, there would need to be powerful evidence available that advertising is a significant contributing factor in the decision to take up or continue smoking. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of these legitimate concerns the coalition parties established a committee headed by Dr Michael Wooldridge, which included among its ranks a prominent New South Wales cancer specialist and member of parliament, Dr Bob Woods. The committee's brief was to consider carefully all the issues associated with this vexed question and to report back in time for this debate to proceed on an informed and considered basis. The position remained thus until earlier this week when the Government decided to support our contention that non-print matters should not be the subject of Federal legislation. We will therefore be supporting the Government's proposed amendments in this regard. However, the Government also made it plain that it was determined to support the balance of the Australian Democrats' Bill to such an extent that the second reading stage will be concluded before today is out. The Opposition regrets this unseemly haste, which can only be motivated by the imminence of the next Federal election. The Parliament is presently scheduled to resume in the second half of February next year. No time would need to have been lost by allowing ample time for debate, as the 12-month delay before the Bill comes into effect could have been shortened to take account of any additional time required to enable the normal consideration and passage of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will be passed by the Senate and we will certainly not be seeking to obstruct its passage or to filibuster during this debate, as some commentators have wrongly, and in some cases mischievously, speculated. We are anxious, however, that the debate should proceed and decisions should be taken on the basis of fact and information rather than being driven by mere rhetoric and emotion. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is now increasingly being accepted by the community and even by some inveterate smokers in our own ranks that smoking is a thoroughly unhealthy and potentially lethal practice, which is now much more socially unacceptable than it was even five years ago. It is also widely understood in the community that there is a powerful volume of evidence which demonstrates beyond reasonable doubt the health hazards of cigarette smoking. I would expect that there would be few persons above the age of reason who would not be similarly aware of such dangers. This of course does not dissuade some from taking up smoking even if only for an experimental period. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition parties are also aware of strong community concerns that government should, where possible, take effective action to discourage smoking, especially among the young. No serious person can gainsay the appalling loss of life occasioned by lung cancer, heart disease and a range of other respiratory and circulatory diseases. It is by now clear that statistical evidence demonstrates that cigarette smokers are much more likely to die of these diseases than non-smokers. It follows therefore that a responsible society, which, in many instances, is required to bear the financial burden, as well as the social trauma, of the associated medical and hospital treatment, may well consider a range of interventionist actions to discourage such behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it does not follow that the banning of all cigarette advertising will necessarily have such an effect. The case of Norway, which has banned all forms of cigarette advertising since 1975, is often cited in this context. However, the facts of the matter are that the decrease in teenage smoking in New South Wales over the last three years is far greater than for the last 10 years in Norway. Indeed, over the last decade tobacco consumption has dropped by some 7 per cent in Norway, whereas over the last decade in Australia we have seen a massive decrease of some 24 per cent. Cause and effect is therefore always a very contentious scientific conundrum. It is therefore understandable that the latest United States Surgeon-General's report published in January this year states:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no scientifically rigorous study available to the public that provides a definitive answer to the basic question of whether advertising and promotion increase the level of tobacco consumption. </PARA>
<PARA>It was because of our serious concern to explore all aspects of the issue, especially the significance of bans on advertising and the success of anti-smoking campaigns, especially the Quit campaign in Victoria and the activities of various State health promotion foundations, that we established a Party committee to carefully consider the evidence in this area. It would have been highly desirable, and remains so, for the committee to have been able to complete its inquiries and to have reported before this debate was concluded. But it would now seem that the passage of the Bill is to be governed by the Government's election timetable. </PARA>
<PARA> We wish to make it quite clear that we believe that exceptional circumstances should exist before a government imposes restrictions on the advertising of a product which it is legal to sell. Indeed there are some who regard this as a very powerful issue of principle, although we are aware that there are other potentially dangerous products, such as guns and prescription drugs, the advertising of which is severely circumscribed in the public interest. In particular, we do not see any logical connection between any ban on the advertising of cigarettes, which are likely to be harmful to health even in limited quantities, and any attempt to ban or restrict the advertising of alcohol or motor vehicles, which are quite safe when used in moderation. It is to be hoped in future that any government proposal which constitutes a fundamental intrusion on traditional freedoms and which raises fundamental questions as to censorship will be proceeded with only after adequate time for consultation and debate and will not be driven principally by electoral considerations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to advise the Government's decision to move to ban the advertising of all tobacco products in the print media. To this end, today I will be moving amendments to the Smoking and Tobacco Products Advertisements (Prohibition) Bill 1989 introduced into the Parliament by Senator Powell, I think on 31 August this year, to give effect to a ban. The Bill as presented by the Australian Democrats also contains some drafting deficiencies which the Government has sought to rectify in the amendments I will be moving. The amendments will also ensure that the Bill conforms with current Commonwealth criminal law policy. Later in the committee stage I will refer to these matters in greater detail. The Government proposes that a ban would come into effect 12 months after the legislation receives royal assent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is strong expert opinion throughout Australia and internationally that recognises the need for a ban on tobacco advertising. As long ago as 1979, a World Health Organisation expert committee recommended total prohibition of all forms of tobacco advertising. In 1987, the Sixth World Conference on Smoking and Health recommended that all forms of tobacco advertising in all media be banned in all countries. The National Health and Medical Research Council in 1980 fully supported the World Health Organisation's recommendation that there be a total prohibition on all forms of tobacco advertising. Health Ministers, at their meeting in Melbourne last month, called for governments to move towards a complete ban on all advertising of tobacco products. The Australian Medical Association (AMA) is committed to achieving a reduction in smoking with the objective of reducing disease, disability and premature death related to smoking. The AMA has recognised as essential the need for Federal action at this point to prohibit print media advertising of tobacco products. Many other professional and community organisations are fully supportive of the Government's decision to ban tobacco advertising-organisations such as the Australian Cancer Society, the National Heart Foundation and the Australian Association for Adolescent Health. There is strong community support for a ban on print media tobacco advertising generally as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Surveys in Western Australia in mid-1989 showed that 72 per cent of those surveyed supported a ban on tobacco advertising. Surveys in South Australia in December 1988 found that 82 per cent of those surveyed approved a ban on advertising in newspapers and magazines. Surveys in New South Wales in July of last year found that 70 per cent of those surveyed approved a complete advertising ban. Surveys in Victoria in June 1987 showed that 63 per cent of those surveyed approved an advertising ban. These surveys also show that support for legislative restrictions on advertising is strong regardless of political persuasion; indeed, it can be said that all political parties equally oppose advertising of cigarettes and smoking. Therefore, it is not an issue that divides parliaments or political parties by ideology. </PARA>
<PARA> We, as Australian policy makers in the Senate today, cannot ignore the unanimous opinion being expressed by many of our leading professional bodies, and the strong public support on this issue. The need to ban tobacco advertising in the print media is based on the inescapable fact that tobacco is the major preventable cause of death and disease in Australia. Another significant fact is that there is no safe level or form of tobacco use. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1987 tobacco contributed to the deaths of 18,000 Australians. Seventy-one per cent of drug caused deaths in Australia are attributable to tobacco-related illnesses, including approximately 75 per cent of all cases of lung cancers. Tobacco smoke contains 43 known carcinogens. The more people smoke and the longer they smoke, the greater their chances are of developing lung cancer. Overall, smokers are 10 times more likely to die from lung cancer than are non-smokers, and heavy smokers are 15 to 25 times more at risk than non-smokers. If current trends persist, lung cancer will overtake breast cancer as the commonest malignancy amongst Australian women by the early 1990s. To give another example, 75 per cent of chronic bronchitis and emphysema is attributable to smoking. Almost all smokers of more than 20 cigarettes per day show some degree of emphysema. The chronic nature of these diseases means that those who develop them may continue to live for many years with various degrees of disability. At their worst, sufferers may be bed bound, dependent on home oxygen, or even require life support systems. </PARA>
<PARA> To continue with the examples, 25 per cent of ischaemic heart disease is related to tobacco consumption. Smokers have a two- to four-fold greater risk of suffering sudden heart attack than non-smokers. Cigarette smoking has also been linked with cancers of the oral cavity, oesophagus and stomach. In addition to the risk of these diseases, women who smoke are placing themselves at further risk of suffering from cancers of the cervix and from complications in pregnancy. Babies born to women who smoke are, on average, smaller. Smoking while breastfeeding is also harmful. More than 20 cigarettes a day will reduce milk supply and can cause gastro-intestinal problems for babies. Babies of parents who smoke are much more likely to have chest problems and bronchial complaints during the first years of life. Australians are generally aware that smoking is bad for their health and, indeed, smoking by the general population is gradually declining. For example, in 1976 40 per cent of males and 31 per cent of females smoked, while in 1986 33 per cent of males and 29 per cent of females smoked. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear from these figures, however, that male rates of smoking are declining more rapidly than rates for women. This is a matter of great concern. Young women aged between 20 and 24 years have the highest smoking rate of all Australian adult smokers, with 41 per cent of women in this age group smoking. In addition young girls aged 12 to 15 years form the group with the greatest trend of experimentation and uptake of smoking. The smoking rates among blue-collar workers are also of concern. A study of smoking rates by occupational level shows that overall, for both sexes, blue-collar workers smoke more than white-collar workers. </PARA>
<PARA> The most recent Australian study on the costs of smoking to the Australian economy was undertaken in 1987 by the Western Australian Health Department. The study estimated that the total economic cost of smoking-related illness in Australia is in excess of $2.5 billion per annum. Honourable senators in this chamber who are concerned with micro-economic reform know that there is a clear case that considerable savings can be made, in terms of the micro-economy, through disease prevention. The Western Australian study, to which I have referred, took into account the direct medical expenses of treating smokers, and the loss of income and productivity of individuals disabled by smoking-related illness. This estimate is conservative and the real economic cost of smoking to the community is probably far in excess of this amount. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the Government has a responsibility to act to discourage Australians from smoking. Particularly we wish to discourage young people from starting to smoke while acting to reduce the pressures on them to do so. The banning of tobacco advertising in the print media is an important step in our continuing strategy to lower the incidence of smoking in the community. I believe the Government has a commendable record for action in this regard. Many of the initiatives we have introduced were world firsts. As to our achievements, in 1976 a ban on the advertising of cigarettes on television and radio was introduced. The ban was extended in 1988 to all tobacco products. We have been instrumental in having rotating health warnings on cigarette packets. In 1987, a ban on smoking on domestic airline flights and commuter services commenced. In 1988, Qantas Airways Ltd commenced regular smoke-free flights to New Zealand. In 1988, a ban on smoking in all federally registered coaches was introduced, and during 1988 it was followed progressively by bans in State and Territory coaches and buses. In 1988, a ban on smoking in buildings occupied by the Australian Public Service was introduced. This has since been extended to all Commonwealth buildings. In 1988 the Commonwealth announced an agreement with the tobacco manufacturers to reduce the levels of tar and nicotine in cigarettes sold in Australia to among the lowest levels in the world. A ban on the supply of smokeless tobacco products intended for oral use was introduced this year. These measures have been coordinated with State government initiatives through the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategies (MCDS). The MCDS is currently developing a national health strategy on tobacco. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point I would like to address what we as a government perceive as a major problem with the Australian Democrats legislation as it stands; namely, that it does not recognise the division of powers between the Commonwealth and the States in Australia's federal system. The Government will move to amend this Bill effectively to ban the advertising of tobacco products in the print media Australia-wide. There is a clear role for the Commonwealth to impose such a ban as it is extremely doubtful that a State government could effectively impose or enforce such a ban in its State, given the national character of Australia's media industry. However, the Government considers that it is not appropriate that the Commonwealth legislate regarding the forms of tobacco advertising included in the Democrats Bill, such as billboards, hoardings and walls and audio or visual announcements, including in cinemas where the States have shown that they can effectively impose bans on tobacco advertising. The Government amendments to this Bill will delete those aspects of the Bill which seek to have the Commonwealth interfere in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Several States have already acted in relation to these matters, with the encouragement and support of the Commonwealth Government. In Victoria, legislation was introduced in 1987 to prohibit cinema advertising, outdoor advertising, including billboards and unsolicited leaflets covering cigarettes, competitions and the distribution of free samples. The legislation also established the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation, which is funded by a levy of 5 per cent on wholesale tobacco sales. It funds activity relating to the promotion of good health and the prevention and early detection of disease, provides grants for research and health promotion programs and provides sponsorship to sports and the arts. </PARA>
<PARA> In South Australia, the Tobacco Products Control Act 1988 established the Foundation South Australia which receives a proportion of money collected as tobacco merchant licences. Financial support from the fund is provided as grants or loans to sporting and cultural bodies for any sporting, recreational or cultural activities that contribute to health. In Western Australia-I interpolate here and pay tribute to the Burke Government's Minister for Health, Barry Hodge, who, in many respects, is a pioneer in this form of legislation-legislation similar to that in Victoria and South Australia has been introduced into the Parliament. New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania have entered into voluntary arrangements with tobacco companies to restrict the marketing of tobacco products. The States and Territories have also continued to conduct a wide variety of `quit' campaigns all aimed at increasing awareness of the dangers of tobacco consumption and reducing smoking rates in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already referred to the high rates of smoking and experimentation with smoking among respectively young women and teenage girls. Early next year, the Minister for Community Services and Health, Dr Blewett, will be launching a $2m national print and television media campaign targeting a reduction in smoking by young women. The campaign will target women in the 12 to 15 and 20 to 24 year age groups. The 12 to 15 year age group shows the greatest trend towards experimentation and uptake of smoking, and women in the 20 to 24 year age group have the highest smoking rates in Australia. The campaign strategy has been designed to complement anti-smoking activities already in place in the States and Territories. A number of States have run anti-smoking activities for several years and have well-developed school and community programs, as well as cessation services. </PARA>
<PARA> An anomaly exists in the advertising of tobacco products, which I have already said has been banned in the electronic media since 1976, but which has continued in the print media. The Government believes that the time has come to correct this anomaly. The Government will allow a 12-month period prior to the ban becoming law to allow the print and advertising industries a reasonable period of adjustment. If the experience of the banning of tobacco advertising on radio and television is an indicator, however, there should be little impact on industry of such a ban. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988, expenditure by tobacco companies for all national advertising in Australia was estimated to be about $40m, of which approximately 58 per cent, or $27m, was spent in the metropolitan press and 25 per cent, or $10m, in magazines. This represents less than 2 per cent of all print media advertising expenditure which has been estimated at a total of $2.2 billion. The approximately $10m spent on tobacco advertising in magazines represents less than 5 per cent of the estimated $204m spent on all advertising in magazines. It is interesting to note, however, that about 60 per cent of tobacco advertising expenditure in magazines is in women's magazines. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that there is sufficient evidence of a link between tobacco advertising and the uptake of smoking to justify our action in this matter. Advertising alters the way cigarettes are perceived. It changes the image of cigarettes from a harmful, addictive drug to symbols of wealth, glamour, success and healthy good looks. A major research study of children in New South Wales, reported in the international Journal of Epidemiology in 1983, found that children who approved of cigarette advertising were twice as likely to smoke as those who disapproved of such advertising. Generally, children who held favourable attitudes to smoking and cigarette advertising were at greater risk of adopting or maintaining smoking behaviour than those whose attitudes were more disapproving. This report went on to recommend that tobacco advertising be banned. </PARA>
<PARA> A 1980 survey of school children in Perth found that over 80 per cent of children considered that cigarette advertisements probably encourage children to take up smoking. The study also showed that there was a positive association between liking a particular advertising and the use of a particular brand. A 1980 survey of secondary school children in Sydney found a similar correlation between the most heavily advertised brands and the use of these brands. A recent study by the National Health and Medical Research Council, the major health advisory body to governments in Australia, suggested that attempts to prevent the uptake of smoking by children are unlikely to be effective while cigarette advertising is still permitted. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of countries have banned tobacco advertising, including Norway, Canada, Finland, Italy, Portugal, Singapore and Ireland. In Norway, a total ban on cigarette advertising has been in effect since 1974. Detailed research has shown substantial falls in smoking among adolescents since the ban was introduced. This positive trend was ascribed to legislation removing advertising which had created pressure on young people to smoke, to the special attention paid to smoking by girls, and to the change in general attitudes towards smoking and smoking behaviour among adults and young people.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided that the time has now come in Australia to act to stop tobacco advertising in the print media. At this point may I congratulate those sections of the media who have been prepared to analyse critically the health issues relating to tobacco advertising and to voice their support for a government ban. Print media advertising is a national issue and one on which it is unlikely that any State or Territory could effectively deal with, acting alone. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, there is ample evidence of a link between tobacco advertising and the uptake of smoking to justify a print media ban on strong public health grounds. I have gone through those grounds in some detail. It is imperative that the Government acts now to discourage Australians from smoking and, particularly, to reduce pressures on young people to take up smoking in the first place. While I commend the Australian Democrats' initiative, the Government will move the amendments that I have foreshadowed when we reach the committee stage. We support the second reading of this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank Senator Alston, who spoke on behalf of the Opposition, and the Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, who spoke for the Government, for their contributions to this debate. Senator Alston outlined the concerns of the Opposition and informed us of the work of the committee which was established over the past few weeks to address those concerns. Senator Cook gave the Senate a most comprehensive and researched historical and scientific rundown.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe that the passage of the Smoking and Tobacco Products Advertisements (Prohibition) Bill 1989, in its amended form, will be one of the most positive results of some 20 years of activism and hard work by health groups and anti-tobacco activists in our community. The peak bodies-in particular, the Australian Medical Association, the National Heart Foundation, the Australian Cancer Society, the Doctors Reform Society-as well as their constituent bodies, including many royal colleges in the health field, Action on Smoking and Health and a wide range of health and community groups, have, for many years, come in behind the legislation for which, as Senator Cook has said, the time does seem to have come. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point I emphasise that the Democrats see this piece of legislation as a result of the work of those groups. I want to add to the list that I have spoken about-it is by no means comprehensive; but we do not have time to be comprehensive about it-a former member of my staff, Mr Peter Allen, who has been a long time activist in these groups and who was instrumental in the original drawing up of this legislation. That work has been consistent, as I have said, for many years and that battle has been taken up in the Senate by the Australian Democrats since 1977. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge the work of my colleagues, both present and former Democrat senators. Regrettably, most of their initiatives to this point have not received enough support in the Parliament for passage. Some individuals in the Parliament have been very public supporters of the kinds of initiatives which we have moved in this place, notably Senator Peter Baume and the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett), who is represented here by Senator Cook-but, regrettably, not enough to have had our initiatives made successful.</PARA>
<PARA> There has not been such a significant parliamentary initiative as this since the electronic advertising ban in 1976, a ban which, we should remember, was implemented under the Fraser coalition Government. In recent years, as Senator Cook has said, there has been a strengthening of public opinion, through increased knowledge and understanding of the realities of this situation, and that has led to the development of certain Government-related initiatives, which Senator Cook has outlined and which have been reflected in the wider community in an increase in the number of smoke-free areas in workplaces, in public places, in aircrafts, in restaurants and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> In that environment we have also seen the States acting. As Senator Cook has also outlined, my own State of Victoria has a proud record in this regard. I had the pleasure a couple of weeks ago of attending the second birthday celebration of the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation at which the Victorian Premier, John Cain, actually wished this legislation well. So I am sure he is very pleased with what is happening here today. In South Australia, too, the legislators have been pioneers to the extent that the States have been able to act. I was disturbed to read that in Western Australia State legislation has been brought forward but was actually blocked in the conservative upper House. I hope that the enlightenment of their Federal colleagues will prompt the Western Australian upper House to move on that legislation. Tasmania is drafting legislation. The change of government in Queensland has brought with it a commitment to like legislation, but there seems to be a major blockage in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this year, the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority put down its report Drugs and Crime in Society. In that report there was a recommendation with regard to advertising bans on alcohol and tobacco. That Committee recommendation was dissented from by the coalition members of that Committee, who said: `We would support a ban on tobacco advertising, but we are not satisfied that a ban on the advertising of alcohol products is justified'. Senator Alston has reiterated that point here today. It was upon the release of the Joint Committee report that we decided that it would be timely-given the change of public opinion, the movement in the States and that report, which pointed to cross-party support for a ban at least on the advertising of cigarettes and tobacco products-to introduce into this place a piece of legislation which would enact such a ban. We announced our intention to do so in about May and this Bill was introduced on 31 August. We wanted to give time for consideration by both the Government and the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I express at this point our disappointment that the Government has not been prepared to go all the way with the total provisions of the Australian Democrats Bill. In our view, it is important that national government takes a lead. We believe that the Government should, on this occasion, be prepared to use the corporations power across the board. However, the Government has not agreed with us. That position has also been taken by the Opposition. Therefore, we will be accepting the Government's amendments with reluctance and disappointment, because it is clear that we cannot always rely on the States to act as speedily as we would want them to. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there are positive signs and, as I say, a change of government in Queensland is the latest of those. I hope that the passage of this legislation will move the upper House in Western Australia and the New South Wales Government. I note that the Minister for Health in New South Wales has expressed his support for a ban on advertising tobacco products. I simply hope that this strengthens his arm against that of his less enlightened Premier. This is an obvious area, for all the reasons that Senator Cook has outlined, for action in national leadership. This is an action that requires all-party support. Tobacco use costs this country $2 1/2 billion and more on an annual basis. Every year in Australia 70,000 teenagers become regular smokers. Each day, more than 500 Australian school children smoke their first cigarette. Three-quarters of adults who smoke started smoking when they were adolescents. If our present smoking trends continue, over 2,500 boys and 159,000 girls who are under the age of 14 now will die before their time because they have smoked. The younger children start smoking, the more likely they are to die of smoking related diseases. There have been a great many other statistics and facts put down in this debate by Senator Cook. Conscious of the time of the Senate at this difficult time of year, I just ask the Senate to recall those. I believe that those facts have moved people on both sides of the chamber, including the committee which the Opposition has set up to investigate this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of our disappointment with the Government's restrictions on a ban, the print ban which will be in place with the passage of this Bill, as amended, will really be a major step forward. In fact, it is probably the most significant public health measure that has been taken by this Parliament for a very long time. It is preventive action. Preventive health measures are a matter of strong Australian Democrats policy. This is consistent with Government moves towards better health for the community. It is appropriate action for a coalition which made the last major step in this area under Malcolm Fraser. Therefore, as I said, we are accepting the Government's amendments to our Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I, too, would like to commend those involved in the media on their performance, particularly in recent weeks, on this issue. I especially commend the print media and journalists in particular-not just the journalists, but also the other people involved. It was certainly a pleasure to read in the Melbourne Age this morning support for the moves that are to be made in this Parliament. After declaring an interest in revenue and expressing concerns about bans on any kind of advertising, the newspaper went on to say that this was a matter of principle rather than of profit. That really encapsulates the sort of approach that has been taken here today, one which we had hoped when we introduced the Bill in August would be taken eventually, and one which we commend. We urge upon the Senate a speedy passage for this Smoking and Tobacco Products Advertisements (Prohibition) Bill 1989. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a question for the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) with regard to the section of the Government's amendments which relates to the commencement; that is proposed clause 2, under amendment No. 1, which points out that the Act commences on the first day after the end of the period of 12 months beginning on the day on which it receives the royal assent. We believe it is important that royal assent should be sought as soon as possible; there should be no delay to this. Can the Minister enlighten us as to the Government's intentions on this score?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the anxiety of Senator Powell on this matter. The anxiety would in the normal course arise from the fact, of course, that the House of Representatives has risen for all intents and purposes for the summer recess. I am not 100 per cent sure on this point but I do believe that the House of Representatives is to be recalled on 20 or 21 December and will have a very short sitting period. If that is the case, it would be the Government's intention to refer this Bill to the House, should it meet all stages in the Senate, and ask the House to deal with it. My normal expectation would be that it would do so within the time frame set for its sitting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That then leaves open the question of how long it takes to get between the House and the Governor-General for royal assent. My advice on that is that it is a matter of routine printing time and there is no intention to delay that in any form, other than the normal holiday period observed in Australia over the Christmas-New Year period. So, I cannot put a definite time on when it might be given royal assent because there are too many presumptions of passage. But I can give an undertaking that it is the Government's intention to move as expeditiously as possible. Once the Bill is proclaimed, then that 12-month clock begins to tick before the effect of the legislation comes into force. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Amendment 12 provides that the ban would not apply to a print medium printed outside of Australia and not principally intended for distribution within Australia. `Not principally intended' I think are important words. This amendment moved by the Government replaces the existing clause 7 in the Bill that Senator Powell has moved, with this new clause. I go to clause 7 of the Bill and summarise what it does. That clause confers on the Minister of the day power to make a judgment with respect to this class of publication, and thus it would be a decision of the government of the day. The difference between what is proposed by Senator Powell and what the Government is proposing to do by way of amendment is that publications imported into Australia but not principally intended for distribution within Australia would be exempted from the advertising ban, and I think the important element is `not intended for distribution within Australia'.</PARA></TALK.START>

Since my remarks could be adduced for evidence in any court proceeding that may have to define that question, and for the other very good reason that I am not fully instructed on this point, I think it is wise for me to simply say `not principally' as I think that is the significant term in that section of the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

My question is with regard to amendment No. 18, in which the Government is seeking to change the penalty from $60,000 to $12,000. As the Minister will be aware, we have had quite a number of debates in this place over penalties. At various stages in the past we have even had promises from the Government that we would have a comprehensive and consistent policy with regard to penalties. That has not yet been forthcoming. I wonder what the Minister might be seeking to do in moving the penalty from $60,000 to $12,000?

If it does exist, I think he ought to tell a number of the committees of this place, which are constantly having to grapple with the problem that there is no policy from the Government. It announced years ago that it would present a policy on penalties to the Parliament so that we could have consistency. One item in most of the laws we pass here, shoved down the back, is the whammy that if one breaks this law, this is what one gets. The penalties are currently all over the place. There is a most extraordinary range of penalties, many of which are not consistently updated. It was the Government's intention, certainly, to present a policy. By the way, this goes back to when Senator Gareth Evans was Attorney-General and he actually promised this, so it is a fair while ago now.</PARA></TALK.START>

Clause 5 of the Australian Democrats' Bill includes a list of things which are explicitly not included in the amendment. Billboards and hoardings are two examples that crop up in the Democrats' Bill.

The reason why the Government thinks it is appropriate to go this far, but not as far as the Democrats' original Bill proposed to go, is to maintain the balance that is necessary in a federal system between what the States should do and what their rights and obligations are, and the rights and obligations of the Commonwealth. The Government's view is to encourage the States to take action in that area as appropriate, complementary action to that which we are taking here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take it from that that, when a document displayed as a poster is specifically excluded, and billboards and hoardings are not, it is because the Government takes the view that they are clearly not the type of material with which it wants to deal. In other words, the overall philosophy is to draw a demarcation point between print and other material. I think the logic behind that is that there is some material that is distributed nationally-such as newspapers and magazines-which the Government would say needs to be dealt with on a national basis; whereas billboards, posters and hoardings can be dealt with by each State. If that is correct, I would have thought that either billboards and hoardings could have been tacked on so as not to be included in that definition of print medium, or else the explanation must be that it is so obvious that they could not possibly be included. Is it the latter?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take it that the question on annual reports raised by Senator Alston is whether an annual report published by a company for distribution to its shareholders and those with an interest in its activities could contain an advertisement. I believe it would be an offence under these amendments if an annual report contained an explicit advertisement. However, naturally, the Rothmans company, for example, would produce its annual report in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday during the second reading debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1989 there was quite some discussion by me and others on this side of the chamber with regard to the Government bringing forward a company tax proposal that is particularly relevant to clause 36. I want to raise the matter again. Honourable senators will be aware that until August of this year companies with a tax liability of $1,000 or more paid their tax in four instalments spread over the year following the income year. The Government decided that it would change that-we gather for the specific purpose of raising a one-off huge leap in revenue and, hence, in the size of the surplus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government announced in the Budget that new arrangements would be made whereby the quarterly tax payments would be replaced by a new tax system. Under that new system all companies were required to pay 85 per cent of their notional tax in a single instalment due 15 days after the end of the income period relevant to them. For those companies that meant that 15 days after 30 June they were expected to produce 85 per cent of the tax that they owed to the Government, with the remaining 15 per cent being paid nine months later. The Government, presumably under pressure from business organisations and from businesses themselves or just simply because it had a sudden rush of blood to the head, decided that a little commonsense was in order and decided to change this requirement last month. </PARA>
<PARA> On 2 November Mr Keating announced the first of the changes that the Government was to make to this procedure which would have raised quite significantly the amount of tax that had to be paid to the Government before this new procedure came into effect. A little later-in fact, only quite recently-the Government went even further by increasing absolutely the threshold for the next financial year so that it increased a threshold that had gone from $1,000 to $20,000 by a further $380,000 and announced that the new threshold would be $400,000. That would apply for the coming transitional year only and, after that, it would drop back to $20,000 as the absolute limit. In another place the Opposition spokesperson on these matters said some extremely sensible things with regard to what this particular legislation was likely to do to small business and indicated that the Opposition would be moving an amendment that would increase the threshold below which the new proposal did not operate. On 22 November in the taxation legislation debate, Dr Hewson said:</PARA>
<PARA> In my earlier remarks I drew attention to our decision-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Opposition's decision-</PARA>
<PARA>to amend this Bill in a couple of important respects. In particular, I referred to the fact that I had announced our position by way of press release on this Bill before this debate got under way. I-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Dr Hewson-</PARA>
<PARA>read into the record a second reading amendment to that effect which was designed to draw attention to two major deficiencies of the Bill. I foreshadowed that if time allowed, and we were not prevented by the guillotine, at the committee stage I would move the details of those amendments. In all seriousness, given the considerable plight of small business in current circumstances in Australia, I would strongly urge the Government to look at those second reading and committee stage amendments and if possible pick them up, particularly the amendment that relates to the increase in the threshold in which the new instalment arrangements will apply. We-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Opposition parties-</PARA>
<PARA>have identified that as consistent with roughly a taxable income of $200,000 per year or a tax payable amount of about $80,000 a year which is roughly four times the Government's threshold. I put it to the Government that there is an urgent need on the part of the small to medium sized business. I urge the Government to respond favourably to our initiative. To my mind this is the minimum immediate relief that is required in order to minimise the damage done by this Bill from the point of view of the small to medium size business sector. I seek to emphasise that it is the minimum immediate relief required. </PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to point out that the Opposition did not like the decision at all and also went on to discuss matters relating to the self-assessment part of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats said at the time that this amendment was moved some weeks ago that we would support it if it were moved as we, and members of the press who contacted me, assumed it would be moved in the Senate. Speaking on this Bill yesterday I made an incorrect assumption that this was a Bill that was not amendable by the Senate; that it was a Bill to which only a request for amendment could be made to the House of Representatives. I have been advised by our ever vigilant Clerks that this is not the case and that it is an amendable Bill. I think that it is worth while pointing out that the Government's amendment relating to the transitional year will certainly alleviate the problems facing small businesses which may well be forced to borrow money in order to meet the 85 per cent requirement for the next financial year. It will not, however, help those people who have to face up to that payment in subsequent financial years. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know why the Government chose this particular figure of $400,000. I do not know why it brought it in for a transitional year only. The Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) might be able to tell me whether he assumes that that year will give small and medium businesses sufficient opportunity to save up, as it were, the money that they need to pay the 85 per cent requirement 28 days-which is the other amendment that the Government moved-after the end of their income year. If that is the assumption I would like to know on what evidence that assumption is based because in my experience and my discussions with small business proprietors they are certainly not anticipating a sufficient improvement in economic conditions in this country to make the 1991-92 financial year a better proposition for them than this financial year or the one after that-that is, the financial year just gone or the one that is about to end. It seems to me that all that the Government has done by moving this amendment, which has provided some relief for the 1990-91 financial year, is to move the burden 12 months down the track. It is for that reason that I think it is worthwhile that the Hewson amendment be moved in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> The House is coming back, as we all know, on the 20th and 21st of this month. It has other matters to deal with and I ask the Minister to consider seriously the fact that there will be no significant financial impact on the Government in the long term from the passage of this amendment, but it will certainly provide significant benefits for small businesses in both the short and the long term. If the Government wants to review it some time down the track when the economic circumstances of the country generally have improved, when small businesses' cash flow is not as tight as it is, when the capacity for lending institutions to lend the sort of money that would be required if large numbers of small businesses were forced to borrow were a little better, perhaps the figures could be reduced to the $20,000 that is currently in the legislation for financial years subsequent to the next one. </PARA>
<PARA> But in the meantime, with the Treasurer pointing out that he believes there is no end in sight to the situation of high interest rates-which in itself makes even worse the prospect of tens of thousands of small businesses being forced to borrow for that 85 per cent in the financial year after next-the Government cannot see its way clear to accepting the amendment that Dr Hewson moved in another place and to relieving small businesses; that is, those whose notional tax is $80,000 and whose profit, therefore, is in the region of $200,000. If Dr Hewson's amendment were adopted, small businesses would not be forced, within 28 days of the end of the financial year, to find 85 per cent of the tax owing to the Government. I would have thought that it would not make an enormous financial difference to the Government, and it would certainly stop at least some small businesses going to the wall and others from having to increase their debt burden in order to meet the requirements for payment under the Act. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that, while I am not normally noted for my sympathy with the Australian Democrats, the Minister's response on that point left a little to be desired in terms of courtesy. On speaking to the Democrats' amendment to clause 36, let me say that I saw this amendment for the first time at about a quarter past 10 this morning. To be quite fair, it is true that the possibility of such an amendment was foreshadowed yesterday morning by Senator Haines. In that sense, perhaps, Senator Haines could say that I had 24 hours in which to think about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One point that concerns me a little about the technical aspect of the amendment is that it is an amendment to a single clause to change the exemption limit for the continuing period of the Bill as distinct from the transitional year from $20,000 to $80,000. It is not clear to me that in such a complex Bill there would not be some consequentials of that, so to speak, elsewhere in the Bill, which may not have been attended to. I am not saying that there are, but in very complex tax legislation of this kind one often finds that when one alters something in one place one has to--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He does not think so, but he will not guarantee it. I take whatever assurance from that that the Minister is disposed to give me, which is, by the sound of it, not a great deal. I therefore restate my feeling of some concern on that point. But let me come now to the substance, as distinct from the technicalities, of the amendment. I came into the chamber in the middle of Senator Haines's remarks, and I may not have fully comprehended them, but I think she was saying that this proposal is based upon the proposal that was put forward in the other place by Dr Hewson at one point of the debate before the Government had, in fact, decided to make the change in the threshold in respect of the transitional year which it subsequently did make and which is now incorporated in the Bill before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important to note that Senator Haines's amendment would put into the law on a continuing basis the increased threshold which the Opposition at one stage was talking about and which stimulated the Government to revise its views. That may very well be appropriate in the long run, but, as Dr Hewson said in his speech in the second reading debate in the House of Representatives, the Government having finally come to the party in relation to the transitional year in effect removed the immediate concern in respect of 1989-90 and 1990-91. Of course, before we come into 1991 there will be a change of government; we are quite confident of that. We have given an undertaking to review these proposals in their entirety at that stage. On the basis of that, the Opposition does not propose to support this amendment moved by the Democrats on the grounds that the immediate concern, in respect of the transitionary year, has already been attended to-admittedly belatedly-by the Government. So far as the post-transitional years are concerned, we propose to examine the whole situation in six months or so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bishop raised this issue before lunch today. As I said at the time, it is a complicated matter. The officers have prepared a quick, tentative response, if you like, because they have not had the text of what Senator Bishop said and because it was a very long letter. I will read into the record their response based on their understanding of what Senator Bishop said. The special measure to provide an exemption from contributions taxed for certain last minute employer superannuation contributions is in recognition of the administrative arrangements of some superannuation schemes that operate on a partially or wholly unfunded basis. The measure is designed to provide the same tax treatment as if a benefit equal to the last minute contribution was paid direct to the member by the employer. The amendment to the measure proposed by this Bill is necessary to ensure that the measure is not used to avoid tax. I interpolate that the Government makes no apology for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is significant that no complaint has been received from any State government or other public sector fund. That, of course, excludes the Northern Territory. Indeed, in discussions with Treasury officials the reaction to the amendment has been generally favourable. If a pre-July 1988 funding credit is not available for a particular member or members, the same result as that given by the exempting provision could be obtained by paying the last minute employer contributions direct to the fund member. In the majority of situations, the proposed amendment will not create difficulties for funds that want to take advantage of the measure. In the remaining cases, any difficulties may easily be overcome by a change in administrative practices. If Senator Bishop wants to look at the written response that I have just read into the record, she is quite welcome to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I bothered to get out a copy of the press release of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) of 11 August 1988 when these matters were dealt with. Mr Perron makes a point-and this is where the answer that the Minister has just given seems not to be satisfactory-in the penultimate paragraph, and I would be happy to make a copy of the letter available to the officials for them, perhaps, to comment on these specific issues. He says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The proposed amendments appear to be predicated on the assumption that there will always be sufficient pre-July 1988 unfunded liabilities to compensate for the removal of the exemption of the pre-July 1983 component of benefits funded by last minute contributions. This is not a well founded proposition. </PARA>
<PARA>He is speaking for the Northern Territory, and I do not think it is relevant to say what other States may have concluded because the Territory could well be in a different position. Nonetheless, the undertaking was given specifically to the Northern Territory. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The extent of pre-July 1988 unfunded liabilities depends on the date a superannuation scheme commenced and whether any prior service is recognised for benefit purposes. Recently established schemes may have minor or no pre-July 1988 unfunded liabilities, although they may easily have members with a pre-July 1983 component to their eligible service period as a result of recognised employment prior to scheme membership or as a result of a roll-over from another scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that the Northern Territory may be in a singular situation in that it may have taken over superannuation commitments for previous Commonwealth public servants who have gone onto the payroll of the Northern Territory after its own change in status which, if my memory serves me correctly, would be post-1983. So it seems to me that they may be in a singular situation and they may well be entitled to special treatment. I do not see, quite frankly, why some special provision cannot be made for them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bill before the Senate is the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill. It puts in place arrangements for the provision of general purpose assistance grants to the States and the Northern Territory for the 1989 financial year, consistent with the decisions taken at the May 1989 Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting. I point out that this is no minor piece of legislation. It authorises funding totalling $13,135m, which is about 15 per cent of estimated total Commonwealth Budget outlays this financial year. It is a very large financial provision. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) noted:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> General purpose payments to the States and the Northern Territory are estimated to decline by around 3 per cent in real terms in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to laud the Government's record on fiscal restraint and to call on the States to share the burden. I do not know which is the more interesting-the Government's pomposity in that regard or its sheer gall in thus suggesting that it is the States, so to speak, which have to reef in their spending sails in order to match the asserted performance of the Government. The fact is that as opposed to a 3 per cent real reduction for general purpose payments to the States this year the growth in total outlays from the Budget-excluding asset sales-will be a small increase of about 0.1 of one per cent. Nevertheless, it is an increase. As a matter of fact, because that total figure actually incorporates the 3 per cent real decrease in payments to the States comprising about 15 per cent of the Budget, the actual growth in payments for the Commonwealth's own purposes, of course, is higher than 0.1 per cent. I have not actually done the calculation, but it would be something of the order of half of one per cent, I suppose. </PARA>
<PARA> In Budget Paper No. 1, Table 3, headed `Summary of Major Measures by Function', sets out the total expenditure cutting exercise which has been incorporated into the Budget figuring. The spending cut in assistance to other governments is 47 per cent of the total-nearly half of the total expenditure reduction. That calculation does not take account of the various cuts in specific purpose payments to the States which are littered throughout the other functional areas of the Budget. I have to add that this is no one-off occurrence. This year's figures, in fact, continue the story of recent years: a disproportionate cut in payments to the States compared with the Commonwealth's own purpose spending. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has adopted the comparatively easier task of attacking the State Premiers, rather than his Cabinet colleagues, for a major share in the expenditure savings in the past several years. Payments to the States and local government, as a proportion of total Commonwealth outlays, have fallen, in round figures, from over 20 per cent of the total Budget outlays to around 15 per cent since the Hawke-Keating Government came to power. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say that I personally do not object to cuts in the finance being made available by the Commonwealth to the States but I do object to the kind of cant and hypocrisy we have had from the Treasurer and, indeed, the Government generally about its own efforts in cutting spending when in fact, as I have said, the larger part of that achievement has been directed to cutting the funds made available to States rather than cutting the spending of Commonwealth Ministers themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> I might also say, in passing, that what the Treasurer unaccountably fails to mention in talking about the Budget surplus is the contribution of taxation increases to that process. I take one example-a particularly outrageous one-over the life of the Hawke-Keating Government, since it came to office late in 1983. Indirect taxation revenues have increased by 200 per cent-they now stand at approximately three times their level of 6 1/2 years ago. That, of course, has increased at a much faster rate. It has been triple the inflation rate over that particular period. It has also been estimated that, using November 1982 tax scales as a base, bracket creep has contributed during that time some $13.5 billion in additional, cumulative revenue over and above all the so-called tax cuts during the life of the present Government. The coalition, I should say in passing, has given an unequivocal commitment to forgo the increase in revenue because of bracket creep. I ask in passing whether the Government has yet given such a commitment. The answer is no. That, in fact, would be real fiscal discipline that the Treasurer simply could not match. </PARA>
<PARA> The comments I have made do not mean that the coalition does not recognise the need for State governments also to undertake major structural reform and to pare back their expenditures. Our Economic Action Plan proposes to reduce general purpose payments by $300m during the first year of a Peacock-Blunt government. That would represent 2.3 per cent of those payments. As we note in the Economic Action Plan document, some States could do more, to take one example, to take advantage of the larger savings which can be expected from competitive tendering for many services if those services were to be contracted out to the private sector rather than continuing to be performed in the public sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry that the Minister is interjecting along those lines because I regard that as a rather frivolous contribution to the debate and one which is less than worthy of the Minister. It is obvious that on occasions the lowest bid is not taken, for good reason. One of the Minister's colleagues in recent days has tried to explain that in this place in Question Time. I do not propose to spend further time on that digression.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the same point about contracting out, the Business Council of Australia has indicated that, using what it describes as conservative assumptions, contracting out of a variety of functions at the State government level could save such governments up to $600m on an Australia-wide basis. That is the Business Council's calculation. We have no means of checking that independently but, on the basis of the data it puts down, the estimate seems to be not unreasonable, if conservative. Contracting-out exercises undertaken in the State of New South Wales by the Greiner-Murray Government would confirm that that global Australia-wide figure is an underestimate. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I am making to the Senate is that there are very large savings in getting a lot of the functions which are presently performed in the government sector outside to be performed in the private sector. People who have some profit motive get things done more efficiently and more cheaply, providing the same level of service. The key difference between our approach in this area of payments to States and that of this Government is that the $300m cut in general purpose payments to the States which is proposed by the coalition in its Economic Action Plan is merely part of a total program of spending cuts of $2,700m. It is only about 11 per cent of the total cuts, whereas these reductions which the Minister referred to in his second reading speech-perhaps I should not say `boasted about'-total about half of the cuts in the Budget this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to other aspects of the legislation before the Senate. One part of the Bill provides for the payment of $310.5m in interest-free capital grants to the States and the Northern Territory. That is the same amount as was provided last year as grants under the States (Works and Housing) Assistance Act 1988 and it is to be distributed on the same basis as was laid down in that Bill last year. In a departure from recent years, the arrangements that are proposed for this year do not provide for concessional loans for public housing. Those loans are being replaced by additional grants under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. These changes in administrative arrangements per se are not opposed by the coalition and therefore I do not propose to spend any further time on them. But the money for public housing brings to mind the devastation caused by the Hawke Government to the Australian dream of private home ownership through high interest rates and the capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA> But the story may not end there. The Melbourne Herald report of 9 November this year noted that the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) executive recently endorsed a proposal that houses of over $1m in value should attract the capital gains tax. I suppose the general reaction of most people in the community if they were told that houses over $1m should attract the capital gains tax would be something of a yawn. I can almost see Senator Ray confirming my speculation. But, of course, the question really is whether, if such a measure were introduced, it would be the thin end of the wedge and would lead in due course to an extension of that proposal to houses of a value much lower than $1m. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know that one of the major distortions created by the Government's capital gains tax, under which a capital gain on a taxpayer's principal private residence is exempt, is that it has diverted enormous amounts of money into the housing sector, which, although perhaps it is not a fair way of describing it, most people regard as a non-productive sector of the economy. That is perhaps not a fair term, but many people regard it as so when compared with, say, manufacturing industry or some other obvious industry. They see the housing sector as being more akin to a consumption area than a production area. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that we now have a capital gains tax with this exclusion of the principal private residence is one of the principal causes of the outrageous increase in housing prices which was earlier experienced in Sydney and Melbourne, although that house of financial cards is perhaps now crumbling under the impact of the Treasurer's crushingly high interest rates. Of course, the only solution to that is either effectively to remove the capital gains tax altogether-that is the solution that the coalition proposes in the Economic Action Plan-or to include the principal private residence in the capital gains tax net. In other words, I am saying that there are only two ways of removing the distortion: one is to get rid of the capital gains tax as such so that the exclusion no longer arises; the other is to get rid of the exclusion by including the principal private residence in the capital gains tax net. Of course, the Government has not indicated that it will do that. But, as I have said, the ACTU has recently indicated that private residences of a value of more than $1m should no longer qualify for the exclusion; in other words, that the capital gains tax should apply on the sale of such residences. Once that first step is taken, I predict that it would be only a matter of time before the capital gains tax would be applied to houses of a lower value than $1m. After all, we should all remember the solemn promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in 1983 that he would not introduce a capital gains tax at all. He said, `There will be no capital gains tax'. </PARA>
<PARA> The final issue I raise in regard to this Bill harks back to a concern with equivalent legislation last year, the States Grants (General Revenue) Bill 1988. In the course of debate in the Senate on last year's legislation, I focused my remarks on clause 7 of that Bill which, I remind the Senate, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if, in the opinion of the Treasurer, the global borrowing limit for the State has been exceeded, the Treasurer may reduce payment due to the State under this Act by an amount equal to, or less than, the amount that the Treasurer determines to be the amount of the excess. </PARA>
<PARA>That clause gave two clear messages. First, it laid to rest any doubt that the so-called global borrowing limits program, which was begun in 1984, was not the voluntary arrangement that the Commonwealth Government had always claimed it was. Secondly, the clause showed how vindictive-I think I said this at the time-the Hawke-Keating Labor Government would be to State governments of a different political hue; that clause was, of course, aimed directly at Queensland and at no other State. Despite all the outrageous misuse of taxpayers' money in States such as Western Australia, Victoria and, prior to the present New South Wales Government, in New South Wales, despite various deals such as the collapse of Rothwells Ltd and the whole murky Western Australia Incorporated system, and despite for that matter in Victoria, the Victorian Economic Development Corporation scandal and the suspect decisions of the former Deputy Premier Fordham-in other words, the deals of Labor governments-no action was taken or proposed to be taken by this Labor Government against the governments in those States. However, last year when Queensland baulked at having its borrowing limits cut by one-third-itself a totally vindictive decision-the Treasurer maliciously changed the longstanding legislative forms to get back at it. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise this issue because the Minister for Justice himself raised it in his second reading speech on this Bill. In that speech he noted that no equivalent to clause 7 from last year was included this year. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . should any State in the future fail to commit itself to the global limits or fail to use its best endeavours to observe them, the Government would be prepared to propose the reintroduction of the provision to this or future legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>One should really read the words `any State' as `any non-Labor State'. Today there is only one such State in the Commonwealth. Under those circumstances, New South Wales should beware. But the others, including now the new Government of Queensland, can go on with their outrageous financial practices and be totally free from any fear of retribution from this Commonwealth Treasurer. I move the following amendment to the motion for a second reading, which has been circulated in my name:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``but the Senate notes that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the Hawke/Keating Government's prospective 1989-90 Budget surplus is mostly based on increased taxation, while nearly 50 per cent of any expenditure cuts come from reduced payments to State and local Government alone;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the Government has been found wanting in bearing its proper share of expenditure restraint by cutting its own direct expenditure; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) this typifies the mismanagement of taxpayers' funds shown by Labor Party governments around Australia, both State and Federal''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The States Grants (General Purposes) Bill is a standard piece of legislation brought forward by the Government that deals essentially with legislation arising out of the Premiers Conference negotiations. It is indicative of this Government's set of priorities that over the years we have seen significant cuts to States grants-both general purposes and other forms of States grants. In part, this is due to the fact that the Government has gone on a surplus achievement binge for some reason that many of us have found difficult to understand. This Government has decided that its major priority in life is to appease and to please international financiers by getting the largest possible domestic surplus that it can. This is achieved in two major ways: one of course is by cutting grants to the States; the other is by decreasing expenditure in the health, housing, welfare and education areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have had a major problem with this Government, certainly since 1984 when it was elected for its second term, in that it has turned away from its major areas of support; that is, ordinary families, ordinary Australians-people that the Government liked to call the workers when it was in opposition-and, in particular, those people on some form of welfare. In turning away from them, the Government has denied them many of the benefits that it argued strongly for when it was in opposition. For example, I can recall in 1982 when the then Fraser Government moved what was widely known at the time as the `wives of strikers' legislation. At that stage the then Liberal-National Party coalition Government was attempting to prevent the wives of men who were out on strike from having access to the unemployment benefit and certain other benefits generally available under the social security legislation. That piece of legislation was greeted with horror, not just by the Australian Democrats but also by the Australian Labor Party that was then in opposition, and for good reason. Essentially, it was an attack on the victim; it was an attack on a group of people who were not responsible for the strike taking place and who were going to be further penalised in many ways and, of course, that included not just the wives of the men who were on strike but also the children. </PARA>
<PARA> So, at that stage, the Government was quite clearly linked ideologically to the less well-off in the community and it stayed ideologically linked to those people through its first term in office. It introduced the capital gains tax legislation on the grounds that that was necessary in order to make the tax system more equitable; it introduced the fringe benefits tax legislation on the grounds that that was necessary to prevent a situation in which some people on high incomes were not paying tax while others on similar sorts of incomes had to pay tax; and generally, in its first term in office, it showed itself as genuinely being a government for economic reform. That went downhill very quickly after it won office again in 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then, the Government's economic strategy has been based very much on the mythology of the benefits of a large domestic surplus-the argument being, of course, that, if the Government has a large surplus, it is regarded as being a good economic manager. Certainly this may sometimes be correct if the surplus is properly acquired. But, in the case of this Government, since 1984 the surplus has been acquired by slashing expenditure in those very vulnerable areas of health, education, housing and welfare and doing it, in many cases, by cutting grants to the States. In this it has been supported by the Opposition which, over the years, has been quite happy to agree to this Government doing things like delaying consumer price index increases to age pensioners; discounting ex-service and ex-defence personnel increases in pensions; abolishing Austudy payments to 15-year-olds in low income families; and taking 45-year-old women off the class B widows' pension once their youngest child turned 16 and telling them that, if they could not go out and get a job, they were to go onto the unemployment benefit. The damage that that did to the self-esteem of those women as well as to their disposable incomes is probably incalculable. </PARA>
<PARA> But the Government did that at the behest of a big business community that argued that the Government needed a surplus and that it needed to cut expenditure. That big business sector was busy propounding the myth in Australia that this country was a welfare state and that anyone in receipt of pensions and benefits was a bludger. Of course, that view was most recently expressed by the President of the Liberal Party of Australia, John Elliott. The implication behind all of that was that the only money spent by governments should go to the well-off because they were the ones who were being productive and the theory of the trickle-down effect still had some validity. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is hardly any surprise at all to note that the distribution of income in Australia has become particularly distorted over the last five or six years-sufficiently distorted to put us near the bottom of the list of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries when it comes to equity of income access. And this is something which a Labor government-or at least a government which likes to call itself a Labor government-should not be proud of. </PARA>
<PARA> Given this disproportionate distribution of income revealed in a recent university survey from New South Wales, I think two things need to be said. The first is that it is hardly surprising, given that disproportionate distribution of income, that living standards in Australia are low in comparison to most other OECD member countries. The second thing that needs to be said concerns the misleading myths to the contrary-the belief that we are somehow living off the fat of the land in Australia, that we are better off in wages than anywhere else, and that that is, of course, impeding our productivity. These sorts of myths are prevailing to such an extent in the community that the Government is able to get away with its swinging attitude, if you like, to middle and low income earners. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians are missing out on the lot, if European and United States figures are taken into account. Far from being a welfare state, as common mythology would have it in this country, Australia spends less as a percentage of gross domestic product on housing and social security payments than any other industrialised country, including Japan and countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom. That is partly due to the fact that, unlike America and Britain, for example, the Australian Government provides no assistance to people buying their own homes. Both of those countries do, as do many other countries. Instead, Australia reserves the tax deduction for investors. As I have already said, that is partly due to the frenzy of cuts to the States' capital grants funds and welfare payments of one sort or another. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting, I think, that Australia is also well behind most European countries when it comes to employer contributions to pension or superannuation funds. The employers complained bitterly when part of the recent wages deal included a contribution on their part to their employees' superannuation funds and their retirement benefits, but this is standard practice in many other countries around the world. It is not regarded as part of a socialist conspiracy or an attempt to beat employers into the ground or make them non-profitable. It is simply a part of the wages system put off until retirement. It is no wonder that most European countries in particular have a far better social welfare system, a far better post-retirement income system and, indeed, a far better unemployment benefit system than Australia does. </PARA>
<PARA> These things have been in place in most European countries for the last 40 or more years. They are well established and considered to be an integral part of the benefits that go to workers. Furthermore, I think it is worth noting that we are among the lowest taxed nations in the Western world. I think those people who still find this hard to come to terms with ought to have a look at current issues paper No. 5, recently released by the Legislative Research Service of the Federal Parliamentary Library. It goes into some considerable detail with regard to Australia's living standards and our position in world markets with regard to taxation, hours worked and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> According to this paper, Australia's working hours were the fortieth highest of the group of 52 countries looked at. They are similar to, or slightly higher than, those of most of western Europe and slightly less than those of North America and the Swiss cities. In Tokyo and the developing countries the hours worked were higher again than Australia's, with Hong Kong reporting hours worked as 50 per cent higher than Sydney's. Nevertheless, Australia's working hours were very similar to, and in some cases slightly higher than, most of those in western Europe. To argue that we are not productive in this country because our working hours are not long enough is to ignore the fact that some of our major trading partners in western Europe-countries like West Germany-do not work significantly longer hours. For example, West German workers in the car industry work a 38 1/2-hour week in comparison to Australians in the car industry working a 30-hour week. </PARA>
<PARA> The report on living standards from the Parliamentary Library points out that there is also nothing for us to be concerned about as far as being excessively taxed is concerned. The before-tax hourly incomes of people in Sydney were towards the lower ranking of European standards-lower than London, Vienna and Milan and slightly, but not significantly, higher than places like Paris, Dublin and Athens. They were also considerably lower than the incomes of people in Tokyo and North America and most of the northern European cities. As far as before-tax hourly incomes are concerned we are not doing too badly. A similar situation applies to Australia's major city rankings with regard to after-tax incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> The offsetting benefit to Australians for having a lower wages and tax system is that we also have a lower cost of living. It needs to be remembered that the pilots are not the only people in this country who could go overseas and get significantly better salaries-almost every worker could find another country where they would get a better deal in wages and benefits. However, they would also face a significantly higher cost of living. The living costs for Sydney are relatively low-lower than all other cities in developed countries except Los Angeles and Athens; equal to those of Luxembourg; well under half those of Tokyo; and just over half those of Scandinavian and Swiss cities, with the levels of other European and North American cities being just above those of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> The Union Bank of Switzerland data shows relatively lower living costs and thus a relatively higher purchasing power for Sydney than the OECD data shows for Australia generally. Nevertheless, the figures, by and large, are compatible. In terms of before-tax incomes, after adjusting for living costs, Los Angeles was clearly the highest and approaching double that of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is not a country where there has been a wages blow-out to make us non-competitive in comparison with our major trading partners. Australia is not a country with a significantly higher taxation system than those of our major trading partners. It is about time that some of that mythology was knocked on the head. Simply looking at comparable figures from other OECD countries indicates that we are not the welfare state, the highly taxed state, or the workers' paradise that many people here would have us believe in arguing that we need to lower the tax system and lower wages or, at least, keep them thoroughly pegged in order to become competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, one of the major problems has been the Government's cutting of States grants. Apart from the fact that this places an additional revenue or loan raising burden on State governments, it also reflects a strange ordering of priorities in some areas by the Federal Government. Housing is one of those particular areas where the Federal Government's priorities seem to have been blown out of the water-certainly since it won office for the second time in 1984. This is particularly true when one considers the likely damage done to South Australia-just to take one example-by the new Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. Health and education are two other areas where the States have suffered with regard to capital grants funding. </PARA>
<PARA> This means that State governments are starved of funds for capital works. Therefore, they face the choice of letting maintenance or rebuilding programs for hospitals and schools run down, or raising the necessary additional funds through loans-generally foreign-borrowed, which does nothing to help our general foreign debt problem. Their last option is raising the additional money through excises, charges and levies that lie within the power of State governments. No State government likes doing that, particularly in the run-up to an election, so the option that they tend to opt for is simply letting the buildings deteriorate and hoping that sooner or later either they will be able to raise the money somehow or a benign Federal government will increase their share of the States grants. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of housing, however, it has meant that the Government has shown a clear ideological change of heart in the last few years. It has chosen quite deliberately to direct its funding assistance not to those people who are on low incomes and who desperately need subsidies in order to rent or to buy, but to those people whose incomes are sufficiently high for them to be able to afford to invest in the housing market and to rent out to somebody else. So the Government has chosen to go the route of negative gearing, to subsidise investors rather than to assist those in need of affordable and appropriate housing actually to have access specifically in those areas. The negative gearing expenditure has won out over States housing grants type of expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> To make matters worse in the housing area, Australia has not yet seen fit to adopt two practices which are common overseas and which the Australian Democrats have been pushing for the last eight years; namely, the Australian Government still provides no incentive to save so that there is a reasonably large pool of low interest investment money available inside the country, and it provides no assistance at all to individuals, couples or families who are wanting to buy their own home. In that latter area in particular we are out of step with virtually all other OECD or comparable countries. If we look at the figures of those countries that provide interest on loans for home purchase or improvements, we find that Australia now is very much out of step. Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands-even New Zealand, on the figures that I have available to me-Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States of America all provide some form of tax deductability for the interest that is being paid on mortgages that people have taken out to buy their own home. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is out of step with almost every other comparable country in the world, in that it provides no direct assistance to ordinary families, ordinary individuals in Australia buying their own home. That assistance is, yet again, set aside only for those people who are investing in the housing market. The theory there is that those people will invest in sufficient numbers in housing and in units that they wish to rent out to provide a significantly large pool to keep rental down and to provide the sort of variety of accommodation and rent prices that people need to be adequately housed in Australia. In fact, that is not the case. Even with the negative gearing capacity, interest rates are so high in Australia at the moment that most investors in the market are not providing the sort of housing that is needed by people on low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> To make matters worse, we have just seen pass through this place a bizarre piece of legislation, put forward by the Government and supported by the Opposition, that would mean that people who are on unemployment benefit, who are living in an area where rental is relatively high and who move to an area where rental is relatively low and who find themselves inadvertently also in an area where unemployment is high will no longer be eligible for unemployment benefit-will, in fact, be penalised additionally for chasing the low rental market and finding themselves, not by choice but by simple economic fact, in an area where unemployment is traditionally high. This is particularly true in a State such as South Australia where the pockets of high unemployment also happen to be the pockets where rental is low. </PARA>
<PARA> So we have failed to follow the experience of other countries with a high regard for home ownership; we have failed to assist ordinary Australians to buy and to keep living in their own homes. As far as the former case is concerned-that is, the need to provide some incentive for people to save-again we have failed to look around the rest of the world to see what has worked. We have failed to learn, for example, from Japan's spectacular success in acquiring low cost investment funds through encouraging savings by their residents, by not taxing for a long time any of the interest that was earned, and in more recent years by applying a tax of only 20 per cent to that interest. A number of countries around the world guarantee the first $500, $600 or $700-in some countries it is as high as $1,000-that people earn on interest on savings. That encourages people to put more money in lending institutions that can then be made available at reasonable interest rates for investment. </PARA>
<PARA> It is time that Australia used some of its considerable surplus by allowing a tax break in either or both of those areas. Maybe if we did that we would find that such dramatic effects would not be caused to States such as South Australia when the Government decides that it will cut its housing funding or its general purpose States grants and force those States into the position of either increasing their borrowings or increasing their own revenue raising or-possibly the worst of all the alternatives-reducing their services to education, health care, housing and that part of the welfare budget which lies in their jurisdiction. Until governments recognise that a surplus is of precious little use unless it is being directed to maintaining the living standards of all Australians, until we stop spending $2 billion on giving tax cuts to big businesses and making up the difference by cutting pensions back further, by taking Austudy away from youngsters who cannot afford to stay at school as a consequence of losing that money, by other draconian measures from cuts in States grants through to attacking 45-year-old women on the class B widows' pension, I do not think that we will be able to regard ourselves as a civilised society or this Government as worthy of the name of being a Labor government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to this amendment in relation to the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1989 moved by Senator Stone, one is reminded of the hypocrisy, the poor rhetoric and the downright misleading statements that are made by this Government in claiming that it is somehow attempting to provide sound financial management for the Commonwealth whilst at the same time it is penalising and suppressing States and local government in order that it can crow about having been able to deliver a surplus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one takes a look at the New South Wales case set out in a document that was put to the Premiers Conference and Loan Council in May this year, I think the following statistics speak for themselves. Specifically, in the six years to 1988-89 in real terms Commonwealth spending on its own functions has increased by 22.3 per cent compared with an increase of 7.7 per cent in State own purpose spending. Commonwealth payments to the States fell by 2.2 per cent. Commonwealth revenue increased by 30.7 per cent whilst State revenue increased by 20 per cent. In fact, the Hawke Government this year is to receive at least $12 billion in revenue from new taxes and tax increases it has introduced since it came to power. The State global borrowing limits fell by 48 per cent compared with a rise of 125 per cent for the Commonwealth. In addition, State governments will receive only 29 per cent of total income tax and other taxes collected by the Commonwealth compared with some 39 per cent in 1982-83. Had the Commonwealth Government over the last six years applied the same restraint to its own expenditure to that imposed on the States, it would face a surplus of over $15 billion in 1988-89 instead of the one that it anticipated. Following the Loan Council meeting, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) put out his own press release on 18 May. He said that the key decisions taken at the Loan Council were that there would be:</PARA>
<PARA>a net reduction from the forward estimates in financial assistance grants to the States of $550 million; a $1 billion reduction in the State authorities' global borrowing limits compared with the 1988-89 limit; a reduction of $1150 million in the Commonwealth authorities' global borrowing limit; revised payment arrangements for the Australian Capital Territory, with $23 million to be made into a Trust Account with a view to providing transitional assistance to the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer put out a statement saying that these things had been agreed to but, in fact, the proposal to limit global borrowings was made by Premier Greiner. He put it on the basis that there was a need for the Commonwealth to give attention to fiscal policy and not simply to monetary policy. It was the persistence of the New South Wales Government and Premier Greiner in pushing the equity of this case that resulted in the cutback to global borrowings announced in the Treasurer's press release. The cutback in loans to government authorities resulted in something of a crisis for Qantas Airways Ltd, which wanted to borrow far more to refurbish its fleet. This just creates further pressure and gives a further basis to the argument that Qantas ought to be privatised in order that it can properly manage its own affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is very proud to say, and Mr Keating frequently boasts, that the Commonwealth Government does not borrow. But that is misleading, as are so many other statements that the Treasurer makes, because authorities borrow. He says that the State governments are borrowing, but this is under the agreement that they are entitled to borrow up to 22 per cent of the global limit overseas. A fiction is used in order that they may do it. Under the Financial Agreement of 1927 only the Commonwealth is entitled to borrow, but by setting up the State treasury corporations, which have been accepted by the Federal Government, they are able to raise those borrowings. Again, the Commonwealth is totally misleading in what it has to say. </PARA>
<PARA> In the second reading speech, the Minister said that the current estimate of general purpose funding for the States and the Northern Territory is some $13 billion, or about 15 per cent of estimated Commonwealth Budget outlays for 1989-90. If one looks at some of the rhetoric that went on at the time of the Loan Council meeting, one finds that the Commonwealth Government attempted to penalise the Liberal-National coalition Government of New South Wales. The Federal Government tried to say that, because receipts were up from conveyancing receipts that had come by way of stamp duty, somehow this ought to be offset against the receipts that New South Wales could expect. Hand in hand with that, this Government is pursuing a monetary policy which is designed to create a downturn in activity, particularly in the property market, which it would have known, if those policies were to have an input at all, would have resulted in a lessening of revenue to the New South Wales Government. </PARA>
<PARA> More and more over the years the system of federalism in this country has become somewhat undermined. We are the most highly centralised democracy in the world. The Federal Government, the Commonwealth, collects something like 75 per cent of all revenue and yet it accounts for only 50 per cent of public sector outlays, which makes for a considerable vertical imbalance in Australian fiscal federalism. </PARA>
<PARA> The crowing that the Government goes on with in saying that it is being responsible, is cutting back on expenditure and is producing surpluses denies the fact that what it is really doing is making the States and local government bear the pain. The Government cuts back on the share of revenue that they have and says, `You will have to raise revenue from other areas'. Then, when a government such as the New South Wales Government does exactly that, it has the hide to say, `Well, you'll need less revenue from the Commonwealth Government simply because you have exercised your own sovereign rights and have used your ability to raise levies'-for instance, the levy for environmental or road purposes that applies in New South Wales where there is an honesty about the Government that the Federal Government simply does not have. The Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), in his second reading speech, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> General purpose payments to the States and the Northern Territory are estimated to decline by around 3 per cent in real terms . . . While the real reduction in general purpose funding is less marked than in 1989-90, it will add to the effect of the significant reductions in payments to the States and global borrowing limits of recent years. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact of the matter is that while the Government has been squeezing State governments in particular, but also local government, it has effectively increased its own general purpose grants by some 5.5 per cent. The proposals put forward to the Loan Council by the State Government were equitable. It said that if the Commonwealth's own general purpose grant was to increase by 5.5 per cent, grants to the States should increase by the same amount. But clearly that message fell on deaf ears. However, New South Wales and Premier Greiner were successful in having global borrowings reduced by $2.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reading amendment condemns the Government for its deception and points out that the Budget surplus is mostly based on increased taxation, while nearly 50 per cent of any expenditure cuts come from reduced payments to the States and local government; that the Government has been found wanting in bearing its proper share of expenditure restraint by cutting its own direct expenditure; and that this typifies the mismanagement of taxpayers' funds shown by Australian Labor Party governments around Australia, both State and Federal. The motion makes the point that the Government has made the decision to rely entirely upon monetary policy; that it will not attack the real problems that the country faces; that the Treasurer somehow takes pleasure in making State governments suffer and wear the opprobrium of the electorate at large because when they cut services or have to raise additional money by way of levy to carry out significant tasks that need to be remedied due to the mismanagement by a previous Labor government, they are doubly penalised by the Commonwealth's saying, `You can raise this money, therefore, we will deduct it from you'. </PARA>
<PARA> In the whole area of federalism, generally the Government is totally centralist. It has no regard nor concern for the need of the people of Australia, who value their federal system, to have an equitable system of sharing the taxes that are raised. The policies outlined in the Opposition's Economic Action Plan will mean that Australia will finally get some good sense of government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government, of course, opposes the second reading amendment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am always happy to oblige Senator Stone, even if it is relentlessly tedious. The situation is this: the Bill is before this chamber for the third time and this is the second request from the House of Representatives that the Committee not insist on this amendment to the Bill. The Government has previously detailed its reasons. Those reasons have not changed. The arguments put forward by the Opposition have not persuaded the Government to change its mind. The Government does not accept the Opposition's argument that because the bodies that will gain from the amendment are public bodies they should be given the benefit of the use of public funds. As was indicated at the time the Committee agreed to the amendment, government outlays to public hospitals, public benevolent institutions and public universities are appropriately provided by means of outlays which are subject to review and compared with competing demands for Commonwealth funds in the budgetary process, not by way of the use of funds that are prepayments of income tax by employees intended to be paid to the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Budget measure does no more than seek to overcome the deferral of tax payments by closer matching of remittances to collections. It should be remembered that we are not talking about the remitters' money in this instance. It is necessary to realise that the Budget measure is part of the Government's strategy aimed at eventually reducing the administrative burden placed on small businesses by the tax instalment deduction system by moving small employers which comprise the majority of remitters to a system that would require less frequent remit- tances than at present. The Government aims to continue with this strategy, despite the obstacle placed in its way by the Opposition parties by this amendment. The strategy should not be interfered with by making adjustments on the fringe, otherwise the system will become an administrative jungle. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment previously moved by the Opposition would effectively condone the backdoor financing of public institutions with Commonwealth funds through the use of extended retention of tax instalment deductions made from the salary and wages of their employees. This is just not acceptable to the Government. I further remind the Opposition that this is a budgetary Bill with significant revenue implications. The amendment which is being insisted upon here would reduce the revenue in the 1989-90 year by $50m. I again urge, as has been done by speakers before me, that the Opposition reconsider its position for the reasons I have spelt out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating cognately the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) (Computer Programs) Amendment Bill 1989 and the Sales Tax Laws (Computer Programs) Amendment Bill 1989. The coalition does not oppose these three Bills being debated today. However, I foreshadow that I will be moving a second reading amendment which expresses our reservations about the way the Government has dramatically increased the revenue from the wholesale sales tax by over 200 per cent within the life of the present Government. In addition, Senator Messner, on behalf of the Opposition, will move a committee stage amendment to one of the computer sales tax Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I propose to divide my remarks into two parts, dealing first with the second and third Bills, those which deal with the application of sales tax to computer software. In a direct sense these Bills follow upon an announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on 22 December last year. The result of that announcement was that all computer software would be exempt from sales tax but that the inputs to the production of software would remain subject to sales tax. As I think we all know, that kind of division between the product itself and the inputs to it almost invariably leads to anomalous situations. One of those, as I have already indicated, will be the subject of an amendment by my colleague Senator Messner, who has just joined me, at a later point in the proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> The inputs to the production of software include computer hardware, discs, tapes and other material used in producing software. However, if one examines the background to this legislation, it becomes obvious that yet another taxation area has been subjected to continued messing around over the last few years. In theory it has always been the case, I understand, that computer software services were not taxed. Only the manufacture of a product for multiple users would be taxed. However, the perennial problem arose apparently, whereby, in a draft ruling dated May 1988, the Australian Taxation Office appeared to reinterpret Government legislation so that effectively the provision of computer services, as well as the manufacture of goods, would be taxed. </PARA>
<PARA> To its credit, the Government responded to the dismay which that ruling generated by announcing in last year's Budget that it would introduce legislation to clarify and confirm the Government's original intentions. Unfortunately, when that legislation was introduced last year it was still found to be ambiguous. The software industry remained genuinely concerned that the changes introduced in the 1988 legislation would inevitably result in a Taxation Office ruling that would once again encroach on the area of computer software services. As a result the Opposition moved committee stage amendments to that 1988 legislation seeking to define clearly what a computer program was for the purpose of sales tax. We attempted to do that in the House of Representatives last year. Naturally enough, the Government, which is both arrogant and stubborn, defeated those amendments. Nevertheless, having defeated the amendments, the Government then-I suppose as a result of that process-was forced to examine its handiwork a little more closely than it had done when the legislation was drawn up, and it totally withdrew that 1988 legislation. This is another ignominious example of a government which talks first and thinks later-or in that case legislated first and thought later. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the coalition does not oppose these two Bills, or the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2) that I will deal with in a moment. We understand that the software industry is broadly satisfied with the Government's legislation. But coalition senators and members have received representations from some companies within the software industry suggesting that an anomaly will now be created by this legislation which in other respects is thought to be broadly satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears that the Government's legislation is drafted in such a way that computer software will not be subject to sales tax `except where the only computer programs embodied in the goods are embodied in microchips'. It has come to our attention that such a definition, while no doubt designed to prevent an unnecessary loophole in the taxation provisions, does in fact remove the exemption for a small but nonetheless legitimate segment of the computer software market. I understand, and I have had demonstrated to me, that a number of products exist which could be termed educational games for children which, because they rely on a plug-in apparatus which contains a microchip, rather than, say, a floppy disc, to transport computer software information, will be subject to rather than exempt from sales tax. Some such educational games are available on the market in two models: one model incorporates a floppy disc and the other a plug-in apparatus containing a microchip. Under the Government's proposal the software sold in the first case would be exempt from sales tax and the software sold in the second case would be subject to sales tax. That is a fairly clear anomaly. Sales tax is not meant to distort the productive process between one form of technology and another. If it does produce that outcome, as it clearly would in this case, it is an anomalous situation that ought to be rectified. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's amendment, which Senator Messner will deal with at the committee stage, seeks to alter the definitions contained in the Sales Tax Laws (Computer Programs) Amendment Bill to avoid that anomaly. We hope that the Government will support our amendment. But, as I have said previously, apart from that amendment the coalition will not oppose these two Bills. But we do oppose and strongly criticise the delay, the confusion and the indecision-and, I have to say, the bumbling-of the Government in this area over the past nearly two years. This has simply added to what is already a very complex administration in this area, to high compliance costs and slow appeal processes which typify the wholesale sales tax laws. It comes on top of over 3,500 pages of complex and often enigmatic general taxation legislation. For too long the Hawke-Keating Government has used the words `taxation reform' as a euphemism for `increased taxation burden'. I now move my amendment to the motion that the Bill be read a second time:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add: ``, but the Senate deplores the Hawke/Keating Government's economic irresponsibility in increasing sales tax revenue by 200 per cent in an ad hoc and distortionary fashion since it came to power''. </PARA>
<PARA>I now turn briefly to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2), which makes four substantive changes to the state of the sales tax laws: namely, the exemption of certain paper products from sales tax; the exemption of the range of goods which are exempt from sales tax where those goods are for use by a subcontractor exclusively in carrying out activities on behalf of manufacturers; an increase in the small manufacturer exemption thresholds; and, finally, the provision that flavoured milk drinks that contain at least 90 per cent milk will now be subject to tax at the concessional rate of 10 per cent. The coalition supports all of those changes. Indeed, we particularly welcome the moves to increase the small manufacturer exemption threshold. The small business community has been greatly neglected by this Government and the fact that it is being at least somewhat recognised in this piece of legislation can only indicate that an election is in the offing. A similar motivation can be seen behind the decision to allow a sales tax exemption for goods manufactured from recycled paper. The truth is that the coalition parties made that decision well before the August Budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad to hear the Minister's applause. He is making his comment out of his place, so perhaps I should not recognise it. The exemptions and concessions contained in the three Bills provide some fractional relief from the general burden of indirect taxation, and as such they are to be welcomed. Yet, as I noted before, the bottom line is that sales tax revenue under this Government has increased by 200 per cent during the not quite seven years. Indeed, I understand that the Treasurer has boasted-this story may be apocryphal but it has a ring of truth about it-that these days he actually raises more revenue from the wholesale sales tax and indirect taxes generally than he would if he had introduced a broad-based consumption tax in 1985, as he was trying to do at the time before he was knocked off by the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). However that may be, as the coalition has made clear since our initial statement on taxation policy, I think in May of last year, we are committed to reforming this ramshackle indirect tax system and to removing the anomalies and inequities which presently abound.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In contributing to this sales tax debate, I wish first to comment on the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2) and to speak on the exemption of certain paper products from sales tax. I understand that this portion of the Bill is included to give effect to the Government's environmental statement of 20 July 1989, in which an undertaking was made to exempt goods that were made out of wholly recycled paper. The wording of the Bill indicates that the Government has moved away from products made from wholly recycled paper to goods in which all the paper has been manufactured from recycled paper. There is a subtle distinction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As has already been pointed out, the wording of the Bill leaves it open to interpretation and it could be taken to mean that the exemption applies to goods made only partially, and not wholly, of recycled paper. I would be grateful if the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) could comment on this aspect of interpretation when he responds to the second reading debate. We will certainly be looking for clarification on this point. </PARA>
<PARA> Also in the Government's environmental statement is an undertaking to `extend the exempting of any other recycled paper products'. I think the first thing the Government needs to do is to define `recycled paper'. Again I ask for the Minister's comment on that. I suggest that, in assisting him in this regard, there are two acceptable definitions of recycled paper. One definition of recycled paper is: paper produced from wastepaper which has already been broken down to form the pulp from which the recycled paper is made. In effect, all paper has a component of recycled paper as per this definition because, after all, paper mills recycle all their broken paper waste which occurs in the process of making and winding the paper. This could prove rather a major loophole in the legislation unless this term is clarified. So people around Australia will really be able to drive chariots through this loophole as it is presently defined. I think it is up to the Government, having been alerted to this problem, to define this term appropriately. </PARA>
<PARA> A second definition of recycled paper is: waste paper which, without breaking it down to pulp form, is actually recycled into another product. There are many examples of recycled paper as per the second definition. For instance, the Higgins Trading Co. Pty Ltd is involved in an operation which converts printers waste paper into packaging paper for use in butchers shops and other food outlets. The recycling process used in this instance is to take the outer damaged layers of printers reels and the small amount left as butt reels, sheet the paper, removing any damage, and package it for distribution. This wastepaper from many small printers has been in the past dumped. Other products which have been produced from wastepaper include things such as insulation and egg cartons. There are many ideas on the drawing board but there is a lack of incentive to get them up and running. </PARA>
<PARA> The thrust of the Government's environmental statement was to utilise better the existing materials in preference to damaging or depleting scarce and environmentally valuable resources. If this Government were really serious about its environmental endeavours it would, as a matter of priority, examine whether it could extend the exemption to other recycled paper products, such as the sheet paper produced by Higgins. If this Government were also serious about encouraging the use of recycled paper it would ensure that the Federal contract was awarded to a company which would service photo- copying machines that used recycled paper. Presently, repairs to photocopiers are not covered under contract if recycled paper is used in them. </PARA>
<PARA> Also of note is the lack of incentive to takeaway food and beverage vendors to change to containers made from recycled paper. Their containers are currently taxed at 10 per cent under item 17 in the third schedule. Again, if this Government were fair dinkum-and this is the fifth point that I make-it would give takeaway food operators, who must be one of the country's major paper container consumers, an incentive to become environmentally conscious and serve up their hamburgers, chicken pieces, chicken nuggets, fish and chips, pizzas, et cetera in containers made from wastepaper. A similar argument could be extended to those takeaway food vendors who use chlorofluorocarbon-free containers. Why not exempt them also from the 10 per cent sales tax as another incentive?</PARA>
<PARA> I think it is also of interest to note that item No. 96 formerly provided for the exemption of goods of a kind used to wrap up or secure goods for marketing or delivery-namely, wrapping material or bags consisting of paper and single-faced corrugated fibre board. Perhaps the Government should consider reintroducing this exemption, or including those items mentioned above if they are made from recycled paper. </PARA>
<PARA> I now go on to the Sales Tax Laws (Computer Programs) Amendment Bill 1989. This Bill has been introduced to give effect to the announcement by the Treasurer, Mr Keating, that sales tax liability for all computer software other than firmware would be removed. Perhaps I should explain the computer industry jargon. Software refers only to computer programs which, because they are not goods as such, have not been subject to sales tax. There was an unsuccessful attempt by this Government to tax them previously. Firmware is typically permanently built into the computer and embodies such items as silicon-based microchips designed to regulate the operating performance of computers or other machines such as motor vehicles. To help the Senate I will illustrate this by virtue of a small board which I have with me in the Senate tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> The intention of the Bill is to separate the sales tax on software from the sales tax on firmware. Under the present situation, the sale value of tangible carrying media for programs such as floppy discs or cartridges includes the value of the program when calculating the amount of sales tax payable on those goods. Let us assume for a moment that there are only two types of firmware in the world for carrying media for software or programs. One is this floppy disc, exhibit A, and the other is this cartridge, exhibit B. Typically, floppy discs are placed in a drive shaft, as we all know, to activate the program, whereas the cartridge is plugged into a port, usually at the back of the visual display unit. </PARA>
<PARA> Both pieces of firmware are frequently used as a source of portable storage within the marketplace. This is important because this is the anomaly that the Government's Bill does not pick up. The Minister should not be too smart about it. It is a real anomaly. Senator Messner has an amendment to pick up this anomaly, which the Government has failed to recognise despite the repeated representations that have been made to it. It is worth at least $1m to the industry. If the Minister listens, hopefully he will agree with this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For example, the computer educational game entitled Memory Manor is available in the marketplace in cartridge form or on floppy disc. There are two alternatives. Both are manufactured for use on a Commodore 64 home computer, with identical software which produces exactly the same program on the screen. In other words, there are two mechanisms for producing a program on the screen. This Government has forgotten about one of them, and that is the purpose of our amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In legislating to remove the sales tax liability for all computer software, what the Bill has, in effect, done is remove the sales tax on the program stored on the floppy disc. However, it has failed to remove the sales tax liability for the identical program stored in a cartridge. It is not the whole of it; it is just part of it. The inconsistency arises in the wording of the Bill, in which the firmware is described as software embodied in a microchip. This is where the Government went wrong, because the cartridge consists of a microchip mounted onto a board with input-output connections encased in some form of plastic housing. It is considered firmware and thus is taxable, which is quite wrong. </PARA>

It might not seem a lot, but if one sells a lot of products it is important, particularly for Australian manufacturers. The flow-on effect of this price difference will be a move by the market away from the cartridge towards the floppy disc.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to hear that they are changing. Had it not changed, this industry could well have quickly been a sunset industry. In addition to local demand, the export of cartridges is expected to begin during the next six months, and this is positive news because it will help the balance of payments. It is important to spell out the benefits of acknowledging what the Opposition has done for the balance of payments. This is a major breakthrough. An estimated 250,000 units will be exported in the first year, building up to 600,000 units in the second year. This is an important industry; it is a sunrise industry; it is a technologically advanced industry, and Australian people are at the forefront. The exclusion of cartridge-based software from this Bill would no doubt ultimately result in the death of this local manufacturing industry but, as a result of the impression we have made on the Minister tonight, the Government will agree to our amendment, and I welcome that. My colleague Senator Messner will be moving an amendment to secure the Government's agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On another matter concerning general sales tax, the Ombudsman has drawn the attention of the Commissioner of Taxation to several problems which became evident in the course of his handling of complaints about sales tax. The Ombudsman was concerned that, with an audit crackdown on sales tax imminent, these problems could mean that audit activity would have unfair results, especially with regard to penalties. The most significant problems are, firstly, the uncertainty about key provisions of the sales tax legislation giving rise to confusion both within and outside the Australian Taxation Office and to disputation. Only last week we were advised that small to medium sized companies find it necessary to employ someone full-time just to handle sales tax issues. Secondly, there is the disadvantage to taxpayers because of the requirement to assess for themselves which goods are taxable and at what rate, leading to difficulties in the absence of an efficient inquiry system, in establishing correct liability for particular transactions. Thirdly, there is the absence of regular monitoring of sales tax returns by the Taxation Office so that taxpayers' errors are not detected in time to prevent significant arrears of sales tax which continue to accrue until detection. Lastly, unfortunately, there is inconsistent advice and decisions from regional offices which may put some manufacturers at a significant competitive disadvantage. There are also difficulties in obtaining refunds of overpaid sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> While major changes to the administration of sales tax announced by the Commissioner following a sales tax review last year could alleviate some of the problems, the Bill before us contains sufficient ambiguities with regard to the term `recycled paper'. I would be grateful if the Minister could respond in depth to the issues that I have raised and enunciated very clearly here tonight in order to overcome the loopholes in the legislation that is now before the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA> Page 4, after paragraph 3 (d), add the following new paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(e) by inserting after item 123a the following item:</PARA>
<PARA> `123aa. (1) Goods, not covered by any other item in this Schedule, for use as special aids, and not for sale for that purpose, by people with physical or intellectual disabilities, in respect of whom a medical practitioner or a qualified or registered occupational therapist has certified that the use of the goods as special aids is necessary, in such cases or circumstances, and subject to such conditions, as are prescribed. </PARA>
<PARA> `(2) Parts for goods covered by sub-item (1) Nos. 1 to 9' ''. </PARA>
<PARA>As honourable senators will realise, this particular amendment is not new; indeed, it goes back quite a long way now. I have persisted by moving this amendment every time that we have come to exemptions and classifications. Every time we discuss this issue, it becomes more and more urgent. I would like to take some of the Committee's time to explain why it is now becoming so much more urgent that we deal with this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent years there has been an upsurge of goods being developed for disabled people. Under the sales tax provisions, if the goods are developed and sold for disabled people, they are exempt from sales tax; but as honourable senators will realise, any such goods tend to be of a fairly costly nature. The reason for that is obvious: the market is an extremely small one, a highly specialised one, and hence the return for a manufactured good has to be very high indeed, to cover not only the cost of manufacture but also the cost of development. </PARA>
<PARA> Typically, items of this kind tend to come from the mum and dad class of company-very small and usually handling one or two products. The goods that I am talking about do not fall into that area. They are goods of a quite different nature. They are goods that are dealing with a general item. I have given examples before, such as computers, which I will return to shortly, but there are quite a number of others. For example, I would like to refer to a letter with regard to some other such items. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA>All paraplegics above T6 and all with tetraplegia experience difficulties with temperature control. This includes people with diseases of the nervous system caused by accident, polio, spina bifida or diseases such as multiple sclerosis. For these people an air-conditioned system is essential rather than a luxury item. It is estimated that there are about 5,000 people with this need. The annual cost of tax revenue forgone would be about $30,000. Tax on air-conditioners is currently 10 per cent. This assumes a 25-year life span for each air-conditioner. </PARA>
<PARA>I suppose that people would feel it rather odd that when we are debating a Bill covering such a massive revenue raising exercise-Senator Stone set out in the speech he made in the second reading debate the enormous amounts of money that are raised-I would want to refer to something costing $30,000. The odd thing is that I have had to go on talking about these incredibly small amounts year in, year out. I am talking about general goods; not specially designed goods, but general purpose goods that, as I say in my amendment, `a medical practitioner or a qualified registered occupational therapist has certified that the use of the goods as special aids is necessary, in such cases or circum- stances'. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, there are quite a number of items available on the market that are of use to people with low vision. They are general items; they all carry sales tax. Yet it is possible that for this particular item-estimates have been made by the Australian National Council of and for the Blind which indicate that there are 3,500 people for whom these particular aids might be able to be prescribed every year-the revenue lost is in the vicinity of $54,000. The sales tax on most of the devices that I am talking about is charged at 20 per cent although a few are subject to 30 per cent sales tax. Again, this is a matter of hardly any significance whatsoever for the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA> There are reclining chairs specifically designed for no other purpose than comfort which are extremely useful for people with specific arthritic conditions. The body of people who are most competent in this area estimate that of the order of 7,000 people in Australia might be able to buy that piece of furniture and make use of it for their particular arthritic condition. The annual cost to revenue of that proposition is $20,000. The sales tax on the furniture is 10 per cent. I freely admit that I am not talking about large sums of money, I am talking about very small amounts of money indeed. But the extraordinary thing is that these small amounts of money are extremely important to most of the people with these types of conditions. We are all very much aware that the annual average income of people with the disabilities that I have just mentioned is amongst the lowest of any group in Australia. Hence, not to have to pay 10 or 20 per cent of the cost of specifically designed items is of extreme significance to them. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not heard anybody in any of the debates that we have had on this issue over the years suggest that anybody in the community wants sales tax raised on these items. In fact, people are quite happy to forgo the sales tax. Last year I gave an example of such a person with a disability who was trying to purchase a computer. The retailer happily gave up his profit, which was more than the 15 per cent of sales tax that was to be paid. He did not want to make a profit by selling that item to that person, and he was happy to forgo it. That shows that in the normal commercial world people are not interested in making money out of selling such items to disabled people; yet the Government is still persisting. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard a myriad of excuses as to why such items can be exempt from sales tax, most of them, quite frankly, of a paternalistic kind. One of the usual excuses given is that the Department of Finance knows better with regard to this item. I am not asking the Department or anybody else to take my word for it. I have used a mechanism, the exemption of sales tax, that is already in the Act with regard to other items. For example, I draw attention to very large capital cost items-specially modified cars. The basic car is available to everybody. If a car goes through an identical process-in fact, the words are identical in the Act-the sales tax can be removed. I am not looking at a new method; I am not looking at a new exercise. I am looking at an extension of a current exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> Of all things, an exemption applies to people who have wigs prescribed. Sales tax is removed for that specific purpose. I will contrast the treatment of that item in the legislation with the following: I was very privileged a few weeks ago to be in the United States of America where I was following up this issue, in which, as honourable senators know, I have had a longstanding interest. I was visiting a number of commercial firms in the United States that deal with computers and disabled people. The most extraordinary things are now possible that one would not have thought possible at all. I will give two examples of that. The first is that of a woman who from birth was blind and deaf and also had quite severe multiple sclerosis. In our community still, unfortunately, the normal expectations of such a person would be very low. However, that woman was running a million dollar company. She was the managing director. She was able to do that via computers. The other person I went to see was a computer software writer. Although he was totally blind he was writing computer programs for the United States space program. Most honourable senators, even with their sight, would find writing a computer program mind-boggling, but he was writing sophisticated computer programs totally blind. </PARA>
<PARA> It is often felt in our community that disability disqualified a person from earning a decent living and making his or her way in our society. It is almost as if to say, `If you are disabled you can go out and weave baskets'. With new technology, these people are able to confront the world and in most cases, if they wish to do so and if they have support initially, they are able to earn a living and perform activities that most of us would think they could not possibly do. </PARA>
<PARA> I had the good fortune to spend a number of days with the managing directors of various companies in the United States. They were selling ordinary goods which in Australia have a sales tax on them. Under our social security system we do provide a range of support, but in the United States the situation is much more difficult. However, in the United States there is no sales tax on these items and in Australia there is. I discovered this extraordinary situation while I was in the United States. It is possible, under a provision similar to the one we are considering, for these goods to be exempt from various types of local, State and Federal taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> What is more, two years ago the United States Congress passed an almost identical motion to the amendment before us. The United States legislation actually mandates that all Federal employees be assisted. It is even better than our proposal because, when general goods are available, they have to be provided within Federal departments so that departments are able to employ a reason- able percentage of people with physical and mental disabilities. It is extraordinary that the United States, with the complexity of its legislative involvement, is able to confront this when we in Australia have not even been able to approach it sensibly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Amendments similar to that to which Senator Macklin spoke have been moved four or five times previously during Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Bill debates in this chamber. They have been moved regularly by the Australian Dem- ocrats and opposed just as regularly by Liberal, Labor and National Party senators, until last year when finally they decided that they would send the matter off to a committee. I understand that the question of whether or not this sort of equipment is likely to have its sales tax removed is now before the new Industry Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said earlier tonight, I am very disappointed that the Australian Labor Party, in government, has moved so far from its roots-so far from the issues that it supported loudly and long in opposition. I recall that in 1981, when the Fraser Government introduced nine sales tax exemptions and classifications Bills that imposed, I think, about a 2 per cent sales tax on a wide range of materials, the Democrats were attacked viciously-not just by the Government, which was understandable, but also by the Labor Party Opposition. The Government, of course, attacked us for meddling in its revenue raising capacity. The Labor Opposition attacked us because we were not prepared to oppose all nine sales tax exemptions and classifications Bills outright but chose to amend those Bills in order to remove certain select items from the tax. It was a small tax. It was 2 or 2.5 per cent-at the moment I forget offhand what it was. What we did, successfully in the long run, was to amend that legislation so that food, clothing, building materials, educational materials and so on were exempt. </PARA>
<PARA> It concerned me at the time that no journalist bothered to ask any member of the Labor Party, front or back bench, that I am aware of, why in 1981 in opposition it was opposing sales tax measures that imposed a small tax on things like gold-plated cutlery. That item was in that legislation. It was one of those things about which Labor Party members in opposition in 1981 publicly expressed their outrage. They attacked the Fraser Government for daring to impose a sales tax of that sort on an item of that kind. No-one criticised them for it and presumably they could not see anything odd in it themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> It bothers me that a party that in 1981 opposed the imposition of a 2 per cent sales tax on gold-plated cutlery is now opposing and has for several years in government opposed the removal of a much higher sales tax than 2 per cent on computer equipment that has been adopted for use by disabled people. One wonders how far the Labor Party has come in the last eight years that it can change so violently from opposing, in 1981, a couple of per cent on gold-plated cutlery to now opposing the removal of a much higher tax on computer equipment that may be the only thing, after it has been adapted for use, that gives a child with a disability even a fighting chance to get through the education system and into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the same political party which in last year's Budget announced and then some months later, in November, moved and got through the Senate, an amendment that removed the sales tax-I think it was 10 per cent-from private planes. Just where are the Government's priorities in that little list? No 2 per cent tax on gold-plated cutlery in 1981, and no 10 per cent tax on private planes in 1988, but it was quite prepared to see a tax of, I think, 20 per cent on computer equipment even after it has been adapted for use by a disabled child. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government says that it does not think that sales tax exemptions are the right way to direct assistance to disabled people. That may well be true but, as Senator Macklin has already pointed out, the Government already offers a range of sales tax exemptions and assistance in other areas for people with disabilities. Cars, wigs, hearing aids, special glasses and an assortment of other things all qualify for sales tax exemption. If the Government is using the argument that it does not think sales tax exemptions are the right way to direct assistance to disabled people, why are the exemptions retained on those items? The worst of it is that, having claimed that this is not the right way to go, the Government has not offered us any other way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> If assistance to people with disabilities is not appropriately provided through sales tax assistance as either the only way or one way of making them a little more able to operate in society, what does the Government suggest instead and when will it offer it? We have not heard what are the best ways of providing assistance to people with disabilities other than through the sales tax system. It is time that we did. It is a bit like Senator Evans's contribution of an hour ago or thereabouts when he announced that the money that the Government was going to save by getting public hospitals, tertiary institutions and benevolent organisations to pay tax twice a month instead of once a month was possibly going to be used some years down the track to help some unspecified small business groups by allowing them to pay tax quarterly instead of monthly. We are getting into cloud-cuckoo-land when this is the sort of offering that we get from the Minister in response to the criticism of legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Trumped up or otherwise, the Government keeps trumpeting about it. It is not much good a family having a very large bank balance if its children are starving to death. It seems to me that if by devious means-mostly by cutting expenditure in the welfare, health, housing and education areas, as Senator Evans himself proudly acknowledged-we have managed to acquire a $9 billion surplus, maybe we could spend a total amount of $100,000 in providing a sales tax exemption to those families who are concerned enough about their child's access to education to have computer equipment. We are not talking about hundreds of dollars worth of computer equipment; we are talking in the realm of thousands. The equipment would be adapted for use by that child to give him or her at least some sort of running start in the society that he or she will move into. The Government's response to the argument that these kids need a fair go and that their families need a bit of assistance is to say, `Well, yes, maybe; but what if it's used by somebody in the family who isn't handicapped?'. So what! Big deal if that is what happens!</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think they would care what they were called, quite frankly, if this amendment got through. Given the choice between a correct label and no assistance, and an incorrect label and a bit of assistance, I think they would wear the incorrect label. It is a silly move by this Government not to care enough about the people that it argues it supports to move persistently-Budget after Budget-to take sales tax off things like private planes and refuse to remove it from a piece of equipment that could make all the difference between a child with a disability moving up through the education system to fulfil its complete intellectual capacity and then get out into the work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To put forward arguments about the time not being right, the sort of assistance not being appropriate, the cost being too great, the fact that somebody else in the family might use it and give that person an unfair advantage over somebody in another family which has had to pay the full tax is simply not only ludicrous but begs the whole question. Are we, as a civilised society, prepared to do all we can to give people with disabilities a reasonable chance or are we not? That is basically what it boils down to. I say this to the Australian Labor Party, the same party, by and large, that in 1981 objected violently, loudly and long to the Fraser Government putting a 2 per cent sales tax on gold plated cutlery and that last year made a 10 per cent sales tax cut on private planes: why does it not offer the same benefit to those families that are bringing up, amongst other children, a child with a disability and allow them a tax exemption on the computer equipment that they buy after it has been adapted specifically for the use of that child? There is no reason, financial or other, that I can see that a government with a $9 billion surplus cannot see its way clear to providing at least that much assistance to families of that kind. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Haines has made a very impassioned speech which, on the face of it, might seem to be persuasive. However, there is a difference between being in opposition, and being a minority in opposition, and being in government. The amendment that the honourable senator has been referring to is currently being considered by the Industries Assistance Commission in a general reference on assistance to the disabled. The Australian Taxation Office advises that the particular amendment is wide open to abuse. The Government, therefore, could not agree to this amendment, even though it would agree with the spirit of the amendment. Anyone listening to Senator Haines's speech and Senator Macklin's speech would not disagree with the general sentiments, the general spirit, of what they are arguing. But government has a responsibility when we are advised that it could be wide open to abuse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's view is that it would be sensible to await the outcome of the Industries Assistance Commission review rather than to make an ad hoc change to sales tax arrangements at this time. In view of the lateness of the hour, I suggest that we not proceed further with these three Bills. That will allow us time to check with the Industries Assistance Commission on the progress of its review and report back to the Committee next week. The Government will not be opposing the amendment moved by the Opposition. In relation to the second of the Democrats' amendments--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to say a few words about my friend Robert Nestdale, who died today aged 40. Robert was born in July 1949. During his 40 years, a tragically short period for one who had so much to give, he was a man of very considerable achievement. The outlines of his life and career can be given very briefly. He went to school in Sydney at Cumberland High School and obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of New England at Armidale. He held a variety of jobs in the parliamentary system and parliamentary process. He was an executive of CSR Ltd and since 1986 had served in the position of National Director of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Robert was known to many honourable senators. I knew him as a friend of more than 20 years standing. My colleagues Peter Baume and Robert Hill knew him in particular as a dedicated liberal in the classical traditional small `l' mould or whatever term one likes to use. My friend Senator Knowles knew him as a member of the Young Liberal Movement of Australia. Senator Chaney knew him particularly as a person who had worked on a number of party committees and organisations. Senators Brownhill, Childs, Macklin and Vallentine have known him as a person intimately connected with the work of UNICEF. The President of the Senate, Senator Sibraa, knew him through his connections with the work which from time to time had impinged on the consciousness of the foreign affairs committee. The Clerk of the Senate, Mr Evans, knew him during the period that he worked for Senator Peter Rae. Members of the House of Representatives knew him well. Philip Ruddock, the member for Dundas, and his family were particularly close friends of Robert's. Mrs Sullivan, Mr Dobie, Mr Hall and a number of other members of the House of Representatives had close friendships and connections with Robert. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, he was a committed liberal. He believed in liberal causes, liberal principles and liberal values. He made manifest efforts in defence of those principles at times when they were unpopular, when standing up for them was difficult and when a commitment to them was not easy. He was a committed member of my political party, the Liberal Party of Australia. Indeed, he served as the New South Wales State President of the Young Liberal Movement of Australia from 1978 to 1979 and as Federal President of the Young Liberal Movement of Australia from 1980 to 1981. I served in both of those positions a few years before that. Robert was a person who came through the Young Liberal Movement and had a career within the Liberal Party very much akin to my own. We served on the Federal and State executives of the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA> I said that he was committed to involvement in the parliamentary process. He first started working down here in Canberra a little after the time that I started here. He worked first on the staff of Malcolm Mackay, who was at that stage the Minister for the Navy in the period of the McMahon Government in 1971 and 1972. He subsequently worked with Senator Peter Rae and developed a particular interest and involvement in the work that Senator Rae was pursuing in terms of reforms of the Senate procedures and operations and strengthening of the parliamentary committee system. </PARA>
<PARA> But, above all, Robert was committed to three great causes. Those causes were Amnesty International, the International Commission of Jurists, and UNICEF. I will not dwell on his work for Amnesty and the International Commission of Jurists but rather focus on the work that he did for UNICEF. He had a remarkable capacity to bring together people of enormously different temperament and interests and to find the common cause that they had between them in terms of advancing the cause of the world's children. </PARA>
<PARA> I just mention three of those people, each entirely different, who were roped into working for UNICEF by Robert and who have made, and doubtless will continue to make, enormous contributions to that organisation. My friend Robert O'Reilley is an accountant in Sydney who eventually became the accountant looking after the books of UNICEF and who has been taking care of some of the necessary technical and formal arrangements which must be made in the event of anybody's death. The second is my friend Peter Spies, whose interest was in the commercial world, in duty-free operations and international tourism, who Robert persuaded to work for UNICEF in Sydney and who played a major role in finding UNICEF its new headquarters in Sydney at the most advantageous commercial rates and arrangements. The third is Joan Hall, a person well known to honourable senators and members of the House of Representatives, who is a dedicated supporter of and worker for UNICEF and who had many of her projects particularly stimulated by Robert and the work that he was doing. </PARA>
<PARA> Robert also played a role in promoting the establishment of the parliamentary group of UNICEF. We have many parliamentary groups in this building at the moment. I have looked at the list of those who were present at, or who sent apologies for, the first meeting of the Australian Parliamentary Association for UNICEF held in December 1987. The names are: David Jull, John Mountford, Bob Katter, Chris Miles, David Hawker, Michael Macklin, Jean Jenkins, Robert Wood, John Watson, John Langmore, Nick Bolkus, Robert Hill, David Brownhill, Elaine Darling, Kathy Sullivan, Fred Chaney, Bruce Childs, Jo Vallentine, Olive Zakharov, Alasdair Webster, Peter Baume, Bob Brown and me-as diverse and as different a group of people as one could possibly gather within the four walls of this parliamentary institution. The committee, on which Senator Childs serves as Chairman and, I think, Senator Brownhill, Senator Vallentine and Mr Webster as executive members, again reflects the commonality of interests that people have and that have been brought together within this extraordinary organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Robert's concern for children was remarkable. He did not have any children; I think he probably felt that he had all the world's children to look after. Indeed, in a paper by Robert, printed in the Liberal Forum Occasional Papers and entitled `Debt, Poverty and Children in Africa', he made a particular plea when addressing a forum at the University of New England, where he had studied. He said to that forum:</PARA>
<PARA>In the three hours of this morning's Forum, nearly 5,000 young children will die in the world. By day's end, the total will be 38,000. The same was true yesterday; the same will be true tomorrow. Equally bad or even worse, comparable numbers of children will be crippled for life and many more will be dragged down the nutritional ladder, day after day, until the stunting of their growth is irremediable and their chances for normal mental development are lost forever. </PARA>
<PARA>Robert practised what he preached in terms of care for children, in particular for the children of Africa. He spent a lot of time in Africa. He numbered among his friends African politicians such as Kenneth Kaunda. He participated not only in the defence of children as children but in the fight against racism and the fight against apartheid, which is another cause in which so many of us so passionately believe. He got sick in Africa and was one of those people who returned with, I think, some sort of hepatitis or liver complaint which laid him low for a while but which he struggled to overcome. He was dedicated to children not just in Africa; indeed, he was one of the few people who in recent years went regularly backwards and forwards to Beirut trying to see what he could do in his role as an officer of UNICEF for the tragic situation of children in the Lebanon. He had no sense of personal fear; no sense of personal danger. To him it was part and parcel of his manifest attempts to do what he could within the compass of a life which at that stage he had no reason to believe would not be four score and 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Robert got sick quite recently and battled against leukaemia valiantly. In particular, he steeled himself to ensure that during the visit to Australia of Audrey Hepburn, as one of the international ambassadors for UNICEF, he was well enough, despite his illness, to cope, to accompany her, to arrange part of her program, to bring her to the Parliament and to introduce her to people at all levels of government and society. He made a particular effort to keep himself as well as he could in order to accomplish what he must surely have known, if not simply suspected, would be the last major contribution which he would be able to make. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to extend heartfelt sympathies-both mine and those of friends and colleagues in this Parliament-to his family, and his parents in particular. Apart from seeing them recently during Robert's last illness, I saw them just a few months ago at his fortieth birthday celebrations. I suppose we all knew at the time that it was unlikely that there would be a forty-first birthday party. They also have coped with great courage and great fortitude in these last couple of very difficult weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> I am delighted to see that UNICEF, in the announcement it made today about Robert's death, has indicated that in honour of his work it will begin an appeal for areas of Southern Africa. The appeal will be named after Robert. The project to be financed aims to provide safe, clean water for thousands of African families to help them escape from the cycle of serious diseases caused by drinking dirty water-as simple and as ordinary a thing as we take manifestly for granted, which nevertheless is a cause of death, dehydration and terrible illness for children throughout Africa and Southern Africa in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> Robert was above all a gentle person whose life was lived in the service of others and, as I have said, especially in the service of the children of this world. I would like to conclude by referring to two quotations from Shakespeare. Robert was not a particularly artistic or culturally minded friend. His pleasures were in music and much less in things like theatre but he did enjoy; he did participate. I am sure he would not mind my concluding my remarks by drawing on Shakespeare's words. The two quotations which have rattled around in my mind today come first from Julius Caesar and second from The Tempest. At the end of Julius Caesar, Octavius, triumphant, ponders the fate, nature and character of Brutus, defeated. Octavius says of Brutus:</PARA>
<PARA>His life was gentle, and the elements</PARA>
<PARA>So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up</PARA>
<PARA>And say to all the world, `This was a man!'</PARA>
<PARA>The second quotation is from The Tempest. Prospero tries to sum up his life and the achievements that ordinary human beings make. Robert's achievements were substantial and real but he would understand what Prospero meant when talking about the life of ordinary individuals. Prospero said this:</PARA>
<PARA>Our revels now are ended. These our actors,</PARA>
<PARA>As I foretold you, were all spirits, and</PARA>
<PARA>Are melted into air, into thin air:</PARA>
<PARA>And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,</PARA>
<PARA>The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,</PARA>
<PARA>The solemn temples, the great globe itself,</PARA>
<PARA>Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,</PARA>
<PARA>And like the insubstantial pageant faded,</PARA>
<PARA>Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff</PARA>
<PARA>As dreams are made on, and our little life</PARA>
<PARA>Is rounded with a sleep. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join with Senator Puplick in expressing sorrow on the death of Robert Nestdale, the Australian Director of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). I do so as President of the Parliamentary Association for UNICEF. This was the first parliamentary association formed in the world and, as Senator Puplick said, Robert had a role in that. In fact, he had much more than a role; he was the inspiration for the formation of that association. On behalf of the executive members, and the members generally of that association, I would like to express our sorrow. The executive members from the House of Representatives are: Kathy Sullivan, the Vice President, who is from the Liberal Party of Australia; Bob Katter, the Secretary, who is from the National Party of Australia; and John Langmore and Elaine Darling of the Australian Labor Party who are executive members. Senate members are: Senator Michael Macklin, the Treasurer; Senator David Brownhill, the former Secretary; and Senator Jo Vallentine who, no doubt, will speak this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I mention the executive because it represents the coming together of all political parties and all the political tendencies in the Parliament. I think that was something that Robert wanted us to achieve. We achieved that. We achieved a `working together' under his inspiration. In our working relationship with him he found that he had real friends across the Parliament. In my case, and I am sure in the case of everybody else, that was based on a recognition of his dedication. We were all impressed with the dynamic, infectious enthusiasm that was so much a characteristic of Robert. </PARA>
<PARA> His death is a tragedy. It is a tragedy any time that somebody so young and so vital passes on. I believe that we should attempt to honour his memory. Senator Puplick has indicated what UNICEF is proposing. I know that many senators and members will honour his memory at the memorial service next Monday in Sydney. I invite all honourable senators to attend the launch of UNICEF's report on the state of the world's children in the main committee room next Wednesday at 11 a.m. Although we have lost one life, I believe that Robert would wish us to do something to save the millions of lives that are threatened in the world at present. If we could participate in and improve the work that Robert has been part of, it would be a fitting epitaph to his life's work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many people have loved and admired Robert Nestdale and not least those of us who have known him longest. He suffered from leukaemia for a couple of years and died of it early this morning. During his illness he declined to speak of it much and steadfastly refused to allow the illness to interfere with his work or with his life. During the time he was ill he had to cope with the sadness of a divorce, having separated soon before his diagnosis was made. But however hard this was to bear, he did not ever speak of it and he never complained and was never bitter to me about anyone else who had been important in his life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Robert was a truly beautiful man and his good looks worried some people, who chose to think that good looks meant that he lacked commitment and depth. But there was so much about him that few people knew. My wife Jenny, shopping one day in suburban Gordon in Sydney, ran across Robert with a little girl. He introduced her to Jenny and it became clear very quickly that she was blind. It then emerged that Robert and she went out once a week, and that part of his commitment and service to his community was expressed through assisting this child to be more independent, more autonomous and more secure. He never spoke of this activity to others. It was as if it just did not matter whether or not others knew and admired him or whether they dismissed him. He knew what he was about and he followed his own star. </PARA>
<PARA> Robert Nestdale's belief in justice was passionate and his adherence to classical Liberal values was absolute. He was, as others have said, an active member of Amnesty International. He was active with the International Commission of Jurists. Some here-those who admired and loved another great Liberal, Alan Missen-will recall that Robert spoke at Alan's funeral and lit there the Amnesty candle and gave us some deeply felt words about Alan Missen and Alan's contribution to Amnesty International. </PARA>
<PARA> Robert was one of that line of Federal Liberal presidents of the Young Liberal Movement of which Chris Puplick is another representative. He served the movement well and presented a vibrant message of concerned and caring liberalism within the councils of the Liberal Party. It was no surprise that he spent some time professionally with another former senator and another small `l' liberal Peter Rae, with whom he would have shared some personal and political perspectives. </PARA>
<PARA> To me he was always a valued adviser and a friend. At times of difficulty in my own political life, Robert offered me support and wise counsel. He offered me encouragement and hope when I needed them most, and for this I am forever in his debt. He always treated my wife with affection and consideration. It was our very good fortune that he was able to join us for lunch just 11 days ago. He was already mortally ill but he drove himself to our home in his own car and he managed to participate in the meal and the social exchanges during an entire afternoon. When he left to drive himself home my wife and I both knew that we would never see him again. But we were so glad that he had been with us and we were honoured that, ill as he was, he had managed nevertheless to be entertained, to show and receive affection, and to accept our loving concern and sympathy for his illness. </PARA>
<PARA> Robert Nestdale dedicated his professional life, or its last part, to the world's children. He had a significant role in the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)-one that he discharged with great distinction. He was good for UNICEF and UNICEF was good for him. It is to the very considerable credit of UNICEF in Australia that it was able to order its administrative arrangements so that Robert Nestdale, right up to his death, continued to hold his post, attend his place of work and function as well as he was able, all with the considerable assistance of the UNICEF board and of his staff and colleagues. We are very much in their debt for what they did. In fact, he was working at home until yesterday afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> Another very notable Liberal friend, John Dowd, was with Robert and his parents for much of the bad time that followed. In speaking recently with Paul Ignatieff of UNICEF, who had been Robert's superior, it became apparent just how much affection and admiration existed for Nestdale, for his commitment and for his ability. Paul Ignatieff is now in Tokyo, but I know that he would wish to be associated with the words being spoken tonight, just as I know that he will grieve with us at the premature and pointless end to the life of Robert Nestdale. He was born in July 1949 and died today, just 40 years old. His parents, his sister Ann and his brother Stephen are in our thoughts. I say to Ann, Stephen and his parents: Your son and your brother leaves a record of achievement and service and we are all the poorer for his loss. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I, too, just wish to say a few words about a very dear friend. The gentleman to whom I refer is Robert Nestdale. I have known Robert for only the last 12 years but during that time he became a very special friend who clearly was a very caring, sensitive and capable man. I first met Robert when we were both newly elected State Presidents of the Young Liberal Movement of Australia. It was very obvious to me at a very early stage that he was an intelligent person who had political and administrative skills that he very cleverly combined with his keen sense of humour-which I loved dearly-his infectious smile and his wonderful charm.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> His caring and sensitive side became very clear and even more evident when he became the National Director of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). He did not treat that position as a job; he treated it as a vital part of his life. Every time I spoke with Robert he was continually expressing his ideas and innovations that had the potential to help millions of less fortunate children in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> My good friend and colleague Senator Puplick, sitting beside me tonight, has already spoken about Robert. The three of us shared many a laugh together over many years. There are many other people from our Young Liberal era who are feeling very sad today and I would like to include some of their names in this tribute to a lovely man, otherwise known to us as a great guy. They are: former Senator Andrew Thomas, Jeremy Buxton, Norm Haywood, Robert Marks, Craig McKerracher, Janne Frankish, Julie and Vincent Mendrik, Gary Hampson and Kingsley Pearce. </PARA>
<PARA> I was looking forward very much to seeing Robert here in Canberra next week for the launch of the UNICEF report on the state of the world's children in 1990. The members of the Australian Parliamentary Association for UNICEF will miss his continuous efforts for the great cause for which he fought. </PARA>
<PARA> At 40 years of age Robert was a young man in the prime of his life. Ever since the diagnosis of his terminal illness I never once heard him complain. In fact, it was quite the reverse. He immersed himself in his work helping others and remained cheerful. He provided a fine example from which we can all learn a great deal. To Mr and Mrs Nestdale, his sister and his brother, I express my sincere sympathy and that of the friends I mentioned earlier. Robert Nestdale was loved and admired by many and will be sadly missed by those who cared for him and for whom he cared. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also want to pay tribute to the life of Robert Nestdale. I did not have a long association with him, but in the short time that I knew him-which dated only from the beginning of the Australian Parliamentary Association for the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)-I was greatly impressed by his energy and commitment. His great and insatiable desire to improve the lot of the world's children was inspiring, and I pay tribute to that. I was also deeply moved by his courage in dealing with his illness. I am very saddened by his death. When someone so young and so committed to social justice, and so active in its pursuits, is snatched from our midst, it is sometimes very difficult to accept.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Robert's death is teaching us who are left to mourn something very important: that life is precious; that we must not waste opportunities; that the situation is urgent; and that we should not put off until tomorrow what needs to be done today. Robert's spirit will live on within UNICEF for a long time. I am very glad that my life was enriched by our brief association. To conclude, I would like to suggest a few minutes of silence in the Quaker tradition. This is something I spoke about with Robert. We shared quite a lot of meaningful conversations in the short time that we knew each other. I am very grateful for the enrichment that he brought to my life. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, I wish to associate myself with the comments that have been made tonight by colleagues on this sad day, the day of the death of Robert Nestdale. When I think of Robert, I think of energy, determination and goodwill. He was a person of enormous capacity and, as has been said by others, devoted his life to service-in more recent years particularly, service to the less fortunate children of the world. He always encouraged me in a similar way, as Senator Peter Baume mentioned, in the ups and downs of political life. We all experience both ups and downs. I will forever remain grateful for his support and encouragement. I use this occasion also to extend my sympathy to his family.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like very briefly to associate myself with the remarks of previous speakers this evening. Robert Nestdale was not a close friend of mine but he was a person whom I had known for the last 15 years. He was one of those special persons who attracted admiration of a very wide range of people from all walks of life and all parts of the political and philosophical spectrums. I would just like to say to his family, to all members of the Liberal Party of Australia and to all Australians that we have, in the last 24 hours, lost a very true and a very special Australian.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> His work over the range of his career has been very significant. The thing that commends him to most of our memories has been his work in the more recent years, particularly with UNICEF. I just want to associate myself with the tributes paid earlier this evening by all those who have spoken. Robert was a very special person. We have all lost a great deal through his passing. Particularly to his family, I wish to express my sympathy and sadness and the hope that they will find comfort in the fact that so many people who had association with Robert throughout this life will feel that his passing is a very significant loss. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to associate myself with the remarks that have been made this evening in regard to Robert Nestdale. I first came to know Robert some 20 years ago when we were both very keenly and actively involved in the Young Liberals and, in particular, were attending the national Young Liberals conventions that, I think, started in 1969. If I remember correctly, Robert was one of the New South Wales delegates at that first convention, as was Senator Puplick. I was one of the South Australian delegates. At that time we developed a very close friendship which continued for the next 10 years or so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In more recent years, particularly during the period that I was not a member of this Parliament, I did not see so much of Robert. But I was privileged to see him more regularly in the last year or so since my return to the Parliament and during the period that he was involved with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). Certainly, during that 20 years of acquaintance and friendship, I developed a tremendous respect for Robert, for his commitment to the Liberal cause in particular, and more recently for his untiring work for the children of the world as the Director of UNICEF. I would like to place on record my sympathy with his family and my appreciation for what he did for the Liberal Party and for UNICEF in both of the roles he filled there, and for the friendship that I shared with him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to raise in this chamber a matter of justice. I am referring to a case that is known to many members of both the Federal and New South Wales parliaments, including at least one senator. I know that Senator Bishop has made representations on this matter, as have some members of the other place. I refer to the attempt by Mr John Ellenbogen to gain a judicial hearing for his claim that he was wrongfully dismissed by the Blue Mountains City Council. Mr Ellenbogen has been assiduous, even unrelenting, in putting his case to every parliamentarian who has some obligation to represent his interests, as well as to such bodies as the Australian Civil Liberties Union. I have no doubt that many people have advised him to forget about the whole matter. Indeed, Mr Ellenbogen's pursuit of this matter has cost him much in personal terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I believe that most of this cost would have been avoided if Mr Ellenbogen could have gained a proper hearing for his case. I do not want to rehearse the details of this case and I am not qualified to comment on the validity of Mr Ellenbogen's claim of wrongful dismissal. Although some adverse comments on the quality of his case have been passed by more qualified individuals, this is unimportant to the central issue. The central issue is that Mr Ellenbogen has never managed to have his case heard before a properly constituted court or tribunal. The situation is made worse because before 14 April 1985 the case could have been heard before the New South Wales Industrial Commission. After new legislation foreshadowed by the New South Wales Government is passed early next year, cases such as this-that is, cases brought before the Industrial Commission by individuals-will be heard again. Unfortunately for Mr Ellenbogen, the events that led to his grievance occurred in the period when access by individuals to the Industrial Commission was not possible. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1985 the New South Wales Labor Government passed an amendment to amend the Industrial Arbitration Act 1940, which removed the right of access of individuals to the Industrial Commission. From that time on only grievances supported by unions could be heard. The current New South Wales coalition government has had a policy of reinstating the right of access of individuals to this court. The New South Wales Government has a problem with this change. All parliaments are rightly cautious about retrospectivity in any aspect of legislation. I do not know what they are going to do about this one. Nor do I know how many cases would be likely to be heard if access to the court was made retrospective to 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Ellenbogen could have been given access to the Industrial Commission either with the support of the appropriate union-in this case the Federated Municipal and Shire Council Employees Union, which Mr Ellenbogen had not joined while employed by the Council-or at the discretion of the New South Wales Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Fahey, who could have issued a writ of reference to allow this case to be heard. Both the union and the Minister declined to support Mr Ellenbogen's case, as was their right, I stress, and Mr Ellenbogen's attempt through the Equity Division of the Supreme Court of New South Wales to compel the union to represent his case and to compel the Minister to issue a writ of reference failed on both counts. </PARA>
<PARA> It might appear that this is solely a State matter in which the Federal Government has no proper interest. However, as in an increasing number of areas, a closer examination reveals that the Federal Government cannot escape the responsibility for ensuring that all Australian citizens will have open and equal access to the courts. The Federal Government has the obligation under the Australian Constitution to fulfil all the conditions of international treaties and agreements. One international agreement very relevant to this case is the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) which has been signed and ratified by Australia. The covenant was signed in 1972 and ratified in 1980 by Andrew Peacock as the Minister for Foreign Affairs, but with a number of reservations. In 1984, our current Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, who was then the Attorney-General, withdrew most of the reservations, including the one relating to article 50. Article 50 states:</PARA>
<PARA>The provisions of the present Covenant shall extend to all parts of Federal states without any limitations or exceptions. </PARA>
<PARA>In a press release on Human Rights Day in 1984, Senator Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA>The ICCPR provides a charter of the civil and political rights of individuals within a country and places an obligation on the country to ensure protection of these rights. </PARA>
<PARA>He also spoke about the right to a fair trial and the right to equal protection before the law. In 1987, Australia submitted its second periodic report on the ICCPR to the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations. In section 342 on page 136 of the report the Federal Government claimed:</PARA>
<PARA>In all Australian jurisdictions, all persons are equal before courts and tribunals. </PARA>
<PARA>This assertion seems to me to be contradicted by the fact that Mr Ellenbogen has found it impossible to have his case heard before the proper judicial body. How the Federal Government is to correct this anomaly is not clear to me, but I would like to see some more tangible indication of effort than the polite evasions which have so far followed my representations on Mr Ellenbogen's behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently I have had occasion to investigate the constitutional powers available to the Commonwealth and it is now even more apparent to me how ill we are served, in some important areas, by the constitutional division of powers and responsibilities between the States and the Federal Government. However, whether it is through the exercise of constitutional powers or through Commonwealth representations to the New South Wales Government, Mr Ellenbogen has the right to demand that the Federal Government-the government that claims that all its citizens have unhindered access to the courts-ensures that he has his day in court. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IG4">Senator VALLENTINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the last couple of years we have seen a run-down of many of the world's long running conflicts because negotiation is now seen as more effective than continued fighting. We have recognised the value of the United Nations as a third party and members of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) were able to assist with the transition in Namibia after the settlement there, just as we have peacekeepers in Cyprus, the Middle East and South West Asia. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) has spoken of the possibility of members of the ADF serving in Cambodia if conditions permit. He made a proposal to the United Nations General Assembly this year for member states to establish emergency teams, which could be mobilised at short notice, along with another proposal to establish an international training centre for peacekeeping troops.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Spending an extra $100m on the working capital fund for peacekeeping is money better spent than $800m on two extra submarines for the Royal Australian Navy. I would propose using the difference to top up our overseas aid budget to promote real security in our region-not the false security generated by having eight submarines instead of six. Some of the money might go to Radio Australia as well, which, as the Minister correctly points out in paragraph 142, needs long overdue expenditure on the maintenance and upgrading of its capabilities. In fact, it is thoroughly depressing how the Minister almost has to apologise for the inadequate amounts of money available for Radio Australia, or indeed the entire overseas aid budget, yet pushes the line that the military should continue to get its share of the budget, currently 9.6 per cent, or just over $8 billion. I compare that with the 1.8 per cent for the foreign affairs budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Another useful project worthy of more funding is the diplomacy course now being run at the University of New South Wales. One has to ask how much effort we put into training our diplomats in negotiation skills or learning Asian languages. We value conflict resolution courses at the personal or local level but seem to ignore teaching those skills at the international level. With the constructive suggestions from the Minister, such as the ones I have referred to, Australia has played a useful role at the international level, but all this is spoiled by the continuation of the dual rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA> We applaud events in Europe and the effective obsolescence of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact, yet we maintain the even more obsolete myth of ANZUS. We take positive initiatives on a chemical weapons ban after being thwarted in our attempts to promote a comprehensive test ban treaty, and again we are stymied by the United States. We could parallel the talks on land-based missiles by initiating discussion on naval arms control in the Pacific, but again the United States refuses to discuss this question. The Minister is keen on a settlement in Cambodia but he is trapped between all the aid agencies and humanitarian groups which tell him one thing and the vindictive men and women in the United States State Department who cannot forgive Vietnam and who still go along with China. In the meantime, the people of Cambodia continue to suffer so that the politicians can play their silly games. </PARA>
<PARA> Those of us in the Secure Australia project who have talked about Australia's new militarism have argued various points in relation to the militarisation of our region. We have criticised the unnecessary acquisition of new military equipment which we believe is largely irrelevant to the defence of Australia and which has had a disastrous effect on our balance of payments deficit. Even worse, it has prompted the Government to try to offset the costs of these imports by trying to double our military exports. That way military imports, which are running at over $1 billion a year, would be partly offset by exports doubling from $250m to $500m a year. That is the intention; I doubt whether we will ever reach that figure. We may actually be helping to create threats to our own security in the long run by trying to sell weapons in our region. We worry about a long-term possible threat from India but an Australian company in partnership with a Dutch company has got the contract to design India's big new naval base on its west coast, south of Goa. This is hardly sensible if we are really worried about India's militarisation. That contract, incidentally, was actively promoted by our Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's statement does nothing to allay concerns that the Indian Ocean region is not taken seriously, not given enough attention by Canberra based bureaucrats. The recent promotion of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace by Mikhail Gorbachev is ignored in the statement. If the threat is going to come from a regional state, then it may well be that we will have supplied the weapons in the first place if we are serious about selling submarines and other items of military hardware to our neighbours. After all, our first military sales drive last December went round South East Asia, and HMAS Tobruk is being transformed into a floating arms bazaar to peddle more of our military hardware in south and south-west Asia after going to Gallipoli next April. Of course, we have just endured the indignity of AIDEX 89, the biggest arms bazaar in the southern hemisphere with some of the biggest rogues in the industry welcomed to Australia by our Government. It is contradictory that we check individual criminals before they are allowed to come to Australia, and with any luck keep them out, but we turn a blind eye to the corporate criminals. </PARA>
<PARA> Defence analysts agree that we enjoy friendly relations with almost all the countries in our region but go on to say that because the military capacities required for many types of lesser threats already exist in the region, there is a need for defence planning to take account of the fact that relations could deteriorate, intentions could change and in some circumstances this could happen quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> In a number of places in his statement the Minister asserts that there is no country that has or that will have in the foreseeable future the range of naval, air and logistic capabilities that would be needed to both project and sustain substantial conventional forces for major military action against Australia. He asserts that none of the recent military acquisitions by the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries represent a situation in which any ASEAN country has the capability, let alone the intention, to project that kind of major military action against Australia. Indeed in paragraph 70 we are reminded that Australia's defence budget is roughly equivalent to that of all the ASEAN countries combined. In paragraph 63 we are told that we cannot even think of a specific threat. That was evident during Kangaroo 89 when we had to invent an enemy, Kamaria, and the peace movement very imaginatively opened embassies to declare that Kamarians wanted a peaceful settlement and not a war. Unfortunately, such a move was totally lost on the warrior class. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Falklands-or Malvinas-war the United Kingdom found that Argentina was armed by the UK's NATO allies, so it is important to note that all these potential threats to the north are currently being armed or wooed by our Western allies as well as our own defence contractors: West Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, Israel, France, Sweden, Spain, and South Korea, to name just a few. It really does not make sense. We would suggest that it is better to reduce the imports rather than increase our role as merchants of death, particularly bearing in mind the words of the former Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject of the United Nations Special Session on Disarmament in New York in June 1988 and the warning on our wider development responsibilities given by the head of the World Bank speaking in Washington in September this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, we are disturbed by the change in rhetoric by the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) in the last two years, where he uses phrases like `regional management' and `a peacekeeping role in the south-west Pacific'. I would suggest that this is a resurrection of what the German Chancellor Bismarck referred to in 1883 as Australasia's Monroe Doctrine and that it is not peacekeeping which he is talking about, but interventionism. I am not saying that Australia should never intervene in any way, although I would draw the line at military intervention. Yet, under General `Kimbo's' management of the military in this country, we have had the Australian defence forces on alert for action four times-not once in defence of our own country, but twice in Fiji, and once in Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea. </PARA>
<PARA> I also query the talk about rescuing Australian citizens. They are often getting caught up in unrest somewhere or other and the ADF does not go rushing off to rescue them from places like Beijing or the Makati district in Manila. Qantas did a very adequate job in those situations. It was also interesting to hear the Minister's answer to Peter Thomson's question on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's AM program this morning. He was asked about the use of the military to rescue Australian nationals. The Minister said, `Well, it's always a question of being sensitive to requests that may be made of us by friendly governments, just as the United States responded to assist the Aquino Administration'. As I read it, that was an admission of an interventionist policy-that the Australian Government would be prepared to consider intervention and if a request came from a neighbouring country we would have to look at it very sensitively and consider that as an option. </PARA>
<PARA> I was intrigued by Senator Evans's answer to my question today on the matter of military capability in our region, as he classified it. He effectively abandoned the security strategy, presumably carefully planned, after only 24 hours. The strategy announced yesterday by Senator Evans called for the use of many different policy instruments, including military capabilities, to `maintain a positive security and strategic environment in our own region'. Senator Evans's statement defined `our own region' as essentially the same as that called `the area of primary strategic interest' in the Government's 1987 Defence White Paper. </PARA>
<PARA> Questioning the Minister in the Senate today, I pointed out that the 1987 Defence Paper did not envisage significant use of military capacity in this vast area of some 20 per cent of the earth's surface. Rather, it envisaged Australia having a military capacity in a much smaller area-the area of primary defence interest of about 10 per cent of the globe. I asked the Minister to explain this glaring discrepancy between the Government's defence and foreign policy positions. In reply, Senator Evans admitted that it was not envisaged that Australia would have a military role in the larger area, thus abandoning after barely 24 hours the position set out in his elaborate policy paper. I welcome this retreat by the Government, but the contradictions show all too clearly that the Government has failed to set consistent priorities in the defence and foreign affairs areas. Its inability to set out a coherent position even in a prepared paper evidences a continuing struggle between militarism and commonsense in government policy. For once, there seems to have been a rare victory for commonsense, although I suspect it was a fluke as it was based on what must have been a careless error in the Minister's statement.</PARA>
<PARA> It is encouraging that the United States and the Soviet Union are going to reduce their military budgets. There was an inspiring article in the Canberra Times on 6 December which mentioned that pessimists were projecting a halving of United States military spending by the end of the century, from $US300 billion to $US160 billion. Why then do we have the ludicrous spectacle of Australia, which has no threat, actually increasing that proportion of the Budget which goes on the military? The logic, Senator Evans tells us, is that there might be a threat sometime in the distant future, even though we cannot see one now. I think that is a crazy approach to security. Suppose every country were to act in this way; that is, although no threat is in view there might be one day, so every country must arm against that unforeseeable threat. What sort of world would that look like? I venture to say that it would be alarmingly militaristic. We are now seeing the US, the Soviet Union and the Europeans saying that the existing real perceived threat is vanishing so they can cut their military expenditure. But not Australia-we are still a country in search of a threat. </PARA>

Indeed, I am one of those who have been assiduous in John Ellenbogen's cause and have had, in the last days, to separate the person from the principle, which is what we have to do in cases where an individual, as in Mr Ellenbogen's case, has become overtaken by his personal circumstances and has lost very much by his personal case.

But if he has, I remind him that it is in accordance with his own party's policy of giving individuals access to the Industrial Court. This is a policy with which I happen to agree. At least the Minister can now be consoled by the fact that the voluminous Ellenbogen file can be closed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Most goods of a kind sold exclusively or principally, or put up for sale, as food for human consumption are exempt from sales tax. However, this exemption does not extend to snack foods, confectionery, ice-cream and biscuits, which are taxable at the 10 per cent rate. It also does not extend to beverages. The sales tax treatment of beverages is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>plain milk, tea and coffee are exempt;</PARA>
<PARA>fruit and vegetable juice products containing 25 per cent or more Australian, New Zealand or Papua New Guinean juice, and flavoured milk drinks containing 90 per cent or more milk, are taxed at the 10 per cent rate (prior to the 1986-87 Budget, these beverages were exempt); and</PARA>
<PARA>most other beverages, including soft drinks, those fruit and vegetable juice products and flavoured milk drinks not taxed at 10 per cent, and alcoholic beverages are taxed at the 20 per cent rate.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) As noted above, most foodstuffs for human consumption are exempt from sales tax. This exemption extends to smoked salmon and caviar.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Beverages are taxed at a variety of sales tax rates. The Government's decision in the 1986-87 Budget to tax previously exempt fruit juice products at the 10 per cent rate was designed to reduce anomalies associated with the sales tax treatment of non-alcoholic beverages.</PARA>
<PARA> Imposing sales tax on `luxury' food items such as smoked salmon and caviar would lead to major distortions, anomalies and administrative difficulties. Classifying some foodstuffs as luxuries would be extremely arbitrary; items that are considered to be luxuries in some cultures may not be in others. Further, distortions would inevitably arise-there would not appear to be any reason to impose sales tax on smoked salmon but not on fresh salmon, or oysters, for example. In effect, there is no clear distinction between luxury and other food items which could enable them to be distinguished for the purposes of applying sales tax.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health, upon notice, on 31 October 1989:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Is the Minister aware that an article in the 3 March 1989 edition of the North American Journal of Dermatological and Surgical Oncology states that the argon laser treatment of port-wine stain haemangiomas found on thin skin, such as the skin of the lateral neck and upper lip, has the major disadvantage for the patient in some 87 per cent of cases of the development of hypertrophic scarring, whereas the argon-pumped tunable dye laser permits successful treatment of haemangiomas on these areas, and is therefore particularly appropriate for treatment of the face and neck, and the treatment of young children.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) How many flash-lamp pumped dye laser, argon laser, argon dye laser and copper vapour laser machines are there currently in Australia and where are they located (private and public clinics and hospitals).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In the treatment of port-wine stain haemangiomas; (a) what is the Medicare rebate for 15 minute, 30 minute, 45 minute and 60 minute sessions for treatment with the: (i) argon laser machine, (ii) argon dye laser machine, (iii) flash-lamp pumped dye laser machine, and (iv) copper vapour laser machine; and (b) what is the private health fund rebate for each of the above treatments.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) What is the range of charges by doctors for 15 minute, 30 minute, 45 minute and 60 minute sessions of treatment by each of the 4 lasers.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) What would be the cost to a clinic or hospital of treating a patient with each type of laser equipment for 15 minute, 30 minute, 45 minute and 60 minute sessions, taking into consideration, where appropriate: (a) capital purchase costs; (b) electricity; (c) transformer; (d) water chiller; (e) maintenance costs; (f) laser consumables such as dye, cot, filters and methanol; (g) salary of operator; (h) anaesthetic (local and general); and (i) other relevant costs.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Which State/Territory Departments of Health currently pay the interstate travel costs of patients to enable them to receive laser treatment for port-wine stain haemangiomas.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Community Services and Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. However, the Medicare Benefits Advisory Committee, in providing advice to the Minister for Community Services and Health, has considered other studies from clinical literature concerning the efficacy of flash-lamp pumped tunable dye lasers in the treatment of haemangiomas of the skin.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Medicare statistics do not specify the location at which services are rendered. Accordingly, it is not possible to identify from Medicare data the number or type of laser machines currently in Australia or their location.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (a) (i)-(iv) there is no differentiation between the rebates for services rendered using the 4 different machines listed providing the light produced by the laser is within a wavelength of 510-600 nanometres. Medicare rebates for the laser treatment of port-wine haemangiomas are:</PARA>

<PARA> There is no specific rebate payable for a 45 minute session of treatment. The rebates for this length of treatment are the same as those for Item 9451 above.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The private health fund rebate for these treatments is limited to services provided to hospital in-patients. The funds are required, under their basic table as defined in the National Health Act, to pay the difference between the Medicare benefits schedule fee and the Medicare rebate for in-patient services provided in a hospital or day hospital facility. The private health fund benefits for items 9451 and 9452 are therefore $19.00 and $24.00 respectively.</PARA>
