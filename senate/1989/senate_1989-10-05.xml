<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>To the honourable the President of the Senate and the Senators in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That every abortion kills an unborn human baby.</PARA>
<PARA> That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights.</PARA>
<PARA> That in 1987/88 the Federal Government paid $6.4 million from taxpayers funds for 61,879 abortions under Medicare Items 6469 and 274/275 alone.</PARA>
<PARA> That in the same year Federal Government grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State Public Hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA> Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will carry out its duty to protect the right to life of Australian babies and abolish Government funding of abortion.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth, that:</PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned about the increase in violent television programmes for children and particularly those programmes promoting violent toys that are available for sale in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray; that you support the Broadcasting (Prohibition of Violent Programmes for Children) Act 1988 which has been presented by WA Independent Senator for Nuclear Disarmament, Jo Vallentine. This act aims to prohibit the broadcasting of children's TV programmes that are violent and that promote toys modelled on characters, weapons or other war accessories which are also available for sale in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth, that:</PARA>
<PARA> At present all Australians, including those who conscientiously object to war and the preparation of war, are required by law for a portion of their income tax to be spent on military use.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you support the Peace Tax Trust Fund Bill 1989 which has been presented by Western Australian Independent Senator, Jo Vallentine. This Bill does not propose that anyone be permitted to withhold tax, but that the law should be changed to allow conscientious objectors to divert the military portion of their tax into more positive and socially useful programmes.</PARA>

<TITLE>Vietnam: End of War List</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The members of the Australian Armed Forces who served in Vietnam from 1962 to 1973 did so with distinction, valour and professionalism, upholding the traditions of the Armed Forces.</PARA>
<PARA> After World War 2 and the Korean War the Australian Government approved an End of War List of Gallantry Medals for individual acts of bravery that were not rewarded during wartime.</PARA>
<PARA> The Whitlam Government refused to approve such an End of War List at the end of the Vietnam War.</PARA>
<PARA> Your humble petitioners pray that the Federal Government reverse the decision of the Whitlam Government and thus approve an End of War List for the Australian Armed Forces Personnel that served in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA> Upon the approval of the End of War List, the case of the 2nd Lieutenant John Fraser, 3RAR be considered for the award of a posthumous military honour.</PARA>

<TITLE>Home Ownership</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth, that:</PARA>
<PARA> Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.</PARA>
<PARA> Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled require the Hawke-Keating government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many home ownership is returned to average Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) are opposed to the holding of an Arms Bazaar, AIDEX '89, at the National Exhibition Centre in Canberra on 28-30 November 1989</PARA>
<PARA> (2) believe that it is inappropriate for Australia to seek to offset its balance of payments deficit incurred through the import of expensive and unnecessary military equipment by seeking to double military exports over the next three to five years</PARA>
<PARA> (3) regard it is offensive that on one hand we offer foreign aid to neighbouring countries to improve their material standard of being, while on the other hand the merchants of death seek to persuade their rulers to buy military equipment which is entirely inappropriate to the needs of the people</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners respectfully request that the Senate urge the Government to cancel this exhibition just as its predecessor, PADEX, was called off in 1986, the International Year of Peace.</PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Pensions payable to, or in relation to, most former Commonwealth Government employees and Defence Force Personnel are increased in July each year in accordance with the increase in the weighted average of the consumer price index for the eight capital cities to the previous 31 March. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986, the extraordinary circumstances of the economy required all members of the community to share the cost of reducing government expenditure. As part of these arrangements, the government legislated in October 1986 for the 2 per cent wage discount that had been applied to wages to be extended to the 1986 pension increase applied to government superannuation benefits payable to, or in respect of, former Commonwealth government employees and defence force personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1986 those pensions payable to former Commonwealth government employees and Defence Force Personnel have been adjusted by the full Consumer Price Index increase. Persons receiving those pensions have therefore suffered a significantly lower reduction in living standards than the average person in the workforce at the time when real wages for fulltime adult workers have fallen by 2.2 percent since 1982. In the context of the decision, announced in the April statement, to bring forward indexation increases of social welfare benefits by 12 weeks, the Government also decided that former Commonwealth government employees and Defence Force Personnel whose 1986 pension increases were reduced would have the level of those pensions restored from November 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to implement the Government's decision. It amends the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973, the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948, The Superannuation Acts 1922 and 1976 and The Papua New Guinea (Staffing Assistance) (Superannuation) Regulations to provide for the levels of pensions payable under that legislation to be increased from 20 October 1989. This is the first day in the pay period which ends on the first pension payday in November. Pensions will be increased from that date to the levels that would have applied if they had not been reduced in October 1986. The increase will be applied only to pensions directly or indirectly affected by the 1986 reduction. </PARA>
<PARA> It is expected that, as a result of the proposed amendments, total costs of the relevant pensions during 1989-90 will increase by approximately $17 million and during 1990-91 by approximately $27.7 million. Increases in outlays effects are estimated at $12.1 million for 1989-90, and $19.8 million for 1990-91. </PARA>

<PARA> An amount of $170m is included under the advance to the Minister for Finance, the same as was provided in the Supply Act (No. 1) 1989/90 which this Bill, when enacted, will subsume. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 5 of the Bill provides for the appropriation of the Consolidated Revenue Fund to enable the Minister for Finance to issue amounts for the payment of increases in salaries and payments in the nature of salary arising out of awards, orders or determinations made under, or in accordance with, a law. Allowance has been included in the overall Budget figuring for such prospective increases-$80m in respect of persons employed under the Defence function and $110m in respect of other Public Service employees; that allowance is not, however, appropriated in advance of any increases being awarded. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, pursuant to my contingent notice of motion, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Chaney moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely, a censure motion relating to the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button). </PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday Senator Button responded to a series of questions from the Opposition on the issue of airline safety. We had a vintage performance from Senator Button which, once he came under a bit of pressure, turned into a series of abusive comments about the Opposition. He said that what was being raised by the Opposition:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . is yet another clear example of the despicable scaremongering that is being driven by the Opposition at the behest of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA>There is apparently no limit to the depths to which Senator MacGibbon and his Opposition colleagues are prepared to descend to create panic and uncertainty in the minds of the travelling public. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement and an earlier statement in response to Senator MacGibbon, which was in similar terms, questioning the motives of the Opposition and questioning the facts which were raised by us earlier in Question Time, were part of what has come from the Government, namely, a series of bland reassurances about the standards which are being maintained by this Government. In the House of Representatives at the same time a number of questions were put to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis). At the same time as we were getting bland assurances from Senator Button, interspersed with some abuse about the motivation of the Opposition, Mr Willis was telling the House of Representatives that he was aware of allegations made by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots and various of its supporters, including the Federal Opposition, that the Civil Aviation Authority has compromised safety during this dispute. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I totally reject that charge. Both the Government and the CAA are concerned to ensure that, in rebuilding our domestic aviation system, Australia's high safety standards are fully maintained. </PARA>
<PARA>A little later in the same answer he said:</PARA>
<PARA>There has been no change to the normal requirement that pilot competence must be adequately demonstrated. </PARA>
<PARA>It is all part of a pattern of reassurance, Mr President, at a time when, as Minister Button admitted in the Senate yesterday, the air services of Australia are under considerable stress. The stress must be evident when we look at the description of the air services being provided under this Government which was provided to the Estimates Committee just two days ago. The normal company aircraft which provide services around Australia at the moment are providing 29 per cent of the capacity; leased aircraft, which are substantially foreign aircraft, are providing in excess of that; and the rest is made up of foreign carriers, Royal Australian Air Force and Royal Australian Navy flights and commuter flights. </PARA>
<PARA> During this period of stress it has been of concern to the Opposition to ensure that the safety standards of which Australians are justifiably proud-those of us who fly frequently are extremely grateful for them-should not be compromised. The first matter that was raised with me was raised by Senator Panizza. He raised an issue which had come to his direct attention because of his own experience on a charter flight. The matters that were raised by Senator Panizza, by Senator Brian Archer and by a series of senators in this place have been pooh-poohed by the Government and we have been told that there is nothing to worry about. We have been told that the matter is simply a political gambit on the part of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> That position is very hard for the Government to sustain, in the face of the revelation that senior officials in the Civil Aviation Authority who are concerned with the maintenance of safety standards have now been shown to have made complaints to their senior officers over what they see as the very serious breaches of safety standards which have occurred over the weeks of this dispute. I hope that Senator Button was able to watch some television this morning because on Good Morning Australia there was a public servant from the Civil Aviation Authority, an airworthiness surveyor named Mr Quinn, putting on the public record in the most open way possible his concerns. In the interview he made it clear what his judgment of the safety situation was when he said he was going to drive back to Melbourne rather than fly. I suppose for someone as intimately involved in the administration of safety standards as he is that is a fairly telling comment. </PARA>
<PARA> What Mr Quinn described in that interview this morning is the sort of factual situation which gives rise to the concern of the Opposition and leads us to wish to debate this matter now and to censure the Leader of the Government for his cavalier attitude to this serious matter and for his abusive response to serious matters which were raised with him yesterday. Mr Quinn in his interview talked about finding structural cracks, unacceptable levels of corrosion, brakes worn beyond limits, fluid systems with unaccept- able leaks and aircraft flying without maintenance releases. This is the description given by one of the people charged with the responsibility of seeing that aircraft standards are maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> A little later in the same interview we found Mr Quinn telling the Australian people that the Authority cannot even get access to the foreign aircraft which are being brought in with the active encouragement of this Government and which are being used to provide the great bulk of air services which the Australian people are using. Mr Quinn said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we have been given written direction that we are not to board those aircraft, we have no right to board those aircraft although we have informally walked around them. But we haven't carried out a surveillance or an assessment on aircraft as such. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . one aircraft which is not flying by the way, I must stress that, we walked around and we found that the main landing gear support . . . was cracked. But that aircraft has not been flown. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an example of one person who has been prepared to go to the public and to disclose what he regards as a situation so unsatisfactory that he himself is choosing to drive rather than fly to Melbourne from Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> A far more comprehensive description of what is wrong with the system that is being operated has become public over the last 12 hours. Indeed, a number of major newspapers have reported on the reports from within the Civil Aviation Authority which go to operational standards and to concerns among senior officials about those operational standards. It is in that context that the Opposition seeks the suspension of Standing Orders because we have taken a number of steps to try to ensure that the Government maintains standards. We have sought, for example, a parliamentary committee which will examine that aspect of the Civil Aviation Authority's administration. The Government has undertaken to discuss that matter with us; it has not closed the door on it although my meeting with Minister Willis was cancelled at 9 o'clock this morning and I suppose he has other things on his mind. Our persistent concern is to ensure that these matters are addressed early so that an accident or accidents can be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> In advancing this, let me say that on every specific issue that we have raised there has been what I would describe as a bland or brush-off response. I think it was Senator David MacGibbon who asked a question about a plane flying out of Sydney being flown by a French-speaking pilot, presumably with some command of English, who took a wrong turn and was found to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Senator MacGibbon was much criticised by Senator Button-intemperately criticised by Senator Button-for raising this matter. Let me say that it is interesting to see the message that was sent out by a member of the Civil Aviation Authority with respect to this incident. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Thank heavens for radar. Sector controller tried to counsel pilot gently but has no doubt he was not understood. Would you please try to help these pilots understand the meaning of SFPDN PLUS and the difference between a WOL and a SLS Dep--</PARA>
<PARA>We of course will try to do the same. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, the point I wish to make is that the Opposition to this point has been raising these issues on the basis of a series of public reports of malfunctions in the airline system around Australia. We have received nothing but bland replies. Now we have people who are charged with the responsibility of administering this area expressing the gravest possible concerns about the approach which has been adopted. I do not wish to deal with the whole of the substance of this matter in a motion for the suspension of Standing Orders, but let me quote from the summary of the document prepared by Mr Segan, an Acting Senior Examiner with the Civil Aviation Authority. He says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The events of recent weeks have had a deleterious effect on our ability to set and administer standards for the airline industry. We have:</PARA>
<PARA>granted concessions, for purely political reasons, against longstanding requirements without due consideration of the equivalent safety factors;</PARA>
<PARA> In those circumstances, where people who are employed by the Aviation Authority are prepared to have this sort of view put to their superior officers with the express desire of having their concerns about the inadequate safety standards on the record, I believe we have a very serious situation indeed and one which lies strangely at odds with the sorts of responses which we have received from Senator Button over recent days. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Senate to consider the context of what I am talking about. We have had a seven-week dispute in the airline industry. We have seen the Government adopt a most extraordinary political position which is completely at odds with many of its previous stances. I invite Labor senators to consider the record. On the weekend before the pilots were to be brought before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission the Prime Minister publicly announced that he would support the immediate use of common law action against the pilots. This was prior to this matter having been dealt with before the Commission. We have a situation where the Prime Minister has supported the use of individual contracts; he has supported a situation where the pilots have been told that they cannot have representation in negotiations for their employment contract-a most extraordinary series of actions by the Government for what?</PARA>
<PARA> We have been alleging that the reasoning behind what the Government is doing is in part its defence of the accord. I would invite Labor senators to address their attention to certain documents and in particular the document over the signature of Mr M. R. Lewino which describes the actions of the Civil Aviation Authority with respect to the Ansett organisation in Western Australia. It is a very interesting document, I would have thought, for any Labor senator to read. It is interesting to find that when the Minister is saying that these are matters for the Civil Aviation Authority there seems to be the most intimate interaction between the Civil Aviation Authority, the Ansett organisation and the Minister. Let me quote from one part of this document:</PARA>
<PARA> The next morning Mr Thomas arrived in Melbourne to handle the America West arrangements. I informed him of our concerns about Captain Smith and that I intended to withdraw his check pilot approval. In return, Mr Thomas advised that Captain Smith and Mr McMahon, Ansett's GM, had contacted him late the previous evening, via Minister Willis' office, to protest at the French requirements. Mr Thomas had agreed to look further into the need for . . . revalidation exam and to remove the requirement for 50 hours training, acting in command under supervision . . . and substitute training to `the satisfaction of the training officer'. </PARA>
<PARA>I suppose that is the sort of thing Labor senators have come to expect because, of course, we have a government which operates by the rules of the New South Wales Right of the Australian Labor Party. We have moved a censure motion against Senator Button because he has become caught up in the sort of behaviour that we used to associate only with the New South Wales Right of the Labor Party. We have, in fact, a total abrogation of the public interest in favour of short term sectional interests which are supported by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the matter of safety is not one which should be temporised. We think it should be dealt with quickly and we require the clearest assurances from the Government that the safety issue will be addressed properly now. It is not a matter for delay. We think the attitude which has been adopted by this Minister so far is an absurd one which we certainly cannot countenance and support. Indeed, we are seeking that the Senate condemn it. Mr President, I ask that the Standing Orders be suspended. I believe that we should debate this matter in full and that the full contents of these documents should be made public and available so that people can see the way this Government has temporised on this vital issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chaney has moved for the suspension of Standing Orders. I do not think anyone in this chamber would regard air safety as a minor matter. Australia has had a very proud record in that regard over the years. When the matter was raised yesterday, as Manager of Government Business-and Senator Sanders could affirm or deny this-if Senator Chaney had moved to set up his committee yesterday I probably could have rolled it over. I am not sure; that was my impression. Certainly, I thought the matter was serious enough not to roll over yesterday and to have some discussions about in the meantime.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I apologise in one sense to Senator Chaney that the 9 o'clock meeting this morning was cancelled, although `rescheduled' is a better word to use, because I certainly intended to have it today, well before tomorrow morning, even though we have a heavy Estimates schedule. I was willing to give up my lunch or dinner hour to pursue that. So there was no malevolence on the part of the Government. Indeed, some of the issues Senator Chaney has raised obviously needed the attention of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis). We can expect him to be giving that his attention this morning, especially as the Senate had Question Time at 10 o'clock. I just want to put it on the record on behalf of the Government that we take matters of air safety very seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that in attempting at Question Time to answer questions on air safety matters it is very difficult for a Minister representing another Minister who is representing another Minister to have every detail available. Indeed, I do not think it has ever been the case in the Senate where a Minister representing another Minister would know of every possible air safety infringement or every alleged one. If one goes back through Senate history one will not find a record of a Minister who has been able to get on his feet following every question and give an answer as to every potential infringement. </PARA>

Honourable senators opposite lack intestinal fortitude. They are all talk and no action. The moment the Government decides to make a stand on an issue they go to water. The quislings of the national Parliament sit on the opposite side when it comes to a real fight. Mr President, I do not raise the argument today as I have on some other censure motions about this matter taking up the time of the chamber, because it would have been equally open to Senator Chaney or any other Opposition senator to put forward a matter of public importance, which would have absorbed about the same amount of time. As to the timing, whether tomorrow would have been better than today may well have been tested at Question Time today in that the matters that have arisen overnight have come to the attention of people in between Question Times. Those questions may or may not have been able to be satisfied today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to go to two other points. Senator Chaney quoted from a document. When we ask for the source of a document the automatic reaction is, `Why should we give you the source? You are going to get stuck into the source'. When one asks for the source of a document, it just goes to the credibility. If it has a strong source, it improves the credibility of the document. I think you would agree, Mr President, that a leaked anonymous document has far less credibility when we are weighing up the evidentiary nature of what is presented than one that can be sourced. To almost assert, as I have heard in this chamber before, that we want to know the name because we want to get that person, is absolutely fictitious. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I wish to raise relates to the ever growing number of censure motions. I know that the Opposition would say that they are needed. But what the Opposition is essentially doing, as I have said about four times this session, is substantially devaluing censure motions. Yesterday we debated a censure motion. I found it amazing that the remark which was given the greatest coverage, and which dominated the headlines, was a flippant remark about bogong moths. That does not say much for the press, I understand that, but those opposite have devalued censure motions to such a stage that when I make a flippant remark in this chamber-and if people did not see the humour or otherwise in it, I apologise-about Senator McKiernan waving away bogong moths, that receives the major coverage this morning, and the major coverage of Senator Puplick's speech related to his comments on that matter. It shows the extent that those opposite have devalued censure motions. The question of a censure motion on air safety should never be devalued. It may have had much more value today if the weapon of censure had not been devalued on other occasions. I make that point for anyone who is listening or who is going to write about censure motions. They are supposed to be very serious matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The second last time when a censure motion was moved I criticised Senator Chaney for not giving advance notice. Fortunately, the bush telegraph this morning was well and truly working. I thank Senator Chaney for that. We were not told directly about it, but everyone in the building knew that a censure motion would be moved before or during Question Time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate censures the Leader of the Government for his failure to give proper consideration to concerns about air safety raised by the Opposition in light of the grave concern at senior levels of the Civil Aviation Authority about current procedures and standards and condemns the Minister for his despicable allegation of improper motives and scaremongering in the Opposition's questioning of safety issues arising from the pilots' dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>Some of the matters which I wish to address in this motion have been addressed in the motion to suspend Standing Orders, but let me say that the complaint which we specifically address to Senator Button goes to his response yesterday to a series of questions which were addressed to him on the issue of airline safety. In response to the matters which were put to him Senator Button said-I have already quoted these words-that it was another example of despicable scaremongering driven by the Opposition at the behest of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me concentrate my remarks now on the remarks which are made not by the Federation of Air Pilots but by officials of the Civil Aviation Authority. Again, I will not repeat the comments made by Mr Quinn, the aircraft examiner, this morning, except to remind the Senate that a restriction upon Australian bureaucrats actually inspecting foreign aircraft does seem to me to be the height of absurdity. Let me simply use the words which have been used, as I say, not by politicians, not by airline pilots, but by people like Mr Segan, the senior examiner for the Civil Aviation Authority, and Mr Lewino, who is the General Manager for Victoria and Tasmania for the Civil Aviation Authority. Mr President, these are simply some extracts from the documents which at this stage I have not tabled although I intend to do so at the conclusion of this speech unless some good indication has been given to me as to what sections are objected to. What was said by Mr Segan was:</PARA>
<PARA> We had a basic duty to our employer, the public, to maintain standards and in this area I believe we have been totally inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on then in this report to deal in great detail with the sorts of inadequacies which have caused him to say that the standards have not been maintained but concessions have been granted for purely political reasons without due consideration of equivalent safety factors. Apparently, there have been a series of concessions made with respect to the admission of new pilots and aircraft for domestic use in Australia. What this report says under the heading of `granting concessions' is:</PARA>
<PARA> A major error was to allow ourselves to be drawn into discussions with airline commercial management-a group who had no knowledge or interest in standards. Their approach was to attack our standards in an attempt to reduce training requirements and they were successful. Their only negotiating point was the threat of ministerial action and it is an indication of our lack of confidence that we did not call their bluff. As a result new standards were set by political blackmail and it is now highly unlikely that we can redeem this situation. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the report goes on to deal with the fact that foreign pilots have been accredited to fly without supervision in Australia. Under that heading we find that there are concerns about, for example, the French pilots who have been admitted. That concern, which is in a sense expressed in an academic way in this report, is borne out by the incident which was raised by Senator MacGibbon in the Senate yesterday and which was the subject of the paper which I have incorporated in Hansard and tabled earlier today. Mr Segan says:</PARA>
<PARA>It is an acknowledgment that the company procedures and practices detailed in the operations manual are well known to that pilot. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the requirement that he fly under supervision for up to 50 hours. Mr Segan continues:</PARA>
<PARA>This cannot be said of the French-indeed, it could be argued that their difficulty with the English language would override any advantage that their type endorsement may have offered. </PARA>
<PARA>He then expresses criticisms of the flight rules and procedures examination. Normally Australian pilots are required to sit examinations at various levels and each of these examinations is given in series. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>With the French pilots this was not done and what amounted to a re-typed, open book SCPL paper given purely to expedite licence issue. Small wonder, therefore, that within a week of the commencement of their operation we should have reports of ATC confusion due to non standard radio calls, and of RPT aircraft turning right in left hand traffic patterns. </PARA>
<PARA>He talks about English language tests:</PARA>
<PARA>This Authority has a requirement to check all pilots whose first language is not English prior to the issue of a licence . . . To my knowledge no such testing occurred. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Examination Reset Frequency. </PARA>
<PARA>The Authority had a policy on the time interval which should have elapsed before an unsuccessful candidate could reset a written examination. This situation is quite defensible. We possessed a limited number of papers and the aim was to have the candidate acquire the necessary knowledge through study rather than to memorise exam questions. This policy was relaxed without justification even before the French pilots had sat their first exam. </PARA>
<PARA>He complains about the approval of British Aerospace check captains. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no evidence whatsoever to indicate that the pilots on loan from British Aerospace possess the necessary knowledge of CAA requirements and Company operations manual procedures to satisfactorily complete these checks which hitherto were the province of a very select group of senior pilots. Our approval of these on-loan pilots as unrestricted check captains cannot be justified. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on and refers to the misuse of regulatory powers and says that the intent of the regulations has been ignored although the letter has been acknowledged. He considers that the approval of certain Aero Maritime aircraft is `nothing more than a cynical exercise in rule bending'. Then there are extensive references to the approval of Captain Smith as a check captain, and that is the matter which is the subject of the very lengthy memorandum from Mr Lewino to which I have earlier referred. This officer said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Company was desperate to put pilots on the line. Given the circumstances, there was no way that Radnedge could have afforded to fail [Smith] on that check. I firmly believe we should have despatched a regular examiner to observe Radnedge's conduct of the check. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the check on Captain Smith. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Further to the above, Captain [Smith's] performance since assuming office in the West has fallen well short of expectations. There would now appear to be ample evidence that Smith has difficulty in reconciling his loyalty to the Ansett commercial operation with his obligations as the delegate of the Authority. One of our concerns was [Smith's] insistence in bypassing the recognized chain of command within the Ansett check and training system in an attempt to reduce training requirements. It was for these reasons that I elected to delay written confirmation of check approval pending further observations of his performance by both our examiner and Ansett check and training staff. The decision, therefore, by Central Office staff to issue [Smith's] approval in the face of Field Office concern was disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA>He referred to the breakdown of Civil Aviation Authority communications and said:</PARA>
<PARA>Central Office staff appear to have been stampeded into offering instant policy decisions and these have been conveyed directly to the airlines leaving Field Office staff completely out of loop. Airline management has been quick to identify this weakness and has successfully played both officers against each other talking directly to whoever they considered would provide the most favourable response. The result has been the degradation of long established standards. </PARA>
<PARA>The summary of this officer was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The events of recent weeks have had a deleterious effect on our ability to set and administer standards for the airline industry. We have:</PARA>
<PARA>granted concessions, for purely political reasons, against long standing requirements without due consideration of equivalent safety factors; interpreted the literal translation of Regulations solely to expedite approvals without taking due consideration of the intent of such legislation; and allowed a major communication breakdown to develop such that logical and considered decisions could no longer be guaranteed. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the statement of one senior officer of the Civil Aviation Authority. Let me refer to a memo which was sent to Mr Freeland, the head of that Authority, and to other senior officers by Mr Lewino. I simply wish to give a number of direct quotes from that report which I think summarise the concerns which now must be addressed as a matter of urgency by the Government. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> The current pilot dispute has seriously weakened the Ansett operational organisation, despite the fact that a number of the more senior operational managers remained with the company. For political and industrial reasons, Ansett needs to keep at least a token airline service in operation and has used its remaining management pilot force to fly these aircraft. However, people cannot be in two places at once, and as a result experienced operational managers have not been available to organise and oversight developments, such as the introduction of foreign charter services and the reactivation of Ansett services with foreign crews. </PARA>
<PARA>A little later he says:</PARA>
<PARA> A more serious consequence, which has manifested itself over the last week, is that the operational managers are becoming fatigued. They are flying to the full limit of flight and crew duty rules (in one case, over these limits). . .</PARA>
<PARA>A little later he says that a particular named individual stated that `working to the prescribed limit was very tiring for management pilots and he could not accept any increase'. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA> There is other evidence of fatigue. Normally, cool calm managers are becoming terse and brusque and they look tired. People like . . . . . seem to have aged several years. </PARA>
<PARA>He talks about a captain brought over from New Zealand to head the program of training for French-Hungarian BAe146 pilots. He says that `the only concern about' that individual `at that stage was advice from' another official from the Civil Aviation Authority `that he had a known history at deliberately breaking rules'. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> In particular, he had been approved to give a demonstration flight at an air show and had exceeded to safety limitation laid down in the approval. </PARA>
<PARA>He talks about that officer's reacting `precipitously and with emotional aggression'. He talks about-and I referred to this in the debate on my motion to suspend Standing Orders-the contact with Ansett Airlines via the Willis office and the clear close involvement of the Government in these arrangements. He talks again about the named officer's unreliability and about two training flights with a French pilot for whom he was asked to issue a certification of validation to captain of BAe146 aircraft, which he declined to do. Subsequent observation of that pilot's performance by another examiner captain confirmed that he was not at that time up to command status. The same named individual sought the right to carry out his duties as a supervising pilot or as an observer by using the observer seat on the flight deck with two French first officers occupying the pilots' seats in order to expedite their training. </PARA>
<PARA>Again I declined-</PARA>
<PARA>this is the officer speaking-</PARA>
<PARA>and expressed my amazement that he could propose such a course of action, particularly on a revenue flight carrying members of the public. </PARA>
<PARA>What is being described there is an attempt to institute a procedure by somebody who has the responsibility of supervising the introduction of foreign pilots and who is seeking not to sit in the copilot's seat or in the captain's seat but to sit in the observer seat while two foreign pilots fly a commercial flight with a full commercial load. That is the sort of allegation that is being made, not by the Opposition, but by officials within the Civil Aviation Authority. When we contrast that with the responses that have been received in the Senate, giving clear assurances that the procedures have been maintained, it is absolutely clear that we have a very serious problem which needs immediate attention. </PARA>
<PARA> Our concern in this motion is to record the Senate's disapproval of a situation where the senior Minister in this place, Senator Button, is not only a party to bland reassurances about safety, which at best would have to be said to be highly questionable, but is in turn abusive of the Opposition for raising matters that are obviously of central public interest. In our view, Senator Button should be censured by the Senate. Most importantly, the Government should act on this safety issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chaney summed up very well what this censure is all about. There were two points: bland reassurances about safety and abuse of the Opposition. That is what it is all about: it is the abuse of the Opposition which is of the utmost concern to the Opposition. Throughout this week I, as Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis), have been asked a series of questions about specific incidents. I have been asked whether such and such happened in Perth, whether such and such happened south of Sydney on a particular day, what were the particular circumstances, et cetera. Senator Newman is starting already; she does not want to hear what I have to say on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All those questions have asked for specific details. In most cases, the questions would have been more appropriately put on notice but were asked in the context of questions without notice. I have given answers to nearly all of those questions. I gave some yesterday and one or two the day before. Senator Chaney seeks to characterise those answers as bland reassurances. When a Government Minister is asked questions, what does he do? He gets the answers from the appropriate authority, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), and he provides those answers as soon as possible. That is what has been done throughout this week. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney said that yesterday I had made an allegation which was despicable. Today he comes in here and says, `Now we have found the reason that the Minister's answer of yesterday was despicable. A document has been leaked from the Civil Aviation Authority today which proves retrospectively that the Minister was despicable towards Senator MacGibbon'.

What does that prove in terms of what Senator Chaney says is, `the frivolous response of the Government in respect of these issues'?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next document which Senator Chaney cites in retrospective support of his allegation of my conduct yesterday is the document prepared in the Victorian-Tasmanian division. Because we have had some readings about that from Senator Chaney, let me make one or two points about that document-first of all, the comments made by Mr Lewino, acting general manager, safety regulation, Victoria-Tasmania division. If we analyse the document, we see that Mr Lewino's main concern centred on British check pilots conducting final checks for French pilots on BAE146 planes. A very lengthy discussion of that has been provided by the CAA as to what actually happened. Let me just make one or two points about it. Mr Lewino's main concern centred around these British check pilots conducting these checks. In fact, in addition to the checks conducted by the British check pilots, the Ansett Melbourne chief check pilot proceeded to Perth on 28 September and rechecked the French pilots. This was in accord with the wishes expressed by Mr Lewino, the author of this document. That was his concern. We understand, and I am advised, that Mr Lewino's concern was allayed by this action in sending the Ansett Melbourne chief check pilot to Perth to recheck, as I have explained. </PARA>
<PARA> The document from Mr Segan concerns a number of matters. I want to make a comment about it. Subsequent to the recommendations of the Aviation Safety Regulatory Review Committee earlier this year, the CAA had for some time been revising its regulatory approach to concentrate on the outcome of safety rather than rigid means of getting there. I interpolate that a committee has been looking at the operations of the CAA and the Federal Airports Corporation. In the course of that committee inquiry Opposition senators have challenged the CAA about being insufficiently flexible and being too rigid in the procedures which it adopts. The CAA has responded to those expressions of concern. The accusation against it has been that it is too rigid and insufficiently flexible. The CAA has revised its regulatory approach to concentrate on the outcome of safety rather than on rigid means of getting there. </PARA>
<PARA> Also during the current pilots dispute the CAA, in applying this principle, has expedited its approval processes without in any way relaxing its standard of safety. These changes have obviously concerned some CAA officers such as Mr Segan, who may not have been completely in touch with the changed philosophy. The matter is being addressed by the CAA General Manager (Safety Regulations), who is meeting regularly with his staff to discuss these concerns and to ensure that all CAA officers understand the objectives of the changes, that it is a more cost effective, regulatory system, without a reduction in safety. The CAA is happy to obtain detailed answers to any particular queries in relation to these minutes, and if I am asked those questions I will follow the procedure I have adopted this week; that is, I will provide answers as soon as possible. That is the normal procedure in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney made another point-based, I think, on a television interview this morning which I did not see-with a Mr Quinn. The burden of that allegation was that Mr Quinn says that the authorities here do not get access to international planes flying here, and so on. It is true--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. In respect of the question of foreign aircraft airworthiness, let me make this point: foreign aircraft airworthiness is the responsibility of the foreign regulatory authority. America West aircraft, for example, which are currently flying in Australia, are subject to a continuous airworthiness maintenance program approved by the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) operating in the United States. This program describes what must be done in terms of maintenance and airworthiness, and when and how. Compliance is the responsibility of the aircraft operation. Surveillance is the responsibility of the appropriate regulatory authority-in this case, the FAA. Three weeks ago the FAA stated its position on airworthiness and on operations inspections in Australia to assist the CAA to ensure that appropriate airworthiness arrangements were in place. The CAA is in constant communication with a number of foreign regulatory authorities to ensure that safety is not compromised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The airworthiness arrangements for these planes operating in Australia are exactly the same as those applying to any international airline normally operating in Australia on which thousands upon thousands of Australians have travelled with utmost safety for many years. That is the position that the CAA, as the appropriate regulatory authority, adopts. That is consistent with the position always adopted in respect of foreign aircraft flying in Australia. There is nothing different about that. So it is not, with respect, a point of great substance, although it has been expressed as part of Senator Chaney's concerns in the course of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other matters of detail have been raised, but I want to turn to the question of style, the presentation-the substance, if you like-of the allegations by Senator Chaney. There are two issues of substance. The first is that the Government has blandly brushed off questions of air safety. That is not correct. Any questions that have been asked here have been answered and they have been answered on advice from the appropriate body to handle these matters, the Civil Aviation Authority. That is the regulatory authority in Australia. It is an organisation with a hierarchial structure, it is an organisation in which officers at more junior levels are entitled to put views about particular situations to management and, as I have already said, it is an organisation in which on occasions the advice of those more junior officers in the region has been acted on. So to say that there has been a bland brushing off in this chamber of questions which have been put about air safety is incorrect. Questions have been asked and answers have been given. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite correct to say that at the present time the airline system is operating under difficult circumstances. The Government does not retreat from that issue at all, but in those difficult circumstances the responsible authority, the CAA, has been very diligent in ensuring that safety standards have been maintained, although procedures may have been expedited or altered in some minor way in order to cope with a very difficult situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney's second allegation was that somehow this dispute is all the Government's fault because of its political position before the Commission. We have had four or five censure motions or matters of importance in this place about the position in the Industrial Relations Commission, about whose responsibility the air pilots dispute is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not nonsense at all. As Senator Ray said before, all that stuff debases their coinage. That has been part of the Opposition's desperate efforts to manoeuvre some political advantage out of a very difficult situation for the airlines and those associated with them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another allegation which Senator Chaney made was that I was rude to the Opposition yesterday. I want to come back to that because it is of some concern to me. I just want to establish the circumstances in which I was rude to the Opposition. I think that the honourable senator used the word `offensive'. All those words flow readily off his tongue and I am not sure which one he used yesterday or today. That is the substance of the allegation and it is to be found in part of the censure motion itself. It was said that I made despicable allegations of improper motives in the Opposition. I will repeat what I said yesterday lest there be any misunderstanding about this. Everybody in this chamber, Government and Opposition senators alike, are legitimately concerned about air safety issues at all times, but Senator MacGibbon phrased a question regarding an alleged incident at Sydney in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>Is the Minister aware that, despite urgent calls from an alert Sydney traffic control, the pilots persisted with their error? What disciplinary action has been taken against these pilots? Not only could there have been a collision between two commercial airliners with great loss of life, but the accident could have occurred over southern suburban Sydney, possibly over a school, and even more lives could have been lost. </PARA>
<PARA>The despicable allegation that I made yesterday, which I repeat today, was that that was a loaded question, that it was scaremongering calculated to attract a headline somewhere or other, but that it was remote from the truth because the incident which Senator MacGibbon was referring to occurred 50 miles south of Wollongong. There was only one aircraft in the region; there was no possibility of a collision. There was no concern by the Civil Aviation Authority that there was a possibility of a collision. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition senators must understand that the nature of a question is to elicit information; it is not to assert scaremongering remarks like that. It is, in my view, a despicable misuse of Question Time to try to raise a headline somewhere or frighten people. There have been other incidents of this. That is what is objected to by the Government. In respect of every serious question that has been asked and which has sought a serious answer, an answer has been obtained from the Civil Aviation Authority or any other appropriate authority. </PARA>
<PARA> This censure motion has two parts. Firstly, it says that the Opposition is more concerned about air safety than anybody else. In the six weeks of the air pilots dispute we have tried everything in the chamber: we have tried backing the pilots and backing away from the pilots; we have tried backing the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and backing away from the Commission. Every week it has been a case of to and fro. Every week there has been a different tactic but none of them has worked. The Opposition has had a golden opportunity to prove its industrial relations policy. It has failed. It has done nothing that has been of any interest in terms of the very difficult situation in the airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> This week has been safety week. So we have had a whole series of questions about safety and those questions have been answered. The understood procedure in Question Time is that one asks a question and one gets an answer either the same day or the next day. But the real nub of this censure motion is that I got up Senator Chaney's nose yesterday by telling him that 21 per cent of the business community say that they understand and approve of the Liberal Party industrial relations policy. After seven weeks of the pilots strike he has a golden opportunity to explain it all. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not for a moment retreat from what I said about Senator MacGibbon. It is all very well to have legitimate concerns about issues and I am sure that there are plenty of Opposition senators and people on the Government who do. The Opposition has no monopoly of concern about many of these issues. But to try to turn concerns into fears and headlines in the course of a question is the sort of thing which I object to and find despicable. I will probably get another censure motion tomorrow for saying, as I did yesterday, that I find that sort of conduct reprehensible. Well, we will be ready for it when it comes. Perhaps tomorrow the honourable senator will have another document-a bit of new material. But this censure motion should be rejected because, in the current circumstances, it is ridiculous. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do not support this censure motion. As the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) has already said, it is scaremongering. It is cheap scaremongering. If we ask any comedian how to make a quick joke the comedian will tell us, `Make a joke about flying' because people are afraid of flying. They are afraid of getting their feet off the ground. It is a basic fear. One of the reasons that our pilots are paid so much and are considered God-like is that people who do not fly very much want to consider these pilots as someone above the mortal plane so that they can take care of their lives in the air. The fact is that Bob Newhart has made a profession out of fear of flying jokes and now the Opposition has tried to hang on to this coat-tail and sell its scaremongering on the subject of safety. In fact, flying is 400 times safer than driving a car. More people are killed in bathtub accidents than in flying accidents. Flying is basically a safe operation and it is still safe in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we are seeing is the Opposition buying into a fight between the conservative old guard bureaucrats in the Civil Aviation Authority and the reform minded CAA leadership. As Senator MacGibbon would agree, the CAA has been a turgid and constipated bureaucracy fraught with rules and regulations. The new CAA, over the last 12 months, has been trying to break through this morass of red tape and get Australia flying safely, and that is the bottom line-safety. The old time bureaucrats have been hiding behind this shibboleth of safety and building their empires on the basis of `safety'. But these rules are not safe; they are not necessarily safe. I have read the letters that Senator Chaney has tabled and quoted from. What I see and hear is basically the old guard bureaucrat saying `Hey, we don't want to change our procedures. We like the old procedures. We like that red tape'. Let me tell the Senate how much it takes for a pilot to come here under the old system and fly in Australia. As a commercial pilot I came from the United States to fly in Australia. I was made to go through a student pilot exam, a restricted pilot exam and an unrestricted pilot exam. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many people advised me that I could not do it. An Australian pilot in America can fly on the day that he arrives in America. An Australian pilot in Britain, France or anywhere else can do the same, because the standards of the world are applied. Only in Australia were these standards not applied. The CAA is bringing Australia into line with the rest of the world. Some of these very frightened bureaucrats are using this safety issue and this strike issue to try to preserve their own bureaucratic empires. Frankly, I do not want to go along with that. I do not really think that the Opposition and Senator MacGibbon would like to go along with that, either.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the things that have been mentioned. What about this famous telex? The telex said that an aircraft turned right and did not respond to the radar operator, or whatever it was. I have not really had a chance to read the telex. I would say that that is more a result of this same turgid constipation in our regulations than anything else. From memory, there are 84 standard instrument departures for Sydney airport. That means that each pilot has to go through a great sheaf of literature to figure out how to depart Sydney airport. That is because of the proliferation of regulations. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1J4">Senator SANDERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Four out of Los Angeles, Senator. In fact, the CAA has just sent some representatives overseas to look at this very thing with the goal of simplifying the procedures at Sydney airport. So any pilot, French or not, can get into trouble in Sydney or anywhere else under this system. I have a friend, a commercial pilot, a jet rated pilot who worked for the Hobart flight service. When he flew to Melbourne he would request radar control into Essendon rather than into Moorabbin, the general aircraft field, because it was too complicated-and he was a flight service officer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is the extent of the regulations which exist in this country. The CAA presently is trying to cut through them. Of course it is meeting resistance. People do not like to change their ways. That is really the bottom line of these letters. Now let us take a look at them in some detail; we have heard bits of them. On one page of the first letter which is from Mr Segan, it says:</PARA>
<PARA>We have . . . interpreted the literal translation of Regulations solely to expedite approvals without taking due consideration of the intent of such legislation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He is trying to get it both ways here. He is saying, `We should stick to the regulations', but if we do he does not like it. I think he is protecting his empire directly. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go to another letter which was from Mr Lewino. It is the second letter which has been quoted. It is headed `Report on Ansett Airlines operational standards with particular reference to Ansett Western Australia'. Basically, what this involves is the fact that an experienced BAE146 check pilot, Captain Colin Smith, was brought over from New Zealand to head a program of training. This apparently got up the nose of the local Australian CAA officials. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> The only concern about Captain Smith at that stage was advice from Mr Scaife AGM (SR) in WA, that he had a known history-</PARA>
<PARA>a known history; we should watch his terminology--</PARA>
<PARA>at deliberately breaking rules. In particular, he had been approved to give a demonstration flight at an air show and had exceeded the safety limitation laid down in the approval. </PARA>
<PARA>Wow! Is that not awful? Maybe they gave him permission to do one loop and he did two. It could be on that basis. I have been involved myself in air shows. I know the permission a pilot has to get in air shows and I know they will throw the book at him if he does not follow the letter of the law in the permission they gave him. Once again, this relates to an adherence to regulations. The person who wrote this letter is showing his hate for Captain Smith because Captain Smith is a rule breaker-he once broke a rule at an air show. The letter goes on in that vein. The penultimate page of Mr Lewino's letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> I must also record my assessment of the likely adverse effects of Mr Thomas' decision on staff morale and the reputation of the CAA. The RPT Examiners involved in the safety assurance of airline operational standards have been required to make major adjustments to their normal practices. </PARA>
<PARA>Oh my goodness! We have asked a bureaucrat to make a major adjustment to his normal practices. What a terrible thing! Has a censure motion been launched on that? Long established requirements have been cut back to expedite the return of regular public transport services. Those long established requirements were being cut back anyway, before the airline strike. These people are objecting to having to change their ways and act in a responsible manner towards the taxpayers of Australia. I am sure these people have legitimate concerns in their own minds but to a person who has some familiarity with the aircraft industry I find that they are merely trying to cling to the old ways which have so disadvantaged the airline industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We have an interview, which I did not see, by a Mr Quinn. He said that because of lack of proper maintenance and too many flying hours apparently the CAA has found unacceptable levels of corrosion and cracks. Unacceptable levels of corrosion simply could not happen in the last six weeks. Corrosion is something that happens over a period of years. Here is Mr Quinn running out and saying, `Corrosion because of the airline strike'. What a bunch of nonsense. I will not delay the chamber very much longer but I would like to point out that what we have here is an unholy alliance of the Opposition parties, the airline pilots who, of course, are trying to push their own barrow and some very conservative bureaucrats who simply do not want to change with the time. </PARA>

I suggest we set up a select committee to look into the airline strike in a bipartisan or non-partisan way to examine all the issues, including safety, and perhaps resolve this terrible strike which is so affecting our country. But to narrowly focus on one issue of safety and to do it in the manner in which the Opposition has done is not only non-productive; it is counterproductive.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it a motion to censure Senator Button for his actions in relation to his personal conduct and his lack of responsibility in handling the elements of safety which have been a consequence of the airline pilots strike which is now before Australia. Senator Button has not honoured the trust placed in him by the Australian public in the office he holds. He has not honoured the responsibilities vested in him to seriously maintain the safety of the Australian travelling public. That is the whole burden of our argument. He has been guilty of gross irresponsibility and a dereliction of his professional duties in this matter, and he demonstrated that in that collection of trivia that passed for the speech that he made in his own defence this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me deal very briefly with that speech. It arose out of an answer to a question that I asked on Tuesday. Yesterday Senator Button came into the Senate and gave a nonsensical answer. It was nonsensical-I quote from the Hansard pinks-in that Senator Button said, `The aircraft had planned to fly from Wollongong via Shelley, to Corryong and thence to Melbourne'. Now there are only four standard instrument departures off runway 16 at Sydney. Two go via Wollongong; two go via Shelley. One cannot be in two places at the same time. One cannot be going east and west simultaneously. That answer, which obviously came from the Department of Transport and Communications, was either the product of ignorance or intentionally designed to mislead. Senator Button is guilty of misleading the Senate with that fatuous answer. </PARA>
<PARA> In his speech Senator Button attacked the members of the Senate who raised legitimate questions about safety. He said, `This motion this morning is not about safety; it is about the abuse of the Opposition'. That is not our case at all. He went on to say that the document expresses some concerns raised within the Department. I agree, and we agree, that the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has been placed under enormous stress through the pilots strike, but the important thing that concerns the Opposition is that the Civil Aviation Authority has failed under those stresses. That is, it has failed to maintain the standards of safety for the Australian public, which is its raison d'etre. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button dealt with the letter by Mr Lewino, the Assistant Regional Director of the Victorian-Tasmanian division of the Civil Aviation Authority. Senator Button claimed it was centred on the certification of British Aerospace pilots as check captains for British Aerospace 146 aircraft. If Senator Button takes the time to read Mr Lewino's letter he will find that that is not the central point of the argument at all. He made the point that the Civil Aviation Authority is changing, that it is more concerned with the outcomes of safety than the means of getting there. We have no quarrel on this side of the Parliament with the need for change within the Civil Aviation Authority. But we object violently when that change is brought about as a result of political pressure by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) looking after his mates, Mr Harris and Sir Peter Abeles, and the airlines that they represent. We do not mind change if it is reasoned and rational but we object very much to the sheer political pressures that have been placed on the Civil Aviation Authority to bring about change. </PARA>
<PARA> The thing that really infuriated Senator Button and caused him to lose control totally in the chamber yesterday was my allegation that an accident could have happened. Senator Button, that is where-he is laughing as I say this-this charge sticks. He has no sense of responsibility. He is a pygmy in that regard. He does not recognise the responsibilities vested in him in the office he holds. Accidents happen. The tragic thing about what is happening in Australia today is that the system that prevents our having accidents is being debased by this Government. In other words, the tragedy that could befall us is quite preventable. It is the dereliction of duty by Senator Button and his colleagues in the Cabinet that is the really shocking thing about what is happening today. The Opposition believes that there is abundant evidence that the safety of the Australian travelling public has been put gravely at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> Neither I nor Senator Chaney is censuring Senator Button for his lack of knowledge about the Civil Aviation Authority. We do not mind that he does not know the details of questions. I recognise more than anyone the arcane, Byzantine world of the Civil Aviation Authority. It is like no other authority in Australia. It deals with aviation and has its own sets of rules, its own procedures, which are not paralleled in any other form of activity within this country. Unless one has been exposed to them, and unless one has worked under them, one simply does not understand how the aviation regulatory system in this country works. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been interested in aviation all my life and I have been a pilot for more than 25 years. I have owned aircraft for over 20 years. I have always tried to understand and become involved with the regulatory functions through the Department of Aviation, the Department of Civil Aviation and now the Civil Aviation Authority. I do not pretend to have a knowledge that is in any way complete but I do say categorically that I have a better knowledge about how the Civil Aviation Authority works than anyone else in this Parliament. I put on record my respect and admiration for the officers of the Authority who have served under what have been incredibly trying circumstances under this Labor Government. The only censure I have is for its senior officers, who I will come to later. They have not looked after the men and women working for them lower down the line and taking responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole matter of aviation safety is not a matter of legislation. It is a cultural thing. Aviation involves three dimensions, unlike every other form of human activity which involves two dimensions. We have learned some lessons about aviation. We have learnt how to operate safely in the air but it has taken us about 70 years and thousands of lives to learn that. But in this country we can safely move people commercially from one point to another with absolutely minimal risk to their lives and their persons, as our records show.</PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken many times in the 12 years I have been in the Senate on the shortcomings of the Authority. As Senator Sanders said, I am the first to agree that it is grossly overregulated. In many ways it is archaic. That was why I moved that the Senate set up an inquiry into the management and the organisation of the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation. I believe there must be change in the way we regulate our affairs with respect to aviation. I believe it is costing us an enormous amount of money. But the system we have in place is safe even if it is ponderous. I am not an anarchist. Unlike Senator Sanders, I do not want to throw the baby out with the bath water. I want reasoned change in the Authority-a move to simplify and make structures and procedures more efficient-but I want to see safety maintained all the way. I want informed, experienced minds dealing with the regulatory problems in aviation in this country. I do not want any radically anarchistic ideas coming in and destroying a system which, even at its worst, is extremely safe, or it was until this Government moved into the regulatory function purely to protect the commercial interests of its mates in the airline industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequences of what the Government is doing in meddling with the Civil Aviation Authority are quite enormous. I am not exaggerating the devastating effect on the Australian community if two airliners collide, particularly over a capital city. I know it infuriates Senator Button when I say these sorts of things, but I have seen people killed. I have been at accident sites and I have had my friends killed in the air. Accidents do happen. The tragedy is that in nearly all cases they are preventable. What has happened under this Government is that prevention has been denied the Australian public. That is why Senator Chaney and the other speakers on this side of the Parliament are so concerned about what is happening. We have manifest evidence that the safety standards of this country have been abridged and compromised to a very dangerous degree. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to say something about the questions which have been raised in the Senate and which have so infuriated the Australian Labor Party. They were real questions. Everyone asked whether something was true. It is our right to ask whether a certain event occurred. There is nothing wrong with that. But that is not the central point of our argument. The central point of our argument is not whether a French captain got confused and took a standard instrument departure to Shelley when he should have gone to Wollongong. The central point of our argument is that the failure that has occurred in the regulatory functions is putting the safety of the Australian public at risk and that is the consequence of the basest sort of political interference. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me remind the Senate that on Tuesday of this week the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators spoke out on the safety compromises that are now taking place in Australia. The Guild would be totally unknown, I think, to the general public. It is a body that could claim to be the most prestigious body representing airmen in the world. It is a body that never seeks publicity and it never enters into anything which is at all controversial, political or party political. Yet on Tuesday of this week the Australian region of the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators took the quite unprecedented step of speaking out about the dangers inherent in the present regulatory system pertaining to Australian air navigation. </PARA>
<PARA> Questions have been raised in the press about procedures and questions have been raised in the Parliament. The Government has denied that things have happened. Even worse, we have been told that because things have not happened there has not been any inquiry. In all of this, the Government's position has been supported by the Chief Executive Officer of the Authority, Mr Colin Freeland. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to deal for a little while with the Estimates committee procedures in this building on Tuesday night because they provide positive confirmation in the face of the Government assertions that somehow or other the document that Senator Chaney addressed might have been a little slanted. I want to deal with the transcript from Estimates Committee B in relation to a matter which I raised with Mr Thomas, who I believe is in the chamber this morning. He has been brought in as part of the panic move by the Government, to put the best interpretation possible on it. I apologise for taking up some time--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I asked some questions about the issuing of certificates of validation for the French pilots who are flying for Airlines of Western Australia. Let me start at the beginning or it will confuse the simple minds of such people as Senator Collins. I asked initially about the issuing of licences such as aircraft maintenance engineering licences and pilots licences-whether they were issued within regions, Australia is divided into regions on a State basis, or whether it was done centrally. Mr Thomas replied:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Flight crew licences are still issued in the field offices in the regions . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I then said:</PARA>
<PARA>Now, the six French pilots flying for Airlines of Western Australia; where were their licences issued? In Canberra, or in Perth or in Melbourne?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Thomas replied:</PARA>
<PARA>The pilots were issued certificates of validation. Those certificates, I understand, were issued from our Melbourne office. </PARA>
<PARA>The transcript continues:</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why were they not issued from the Perth office?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Thomas-The pilots are flying for Ansett Airlines in Western Australia, and that airline is subject to training and checking control by Ansett in Melbourne, so the normal method of servicing that operator is through our Melbourne office. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are absolutely certain the validation was through Melbourne, not through Canberra?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Thomas-For what?</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The pilots.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Mr Thomas showed great reluctance to answer. The transcript continues:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the French pilots flying for Airlines of Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Then there was a dramatic change:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Thomas-Some of the certificates of validation were issued from Canberra. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why were they issued from Canberra?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Thomas-There was a public holiday in Melbourne on Thursday. They were issued late in the evening of the night before, and there were staff on duty there and not in our Melbourne office at the time. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But some were issued from Melbourne, from what you have said and some from Canberra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>So it goes on. Further on, the transcript reads:</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can you tell the Committee categorically that no-one in the CAA in the Victorian-Tasmanian region refused to issue those certificates?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Thomas-The certificates that were issued for aircraft captains were issued from Canberra and there was a difficulty with the Victorian-Tasmanian region. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What was that difficulty?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Thomas-The Victorian-Tasmanian region field officers were concerned at the checks that were to be performed. They felt that additional checks would be wise. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So you overrode them?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Thomas-Yes. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Thomas-Because the document that had been provided to the airline that specified the requirements for the training of French pilots had been fully complied with. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why did the Victorian group object, then?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Thomas-We are having discussions with them about that. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You can understand an interpretation being placed upon this matter that the laid down procedures were not being followed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>So it goes on. Mr Thomas finally said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Ansett training manual is written to provide a training and checking organisation and to establish the flying standards within the airline. That manual was written some considerable time ago. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to diverge for a moment and talk about operations manuals for airlines. They are absolute law. They have to be compiled before the Department will issue an air operators licence. I have never in my life heard that because a manual was old it was no longer valid. That manual is constantly updated and monitored, but any changes to it have to be made through the Civil Aviation Authority. The point of all this is that it relates very much to the letter by Mr Lewino that was ridiculed by Senator Button. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to the letter of 2 October, the very recent past, from Captain Segan. He opens by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> By now you will be aware of concerns by CAA officers on the erosion of operational standards as a result of decisions made in the light of the extraordinary events of the last six weeks. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>All officers were under considerable pressure from above to review standards and expedite approvals. </PARA>
<PARA>That is absolute proof that pressure had been placed on officers of the Department to bend standards. This statement was made by Captain Segan:</PARA>
<PARA> Our major error was to allow ourselves to be drawn into discussions with airline commercial management-a group who had no knowledge or interest in standards. Their approach was to attack our standards in an attempt to reduce training requirements, and they were successful. Their only negotiating point was the threat of ministerial action. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Bob Hawke and his minions would have dropped directly on the officers of the CAA. There is a lot of information about the way standards were waived and laid down procedures were not followed with respect to in command under supervision requirements for certification of new pilots. Senator Chaney has dealt with that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the certificates of validation, which is a procedure by which foreign pilots can be authorised to fly within Australia. Senator Sanders ridiculed that when he said, `You can go to the United States and be issued with a licence to fly on the same day'. That is perfectly true; that has happened to me. I have held a United States Federal Aviation Administration licence that was issued on the spot, but it was only a private pilot's licence. It was for single-engined aeroplanes and it was for no commercial benefit. The granting of senior airline transport licences, which is what an airline pilot needs, is another matter entirely. Captain Segan said that the issuing of certificates of validation is meant for transitory cases, and is a device to allow foreign pilots limited private, display, ferry or instructional flying without requiring them to undergo full Australian licence examinations. He states-and this is the critical part:</PARA>
<PARA>It was never intended to permit full commercial operations at the highest category of licence by pilots who would normally be expected to have difficulty meeting our standards. </PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely what the French pilots flying with Airlines of Western Australia have been granted. I questioned Mr Thomas about the granting of the certificates during the Estimates Committee hearing. That is of relevance to the news in today's newspapers that the airlines are negotiating long term agreements for the lease of aircraft. Those aircraft will operate with foreign crews, under certificates of validation which are on the statute books to provide short term opportunities for pilots to fly in this country, not to run regular airline services. There was a great deal of discussion in the letter about Captain Smith. In his summary Captain Segan says:</PARA>
<PARA> The events of recent weeks have had a deleterious effect on our ability to set and administer standards for the airline industry. We have:</PARA>
<PARA> granted concessions, for purely political reasons . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Note the words `purely political reasons'. What does that mean? It means that Mr Hawke is looking after his mates again and leaning on the officers. Mr Lewino, the Assistant General Manager (Safety Regulations) in the Victorian-Tasmanian region and also the Assistant Regional Director-a very responsible person-wrote a very detailed letter. Anyone who is interested and has a background in aviation who reads Mr Lewino's letter will realise that it is utterly devastating for the Government and the Department. Senator Collins or Senator Button could not read this and understand its significance. To anyone with a technical background, it is utterly devastating. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>The current pilot dispute has seriously weakened the Ansett operational organisation, despite the fact that a number of more senior operational managers remained with the company. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the things that the Government has been able to suppress with its control of the National Media Liaison Service and the media is the fact that Captain Henry Theinssen, the most respected man in the whole of the Ansett organisation, its chief pilot, its manager of flight operations, resigned over three weeks ago because he told Sir Peter Abeles that he could no longer guarantee minimal safety standards within the Ansett organisation. That has not come out in the press but it is a fact, and it speaks volumes for what is going on in Ansett today. Later on Mr Lewino says:</PARA>
<PARA>A more serious consequence, which has manifested itself over the last week, is that operational managers are becoming fatigued. They are flying to the full limit of flight time and crew duty rules (in one case, over these limits) . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Companies have to have management pilots. There is a management role of seeing that manuals are updated, procedures are followed. It is a full time job. Ansett is driving these people beyond the human limits. It is making them be management pilots, doing the bookwork and the administration, and at the same time flying them to the limits in the air manning aircraft. As Mr Lewino said, over a three-day period from 23 to 25 September, Ansett requested three extensions of flight and crew duty times. That means they flew crews beyond the legal limit. Then there is the matter of Captain Colin Smith. I do not intend to devote any time to that because, while those matters are important, I do not have enough time to put them before the Senate today. There are more important matters to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA> On the third page of Mr Lewino's letter, he makes this statement:</PARA>
<PARA>In return, Mr Thomas advised that Captain Smith and Mr McMahon, Ansett's GM, had contacted him late the previous evening, via Minister Willis' office . . .</PARA>
<PARA>What is Minister Willis doing negotiating on regulatory standards and decisions that are made by the CAA? Why did Mr Willis have his sticky fingers in talking to Mr Thomas, Mr McMahon and Captain Smith? This Government set up the Civil Aviation Authority-primarily to get it off budget-as an independent statutory authority. Under the Act, the Minister cannot direct anything. The CAA is a discrete, independent body in Australia. Yet here we have a statement `via Mr Willis's office'. He was caught red-handed but the Government will say that there is no political pressure, no political gain involved in the debasement of standards at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> The rest of Mr Lewino's letter deals very succinctly with the debasement of standards that is being carried on. Senator Chaney mentioned the sentence which said that Captain Smith sought approval to command an aircraft from the jump seat while he had two inexperienced first officers flying the aeroplane in the left-and the right-hand seat with a full load of unsuspecting, fare paying passengers. Mr Lewino, to his eternal credit, refused that request. On what we have before us, had the request been made at a higher level, we have to consider seriously that it might have been granted. And so it goes. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter that Senator Button raised about the licensing of British Aerospace check captains I view as an irrelevance. I do not think it is important at all. But the question raised by Senator Knowles yesterday on the operations outside controlled air space in Western Australia is mentioned. We have French pilots who do not understand English blundering around there. They can talk to air traffic controllers via the accepted International Civil Aviation Organisation vocabulary or the Australian air traffic controller vocabulary but where they get outside controlled air space there are no air traffic controllers and they are flying into airfields like the many that exist around Western Australia where there are no airfield control zones or anything like that. They have to get on the radio, advise their positions and their intentions. They have all sorts of people, non-professional pilots, coming back at them on the radio. They simply cannot understand it and they have to fly around with English speaking members on the flight deck to tell them what is happening. That is an appalling debasement of standards as we know it in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the saddest parts about this morning's events is the fact that Mr Lewino and Mr Scaife, the Deputy Director for the Western Australian region, will clearly, as Senator Chaney said, have professional bags of cement put around their feet. I am advised that Mr Scaife has been brought by head office to Canberra today to be severely rebuked for his part in this matter and I have no doubt that Mr Lewino will be forced to pay a most severe price for having the integrity to fulfil his professional obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence before us raises the gravest questions about the professional integrity of people like Mr Freeland and Mr Rainbird. Mr Freeland has been on television defending the Government and saying there has not been the slightest debasement or erosion of aviation safety standards. Mr Rainbird was in this building on Tuesday night. He had every opportunity in response to questioning to come clean and inform the Senate. Instead, he chose the devious approach of remaining silent when leading questions were asked. What is going to happen? It is absolutely certain that we are going to have an accident in this country. We have tired pilots exceeding their tours of duty. We have emotional stress in the cockpits where we have strikebreakers flying in Australian aircraft. We have foreign pilots who do not speak the language. We have foreign pilots who do not understand what is happening. In these circumstances an accident is utterly unavoidable, and the tragedy is that it is all preventable if the Government would get its sticky fingers out of it. That is why the Senate finds Senator Button's actions so reprehensible and so deplorable, because the blood will be on Senator Button's hands. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, Senator MacGibbon's concluding remarks in the debate today are utterly reprehensible and he should be condemned for them. It is the kind of outrageous scaremongering that his leader yesterday was forced to attempt to defend him on. There is no excuse that can be offered for any senator, based on the misinformation that Senator MacGibbon particularly, on behalf of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, has provided to the Senate, to make such an appalling statement in such a serious debate, and he stands condemned for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It might be a good idea to go over one or two of the furphies that Senator MacGibbon has placed before this House purporting to be fact. Senator MacGibbon, as I said yesterday, came into this Parliament last week waving a document around that he had been given by the Air Pilots Federation. It was a contract that he said proved that the companies were currently offering a 40 per cent boost to the current conditions under which pilots are employed in this country, 15 per cent more than they were asking for from the airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> Within 10 minutes of examining that document, which I compared with the Ansett contract that I had seen the day before, I discovered, of course, that Senator MacGibbon was absolutely up a tree, as he normally is. People in this House should not be mindless. If people are given documents they should at least take the trouble to examine them and simply not believe the nonsense that their leakers hand them at the same time as the document. When the document was examined it was discovered that the increase that it offered was in fact 6 per cent, not 40-3 per cent now and 3 per cent on 1 April next year, in exchange for a substantial increase in productivity and, I might add, some very important fundamental changes in the conditions under which the pilots were employed. </PARA>
<PARA> As I also said yesterday, the difficulty for Senator MacGibbon and the Opposition in continually going out on a limb for the airline pilots is that every time they stick their necks out on behalf of them, the Pilots Federation pulls the rug out from under them. I also said yesterday, and it is a fact, that having said for two weeks that these contracts offered a 40 per cent boost in their conditions, 15 per cent or more than they were asking for, and having had that line run in here by the Opposition on its behalf, the Federation said on Monday of this week that the contracts were unacceptable because `the contracts took them back to conditions that existed 30 years ago'. It was reported on the national news on Monday. The honourable senator cannot have it both ways. What they were referring to clearly by that statement was the removal of the seniority bidding system. That is exactly right. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, I hope Senator Chaney is not suggesting that he can run a line about a 40 per cent increase and at the same time be silly enough to confine that to the pay section of the contract without looking at all the conditions of the contract. You have actually got to read a contract from the first page to the last where the signatures are. Senator MacGibbon obviously did not bother to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> But in terms of the number of other furphies that he has run, and his scaremongering, he really does need to be pulled up. It is about time his party leadership suggested that he should be a little less extreme in his statements. He put out a statement the other day about a 737 in which he said that the pilots had made serious errors and that there was the risk of a mid-air collision between two jet airliners over Sydney, over schools, et cetera. The fact in that case is, as I have now determined having looked at it yesterday, that the only mistakes that were made were made by the leakers to Senator MacGibbon, not by the pilots. The mistakes were made as a result of the total confusion among members of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, who are continually leaking material to Senator MacGibbon to run his scaremongering tactics in here. </PARA>
<PARA> The airline pilots flying the 737 lodged a flight plan and had that flight plan approved. That flight plan involved flying the route, detailed in this House yesterday, from Sydney to Wollongong to Shelley to Corryong and to Melbourne. That was the flight plan they lodged; that was the route they flew on and they did not deviate from it. The fact is that the pilots of that aircraft made absolutely no errors at all. It is about time that Senator MacGibbon started being just a little bit more responsible in his headlong rush to peddle whatever nonsense the Federation hands him five minutes before he walks in here. He should check the facts first before he frightens the daylights out of the public. He is being totally irresponsible. I might add-it is worth referring to again-that, if people want any evidence of that, they can refer to the final remarks he made in this debate today before he sat down. His remarks were reprehensible and contemptible. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us also look at a few other little furphies that he ran in the debate today. He referred to Captain Theinyssen of Ansett Airlines of Australia, who he said had resigned. The information that I have just been given-I will check it out personally today-is that this officer retired because he had reached the eligible age for retirement. In fact, he was one of the older pilots in the company. He was eligible for retirement and he chose to exercise that right. He retired; he did not resign. I will check that out; I have just been given that information five minutes ago. We will be back in here tomorrow and we will see whether Senator MacGibbon's story stands up. I might add that Senator MacGibbon's track record so far is that he has done nothing but peddle rubbish in this chamber. On every occasion it has been knocked over 24 hours after he has delivered it. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at another piece of gross rubbish: Senator MacGibbon made the charge and the allegation here today that Minister Willis was involved directly in safety issues in consultations between Ansett and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). That is the charge he made, once again as a result of a leak from the Pilots Federation. The pilots led Senator MacGibbon up the garden path on the contracts; they led him up the garden path on the 737; and they have now led him up the garden path on this issue. What are the facts? The fact is that the technical staff of Ansett-I have spoken to the officer who was directly involved in this-wanted to contact Mr Thomas of the CAA, as they need to do from time to time, to discuss an issue late at night. They wanted to short-circuit the process of getting in touch with Mr Thomas to the quickest extent possible as it was late at night. They rang an officer who deals specifically with aviation matters in Mr Willis's office. The Minister was not involved personally at all. The reason they rang the Minister's office, a ministerial officer who deals full time with aviation matters, was to see whether he had a late night contact telephone number for Mr Thomas. That was the extent of the request that was made and that was the extent of the information that was provided. The officer concerned gave the Ansett technical people a telephone number. That was the end of it and, presumably, late on this particular night the Ansett technical people used the telephone number to contact Mr Thomas at his residence. On the basis of that, Senator MacGibbon came in here today and asserted-and the Hansard record will show it-that the Minister has directly involved himself in negotiations and discussions with the airlines on safety issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Senator MacGibbon should withdraw it. He will not do so, of course. No doubt Senator MacGibbon will come in here tomorrow, stand up on his hind legs and deliver the latest piece of nonsense that the Federation has handed him. I suggest to Senator MacGibbon that on the three issues that I have raised so far, it is three strikes and he is out. If he is to retain any kind of credibility in this debate he ought to start vetting a little the information which he is handed by the Federation before he runs it in the chamber. He should also be a little careful that he does not conclude speeches by predicting airline disasters in this country-I am talking about blood on people's hands-based on such nonsense, because there is no excuse for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion, I intend to devote only five minutes to the substantive issue raised in these documents. I have had an opportunity to read the documents from cover to cover and to compare them-that is, the document authored by Mr Lewino and the document authored by Mr Segan. I have to say that the path of the leaking of these documents is known. It was from the Victorian-Tasmanian regional office of the CAA to the Air Pilots Federation and from the Air Pilots Federation to the media and the Opposition. That was the path of the leak and no doubt it led directly to Senator MacGibbon. Having watched him conferencing with his Leader in here he appears again to be the source of this leak. That is fair enough. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the document that Mr Lewino has authored appears to have been written for the purpose of being leaked. The reason I make this statement is that on comparing the references in the first document-that is, Lewino's document-with the same references and issues in the second document one sees a very marked difference between them. Mr Lewino has said some very nasty things in this document about a man called Smith-things which, if this document had been published abroad, are grossly defamatory. There is no question about that. By referring to that I am not impugning Mr Lewino's motives or character in any way. I do not know the man. Obviously the document has been written from serious concern, but it is a fairly sad document when one reads it. Most of the politics appear to be internal CAA politics between Central Office and its regional offices. That is not something that comes new to me. I am very familiar with the operations of the CAA because of my involvement, not as a pilot but as a frequent passenger and a person who knows a great many pilots socially and professionally. </PARA>
<PARA> I made the point yesterday that regrettably I have been involved in many incidents involving people turning at places where they should not have turned, which did not in fact happen in the case of the 737-Senator MacGibbon got it wrong-and involving maintenance failures. The point I made yesterday was that I was involved in those incidents over a period of years when there was no strike on by the Air Pilots Federation. I thought that point was made very succinctly in this debate this morning by Senator Sanders. I rarely agree with Senator Sanders, but this morning I was absolutely ad idem with him. I respect his knowledge in this area. He is quite right about the mass of regulations which control the CAA and the aviation industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend to all honourable senators, if they have never read it, a document authored by another Australian I admire greatly, and that is Dick Smith. I have enormous respect for Dick Smith. I commend to honourable senators his `hall of doom' document which he prepared some years ago on his frustrations in dealing with the Department. I mention that because I am pleased to see in these documents a reference to what is going on in the CAA, which is an attempt, in fact, to streamline its procedures-it has nothing to do with the airline pilots dispute-so that the end product of the procedures becomes the main point rather than the steps that are taken to achieve it. I suppose it is consistent with the program budgeting arrangements that we are bringing in; it is the same kind of approach. There are, of course, many officers in that monolithic organisation who no doubt are concerned and upset about the changes that are being made to streamline these procedures. But in going back to Mr Lewino's document, I just note a couple of things that stand out. There are references to people looking as though they `have aged years' and to people who have `a known history at deliberately breaking rules'. They are very personal references. They are all through this document. Take this one, for example:</PARA>
<PARA>I sent Mr Moss along as he developed over the years a proven ability to detect liars. </PARA>
<PARA>Now he does not actually say that Captain Smith is a liar, but the deliberate use of that kind of expression associated with complaints about Captain Smith gives the reader a deliberate impression that that is precisely what he is talking about and I am sure that that impression was meant to be deliberate. </PARA>
<PARA> He goes on to make another personal reference to Captain Smith. In fact, I will not read it out. That is the third. He then says again:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Captain Smith lacked the maturity and judgement . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is all the way through this document. The reason I point that out is that if we go to the second document, which refers to the same issue, we find there a far more measured and a far less personal approach-even though the complaint is there and the concern is there. I might add that its concern is delivered in just as effective a manner as the concern that these people had about Mr Smith, which leads me to a belief about this, knowing as I do the path of the leaks. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, I might make one final reference to nail down the concern that I have about this first document. I noted this reference:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Rainbird made reference on several occasions to the high workload I had been under since the pilots dispute started. I gained the impression he thought my judgement was distorted as a result of this. Also, that my differences with Captain Smith were known to everybody from the ``Prime Minister on down''. </PARA>
<PARA>There are deliberate references to politics, the Prime Minister, liars and so on. Such references pepper this first document and, as I said, it is a sad document. Obviously Mr Lewino did not like being crossed by the central office and overriden by the central office and he has got his rocks off in this document well and truly. He has really sat down and delivered a fair bit of bile. I am not saying that perhaps the circumstances that precipitated this brief were not in some way conducive to that, and perhaps the high workload that he is suffering under is conducive to that, but I think the document would have been far more effective if at least half of the personal references had been left out. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that this document, if it is given wide circulation, is going to do some considerable professional damage to one person. I, unfortunately, I guess like a number of members of this chamber, have had an unwelcome familiarity with the defamation laws of this country-on three occasions, on one side or the other. I know from my personal experience that one of the most serious defamations that you can make about any person, and rightly so, is a statement impugning that person's professional ability in terms of capacity to earn a living from a job. There is no doubt that-and I must say this with some regret-whereas the second document makes the same points very effectively about concerns about this particular person, the first document is in fact grossly defamatory. I regret that it is now out in wide circulation in the public domain because presumably Captain Smith will not have the opportunity of tracking down every single one of these copies to try to put his case, and I regret that. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn finally to the substantive issue involved in both of these documents-the procedures that were adopted in checking out the French captains on these aircraft that are concerned, the BAE146 aircraft which I have had the pleasure to fly on to Western Australia on a number of occasions. The reality is that Mr Lewino's main concern centred around the fact that British check pilots, that is, pilots employed by the company that manufactures these aircraft, did the final checks on the French pilots on these aircraft. The facts are that the Ansett Melbourne chief check pilot did go to Perth on 28 September and he did re-check the French pilots. This was in accord with what Mr Lewino himself wanted and I imagine it has allayed any concerns that Mr Lewino may have had. So, all of a sudden, where is the Opposition's censure motion issue? It has disappeared. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one further point about the comments made in these two documents: the pilots concerned who did the final checks are the BAe pilots themselves-they know more about this aircraft than any other pilots in the world. We can take this one step further. The pilots concerned, the check captains who carried out these final checks, were the same check captains who introduced this aircraft to Australia; they were the same check captains who in fact participated in writing the manual for the operations of these aircraft in Australian airspace. Not only were the final BAe check captains who were used more knowledgeable about the type of aircraft involved than any other pilot in the country-in fact, the Ansett captains who carried out the final checks were personnel that these people had trained-but they were the same pilots who had personally assisted in writing the operations manuals for the operations of these aircraft in Australian conditions. To suggest on that basis that the Australian public has been put at risk by these procedures is really drawing a very long bow indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe-and I direct these remarks particularly to the Leader of the Opposition in the chamber who will sum up on behalf of the Opposition-that concerns about air safety are not just legitimate but should be canvassed in this Parliament. They are concerns that I personally am extremely sensitive to. Concerns about air safety, based on factual information, should in fact be the basis for censure motions. But I do say, Mr Acting Deputy President, that statements by Senator MacGibbon that there was an imminent risk of a mid-air collision of two aircraft over Sydney, that there will be an airline disaster in the near future in Australia and that blood will be on the hands of the Government as a result, are outrageous and are not justified at all by any of the evidence that has been delivered in this Parliament today. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude in terms of nailing that down by referring to the final paragraph of the second leaked document tabled by Senator MacGibbon in which the officer concerned-even though, I must say, I think factually he is wrong in a number of the points he makes-talks about a breakdown of CAA communications which he says can, in fact, be repaired by fairly simple procedures, as he sees them, applied in the CAA to redress this issue. I would compare the measured, reasoned and careful response of this officer with the outrageous scaremongering, based presumably on the same issues, of Senator MacGibbon. I would ask the honourable senator for the sake of the Opposition's credibility and his own credibility in terms of his continued representation in this Parliament of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, to cease and desist. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not take up too much time of the Senate. However, in view of what is happening in this country, I believe that I should participate in this debate. Contrary to what Senator Collins just told us, I believe that incidents involving aircraft around Australia are on the increase. I am worried about the lack of concern that this Government has for airline safety. One of the offshoots of Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines not being able to operate is that the smaller airlines are experiencing heavy loadings. I use small airlines in Western Australia on a regular basis when travelling between my home town and the city. I would like to relate, in the short time available, certain incidents that have taken place. These pilots that I see regularly are getting tireder and tireder every day. They jump off a plane which has come from, say, Carnarvon, get straight into a different plane and go off somewhere else. Unfortunately, added to that workload for those experienced pilots, planes are being changed around and so are the pilots on those planes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My experience has been that one goes to a corner in the terminal at Perth, where the pilot calls the passengers-there are seven or eight on each flight-and away they go together. One day, as I walked out I said to the pilot, `I have never seen you before', and he introduced himself. When we got outside to the plane I said, `I've never seen this plane before'. He said, `It's on charter but that's okay'. Mind you, there is nothing wrong with putting pilots and planes on a new run. Sooner or later a pilot has got to go to a new area. But normally on this particular airline-a small airline-and other airlines, there is an experienced pilot on that route and on the plane who is used to the approaches without air traffic controllers at the other end. </PARA>
<PARA> On this day, we got into the place but were short of seats at the back. The pilot asked me, `Would you like to sit off-side?'. I said, `Yes, I'd love to. I do so every time I can'. As we readied to leave the terminal he looked over his shoulder and called out to the people down the back, `Have you shut the door down there?'. My confidence was starting to take a bit of a dint. He had locked the door next to me. The pilot was on one side, I was on the other and the door was next to me. I am glad Senator Walsh has come into the chamber because he was in an incident over Bass Strait once. He evidently does not remember that incident but we will remind him later. We pulled out to the beginning of the main runway. When the pilot got his clearance, off we went. I was watching the instruments, and we were just ready to take off when my door flew right open. Fortunately, I had the harness fastened, as one is always supposed to do, and I did not fall out. The pilot was able to cut his engines and we had plenty of runway on which to pull up. He got on the two-way radio to the control tower making explanations. He then leaned over me and banged the door about five times, which showed the lack of maintenance on these aeroplanes, with all the loading that is taking place. Finally he got it shut and locked. Then he went back to the runway and stopped half way down it. I thought, `My God, if the same thing happens we will be off the end of the runway before he can pull up'. </PARA>
<PARA> Anyhow, we got going the second time and flew out to home, which takes an hour and a quarter. We were coming into a strange airport for the pilot. We came in in the middle of the airport. Normally the pilots come in at one end or the other, depending on which way the wind is blowing, then do a three-quarter turn to see that there are no stray stock or stray vehicles or the odd road grader on the runway-home being a country town-and whether it is safe to land. On his third time around the airstrip the pilot came down. He was flying the plane, of course, and I was not game to say anything, but he came down on the cross-strip. </PARA>

I have flown a lot in small planes and these incidents are building up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to pick up a couple of points that have been raised by other speakers. Senator Sanders-and I take him to be an experienced former military pilot-told us about pilots coming from overseas. He commented, and others have commented, about the incident in Sydney, when a plane took a wrong turn. There was no danger to safety. He said, `There was no other plane there'. I presume that the air traffic controllers checked the space after a plane took the wrong turn and not before it. The fact that there was no other plane there, I believe, was more good luck than good judgment. Of course, if there had been another plane there, as there could have been, there could have been an accident of the dimensions that Senator MacGibbon pointed out yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, it is no different for a plane to take a wrong turn than it is for a bus, a motor car, or a heavy highway vehicle to do the same thing. In other words, contravening road laws can lead to accidents. Honourable senators may have read or heard about the buses in Adelaide last week. Obviously one bus was in the wrong place while the other bus was there legally, and there was an accident. Fortunately there was no loss of life. Senator Sanders mentioned that pilots coming from overseas take up to six months to be certified in Australia and I believe that that should continue. We have got the best safety record in the world and I believe that we should keep it that way. </PARA>
<PARA> I finish on the point that was made about scaremongering. Senator MacGibbon pointed out what could have happened over Sydney-I am not familiar with Wollongong-but he was accused by Senator Button and Senator Collins of scaremongering. Can you tell me, Mr Acting Deputy President, of any road safety program that does not use scaremongering tactics? Any material put out shows vivid pictures of accidents on the roads, I believe with some good results. When it comes to scaremongering to improve road safety and obeying the rules of the road, I believe it is best remembered when you scare yourself. </PARA>
<PARA> I can remember an incident in my own life over 20 years ago. It involved a railway line that has now been pulled out. I was breaking one of the unwritten rules of the road that you keep your eyes on the road. I was being inattentive. My mind and my eyes wandered. I came around a bend on a country road that I had come around a thousand times before and since, and I heard a railway engine whistling at me. I looked up and there were the lights going and the engine was just over there. I did not know whether to pull up or to try to get in front of it; so I went for the brakes and I stopped about one metre short. It took me about 10 minutes to have the courage to drive to the other side of the railway line and pull off the road. That improved my driving 1,000 per cent. That line was pulled out over 20 years ago. The incident occurred in 1968 when the standard gauge went through, but every time I drive past that crossing, which is an average of three times a week, my hair still stands on end, even though there is no longer a crossing. So I believe a bit of scaremongering on safety-in the air or on the road-does not go astray. If Senator MacGibbon did use scaremongering, I think it might have some good effect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened to this debate. In some ways Senator Panizza has made one of the finest contributions because he has really indicated what this debate is all about. It seems that the Opposition wants to use scaremongering tactics to make everybody more conscious of safety. That is in effect what he was saying. I have always understood that a censure motion is moved when a Minister or, indeed, a member, has been so derelict in his or her duty that the disapproval of his or her peers should be formally registered. That convention, I put it to the Senate today, has been corrupted. Having listened to the debate, it certainly has not been established that such behaviour has occurred on this occasion. It has not been suggested that a Minister has grossly and deliberately misled Parliament or has acted in such a gross and reckless way that the disapproval of his peers should be visited upon him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Evidence has been given by way of anecdote, by way of leaked documents, and that evidence has been interpreted by different people in different ways. There is no doubt that air safety is a vital, essential and crucial issue for this Parliament to debate, but we have not been debating that today. What we have been debating is a motion of censure which seems to have lost its way amongst a series of anecdotes, a series of stories about people's personal experiences. I ask the mover of the motion to indicate how the anecdotes-and, as I say, Senator Panizza's contribution eloquently typified the style of the debate so far-can be related to a motion which should be one of the most solemn and serious procedures used in this chamber. It is clearly going to be defeated, and so it should be, because there is no substance to it. In addition, it should be defeated because it amounts to an abuse of process of the instruments of this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA> This issue of air safety is one on which Australia has prided itself. I do not have to canvass all of the questions that have been raised in this and other debates, but I will refer to the question of whether it is appropriate for the censure motion to be worded in the way that it is. I do not claim the right to be consulted about measures such as this. But had I been consulted on this particular measure I would have suggested that there was one further step that the Opposition could have taken prior to taking what I believe is a very serious measure, and that is moving a censure motion. Thus, it is my view that this is premature and it is not my intention at this stage to support the censure motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-The Senate has been debating a censure of the Leader of the Government, Senator Button, for:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . his failure to give proper consideration to concerns about air safety raised by the Opposition in light of grave concern at senior levels of the Civil Aviation Authority about current procedures and standards and condemns the Minister for his despicable allegation of improper motives and scaremongering in the Opposition's questioning of safety issues arising from the pilots' dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>The context of this debate is very clear from the contributions which have been made both by those who have supported the motion and by those who are opposed to it. The Minister again conceded in his contribution to the debate that the system is under stress. Of course we have been given clear notice by the airlines, and indeed by the Government, that that stress will continue. For quite a long time the Australian airlines system, according to the Government, according to the airlines, will be a stitching together of regular airline services with charter services, the use of the armed forces and the use of all sorts of fillers which will enable some proportion of the traffic to be transported. We have a system which is under stress and in the view of the Opposition-we have been saying this for a very long time, before these documents from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) appeared in the public arena-it is important that the issue of safety be given careful consideration during this period of stress. Senator Panizza gave an anecdotal example of the difficulties which are being found by people using the air services. What we are seeking, and have been seeking, from the Government is the clearest possible assurance that all proper safety measures are being followed. </PARA>
<PARA> Until yesterday, the Opposition had been raising matters on the basis of reports, some public, some private, of incidents, difficulties, shortening of procedures and the telescoping of procedures which normally apply to the certification of pilots and aircraft. Of course the whole complexion of the debate is changed by the leaking of documents from the Civil Aviation Authority itself, documents not leaked directly to the Opposition, which show a high degree of disquiet and concern on the part of senior officers of that Authority. I indicated during the opening debate that I would seek leave of the Senate to table the documents to which I was referring, and Senator Button intervened by way of interjection to suggest that there were matters in the reports which should not be tabled. For that reason I withheld the seeking of leave to table the documents and I subsequently, at his request, conferred with the officials who are here advising him. They have specifically requested the deletion of one portion of the report of Mr Segan. I have deleted from the documents which I now seek to table, two paragraphs on page 4 of Mr Segan's report. I do that out of deference to the request of the Department and the Minister. I therefore seek leave to table the document in that slightly mutilated form. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Mr President, I am a little puzzled by the request, I must say, because there does seem to be considerable overlap in the two documents between what has been deleted and what is there, but I have conferred with you and I accept that there is a desire to prevent an injustice to any particular individual.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The complaint which we make about the Government and the complaint which we make about the Leader of the Government is the failure to give proper consideration to concerns which have been raised by the Opposition. The basis of that complaint is the blandness of the assurances we have received day after day from the Government when these matters have been raised. I think that the proper test to apply with respect to whether or not the Government has acted with responsibility is to ask whether the answers which have been given would have been given in the same form if the Ministers had known that this information would become public. I think that is a fair test. If we had had that additional information, would the assurances have been in the bland form in which they have been fed to us? I think the answer to that is clearly no. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had some very interesting debate in here about the politics and Byzantine regulations of the Civil Aviation Authority-the successor to the Department of Civil Aviation. It has a tradition which I think flowed from the people who came out of the Air Force in World War II. It is a very longstanding institution which has grown and has eventually wound up as the Civil Aviation Authority. I accept that it is probably extraordinarily bureaucratic and hidebound in a number of ways. </PARA>
<PARA> But this is not a debate about that. It is not a debate about the reform of those regulations because this is not the appropriate context in which to be forcing reforms to safety procedures. It is an entirely inappropriate context. If the Opposition were asked to join with the Government in an approach to ensuring aviation safety which is less bureaucratic and avoids some of the defects which have been identified by a number of people in the debate-Senator MacGibbon would, I suppose, be one of the Opposition senators most intimately concerned with these matters-it would, I am sure, agree that there is room for reform and change. But the serious allegation in these documents is that the changes are occurring not simply in a quest for efficiency but because there are particular stresses on the system which require to be met. What these documents suggest is a shaving of standards-using one of the expressions in the documents-under political and economic pressure. That is a matter which is of concern to the Opposition and I think it requires clear answer and consideration by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> What we require of the Government, and what I think the Government should properly have done in its approach to this, is that it identify the fact that there are significant doubts within its own administration about the administration of safety standards during the current dispute and to ensure that there is a proper examination of that so the public can be fully reassured on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button tried to trivialise this matter, as he always does. It is one of his attempts to be disarming-by ignoring his responsibilities as a Minister and suggesting that the Opposition was simply complaining because he had been rude, which was quite true. I never used the expression that he had been rude. But if he wants to make a point of it, he was rude. He is always rude when he is crossed. That is part of his character. The point which is made in the motion is that he has made an allegation of improper motives on the part of the Opposition which is both unparliamentary and certainly unjustified on the facts in this case. Whenever we have raised the issue of safety, he has accused us of scaremongering. We say that clearly the safety issue is of vital importance and the time to be concerned about it is before an accident, not after. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been complaint about some of the things that have been said in the debate. Let me put it in my own words: the time for us to raise our concerns and the time for the Government to ensure those concerns are baseless, if that can be established, is before there is an incident which would lead us all to regret any inaction on the part of the Government, the Opposition or the Civil Aviation Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a debate about the internal politics of the CAA. It is a matter of supreme indifference to me, in the context of this debate about safety, whether there is an internal political problem within that organisation. What I say is that significant officials within the organisation suggest that politics have overridden proper safety considerations. Commercial considerations-the pressure to get planes in the air-have overriden proper safety considerations. These are very serious allegations. They supplement, complement, the anecdotal matters which have been brought to the Government's attention time and again by the Opposition over recent weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> If there are to be changes made in the way the Civil Aviation Authority is administered they should be made on their merits and not under the pressures of this dispute. We have an airline system which is probably now unique in the world. It will apparently remain in that unique condition for a long time. It is a cobbled-together airline system; it is made up of disparate and, it seems to me, often ill-fitting-together elements. It is causing people who are involved in the aviation industry to operate on a higher level of stress than people who are concerned with good management would think to be wise. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had a Government response on these issues which is contemptuous of any suggestion that the Government should be concerned. The leaking of these documents last night is ample evidence that the Government should have embarked on the strongest and strictest inquiry into the sorts of issues that the Opposition has been raising. The response has been totally inadequate and we believe this is an utterly appropriate occasion when, to use Senator Cooney's words, a Minister has been so derelict in his duty as to deserve the censure of his peers. I commend the motion to the Senate. I believe the Leader of the Government should be condemned for his cavalier attitude to this important matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance and Minister representing the Treasurer. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to an article appearing in last week's Business Review Weekly magazine on the subject of pay packages for chief executives in Australia? Would it be true to say that the present capital gains tax is essential to ensuring that such packages bear a proper rate of income taxation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see the article and I must confess that I have not studied it in any great detail. But it is perfectly clear of course. It is clear, even if one did not refer to that particular article, that the answer to the second part of the question is yes; that is, it is essential that the present capital gains tax be retained to ensure that proper taxes are paid. The article refers to senior executives receiving a component of their remuneration which is dependent upon their staying with companies for a considerable period. I understand that five years is a common period. They are know colloquially, I believe, as `golden handcuff' arrangements. They often take the form of paper assets. Under the current capital gains tax legislation the real capital gains would be taxable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the capital gains tax is to be watered down, as some people have proposed, and specifically, if it is to be phased out at 20 per cent per year for each year in which an asset is held, at the end of five years, obviously, a capital gain on a particular asset becomes totally tax free. Were that change to be made to the capital gains tax legislation it would clearly provide a very big incentive for company executives to arrange their remuneration so that they received capital assets under golden handcuff arrangements, which they would then hold with the company for five years, thus completely evading the capital gains tax and, of course, evading the spirit of the income tax law. Traditional, ordinary taxpayers would have to pick up the bill for that.</PARA>
<PARA> The article also pointed to one chief executive in an Australian company who gets over two-thirds of his pay package in that unique way. I have spoken about this before-the 1c paid shares which the Chairman of Elders-IXL Ltd, Mr Elliott, picks up. According to that Business Review Weekly article, the recent one for six bonus issue of shares in Elders-IXL was worth nearly $6 1/2m to its chief executive. The dividend on those shares which he has already picked up is more than an extra $1 1/2m. The Opposition's long awaited tax and spending policy is due to be released next week. If that proposal to phase out entirely capital gains taxation for an asset which is held for five years is contained in the policy, we will know at whose instigation and for whose benefit that major rort of the taxation law will have been inserted in the Opposition's policy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, he means change sides in the Liberal Party, Senator. Only someone with no knowledge of this dispute would read much into the pilots' press statement of yesterday. From the outset of this dispute, the fundamental issue has been the Pilots Federation's insistence on negotiations outside the wage fixing principles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The offer to which Senator Stone referred was communicated in yesterday's press release by Mr McCarthy. In that press release he went out of his way to say that the AFAP continued to refuse to negotiate within wage fixing guidelines. That press release also refers to basing the minimum 55 hours flight time, plus overtime, on the previous award. Of course it is the previous award which grew like topsy, largely under conservative governments, which is the real vice in this whole issue. That award allows for flight time to be credited without any actual flying taking place. So large wage increases are possible without productivity gains.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Financial Review this morning quotes the airlines as saying that this so-called new position represents in excess of a 30 per cent to 35 per cent claim. I believe the Pilots Federation put out a position it knew to be unacceptable in a further attempt to gain some media advantage. It appears it may have fooled the Opposition, although if this morning's newspapers are any guide it has not fooled anybody else. The matter is currently before the Commission and last Friday Mr Justice Maddern expressed a prima facie view that an award could be made based on the airlines' new pilot contracts. Whether the pilots become a party to that award will depend on whether they become a part of the award making process. If they do the Commission has indicated that it may make them a party to the award.</PARA>
<PARA> The Pilots Federation will be in a position to put its current position to the Full Bench, which should be convening shortly to consider a report from Commissioner Paine. Once an award is set up it will be up to individual pilots to decide whether they wish to be employed under these conditions. Naturally, Mr President, the Government hopes that a large number of these highly skilled workers, as the air pilots are, will elect to contribute, as they have in the past, to national prosperity and the solution of many of the problems to which Senator Stone adverts particularly-and I understand this-on behalf of constituents he has in north Queensland, for example. But the point has to be made, as it has been consistently made, that, given expected productivity improvements and pilot recruitment so far, there will be significantly fewer jobs for previous pilot employees. In any event, the airlines will rebuild with the clear objective of providing a better service more efficiently. The airlines have in the last few days put out public releases about their increasing capacity and about the schedules which they are now able to provide. I hope that continues.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Dr Kim Jin-Yeop is an Australian citizen who was arrested on 4 September in Pusan, South Korea, allegedly for dealings with a North Korean agent in Korea. Dr Kim has been working at the Il Shin Presbyterian Hospital in Pusan since his arrival in South Korea in April 1989. Wider ramifications of this case have assumed a certain notoriety in Korea and have led to a number of arrests. The Government understands that relations with North Korea are a matter of great sensitivity in the south and has no wish to interfere in the Republic of Korea's judicial process. At the same time the Government has been concerned about the circumstances of Dr Kim's arrest and has made these concerns known both to Korean authorities in Seoul and to the Korean Embassy in Canberra. The present position is that Dr Kim is still under investigation for alleged breach of the Korean national security law and that a formal charge is still to be laid. The Australian Embassy in Seoul meanwhile has been closely monitoring Dr Kim's welfare. The Australian Consul has already paid a number of visits to Dr Kim and this has enabled him to be satisfied both as to Dr Kim's health and as to his immediate welfare. Dr Kim himself has volunteered that he has no complaints about his treatment in custody. I think honourable senators may be assured that the Government will continue its active interest in Dr Kim's situation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator McMullan would probably know, last night in Sydney I attended the launch of the Australian business support for the arts group. That question was certainly raised at that function by quite a number of people from various disciplines in the arts. The reality is that during the last few years there has been fairly substantial cost-cutting by government. The arts has been immunised, if you like, and quarantined from that, and in the end has survived and flourished at least in terms of government support. Having said that, it should also be noted that while support from the Government is over $60m per annum, it is estimated that last year business support for the arts right across Australia was somewhere around $30m, which would place funding from this source a long way behind that given in comparable countries through Europe and North America. Part of the charter of the group that was set up last night is to make sure that there is a proper data base so that business can know just where sponsorships might be needed. I would have thought that this information would be of great assistance to both business and the arts.</PARA></TALK.START>

If we are to be able to better and more loudly proclaim those things which make us Australians, perhaps the private sector's time has come.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is very anxious to bring the national corporations legislation passed by this Parliament into force at the earliest possible date. Most parts of the Australian Securities Commission Act commenced on 1 July this year. Honourable senators would know that Mr Tony Hartnell has been appointed Chairman. This will enable the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) to set up the necessary infrastructure to properly administer the Corporations Act. Relevant parts of that Act will not be proclaimed, of course, until the Government is informed that the ASC is ready to administer the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators would know that the States of New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia issued writs challenging the constitutional validity of the legislation in the High Court. Directions hearings have been held with a view to narrowing the issues for determination by the Court. Queensland announced on 3 October that it was withdrawing from the High Court challenge, leaving New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia to argue the case.</PARA>
<PARA> The parties have settled on two questions for determination by the Court. The first asks whether the Commonwealth's attempt to legislate for the incorporation of companies, including shelf companies, is valid. The second questions the validity of sections 112 and 113 of the Corporations Act which prohibit outsize partnerships and the incorporation of trading corporations under State or Territory law instead of the Corporations Act. The Commonwealth has agreed that if the High Court rules against it on the first question it will not proclaim those parts of the Corporations Act that relate to incorporation, internal management and winding up.</PARA>
<PARA> To answer the question more directly, the main factor which will determine the date of proclamation of the legislation will be the readiness of the ASC to administer it. Mr Hartnell has indicated that he anticipates the starting date for full operation of the ASC will be 1 July 1990.</PARA>

I refer the Minister to the decision by the Australia to Europe Shipping Conference to impose a $200 surcharge on every container shipped between Europe and Sydney. Is it a fact that this charge has been imposed because of the persistent and outrageous delays to shipping, averaging almost two days per vessel, caused by the gross inefficiency of the Sydney waterfront? Is the Minister aware that shippers put this cost at about $30,000 per day per ship and that this year such losses already amount to about $18m-that is, for the shippers; let alone the trucks that are queued there all day and night? Is it a fact that Sydney now joins Genoa as one of the few world ports to have a congestion surcharge, an honour usually reserved for Third World countries? Has the Government considered yet the report of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority on the so-called in-principle agreement reached on changes to the waterfront? If so, what has the Government decided?

I will direct it to the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health, although the question arises out of the conference on the control of chemical weapons held recently in Canberra. Is the Minister aware that, as long ago as 1969, 80 countries voted to include tear gas agents among chemical weapons banned under the Geneva protocol? Is the Minister aware that mace, the active ingredient of which is chloroacetophenone, or CN, was used last week at Nurrungar against civilian protesters? Is the Minister further aware than CN is an acutely toxic agent which has caused severe and permanent eye damage, acute as well as allergic dermatitis and death, and is probably mutagenic and carcinogenic? Was the agent used to propel the CN at Nurrungar a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)? Will the Minister for Community Services and Health undertake to see that CN, CS gas, as well as other tear gas agents, are banned from use in Australia because they pose an unacceptable risk to the health of those against whom these agents are used?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1759" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="RESOURCES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can confirm the first part of the question. In 1969 in the United Nations General Assembly a resolution on chemical and biological weapons was introduced, calling for accessions to the protocol. It called for `a clear affirmation' that it covered the use in war of all chemical and biological weapons including tear gas and other harassing agents. The resolution was adopted by a vote of 80 to three. Australia, the United States and Portugal were the three that voted against it and there were 36 abstentions. It is now generally accepted internationally, however, that riot control agents are not chemical weapons. The Australian Government's view is that the widespread availability and use of these agents and their relative lack of toxicity and persistence make it impossible to include these agents within the scope of a convention which is to attract widespread adherence and is to be effectively verifiable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Turning to the other parts of the question: I understand that at the recent protest at the Nurrungar base the irritant agent mace was used by a policeman against a protester. I think it is important to say that it was not used by any Commonwealth officer or any member of the Commonwealth Defence Force. My understanding is that it may have been used by an officer of the South Australian police force. I am unable to verify that, so I cannot state it as an unequivocal fact. The allegation is that that was the case, but I have not been able to confirm it with the South Australian police force. The consideration of the effects of this agent is outside the ambit of the Department, so I cannot give Senator Coulter a dissertation on the effects. However, I am able to provide some general information on the toxicology of the active ingredient of mace, which is chloroacetophenone.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not know, in giving Senator Coulter this information, whether the mace used was of a heavy, medium or low concentration. This is just general information and may not apply to the specific mace that was used in the circumstances. CN, also known as mace gas or as a tear gas, is a chemical substance, chloroacetophenone, as I said, and is used as a riot control agent because of its property of causing lachrymation, otherwise known as crying or tears flowing, to persons exposed to it. Eye exposure to CN will result in a burning sensation in the eyes, pain and crying. These effects can last up to 30 minutes or longer. Redness and swelling may continue for one or two days after exposure to CN. Permanent and severe eye injury is possible but is unlikely unless the person has been exposed to very high concentrations of CN. I am unable to say at this stage whether a CFC was used to propel the CN at Nurrungar. In the last question Senator Coulter makes a categorical statement that mace has unacceptable risks to health. I assume he believes that it has mutagenic or carcinogenic properties. I have to say from a health point of view that I do not know whether that is true. But I have asked the relevant authority to investigate that and give me a report, and I will reply to that aspect of the question in due course. I make the point that it is an assertion by Senator Coulter that is not at this stage proven.</PARA>

<PARA>Dear Telecom Customer,</PARA>
<PARA> As you may know, the Canberra telephone network will undergo a major upgrading next year. This means that all Canberra and Queanbeyan telephone numbers will change from six to seven digits in March.</PARA>
<PARA> This change is necessary to ensure that both business and residential customers in Canberra and Queanbeyan will have more telephone codes for future use. You will also have access to the latest technology, such as the new Integrated Subscriber Digital Network (ISDN), which will begin late next year.</PARA>
<PARA> The new dialling arrangements will be introduced to Canberra and Queanbeyan-the (062) area-in conjunction with the 1990 telephone directory next March. And Telecom has conducted careful planning to ensure that the changeover causes minimal disruption to business and residential customers.</PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements are really quite simply-to change to the new seven digit number just prefix your current telephone number with a ``2''.</PARA>
<PARA> For example, if your old number is 455111, your new number will be 2455111.</PARA>
<PARA> The (062) area code will change to (06) to ensure that interstate customers can still call the Canberra and Queanbeyan regions unchanged. Service codes such as the time 1194, trunks 011, and emergency 000, will remain the same.</PARA>
<PARA> If you are a business customer using a PABX, Commander telephone or other small business system, you may need to reprogram your system and change the numbers stored in the memory of the base phone.</PARA>

I can only say that the CSIRO scientist who is apparently the source of much of this commentary appears to be seeking funds for research into this area of science. It appears to me, at least, that he has started a campaign which will create a need which his research project will be designed to address.

The National Health and Medical Research Council Women's Health Committee has prepared guidelines for the use of IUDs and these recommend that IUDs only be used by women who have already had children. The Minister for Housing and Aged Care announced on 15 August new procedures for drug and medical device evaluations that should address ongoing concerns.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that Senator Vanstone is trying to get us to debate this afternoon what is effective and what is not effective. It is obvious that all departments have equal employment opportunity programs. How effective they are will be reflected perhaps in some of the statistics that we are waiting on. Nevertheless, as I said in my answer to her, we are well satisfied with the gradual progress that is being made. It is not speedy progress, but it is certainly progress that is reflected in many of the statistics. It is an issue that we can debate, if the honourable senator wishes, when we have more of that material available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the second part of the honourable senator's question, I understand that she is alluding to the Styles case. Helen Styles has applied to the High Court for special leave to appeal against the decision of the Full Court handed down in Sydney on 28 August 1989. In relation to the second part of the question, we are aware that the court expressed concern about the lack of clarity in the drafting of indirect discrimination legislation. That matter has been referred to the Attorney-General.</PARA>

I do not think any person suffering from AIDS would arouse more compassion than such persons. For that reason, within the Attorney-General's portfolio it has been decided that the Commonwealth should participate in a scheme coordinated by the Legal Aid Commission of Victoria, with the involvement of various legal aid bodies, involving research and funding of two test cases which are currently being considered by the Commission. The preliminary estimate of costs for the two test cases is $250,000. The Commonwealth has also agreed to provide a further grant of up to $50,000 for legal research and collection of evidence in this area. The results of this research will be made available to all persons in this unfortunate situation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I was asked a question by Senator McLean on the matter of access to joint facilities. As the Minister for Defence stated in his reply to Senator McLean's letter of 5 June 1989, the question he raises about briefings and other privileges enjoyed by the leadership group of the Australian Democrats is not a matter of defence policy. It is a matter of parliamentary and constitutional principles and practice. He advised Senator McLean to raise the issue with the Prime Minister. I understand from the Prime Minister's office that Senator McLean has not yet done so. However, my general observation is that the privileges accorded to the leadership of the Opposition reflect its status as the alternative government. No-one has ever regarded the Australian Democrats as an alternative government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator McLean also asked about access to the joint facilities by Australian parliamentarians and United States Congress members and their staff. In that regard, I quote from the Minister's letter to Senator McLean of 31 May this year:</PARA>
<PARA>Australian members of parliament who have a need to be aware of the classified elements of Pine Gap and Nurrungar are briefed and do carry out classified visits. My replies to questions on Notice in Parliament have made that clear. Similar principles apply to US legislators. Only congressmen whose respon- sibilities require that they be aware of the classified functions of Pine Gap and Nurrungar would be able to have a classified visit to Pine Gap. US congressional committee staff members are allowed access on the same basis as Australian officials. In each country only these officers with a particular need to have access to such information and who have been subjected to rigorous clearances are briefed on the joint facilities and allowed full access to them.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator McLean further asked about briefings given to staff of Australian parliamentarians. In fact, among parliamentarians' staff only ministerial staff of the Minister for Defence and the Prime Minister are briefed on the joint facilities. In response to the honourable senator's question as to why the Government considers him unfit to make a classified visit, I would simply remind the honourable senator that the Government makes no judgment on his fitness. That is not at issue. What is at issue is his need to know. Access to classified information is determined strictly by the would-be recipient's need to know. Senators are, of course, entitled to an unclassified briefing and visit to the facilities. In the case of Nurrungar, for example, this Government has placed enough information on the public record, together with that made available in the United States, to allow an unclassified briefing to give a very full understanding of the basic roles of this facility. The material available on the public record now gives at least as full a picture of the functions of Nurrungar as we give publicly on the Jindalee over-the-horizon radar. I invite Senator McLean to take advantage of this offer.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 27 September Senator Calvert asked me a question without notice about the impact of a recent Budget measure on Brisbane City Council and on local government generally throughout Australia. The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows: from 1 December 1989 group remitters with annual pay as you earn (PAYE) tax remittances exceeding $5m a year will be required to remit instalments on a fortnightly basis. At present the collection of remittances is on a monthly basis. This is in effect a concession by the Federal Government because employers deduct pay as you earn tax on a more regular basis, usually weekly or fortnightly. The measure reduces the concession and is intended to get a more timely payment of revenue due to the Federal Government. This will enable the Government to make estimated public debt interest savings of $20m in 1989-90, and $70m in 1990-91 and in subsequent years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of the taxation affairs of the Brisbane City Council, I am advised that the Council estimates that its forgone revenue from the change in PAYE remittances dates will be about $180,000 in a full year, not the $360,000 suggested by Senator Calvert. The Australian Taxation Office estimates that the measure will affect fewer than 20 local governments throughout Australia at a cost of about $400,000 in 1989-90 and $1.5m per annum in following years. While there is no correlation between this initiative and untied financial assistance grants to local government, Brisbane City Council's grant is expected to increase this year in excess of $344,000 to over $16.5m.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government will provide an estimated $675m to local government in 1989-90. Together with the initiative introduced last year, whereby local government can rate Telecom Australia and Australia Post, almost $50m extra is being made available to local government this year compared with the possible $400,000 in forgone revenue from pay as you earn remittances.</PARA>

<PARA>Report 298 is the annual report of the Committee and will give members some indication of the wide range of subjects covered by the Committee in its work. Time precludes a comprehensive discussion of the report but I would like to highlight one particular initiative which is the centrepiece of the work of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee presented its report 296 on the reform of the Australian Audit Office (AAO) to the Parliament on 6 April this year. The report was entitled Ally of the People and Parliament: Reform of the Australian Audit Office. The report was the result of the first comprehensive inquiry into the work of the Audit Office in its 88 years of existence. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee found that the Audit Office did not have the resources and independence necessary to perform its functions under the Audit Act to the satisfaction of the Parliament, nor had the Audit Office kept pace with reforms in the audit function in other jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee made 78 recommendations, the most crucial of which were:</PARA>
<PARA>legislation be introduced to establish the AAO as a statutory authority, and to permit the Auditor-General to determine the terms and conditions of employment of AAO staff;</PARA>
<PARA>repeal of the Audit Act 1901 and its replacement by a new Audit Act and a new Financial Administration Act;</PARA>
<PARA>a parliamentary committee be established to advise the Auditor-General on Parliament's audit priorities and to consider the AAO's finances in detail; and</PARA>
<PARA>the provision of additional resources specifically to allow for more efficiency audits so that in five years time 50 per cent of the AAO's resources will be spent on efficiency audits as distinct from 6 per cent now. </PARA>
<PARA>This report has been fully supported by the Auditor-General who presented his response to the report to the Parliament on 7 September. There was only one recommendation to which the Auditor-General gave qualified support. The rest were given full support. The Auditor-General has urged the Government to act to give effect to the historic reforms recommended by the Committee. Indeed, this has been the response of Auditors-General around the country and of the editorial writers of almost all major Australian newspapers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee remains totally committed to the report and believes it is imperative that the Government accept the recommendations as the Committee believes they provide the blueprint for both greater accountability and efficiency in government. </PARA>
<PARA> The report contains detailed summaries of the reports presented to the Parliament in the 1988-89 financial year as well as a summary of activity in current inquiries. The Committee notes that a Bill on therapeutic goods was introduced into the Parliament yesterday and that the resources for the Antarctic Division have been increased in line with Committee recommendations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to speak briefly to the report. Compliance with mandatory reporting requirements for departmental annual reports to Parliament should be a straightforward and administrative matter. Non-compliance with such requirements, however, is a threat to our concept of democracy. The Public Accounts A Committee produced the report I am tabling today because we found a substantial level of non-compliance. The reporting requirements for annual reports by the secretaries of Commonwealth departments are set down in guidelines approved by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and presented in the Parliament by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). This procedure and the requirement that reports be in accordance with the guidelines is provided for in section 25 of the Public Service Act 1922. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year, in its report No. 291, the Public Accounts Committee foreshadowed that it would review annual reports of departments for compliance with relevant guidelines. This inquiry followed on from the Committee's report No. 262, in which the Committee considered the draft which became the current guidelines for the preparation of departmental annual reports. Originally, the review was intended merely to confirm that secretaries of Commonwealth government departments were complying with the requirement that they include certain information in their 1987-88 annual reports to Parliament. Compliance by secretaries was, after all, required by the Public Service Act. </PARA>
<PARA> During the inquiry the Committee was most concerned at the level of non-compliance with the guidelines. This concern was heightened as the attention of each Secretary personally had been drawn to the guidelines by the Committee by way of letter. Further, the Committee had put on notice its intention to review compliance with the requirements of the guidelines. What more need we have done to achieve compliance? Even if departmental secretaries themselves believed that the accountability requirements were excessive-and this is not what they have told us-surely they can see that if departments do not report in the manner required by the Parliament the recent reforms in public sector management will be put at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> Management for results and devolution include a trade-off of more autonomy and control for more accountability. In this regard, we were pleased to hear that some departments were taking steps to ensure that problems of non-compliance will not be an attribute of the 1988-89 reports. The Committee encourages all parties concerned with annual reports to take an active interest in ensuring that they are useful documents. If scope to improve significantly the guidelines is identified, this should be drawn to the attention of the relevant bodies, the first being the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. For our part, the Public Accounts Committee has commenced a review of the guidelines which is intended to assist the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in redrafting those guidelines by giving a parliamentary perspective. The review will also give the Committee an opportunity to consider its preferences for the guidelines prior to being required to consider the draft guidelines for approval under the Public Service Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee awaits the 1988-89 reports with interest as they will no doubt comply with the requirements of that Act and thus provide improved information on the operations of Commonwealth departments. Also, the initiative and skill of departments should be reflected in the way they present the required information in a manner which is concise and accessible to the reader. In a public hearing it was said that the Prime Minister's guidelines seemed to have been totally regarded with contempt by much of the Public Service. Very simply, I hope annual reports will never again lead any of us to that conclusion and that this inquiry has contributed to this. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I would like to thank my fellow Committee members, the various departmental secretaries and their staff and the staff of the PAC secretariat for their efforts in producing this report. This is not an inquiry which the Public Accounts Committee wished to conduct and, in fact, the Committee went to great lengths to avoid it. It has been an inquiry which has involved some considerable embarrassment to some Commonwealth public sector managers and I am confident that important lessons have been learned from it. Above all else, it has been a forthright assertion of the supremacy of Parliament-a concept fundamental to Australian parliamentary democracy. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise two matters, one of which relates to the subject matter of Senator Patterson's question about the outrageous behaviour of the honourable member for Canberra, Mrs Kelly. In the circumstances, I believe that it demands explanations from the highest level, in particular from Mr Willis as the senior Minister in that portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the so-called important message to telephone customers from Ros Kelly, I would like to know whether this decision to have the Minister's name attached to a Telecom Australia document-in other words, a blatant electioneering stunt-was considered by the Telecom Board; whether the matter was authorised by the Board; and in what circumstances Telecom agreed to such a shoddy piece of electioneering activity. I would also like to know the number of letters distributed, and for what reason it was felt necessary to circulate consumers in the Canberra and Queanbeyan regions, given that there has been extensive telephone advertising on this very matter in recent times, and only those who do not read newspapers would fail to be aware that telephone numbers are about to be changed. I ask whether this practice is about to be followed in other areas, and indeed whether it has been followed in the past. On this occasion was it distributed on an electorate basis, and if so did it include the electorate of Fraser? I would also like to know the cost of the mail-out. </PARA>
<PARA> I invite the honourable member for Canberra, Mrs Kelly, to indicate whether the recently installed folding machine that she now has in her office, which is capable of posting 40,000 letters in one go, was obtained from the Department of Administrative Services, or through the Department of Telecommunications and Aviation Support. The machine was no doubt installed for much higher ministerial purposes but no doubt has been used for quite a deal of electioneering material in recent times including-so I am informed-an 80,000 mail-out on the instructions of the Treasurer, Mr Keating. I ask whether that machine was used for this particular purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> I regard this behaviour as symptomatic of the approach that has been taken by the Government. It is yet another one of its dirty tricks in the run-up to the next Federal election. It is all part of its continuing campaign to transfer the burden of seeking re-election to the Government and to the taxpayer rather than to the party machine. There can be no justification at all for a Minister seeking to intrude into what is essentially a machinery matter for Telecom. Telecom no doubt writes to its consumers on a regular basis. Our accounts are sent to us pretty regularly. There is no reason why that account could not contain information of this nature. Indeed, the letter states that it is a fairly minor change, or words to that effect. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements are really quite simple- . . . just prefix your current telephone number with a `2'. </PARA>
<PARA>It would not take much effort to include that with the next bill that goes out. But what has happened is that the Telecom Customer Services Manager has allowed his signature-no doubt after ministerial heavying-to appear on the letter with the Minister's signature. I regard that as a total abuse of the role of the Minister and a compromising of a supposedly independent government business authority. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish to raise another matter in the same general area. It relates to a press release put out by Mr Willis and a subsequent report in this morning's Australian Financial Review of the new members of Austel, the independent regulatory body for the telecommunications industry. A report by Anne Davies says:</PARA>
<PARA> Ms Johanna Plante, the national manager of Infonet, and Mr Alex Arena, a senior manager at Australia Post . . . have been appointed full-time members. </PARA>
<PARA>Anne Davies goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Notably, the Government has decided not to appoint anyone from Telecom, a move which would have alarmed the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA>She is quite right about that. But the fact is that it is not at all clear where that particular piece of disinformation came from. I strongly suspect that it was fed to her by Telecom, if not by the Minister's office. In any event, I regard it as a serious matter in view of the information provided to me which indicates that Ms Plante, far from being a private sector person by way of background, has had a long history of employment with Telecom. Mr Willis's press release merely says this:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Willis said that in selecting the remaining AUSTEL members he was conscious of the need to appoint members who would contribute superior technical and economic expertise. </PARA>
<PARA> ``Ms Plante, who is currently the National Manager of INFONET, has an engineering background and has worked in senior management and as a communications consultant in private industry,'' Mr Willis said. </PARA>
<PARA> ``She has also established two State branches of the Australian Telecommunications Users' Group. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not suggesting that Ms Plante is not academically or technically qualified but what I am complaining about is that if it is a fact that she has had a long and extensive history of employment with Telecom, other than a couple of years in the private sector with Coopers and Lybrand, she should have been described in Mr Willis's press release as someone with an extensive Telecom background. Indeed, the organisation of which she is currently the national manager is one in which Telecom has a 5 per cent interest, one that is very close to Telecom. It is quite possible that Ms Plante has only been in that position on secondment from her permanent employment with Telecom. If that is the case, I regard Mr Willis's press release as thoroughly deceptive and misleading in its nature and it should be investigated by the appropriate body. I hope that Austel will clarify the position. </PARA>
<PARA> The release is carefully worded to avoid any mention of any Telecom background. It is hard to believe that that can have been accidental. It requires an explanation. These are serious allegations. Whilst the release is at pains to stress the technical and economic expertise, it does not, of course, highlight the fact that we will now have Austel, an independent regulator, consisting of three public servants and two academics-no private people. Yet the way in which the description is made is designed to suggest an extensive private sector background for at least one of the recent appointees.</PARA>
<PARA> I welcome, in particular, the appointment of Mr Arena and Professor Fels, both of whom are known to me. I regard them as very capable and competent people. I do not know Professor Round but I am sure that his qualifications are similarly appropriate. Ms Plante is unknown to me and I have no personal quarrel with her. But if she does have an extensive Telecom background that fact should have been put up front; it should have been made known to the Minister, as I am sure it was. It certainly, therefore, should have resulted in a mention in the press release. Whoever is responsible for advising Anne Davies that the Government had decided not to appoint anyone from Telecom was gilding the lily to a considerable extent and I regard it as very unsatisfactory that the Government should seek to disguise the true nature of appointments in this shabby way. </PARA>

Estimates Committee D covers the portfolio of sport which is, of course, Senator Richardson's. I took the opportunity while at that Estimates Committee hearing to ask the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS)-I asked Mr Crosswhite, the Acting Director, in particular-what steps it was taking in respect of the findings, the conclusions and the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts which had inquired into the use of drugs in sport and, in particular, into the use and misuse of drugs at the Australian Institute of Sport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have to say that Mr Crosswhite gave very disturbing evidence. He provided the Committee with the findings which had been arrived at by the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman of the Board. By any measure, if those findings are accepted by the Government it means that the Government has done absolutely nothing about the problems at the Australian Institute of Sport. That would be a great tragedy because it is a fine institution with some very dedicated and committed young athletes who have given of their time, their energy, their effort and much of their life in pursuit of their endeavours and excellence. Their reputations are being tainted and touched by the incompetence of certain administrators at the Institute of Sport and by the corruption of some coaches. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations that I am concerned about primarily relate to a Mr Wardle, a weight lifting coach assistant at the Institute; Mr Peter Bowman, one of the senior administrators now at the Institute; and an athlete there, Miss Jane Flemming. I asked Mr Crosswhite to tell me what was being done about the recommendations. Let me just touch upon Jane Flemming. I do not have the answers; I do not have the panacea; I am not seeking to judge what steps ought to be taken in terms of discipline. But Jane Flemming has been put up by the Institute, encouraged to come before our Committee and give evidence, by Mr Peter Bowman. She is used, and quite properly so, as the healthy, young, clear skinned PR girl for the Institute who says what a wonderful institution it is, and quite rightly so. But she unwisely and foolishly said that no drugs were used there. I am quite certain she was using somebody else's words and not speaking from her own knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> Sadly, Miss Jane Flemming in 1986 in Belfast, at a meeting which led up to the Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, got caught up in seeking to corrupt the drug testing system, which goes to the heart of cheating. It goes to the heart of fairness and decency in ensuring that the right people win. A Miss Susan Howland had been successful in her event and was called upon, randomly I understand, to submit herself to a drug test and to provide a urine sample. A Mr Plant, an official of the Amateur Athletics Union of Australia, for reasons best known to him, concluded that Susan Howland, on having her own urine tested, would be found to be positive. In other words, she would have been cheating. So Mr Plant asked Miss Jane Flemming to provide a urine sample. </PARA>
<PARA> This incident was totally unrelated to Miss Flemming except that she was at the Games, at that time a student of the Institute of Sport on a full scholarship. He asked her whether she would provide a urine sample, and that she did. She gave it to Mr Plant to replace the urine sample of Miss Susan Howland for the purpose and with the intention of ensuring the test was negative, because it was assumed by Mr Plant, as I say, that Miss Howland would be found positive. In other words, Miss Jane Flemming conspired with and was party to a test to cheat the testing system. As it turns out, according to Mr Plant, for reasons again best known to himself, he disposed of the sample. Miss Howland's urine was used. She tested negative and her medal was presented to her. Miss Howland has since given evidence-and I have no reason to believe that it is not accurate-that she knew nothing of these circumstances, she knew nothing about any suggestion that she would test positive or any suggestion that another urine sample would replace hers. </PARA>
<PARA> That is sad when one contrasts Miss Flemming's personal conduct with her presentation of all the virtues and goodness of athletes at the Institute of Sport. Miss Flemming came along originally to give evidence-to tell us that all these unreasonable, unfair stories we had heard about the Institute were not right. She had been assisted in the drawing up of her written evidence by Peter Bowman from the Institute, who contacted the Committee and encouraged us to take oral evidence from her, which we of course did. We recommended that some disciplinary action be taken against Miss Flemming because she was a full time student at the Institute of Sport and certain standards are expected of scholarship holders, not the least being that they will conduct themselves in a sportsmanlike fashion, they will not cheat and they will uphold the ideals with which the Institute wishes to be associated. </PARA>
<PARA> The Board, under the auspices of the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman, looked at our recommendations and allegedly read the transcript of the evidence. Their action was to send a letter to Jane Flemming informing her that the Board of the Australian Sports Commission (ASC) strongly disapproved of her participation in urine substitution. She has not been disciplined, chastised or criticised; it has simply been pointed out to her in writing that the Board disapproved of her participation in urine substitution. If that is likely to discourage other athletes, students and scholarship holders from doing the same thing, I would be absolutely staggered because normally the rules are that scholarship holders at the Institute of Sport who get caught cheating get kicked out. I am not calling for that-I am not calling for anything-but I would have thought that prima facie in this environment the Board would have at least taken some modest steps; in the interests of sport, the coaches and the athletes at the Institute, it would have been seen at least to have taken some steps. Yet it did absolutely nothing. It did say, `All AIS athletes and coaches be informed that participation in urine substitution now constitutes a breach of the ASC-AIS drug policy'-as it is now a sin to substitute urine, a sin to cheat, do I take it that it was not a sin prior to this ex cathedra dictum from the Commission?-`and would render any athlete or official involved liable to life penalty thereunder'. I am not asking for that of course. I do not have the knowledge of what is fair and what is unfair in terms of discipline, but certainly something is required. </PARA>
<PARA> I asked Mr Crosswhite who, I should say, is only the Acting Executive Director, what else was intended and he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I am not aware of any further action planned by the board on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>Then I asked him about Mr Bowman. At the time Mr Bowman was the Australian Institute of Sport's Company Secretary. There are a number of matters that affect Mr Bowman, not the least being that, as a senior official of the Australian Institute of Sport, he knew of the Jane Flemming urine substitute incident and did nothing about it. He did not inform the Board, the Director or the Australian Amateur Athletic Union. He sat on it. When he was asked why, what did he tell us? He told us that it was because Flemming was representing Australia and not the Australian Institute of Sport and that the substitution incident was a matter for the Australian Amateur Athletic Union and not the AIS. Now I ask you, Mr Acting Deputy President: What chance have we got of discipline if an athlete goes into an event on taxpayers' money from the Australian Institute of Sport but she is representing Australia? Do I take it that from now on any student from the Institute of Sport who represents Australia at any international event has a different set of rules from those representing the Australian Institute of Sport? I should hope not. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not the greatest sin of Mr Bowman. Mr Bowman gave evidence before the Committee. I remind the Senate that Mr Bowman was the Secretary to the AIS at the time. The Committee concluded on the evidence that taxpayers' money was used by the Institute of Sport to purchase anabolic steroids under the guise of food supplements. The person primarily responsible was one, Mr Lyn Jones, and Mr Wardle also must have had knowledge of those circumstances. We found a receipt which just happened to have the wrong State on it. Bova Chemist is actually in New South Wales but the receipt had Victoria on it. You would hardly think the chemist would get his State wrong. Mr Bowman did not authorise it particularly but he was essentially responsible because of his position as secretary. He was asked how could he explain that. Paraphrasing his evidence, he said `Perhaps the person who wrote it out had had a bad night before'. That was his regard for a forged receipt which clearly demonstrated embezzlement of taxpayers' funds for the purpose of purchasing anabolic steroids. The Committee noted:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Bowman had had no personal involvement in the approval of the payment of the $90 receipt, supposedly for Colin Bova Chemist but said by Mr Bova not to be from his pharmacy. Mr Bowman noted that the receipt was for a small amount which had been approved under `a proper delegation' and was more concerned over this than over the fact that public monies could have been misappropriated. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he was more concerned to say, `It was only $90 of the taxpayers' money and it had been officially and properly discharged'. What concerned the Committee was that we found cases where paramedical supplies, contrary to the guidelines, had been purchased without appropriate authority. The Committee's report goes to state:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee was more concerned that Mr Bowman had not sought to closely examine the contents of the Price Waterhouse report prior to his appearance before the Committee, given that much of the substance of the report's adverse findings directly related to his activities as the then head of finance administration at the AIS. The Committee finds that Mr Peter Bowman has displayed disregard for the proper public accountability for the expenditure of public monies inconsistent with his former position as Company Secretary and Administrator of the AIS. </PARA>
<PARA>The finding of the Committee was:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that the AIS investigate the approval of medical supply purchases without medical officer authorisation, contrary to AIS policy, with a view to disciplinary action. </PARA>
<PARA>The truth of the matter is that in respect of Mr Bowman absolutely nothing was done. Recommendation 12, the one I have just read, of the Senate Committee's report, in relation to the Commission stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . accepted the recommendation of the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman that disciplinary action was inappropriate in respect of the approval of the then AIS Ltd's company secretary . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is, Mr Peter Bowman. It was judged that he be not subject to any disciplinary action whatsoever. Mr Bowman was involved in the Jane Flemming case; Mr Bowman was found to have been derelict in his duties and responsibilities. He was an appalling witness. He did more damage to the Institute than almost any other witness. I thought he treated the whole business with contempt, and he has not even been censured. He has barely been spoken to. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the findings of the inquiry was that Mr Jones and a number of coaches and athletes were bringing anabolic steroids into Australia quite freely and that they were wearing Australian uniform tracksuits when doing so. One would not imagine that at the Customs barrier they would have been seen as prime suspects for carrying illegal drugs. So they would have been able to get through easily. They would have been encouraged by their coaches to wear their Australian blazers and tracksuits so that they would look like the Australian ambassadors that they were. We discovered that thousands and thousands of these drugs were coming through in that way and our recommendation was that the athletes and coaches no longer be considered as a low risk. That is sad but it is a reality; they are just no longer a low risk. The tragedy is that this has tainted all athletes. But there is no other way one can handle it. </PARA>
<PARA> Apparently the Australian Customs Service has taken our recommendation with more seriousness than has the Board of the Commission because an article in the Daily Telegraph on 16 September states that Mr Bowman expressed some very real indignation at the new responsibilities embraced by Customs. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> He said it had reached the stage where athletes returning from overseas events were asked by customs officers where they kept their steroids. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Bowman has just returned from leading a team of athletes to the World University Games in Germany. </PARA>
<PARA> He said when the delegation arrived in Sydney a customs official conducted a random search of one athlete and jokingly asked him to take his steroids out of his bag. </PARA>
<PARA> The officer had then implied that perhaps the coach had all the steroids. </PARA>
<PARA> ``Our athletes took it pretty badly'', Mr Bowman said. </PARA>
<PARA> ``They didn't see the joke in it at all''. </PARA>
<PARA> ``We are quite convinced the majority of Australian athletes would not touch steroids''. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not make any judgments about the flippant conduct of the Customs officer. I would have thought under those circumstances that it was probably a relief for an athlete to have been frisked by a relaxed, frivolous Customs officer rather than one who showed all the pomposity and arrogance for which civil servants are renowned. But Mr Bowman was not complaining about the officer's conduct; he was complaining about his character. He was complaining that the athletes had been questioned in the way that we had recommended. So much for Mr Bowman's regard for our findings! Mind you, he must have been feeling pretty comfortable at this stage, having got off scot-free himself. </PARA>
<PARA> I opened my mail and found a copy of the Illawarra Mercury for 16 September; it does not often comes across my desk as it is not compelling reading for someone from Western Australia. But on 16 September, the same day, Mr Bowman was in Wollongong. I took the trouble to speak to the journalist and asked him to read his notes out to me verbatim. The newspaper headline was `Drugs inquiry ``rubbish'' claims' and the article began:</PARA>
<PARA> The Institute of Sport track and field director-</PARA>
<PARA>note the title `track and field director'-</PARA>
<PARA>Peter Bowman yesterday said that a lot of evidence given at the Australian drugs inquiry was a load of rubbish. </PARA>
<PARA>I have since asked the Acting Director whether he had called Mr Bowman in and asked him which pages of the transcript, which evidence, which witnesses, which occasion, which circumstances had led him to make those profound but public comments as the track and field director. Mr Crosswhite told me that he really had not discussed those sorts of matters with him. He just referred him to the fact that it was against the policy of the Sports Commission and the direct guidelines agreed to by the Commission as to the making of public statements. We can see that the Board does not care much for the findings in respect of Mr Bowman and why he is not too concerned. I asked Mr Crosswhite-I will not read his evidence out-whether in essence he had read the transcripts, whether he had read the evidence. He started off by saying, `Yes, some of it'. I can only assume he was referring to that part that affected the Institute of Sport. That is not unreasonable. Then I asked him whether he knew anything about Bowman's relationship with the Jane Flemming affair and her conduct. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I was not aware of that, Senator. I am not aware of that. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that after having told me he had read the transcript and the evidence as it related to Bowman. I said:</PARA>
<PARA>But have you not read that part of the transcript that refers to Mr Bowman's evidence?</PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I probably have, but I am not aware of it at this point of time. </PARA>
<PARA>I said:</PARA>
<PARA> But that is clearly in the transcript. He says that himself. </PARA>
<PARA>So Mr Crosswhite said he had read the transcript. First of all, he could not remember it, he was not aware of it, but then he said he had read the transcript. I asked him further about Mr Bowman's knowledge of the matter and he seemed thoroughly confused as to whether he knew about it or did not know about it. In fact his evidence was absolutely appalling. I was moved to say, perhaps unkindly in retrospect, that if I had closed my eyes it could have been the past director, Mr Harvey, giving us evidence. He was a brilliant civil servant, I thought! I have to say that it gives me no hope for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I touch upon the question of Mr Harry Wardle. Mr Harry Wardle did not even get a mention in the Board's report to the Minister. What of the Committee made up of Democrat, Liberal, Labor and National Party senators? What did it find about Mr Harry Wardle? It found he was Mr Jones's sidekick. The Committee's report stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee accepts the evidence that Mr Jones supplied and administered anabolic steriods and other banned substances to athletes at the Australian Institute of Sport and believes that these drugs could have been purchased using public funds, as discussed in Chapter nine. </PARA>
<PARA>... ... ... .... </PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Committee believes that it is necessary to recognise that these activities of Mr Jones could not have been carried out without the full knowledge and co-operation of Mr Harry Wardle . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What did the Institute of Sport do about that? Absolutely nothing! We also noted the findings of the Institute's own lawyers in respect of claims of use of drugs in sport at the Institute. They drew the conclusion themselves that Mr Harry Wardle gave evidence that was rehearsed by Mr Lyn Jones. In other words, he gave exactly the same evidence as Mr Lyn Jones to the point where it was obvious to the lawyers that it had been rehearsed. Our general findings in respect of Mr Wardle's evidence was that it was unbelievable, unsustainable. The evidence he gave us directly and absolutely conflicted with the evidence he gave to the Institute's lawyers themselves. Naturally, we did not find particularly favourably in respect of Mr Wardle. I asked Mr Crosswhite what would happen to Mr Wardle. He said, `Absolutely nothing'. He had not even merited a mention in the report. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise those matters because they give me grave concern. Of course, the Minister is not, I suspect, bound by the recommendations of the Board and I understand he has some flexibility in terms of his own response to the report and the findings of the Board. Inasmuch as this inquiry has been bipartisan, there have been no party politics in it, no partisan point scoring, notwithstanding the temptation when we had Mr Dowding and Mr Cain trying to bury us because of their own problems. I hope now at the end of the day that Senator Richardson conducts himself in a way which we would expect from a Minister who is concerned about the findings of an inquiry which are unanimous and to which so far he has, at least orally, given support. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope we do not see the Government falling back into the bad old ways of Mr John Brown who went on Channel 9-not having read the transcript, not having read the Hansard, not visiting the Committee, not speaking to the Committee, not listening to any oral evidence-and saying in his gung ho, cowboy way that the Committee was a waste of time, that it did not find any substantial evidence and that it was all a lot of baloney. All I can say is: I can now understand why Mr Brown lost his portfolio-lack of detail and lack of concern and regard for the truth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly to try to clear up an issue that was debated for a very long time in the Senate yesterday-namely, the closing down of the Senate the day before yesterday. As we all know, Senator Vallentine was thrown out of the Senate yesterday as a result of her contrived outburst and her abuse of the Senate. I in fact advised Senator Vallentine's office that I would be making these comments this afternoon, only to find that she has already gone home.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am most concerned that Senator Vallentine, having been thrown out of the Senate because of disgraceful behaviour yesterday morning, was not present for the full debate about the reasons behind the calling of the quorum and the failure to fill that quorum the previous day. One would have imagined that if Senator Vallentine had been as interested in this subject as she claims, she could have listened to it from her office. In fact, as yesterday was a broadcast day, she could have gone home and listened to it there. But that obviously did not happen because only this morning, in an interview between Senator Vallentine and me on a Perth radio station, Senator Vallentine actually made further allegations of collusion and cooperation between the Opposition and the Government to ensure that the Senate was closed down and the Australian Democrats and the Independents were not heard on Tuesday. As was stated in yesterday's meeting of the Senate, that is simply not so. In this morning's interview, according to the transcript, Senator Vallentine said things such as:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . when one side was using a quorum to ensure their members were not available-</PARA>
<PARA>of course, she had in mind the Liberal Party or the Opposition-</PARA>
<PARA>the other side then saw the opportunity and Senator McKiernan, who was Acting Government Whip at the time, was literally shooing Labor Senators out of the chamber, saying don't come in so that the 26 numbers that we needed would not be present so at that point there was co-operation between the two major parties to stop this debate from happening and I think that that is an outrageous derogation of democracy. </PARA>
<PARA>That was not all she said; that was not the only extension of the truth that this lady, who professes to believe in all things right and proper as a Quaker--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will certainly do that, Mr Acting Deputy President. Unfortunately, Senator Vallentine misrepresented the truth in what she said on radio today and what she has said in other places. I think it is very, very sad that she is continuing to do this. She also said in that same interview:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . I would like to get back to the question of the quorum . . . and that is why the quorum was called and at what point a decision was made that the Coalition Senators would not respond to the call. A decision was obviously made . . . </PARA>
<PARA>They were her words. That is not so and I categorically deny it. As the Whip on duty at that time, I made every effort within the remaining time available to get my colleagues into this chamber. Senator Vallentine went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . by the Opposition to tell their senators in some way or other not to respond to the quorum call number one and not to respond to the quorum call number two. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, that simply does not relay the facts both at the time on Tuesday and as they were explained very clearly in the extensive debate yesterday in the Senate. I think it is particularly tragic that Senator Vallentine treated the Senate in the way in which she did yesterday, her behaviour being as it was, when she then ran around and talked, not only in the Senate but outside it, about the absenteeism of other senators. I have only today checked back through all the business of the Senate, all the records since Senator Vallentine has been in the Senate, and no-one has a worse record than she has. She has been absent for 81 per cent of the votes in the Senate chamber since 1986. She has been absent from the Senate for 10 per cent of the time. She told the radio interviewer this morning at two minutes to 10 that she was rushing into the Senate. She said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the bells are ringing and I want to get in there right now. </PARA>
<PARA>First and foremost she could not because she was suspended for a further 17 minutes; and, secondly, we did not see her in here until 2 o'clock for Question Time. That is how she rushed in. She must have crawled in. There was certainly no rushing about it. </PARA>

As I say, for 10 per cent of the time she has been absent, and for the remaining 90 per cent of the time she has been present for perhaps only a matter of minutes-to come into the chamber, be seen, and go out. I think it is very unfair of her to reflect upon other senators, and to do so outside the Senate. She does not have the courage to come into the Senate and reflect on senators in here; she goes outside the Senate and does it out there. As I say, the total disrespect that she has for this chamber, which she clearly demonstrated yesterday, I find quite offensive.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 17 August 1989 (Hansard, page 269), Senator Teague asked me a question without notice concerning a letter in the Adelaide Advertiser about medical research funding and the programs of the Australian Research Council. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The letter was part of a campaign by Medical Schools to gain access to new money for research infrastructure which I announced in May 1989 in my Statement Research for Australia: Higher Education's Contribution in the context of the Prime Minister's Science and Technology Statement. They were concerned that funding may be based on a formula which does not include National Health and Medical Research Council (NH&amp;MRC) grants.</PARA>
<PARA> In that Statement I announced the provision of $107.5 million over the 1990-92 triennium to develop the capacity of higher education institutions to support high quality research. These funds are to be distributed on the basis of advice from the Australian Research Council (ARC), in formal consultation with the Higher Education Council (HEC) and having regard to three guidelines described in my Statement.</PARA>
<PARA> I have now received and considered the Council's advice and have decided to implement it immediately with a few variations. With regard to the Medical Deans' concerns, I have decided to vary the Council's proposals by including NH&amp;MRC grants in the formula which will be used to distribute funding to the former university sector. Infrastructure funding for the former advanced education sector will be handled separately through a competitive process proposed by the ARC. The funds which would have gone to institutions in the former advanced education sector under the ARC's originally proposed formula will be transferred into the competitive scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no threat to medical research funding. On the contrary, in May the Prime Minister also announced a total increase in funding for medical research through the NH&amp;MRC of $45.5 million over the five year period to 1993-94. This represents a real increase of 18.7% over the period.</PARA>

We have emphasised to Hezb-i that such incidents, whatever their root cause, threaten to destroy the mujaheddin and will certainly detract from international support for their struggle. I also expressed my concern to the Pakistani Foreign Minister, Mr Sahabzada Yaqub Khan, in a meeting with him in Belgrade on 2 September.</PARA>

<PARA> The paper Teachers Learning was the outcome of a project initiated by the former Commonwealth Schools Commission and completed in September 1988. Recommendation 1 of that paper referred to the proposed integration of Commonwealth Education Centres into the support structures of employing authorities. No immediate action was taken on the report by my Department as it was overtaken by the broader initiatives of Strengthening Australia's Schools.</PARA>
<PARA> The Schools Council of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, in considering my reference on the development of a strategy to strengthen Australia's schools, identified Teacher Quality as a vital element. As one of the most recent reports in the area, Teacher Learning contributed significantly to that consideration. A similar recommendation on the proposed integration of Commonwealth Education Centres to that in Teachers Learning is to be found in a draft issues paper on Teacher Quality released by the Schools Council as a discussion paper in order to stimulate public debate.
