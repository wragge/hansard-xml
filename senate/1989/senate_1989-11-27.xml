<TITLE>Company Tax Collection System</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's Budget decision to change the company tax collection system will be a crippling blow to many small businesses, already suffering as a direct result of the Hawke Labor Government's high interest rate policy.</PARA>
<PARA> The earlier remittance of company tax payments to the Government will substantially reduce the cash-flow position of thousands of small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA> Many small businesses will be driven under as a result of the Government's decision-unable to find funds for both tax commitments and new stock, only able to borrow at record high interest rates and unable to claim any tax relief on such borrowings to meet their tax commitment.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's proposed changes to the company tax collection system has only been introduced as a greedy grab for more tax revenue.</PARA>
<PARA> The small business community would prefer the Government to completely abandon the proposal rather than make only minor alterations to the original Budget decision, which are not likely to alleviate the situation to any significant extent.</PARA>
<PARA>And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>X-rated and Violent Video Material</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of citizens of Australia points out:</PARA>
<PARA> That all State Governments, State Attorneys-General, most womens' groups and the majority of men in Australia, including significant numbers of Members of Parliament, are totally opposed to the importation and distribution of `X' and excessively violent `R'-rated video pornography in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> That most `X'-rated material available in Australia is imported.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Federal Government, by its Customs power under the Constitution, and not the A.C.T. Government, is solely responsible for controlling the importation of this pornographic material.</PARA>
<PARA> That by continuing to allow the importation of such pornographic material, the Federal Government is neglecting its responsibility to the women, children and families of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners, therefore, request the Senate to:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Ban `X'-rated pornographic material at the point of entry into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Exclude from the `R'-rating all gratuitously violent material.</PARA>

<PARA> Australia's population is ageing and most people require more health services as they grow older.</PARA>
<PARA> if open not-for-profit health funds are to be able to meet the costs of providing benefits to their older members at affordable rates, they need to share these costs equitably.</PARA>

<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>The Honourable President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA> Medicare cannot pretend to be a universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hardest hit by proposals to restrict access to items 6469, 274 and 275 on the Medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners humbly pray and request that the Senate will vote against any attempt to restrict access to abortion or any abortion-related items on the Medicare schedule.</PARA>

<PARA> Your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled, stop the logging of the Coolungubra, Cathcart, Eagan Peaks and Tantawangalow State forests and to stop renewals of Harris Daishowa woodchip export licence and a total re evaluation of state forestry practices.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XG4">Senator GILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health been drawn to newspaper advertisements taken out by the Australian Doctors Fund (ADF) and the New South Wales branch of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) relating to the new general practitioner arrangements and headed in very large type, `Who's looking at your medical records?'? Can the Minister inform the Senate whether the claims made in the advertisements about the confidentiality of patient records under the new arrangements have any basis in fact?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3346" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="RESOURCES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Giles has rightly explained, the advertisements headed `Who's looking at your medical records?' claim that under the new arrangements `confidentiality between you and your doctor will be lost forever' and that `Government agents' will be allowed to access patient records. They incite patients to tell their doctors not to become vocationally registered because they `don't want their medical records exposed'. It is hard to believe the depths of dishonesty plumbed by the New South Wales Australian Medical Association and the ADF both in these advertisements and in letters sent to doctors by the New South Wales AMA. The letter speaks of a need to caution all general practitioners (GPs) that `registration allows government agents to carry out random inspections of their medical records' and to `warn the public of New South Wales of the inevitable loss of confidentiality of their medical records if they attend a vocationally registered practice'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think these statements ought to be compared with the facts. It was an all-party Senate select committee which unanimously recommended-in a report welcomed by the AMA-that a special committee called the Descriptor Utilisation Review Committee should be developed jointly by government, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the AMA to review the new arrangements. It said that the Committee believed that such a body could be structured to carry out its work without breaching patient confidentiality or the established ethics of the medical profession and recommended that it should consist of vocationally registered GPs chosen by their peers. The Senate select committee recommended that the development of this process should be put in the profession's hands and that the review process should not proceed without legislation or without the backing of the College and the AMA. It proposed the establishment of a working party representative of the Department of Community Services and Health, the College and the AMA to develop and finalise such a proposal for review. The AMA has already nominated two members for the working party, which is about to begin its consideration of that review process and what should be adopted.</PARA>
<PARA> The facts speak for themselves and were made clear to all GPs in a letter from the Health Insurance Commission and a pamphlet explaining the new arrangements. Thus, the spectre of `Government agents' exposing patients' confidential records to public scrutiny is a gross misrepresentation of the true position. It will be the medical profession itself, represented by the AMA and the College, which decides on how the review should take place. No decision has yet been made, nor will it be made until full consultation and public discussion has been completed.</PARA>
<PARA> In view of the seriousness of the situation, particularly the concern that the advertisement and the letter were designed to denigrate doctors seeking to become vocationally registered, Dr Blewett asked his Department to refer both the advertisement and the letter to the Medical Board of New South Wales for its consideration and whatever action is deemed necessary. He is also sending copies of this material to the Treasurer and others of his colleagues as further evidence that contributions to the Australian Doctors Fund should not be tax deductable in the light of the dishonest purposes for which such moneys are being applied. Unfortunately, fringe elements of the medical profession-the New South Wales AMA and the ADF-are making a last ditch attempt to impede historic reform of general practice. For political reasons, they do not want the Government and the medical profession to work together constructively for the benefit of patients and, it should be importantly stressed, for the benefit of the doctors.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I read an article in today's Australian newspaper by John Durie headlined `US expands sugar quota'. The United States has increased by 13.5 per cent its sugar import quota. The Australian share of that increase is 21,000 tonnes, which brings the Australian overall quota of sugar into the United states to 178,221 tonnes. Australia's fundamental problem is that under the United States sugar policy, high domestic support arrangements are propping up inefficient production and encouraging production, because of high prices, of alternative sweeteners in competition with sugar. In a recent General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade case GATT members, including the United States, agreed that the United States sugar import regime was in contravention of GATT rules. We have since been encouraging the United States to bring its sugar import quota system into conformity with GATT as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The situation in Czechoslovakia is highly fluid. I do not think anyone could be confidently making any predictions about what will happen at this stage. But at this stage we understand that the following has happened. As has been reported, nine people were replaced in the Politburo at the Central Committee meeting on 24 and 25 November, including the General Secretary of the Communist Party, Milos Jakes. Mr Jakes was replaced by Karel Urbanek, Miroslav Stepan was sacked as Party Chief in Prague and, reportedly, the Prime Minister, Ladislav Adamec, refused to remain a member of the new Politburo, considering it resistant to reform. Of course, it is possible that further changes will occur in the next few days. In order to encourage that, demonstrations have been continuing daily since 17 November and, at most recent estimates, they have grown in size in Prague to about 600,000 people. Leading the crowds in Prague-as has been reported and as we all know-are leading Charter 77 dissidents, such as Vaclav Havel and the Prague Spring Leader, Alexander Dubcek. Demonstrators are calling for further political reforms and free elections. They have called for a two-hour general strike to take place today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The unrest and pressure for reform in Czechoslovakia is, of course, an inevitable and logical part of the movement for change that is presently sweeping across eastern Europe. I am sure that the Prime Minister and I were simply reflecting public opinion in Australia, and indeed in the rest of the world, when we spoke out some days ago against the Czech Government's initial resistance to change and its use of the tactics of political repression. We certainly now welcome the increased responsiveness of the Czech Government to popular demand and note that this may be only the commencement of a process of fundamental reform. We certainly hope that it is. How far that process will go, I guess, will become clear in the next few days or, if it does not, I will be in a better position to assess it when I come back from visiting the area in the second half of December.</PARA>

It is also alleged that many members of the Mongrel Mob are New Zealand citizens.

This is subject to their not having a serious criminal record and having a New Zealand passport on entry. This concession is available to Australian citizens seeking residence in New Zealand.

There has always been a minimum risk policy. It is impossible to have a no risk quarantine policy, as anyone who pauses to think about how we would give such a guarantee will understand immediately. I will check to see whether residues of the food additives that were referred to are checked in quarantine. From a quarantine point of view, whatever standard and routine checks are done will be done in the normal course on this particular commodity.

The quicker he would come out and say that, the more honest the debate on this subject in Australia would be. It is not an occasion to denigrate the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service's very high standards of professionalism. What is essential is that quarantine laws in this country and the actions of our quarantine service be entirely understood by international trading markets as a strictly quarantine function. As I said on Friday-someone interjected about what I said then, but what I said on Friday obviously was not understood-no wool, wheat or beef producer, horticulturalist, or anyone who exports rural or agricultural commodities from this country will welcome the Opposition's trying to bring the AQIS into disrepute by attacks on its integrity, because our clients overseas will seize on that internal domestic ferment and use that to justify a preference for goods from other countries.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a problem with the labelling of a product called S26. At the outset I indicate that it is not a major problem, but every opportunity to warn parents is very eagerly seized upon at the moment. The problem arises from the fact that some cans have been mislabelled. The formula in those cans is intended for consumption by infants over the age of six months, but S26 itself is intended for infants of the age of six months or less. So it could be possible that some infants under the age of six months are getting the wrong product in cans marked S26.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have sought some advice on the risk involved and also on the extent of the problem. That information is necessary in order to give a complete picture. I have been informed by a variety of experts from the Department of Community Services and Health and also paediatricians that the risk to any healthy infant is very low but that there is a risk involved to infants who are less than six months old, particularly those who have been ill or dehydrated during the course of consumption of the product. So, the risk can be targeted to ill or dehydrated babies below the age of six months. In terms of its extent, our information is that only a few cans are believed to have been mislabelled. The company has advised that it has undertaken an extensive search of all retail outlets and has recalled from those outlets the cans that it has been able to find. I have been informed on that basis that they are no longer available for sale. But it may well be that parents have bought S26 and are unaware of the risks that may be involved with it.</PARA>
<PARA> Another factor is that the formula has not been made available through hospitals, so parents of babies who have been born in hospitals or who have spent time in hospital can generally be sure that those babies will not be at risk. The company and I have agreed, however, that we need to make the public aware of the risk, no matter how minor or marginal it may be. To that extent, the company has been prompt in recalling the product and issuing statements and its performance needs to be acknowledged. I take a final opportunity to warn those parents with children under the age of six months, particularly those who may have been ill or dehydrated and who may have used formula S26, to desist from using the formula, to return the product to their retail outlet and also to take care with a child who may have consumed the formula.</PARA>

It was considered by a ministerial committee consisting of Senator Walsh, Mrs Kelly and me. The three of us unanimously resolved to award the contract to John Singleton Advertising, not because John Singleton worked for the Labor Party but because in our unanimous view-and I think even in retrospect it was the absolutely correct view-the concept of using John Williamson's theme of True Blue, which was accepted, incredibly well known and extremely popular, was the only way for us to go. We had a very limited budget. As honourable senators would know, $2.4m does not buy much on television these days.

Given that around $65,000 is being spent monthly on supplying the basic needs of Karen refugees on the Thai side of the border, and another $15,000 a month is being supplied for the basic needs of the Burmese students who have taken refuge in border areas, there is still a shortfall, with some groups receiving little or no aid.

The Government would certainly give sympathetic consideration to any request for aid which was clearly of an emergency and humanitarian nature.

I am advised by the Treasurer's office that there are currently no delays in the processing of tax file numbers within the ATO. Employment declaration forms ask whether the employee currently has a tax file number. If the employee does not, the form asks whether an application for a tax file number has been submitted, and then there are details about how the system operates. If the employee indicated on an employee declaration form that an application had been lodged but, in fact, that was not the case, no extension would be enforced at the end of the initial 28-day period.

In terms of the level of greenhouse gas emissions, I cannot inform the chamber of any energy source comparison at the moment. Decisions on whether to choose wood or some other energy source may depend upon the availability of a particular energy source.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the report in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Social Security in this place. The paper, issued through EPAC, very clearly identifies trends in poverty. Policy prescriptions needed in the future are identified as well. To that extent the Government welcomes the paper and will obviously consider it very seriously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of identifying trends in poverty, the paper makes one very fundamental point, and does so quite well. That is, over the last 20 years the problems of poverty have become problems, essentially, of homelessness, long term unemployment, youth unemployment, marriage breakdown, and hardship as it relates to immigrants and refugees. The paper makes one very fundamental point in terms of policy directions; that is, as a result of government reforms over the last few years, particularly in the areas of family allowance supplements, rental assistance and pension indexation, the question of poverty is now less a problem of inadequate income but more a problem of issues related to alienation, exclusion from full participation in society. The conclusion of the report is also instructive. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Income support measures alone are not sufficient to deal with the broader aspects of poverty that exist in the Australian community. A broader range of other social policies will also be necessary . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The pivotal point there is that the EPAC report recommends to Government that we need to approach the question of poverty with research in a much broader range of areas than purely income support. The Government has recognised the vital role of these social wage measures. I have made that point a number of times in this place, as has the Minister for Social Security in the House of Representatives. We have often spoken about the importance of social wage measures such as Medicare, superannuation, Austudy, family payments and programs such as Newstart and jobs, education and training (JET). In September this year the Prime Minister in his address to the Australian Council of Social Service stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is possible to describe poverty in terms of dollars and cents, or the lack of them. And it is possible to attack it in terms of financial benchmarks, as we have done.</PARA>
<PARA> But the causes and the symptoms of poverty are far wider than pure economics.</PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps we need a broader assault, ACOSS can help-along with State and local governments who have major interests in many aspects of this problem.</PARA>
<PARA>The point picked up by the EPAC paper is one that the Prime Minister also stressed two months ago. The Government has long recognised the need for a broader attack. That recognition will underlie the development of social policy on this side of the Parliament. It is also instructive to note that, whereas we have adopted this particular broad approach, the policy that the Opposition represents is totally different and destructive to the interests of good policy formulation in this area; it is the exact opposite. The Opposition would deny universal access to health care; it would freeze the number of high education places; it would abolish the programs that help families, for instance living--</PARA>

It is one that Senator Chaney ignored in terms of targeting appropriate rigorous policies when he was the Minister in this area, and he ignored it just a few months ago in the development of his Foster's family plan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will conclude on this basic point: there is a very clear distinction between the Government and the Opposition. At a time when the Government is taking a broad approach in this area, the Opposition is putting up programs that will cut back the social wage structures that have been identified by a body such as EPAC. The Opposition will cut back programs such as Skillshare, Jobstart, Newstart and JET which would effectively be abolished. As I say, the EPAC report provides a fundamental basis for policy development in this area. The Government has been working in that direction. I suggest to Senator Chaney that after the election when he is developing policy, in opposition again, this may be a good starting point.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 21 November Senator Harradine asked a question relating to comments allegedly made by Ms Sue Boyd, our former High Commissioner to Bangladesh, to a recent meeting of the Australian Institute of International Affairs (AIIA). I am now in a position to provide the following supplementary information: Ms Boyd described to the meeting the components of Australia's aid to Bangladesh. This includes co-financing of the third International Development Association (IDA) Bangladesh population and family health project. For the details of this program I refer Senator Harradine to the documentation provided to him during the Senate Estimates Committee meeting on 26 September. This project is reviewed regularly and no evidence of coercion has been identified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During her talk Ms Boyd identified population pressures as being one of the most important questions facing the Government of Bangladesh at this time. She noted that the Bangladesh Government attached high priority to the question and that President Ershad had received the United Nations population award in 1987. Her discussions with the Bangladesh authorities included discussion of population questions and the necessity to accord them high priority in all aspects of government planning and programs.</PARA>
<PARA> In her talk she spoke about the excellent relations Australia enjoys with the Government and people of Bangladesh which derive in part from Australia's effective development assistance program with that country. The access this rapport provided was useful to Australia in a number of fields, including that of trade promotion, and it was in this sense that Ms Boyd told the AIIA that Australian aid could be seen as a form of a lever when suggesting change.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine also asked me whether a population program which included elements such as he described could be construed as involving coercion. He queried whether Australia would support such a program. Senator Harradine will appreciate that often there is a fine line between coercion and incentive. All these matters have to be looked at on a case by case basis having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case. Nonetheless, on the face of it, an approach such as he has described would, under the kind of guidance that I have sought to give to the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau, be judged as probably being coercive and would not be supported.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, Senator Harradine will be aware that Bangladesh is among the poorest countries in the world and one of the most densely populated. The current population is estimated at 110 million and the officially admitted rate of birth is 2.4 per cent per annum. At that rate the population could be expected to have doubled within the next 30 years. To try to form a mental picture of what this means in concrete terms, it might be helpful to note that, were the population of the whole world to be placed in Australia, the population density would still be lower than that of Bangladesh at the moment-a country two-thirds the size of Victoria. The continuing growth in population outstrips Bangladesh's tremendous strides in increasing agricultural production. The Bangladesh Government has itself acknowledged that the population question is the most pressing one facing it and that it needs to devise a complex strategy to address it. The Australian Government will continue to be as supportive as it reasonably can to the Bangladesh Government in that regard.</PARA>

It seems as if there is an orchestrated attempt to discredit me. I would be grateful of the opportunity to put on record the correct situation with regard to these allegations. </PARA>
<PARA> At the Federal Council meeting in Sydney in June I moved no motion on any subject at all.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In discussing this matter of public importance it is particularly noteworthy that it is directed not merely at home buyers and the suffering inflicted upon them as a result of the interest rates resulting from this Government's economic policy but also at the suffering of farmers and other small business people as well. In saying that, I do not wish in any way to diminish the suffering of home owners or mortgagees who, after all, are paying 17 per cent on their mortgages and, in many cases, more than that on second mortgages. I want to point out that there are some other people as well in this community who are suffering and, in many cases, suffering even worse. For example, credit card users are now paying interest rates of anything between 22 and 25 per cent. Farmers and other small businessmen are paying interest rates of between 23 and 25 per cent. Even prime borrowers today in the business community, such as Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, are having to pay 20.75 per cent for their money-if they are borrowing on bank bills they can get it for the remarkably cheap rate of about 18.2 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Up in Queensland where I come from we have had a rate of population growth for so many years which has been so fast that the problem for home owners is particularly acute. We have a lot of new settlers in the State, many of whom have had to obtain finance to establish themselves. From that point of view, the degree of suffering referred to in the motion is of particular relevance to Queensland. I am not saying that it is not relevant to other States, but it is certainly relevant to Queensland, which I represent. To underline my point about the rate of population growth, in 1988-89 Queensland had a net immigration rate-that is, after allowance for people leaving the State-of 45,300 persons. That is an enormous rate of net immigration to the State. The only other State to gain population from other States in any significant degree during that year was your own State, Madam Acting Deputy President, Western Australia, which gained 9,500. I think South Australia gained a few hundred and the rest of the States all lost population, principally, as I said, to Queensland. If I may interpose one mild political comment--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator STONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not resist the temptation on this occasion. I have to say that conservative governments in Queensland over the past 30-odd years-both coalition governments and, for the last six years, National Party governments-must have been doing something right: they have all these people wanting to live there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having referred to the very fast rate of population growth and the equally fast rate of job growth-in fact, the fastest in the Commonwealth-which has been rising by almost 6 per cent over the last 12 months, I point out that Queensland is still a very rural State and it happens to have, proportionally speaking, more farmers than perhaps any other State. Because in Queensland business tends not to be big business, such as is found in Victoria and in New South Wales, small business is the predominant form of business organisation there. It is that category which is particularly suffering, as I said earlier, from these very high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, we have a very high concentration of tourism in my State. There is an industry which is characterised principally-almost entirely, in fact-by small business. That industry is suffering not merely from the very high interest rates resulting from Mr Hawke's and Mr Keating's policies, but also from the grievous effects of the air pilots dispute-a direct result not merely of the somewhat questionable activities of the air pilots but particularly of the inflammatory approach to the whole matter by none other than the Prime Minister. So the matter of public importance before us today happens to bear particularly upon the affairs of my own State, although it has general application throughout the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The terrible thing is that nobody in the Government seems to care. I have just mentioned the air pilots dispute. The Government is doing nothing about that. I will not say much about that because that is not the subject before us today, but it has been going on and on. I think we are now into the 102nd day-I may have missed a day; it may be the 103rd day-and the Prime Minister has not even lifted a finger to tell Australian Airlines to go away and negotiate, to sit down with the pilots. </PARA>
<PARA> I will come back to what we were talking about-interest rates. There was a crushing rebuff handed out to the Hawke-Keating Labor Government last Saturday in South Australia. After all, it was a State election, but there was a massive fall in the Labor Party vote, notwithstanding the fact, which I have to acknowledge, that Mr John Bannon is, if I am to believe the public opinion polls, the most popular Premier in Australia. It was a massive vote of loss of confidence, not so much, I suspect, in his Government, although there may be some of that as well, but certainly in the Hawke-Keating Labor Government and a massive vote against the Government's interest rate policy. It is agreed on all sides that interest rates became the central issue of the campaign. There is no question about that. In part, that is what this matter of public importance debate is directed to today. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that there is no end in sight. I quote from an article in today's Australian:</PARA>
<PARA> Interest rates would have to stay high well into next year to curb the continuing blow-out in the trade deficit, the property group Baillieu Knight Frank warned yesterday. The November issue of the group's economic and property investment indicators says it would be irresponsible for either of the main political parties to signal during next year's election campaign an immediate and large fall in interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>We are not going to do anything irresponsible of that kind because we have said all along that there is no magic wand. When a government produces, after what will be seven years of this Government's policies, the kind of mess we have on our hands today there is no magic wand. This Government has put us in the situation where undoubtedly interest rates will stay high for some time. We have policies-and we have announced them in our Economic Action Plan-which will address the issues. But we are not saying that those policies will bring down interest rates with a rush in the next month or so after we are elected. We would be irresponsible to say so. It is only Messrs Hawke and Keating who may be tempted-we will wait and see-between now and the election to try to bring about an artificial fall in interest rates by orders to the Reserve Bank to do as I say, as Mr Keating would say, and indeed as he did say some time ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us be quite clear that, in addition to the very high and crippling interest rates and the burdens they are placing on home buyers and home mortgagees, we now have a situation which is the subject of a very interesting article by Mr Maximilian Walsh in today's Sydney Morning Herald. A quite separate but related problem is now appearing in this area. I want to quote at length from Mr Walsh's article because it spells out the consequences for small people in this country today of the Hawke-Keating economic policies. Mr Walsh heads his article, `Falling home prices spell the end for Hawke'. There is nothing novel about that suggestion. He comments on the sudden sprouting of `For Sale' signs all over those parts of Sydney where he happens to drive or jog around. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> In the last few weeks the signs have spread more quickly than a measles epidemic. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Those signs will be the tombstones of the Hawke Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It's a buyers' market in the world of real estate and those sales represent heartbreak stories. </PARA>
<PARA> For every person who has to sell, there are multiples who would like to escape the crushing burden of mortgage payments that are about to become even heavier as the market for part-time female labour continues to contract and as the unemployment ranks expand. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, these are people who are presently managing to scrape by, financing their much increased mortgage payments because the wife has gone out to work, and who find that her job all of a sudden disappears. Perhaps, indeed, the chief breadwinner in the family finds that his job disappears. Mr Walsh goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Those `For Sale' signs-more of them than I can ever remember-emphasise the emptiness of the present economic debate of whether we will have a `hard' or a `soft' landing. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody really knows the answer to that proposition. The reason nobody knows is that we have never faced quite this set of economic circumstances. At no time since the end of World War II have we had to deal with a situation of a magnitude that involves the wholesale contraction of community wealth which is now underway in Sydney-and spreading throughout the country-in the form of fast falling house prices. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Walsh continues:</PARA>
<PARA> In looking at the political potency of the Sydney housing bust, which is about to spread through the nation, it is important to note that Saturday's swing against Labor in South Australia occurred because of high interest rates but in a State where housing prices have not yet begun to fall. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Walsh then comments that, as yet, housing prices have been holding up in places like Melbourne, Canberra and Brisbane but he says that soon they will join in the fall in house values. I mention Mr Walsh's article at some length because I believe that Mr Walsh is correct when he says that this is a new phenomenon, a phenomenon brought on by this Government's policy. I do not want to spend any further time drawing out the political implications of that because the Government can work them out as well as I can and no doubt is already doing so. Government members have read the front page of this morning's Sydney Morning Herald, no doubt. They should be under no illusion that that is what is happening and that it will continue to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say that in the months to come we will hear a lot less about the benefits and the tax rorts to be had from negative gearing. One remembers all that stuff we heard about negative gearing, particularly from the Australian Democrats. Anyone who has engaged in negative gearing in recent times is suddenly finding that he has a tiger by the tail, because the property that he bought and negatively geared is now falling in value, not rising, and he is still picking up these heavily inflated interest rates that Mr Keating has imposed on him in the process. So, this involves a whole new ball game, and no-one should be under any illusions about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that now nobody seems to care. Perhaps that is a slight exaggeration; perhaps Mr Hawke and Mr Keating do care. They might care about the fact that interest rates are so high, if only for political reasons. However, the problem they have is that they cannot seem to do anything about the matter. Why is that so? What are the things that they might do about it if they did not have their hands tied in one way or another? For example, they might cut government spending. No, they are not prepared to do that. In the Opposition's Economic Action Plan, brought down just over a month ago, we nominated in great detail $2.7 billion worth of cuts in government spending programs. However the Government itself is not prepared to cut a dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> Can the Government lower taxes? No-at least not responsibly. Of course, it cannot lower taxes because it will not cut spending-unlike the Opposition, which did nominate $2.5 billion worth of tax cuts, including a $2 billion family tax package and a decision to abolish the capital gains tax, a decision which will have the greatest benefit for the 750,000 or 800,000 small business people in this country when it takes place. Can Mr Hawke and Mr Keating lower inflation? No, they cannot lower inflation because they are locked into the so-called accord with the trade union movement. That has produced a situation in which, in the 12 months to the September quarter this year, prices have risen by 8.3 per cent and in which we are expecting a consumer price index for the December quarter, which we will know towards the end of January, that will probably increase the figure; it certainly will not lower it, or will not lower it in any way appreciably. To make matters worse, there is now muted talk about another wage-tax deal between this Government and its failed friends in the trade union movement early next year. </PARA>
<PARA> Can the Government raise productivity? No, it cannot do that. It has run away from doing anything about the shambles on the waterfront. It has run away from doing anything about the shambles with our coastal shipping, with the cost that that imposes on every Australian. The fact is that it costs more to send a motor car direct from Sydney to Auckland than it does to send a motor car from Sydney to Tokyo and back to Auckland. The Government has done nothing, and is not prepared to do anything, about that. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have time to go into detail but, as Senator Alston particularly tells us every second day in this place, in the telecommunications industry the Government is refusing to take on the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association. This is because Telecom Australia is run by its unions, not by the Government and not by the management. The Government is unwilling to take on the major job of privatisation of government business enterprises. Again, this is because the Public Service unions and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) have told it not to. So, any possible micro-economic reforms are blocked off by the Government's associations with its trade union masters. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have the supreme irony of Mr Keating, freshly back from a fortnight's holiday abroad-the Government kept him out of the country until the South Australian election was over-telling us about how the Government might start talking about enterprise unions. What a hide! Enterprise unions from the Australian Labor Party? In my time I have seen some attempts to steal the Opposition's clothes, but that really does take the cake, particularly when we know that it is simply rhetoric. The Government will not be allowed to undertake a move towards enterprise unions because the ACTU will not let it. The great virtue of enterprise unions will be the death of ACTU power in this country. They have to be the end of that power. The ACTU cannot exercise power over a multifarious number of unions, and that indeed, is why its policy is to diminish the number of unions in order to strengthen its power. Enterprise unions work in directly the other way. To have the Treasurer talking as he did about this matter is hypocrisy with a capital H. </PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing very surprising about this; it is the normal thing for Labor governments. After all, Messrs Hawke and Keating have produced the highest and, indeed, the most prolonged interest rate regime on record. From 1972 to 1975 Mr Whitlam produced a shambles in this country from which we have never recovered. To this day we have not recovered from the smash to which Australia was subjected under Mr Whitlam. The Wran-Unsworth Government, which was first elected in 1976, was finally thrown out last year in the greatest landslide, in the end, against Labor in New South Wales since the mid-1930s when Jack Lang was defeated. That result showed the revulsion which the people of New South Wales finally felt for the Labor Government in that State. </PARA>
<PARA> The Cain Government has been in office in Victoria since 1982. There has been one financial scandal after another. There have been the Victorian Economic Development Corporation scandal and the WorkCare scandal. Despite some running repairs to WorkCare, the situation is that WorkCare today has $5 billion-worth of outstanding unfunded liabilities to its discredit. State Bank Victoria this year reported, for the first time in its long and previously quite illustrious history, a massive loss, with write-offs all over the place because of financing bits and pieces of the State Government's schemes. While Mr Cain was certainly re-elected last October, I can only say that it is a great pity for the people of Victoria that he was, and they are coming to see that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Burke-Dowding Government in Western Australia was elected at the same time as the Hawke-Keating Government. There has been one scandal after another: the Swan Building Society, the Teachers Credit Society, Burswood Casino, Rothwells Bank, the State Government Insurance Commission, the Government Employees Superannuation Board, Petrochemical Industries Co. Ltd-the list goes on and on. Now there is a terrific fight going on between the Commissioner of Police and his Deputy. I do not have time to go into all that. I simply want to say, Madam Acting Deputy President, as you would be very well aware, that we have had five Labor governments, Federal and State, and five disasters. Last Saturday, of course, the people of South Australia expressed their opinion of Mr Bannon's Labor Government, which I did not mention, by taking away from it 6 per cent of its previous vote. </PARA>
<PARA> An election campaign is now taking place in Queensland. There has never been a greater need in that State for unity on the conservative side to make sure that what has happened in the other States is not repeated in Queensland-a State whose finances have been extremely well managed, as recently acknowledged by Access Economics Pty Ltd, which has produced figuring for the net public sector funding requirements State by State that shows Queensland having outstandingly the best managed finances of any State in this country. That is not my biased-I suppose one could say-claim; that is the statement of Access Economics based on the Statistician's figures. I simply want to say that we have had enough of the suffering imposed by this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A couple of things need to be said from the Government side to point out the extraordinary deficiencies in what the Opposition has said. The lexicon of Senator Stone's demonology is interesting and instructive. He attacks unions, the former President of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Wran, and Premier Cain. In all his words on a matter of public importance that is allegedly about interest rates, does he give us a formula from the Opposition as to how it would manage the economy to reduce interest rates? Did he utter one sentence on that subject? Did he treat us to an expose on the inner workings of Opposition policy?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The answer to those questions is that he did not; he did not say one single word about what the Opposition would do. Sure, he attacked the Government, and that is a privilege of an opposition. But what is also a right and obligation of an opposition that pretends to be a future government is to say what it would do. But what did Senator Stone say? There was a deafening silence on this. I have to say, surprised though I am, that the intellectual contribution Senator Stone made to the debate this afternoon on economics in Australia was as deafening as his words on how he would bring down interest rates. It was nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say what first attracted me to this debate. What is odd about the fact that Senator Stone-the Leader of the National Party in the Senate, the senior Queensland senator in this place, the former `Joh for PM' campaign acolyte-brings on a matter on interest rates this week, as opposed to any other week? It is obvious, when one pauses for but a brief second. Something happened in South Australia at the weekend from which the Opposition believes it can take heart. The Opposition believes that, by attacking the economic record of this Government-something I will have no trouble in defending in a moment-it can deflect attention in Queensland from what is happening in that State before electors in that blighted Deep North go to the polls next Saturday. I think it passing strange that, in his reflection about Queensland, we heard nothing at all from Senator Stone about the corruption that is rife in that State. </PARA>
<PARA> When one thinks about it, in fact, we have heard nothing at all from the Nationals in this Parliament about the findings in the report of the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct. We have heard nothing at all from the Queensland Nationals in this place about the very serious allegations in the Fitzgerald report against, and cases to answer by, senior figures in Queensland-in the police force, politics and business. We have heard nothing at all about the fact that, under the probings of Mr Drummond, QC, politicians-indeed, Ministers-in the National Party Government in Queensland resign rather than face the music of parliamentary probing about how they use their expense allowances. We have heard nothing at all from Queensland senators in this place arguing those questions. We heard nothing at all either from any of them when, just last week, the erstwhile Premier of Queensland, Russell Cooper, said words tantamount to the effect that, should he continue in office-which is, of course, for him a faint and ever-diminishing hope-he will tear up the Fitzgerald report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not feel constrained to. It is true that Mr Cooper is the Premier of Queensland, but `erstwhile' is the correct description if one takes into account the context of what will happen in the next few days. The significant point that that point of order tried to dodge is that Mr Cooper was reported in the press just last week as saying that, should he continue as Premier, the Fitzgerald report would be torn up. After all the expense to reveal the graft and endemic corruption in the State of Queensland, brought about by Mr Cooper's predecessor, Mr Ahern-for which Mr Ahern must get some acknowledgment-we find it was too rich a brew, or too thick a diet, for the Queensland Nationals. They removed Ahern and put in someone who put a blocker on any further action under that report to bring honesty and light to the pure and public discrimination on the seedy, tawdry and facile actions of the corrupt in the State of Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is clear from this matter of public importance today that the National Party is desperate. It recognises that there is a sea of change in the voting community in Queensland. It knows that Mr Goss, the Queensland Labor Leader, is a refreshing blend of intelligence-which is unusual during the period of government of the Queensland National Party-having the real interests of the ordinary people of Queensland at heart and, most importantly, enshrined above those other principles, being clean, not corrupt, and a man of principle. That is the argument which is sought to be obliterated, so much so that in recent weeks we have seen not only Labor Party people, press commentators and political analysts expounding those views, but also distinguished Liberals, one in particular-a former long time Liberal member of the Victorian Parliament, a former Liberal Speaker of the Victorian Parliament-from whom Senator Parer give me a copy of a letter asking people in Queensland to vote Labor. </PARA>

<PARA> This Government will never dodge the opportunity to call on and debate with the Opposition economic issues, and I now turn to those issues. But I preface them by all that I have said-that this matter of public importance coming from Senator Stone, coming from the sorry reputation and record of the Nationals in this chamber, is an attempt, on the threshold of an election in Queensland, to change the issues, deflect attention and argue that something else is true. The people of Queensland have clearly made up their minds and the only thing left blocking democracy now is the undemocratic gerrymander that applies in Queensland, aimed and designed, against the people's wishes, to keep the Nationals in power to continue their corruption. It is aimed and designed against the people's wishes because-unfortunate, and a travesty of democracy in this country that it is-it is possible to conceive of more than 51 per cent of the people in Queensland voting Labor but still not being able to elect a government. Thus it is that democracy under the Nationals applies in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to one other matter before I commence my economic dissertation. Senator Stone could not leave it alone. It beckons like a pikestaff before his eyes and that of the Opposition, something they are infatuated with daily: the pilots strike. There must be a different solution from the Opposition to the pilots strike today, Monday, than there was yesterday, because its position keeps changing. If one looks at the various positions taken by the Opposition over the pilots dispute and what it would do about it, a couple of interesting threads emerge. Firstly, it seems from all the Opposition says and argues that it is on the side of the pilots; that it wants to see victory in this dispute to the pilots and a wage increase achieved by the pilots that is, I remind the chamber, bigger than the average weekly earnings of an ordinary worker in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps one can look forward to a time-at least in the imagination-when Mr Peacock comes back from a talk with the Australian Federation of Air Pilots waving a piece of paper in the air reminiscent of Neville Chamberlain and saying, `Peace in our time'. It is certainly possible to negotiate a very temporary settlement with the pilots but not to resolve the central issue of the dispute and in fact enable the dispute to continue. Again, we have seen nothing from the Opposition that approaches a reasonable solution to the pilots dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> The final comment I make is that Senator Stone talked about Access Economics Pty Ltd and concluded his argument by relying on figures and commentary on Queensland from Access Economics. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Stone. He need not interject; I take that correction. I take the chamber back to a time at which the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was the Treasurer, the time of the Howard Treasury. At that time, in 1982-83, the previous Government was presiding over a doubling of unemployment. How did the 600,000 families fare at that time when their breadwinners were thrown out of work? How many families were denied roofs over their heads when the number of houses built in Australia fell to only 105,000 in 1982-83? How many families had to struggle to make ends meet when the teenage unemployment rate soared to nearly 30 per cent in 1983? More than one in four of our young people were denied a start in life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today the shadow Minister for Finance has the gall to put forward the matter of public importance that we are debating when he is a co-author of a plan, the so-called Economic Action Plan, which explicitly describes how high interest rates will be the chief economic weapon of a coalition government; hence no reference to it today. Furthermore, he is among the leading advocates of a proposal to abolish the capital gains tax. As I will describe in a moment, that will lead to higher interest rates. In other words, what smattering of economic strategy that can be discerned from the Opposition's Economic Action Plan is one that is definitely anti-family. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast, this Government has consistently implemented pro-family policies. Under this Government 1.5 million new jobs have been created. Breadwinners again have an opportunity to provide for their families. The teenage unemployment rate has been more than halved, removing the stress on family life generated by children being forced onto the dole. The school retention rate has doubled from one-third to two-thirds, which has given children a better start in life and ended the time in which parents, out of concern, parked their children in educational institutions rather than let them face unemployment. Now they have a chance to remain in educational institutions to learn skills and gain qualifications to fit them for careers. </PARA>
<PARA> We have increased the family allowance and indexed it to the rate of inflation to protect its real value-a policy that I note is not endorsed by the Opposition. We have had the landmark family allowance supplement, which has lifted children from poverty. Since March 1983, 930,000 homes have been constructed in Australia, housing families at an average of 150,000 a year-50 per cent higher than in 1983. The home ownership rate in Australia has risen from 71.5 per cent in 1984 to 73.4 per cent in December last year. We have increased the number of child-care places from 46,000 in 1983 to 114,000 now, with an additional 30,000 promised in the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are all part of our record of achievement for families. Families, small businesses and farmers have all benefited from these advances. In particular, they have benefited from Labor's cut in small business tax rates from a prohibitive 78c in the dollar-a 46c company tax and a 60c top marginal tax rate on the remainder-to no more than 47c in the dollar. What could be more anti-small business than a confiscatory tax of 78c in the dollar?</PARA>
<PARA> In contrast with our record of support for families and small business, Senator Stone, the shadow spokesman on finance, continued with his knocking, carping and gloomy routine. Senator Stone has no intention of offering any economic strategy of real concern for families or small business. His policy is, as Ross Gittins, the economic correspondent in the Sydney Morning Herald, described it:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a recipe for slow growth, weak investment, rising unemployment, falling real wages, high interest rates and an over-valued dollar'. </PARA>
<PARA>But the Australian people will not be so easily misled. They will recognise that the Opposition parties-more so under their present leadership-have no capability whatsoever to deal with Australia's external challenge and therefore to deal effectively with interest rates. The challenge must be seen in perspective. It does the Opposition no credit when it seeks selectively to quote statements about the external debt. More balanced commentary has come from such highly respected commentators as the former President of the Business Council of Australia, Sir Roderick Carnegie, and the former Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Bob Johnston. They have in recent times made much more balanced commentary. Like the Government, these commentators recognise that Australia's external debt is an issue but they do not attempt to scaremonger in the irresponsible way that Senator Stone has in the past, although he did not do very much of it today. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the facts? Australia's gross external debt of $137 billion, after making allowance for our official reserve assets and lending abroad, represents a net debt of about $108 billion. This is equal to a debt ratio of about 32 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), about 2 per cent less than the recent peak of September 1986. As at the end of 1987, which is the most recent comparison available, Australia's gross external debt as a proportion of GDP was almost exactly equal to the average of the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and was lower than the rate in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal and Sweden and about half that of Argentina and Mexico. While the Macquarie Bank speculates on an external debt ratio of 59 per cent of GDP by the year 2000, studies commissioned by the Economic Planning Advisory Council suggest that the debt ratio could stabilise at around 30 to 35 per cent of GDP by the mid-1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> Of our external debt burden, the Commonwealth is a net creditor via its roughly $18 billion of debt being more than offset by $21 billion of official reserve assets. Sixty-two per cent of Australia's net external debt is owed by the private sector. The Commonwealth Government has actively been repaying debt abroad to such an extent that the Commonwealth's foreign currency debt has fallen from $15 billion at the end of June 1987 to $9 billion at the end of June 1989. By the end of this financial year Commonwealth debt on issue will be equal to only 13 per cent of GDP-less than half of what it was four years ago. I see that I am running out of time and will not be able to complete my address but I am sure that Senator Maguire will make many of these economic points when he speaks in this debate on behalf of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the basic and fundamental theme that the Senate is a House in which politics are played. It is not necessarily a forum in which economic remedies are dispassionately and objectively analysed. When the Opposition brings forward an economic argument in this context, does it do so with reference to tables and analysis? No, it does not. Senator Stone, who is distinguished in the field of economics-albeit from a wrong philosophical base; but nonetheless he is recognised by his peers as a distinguished economist-has not chosen to do that today. Instead, he chose to trivialise the debate in order to deflect attention in Queensland away from what Queensland's electors face on Saturday-a choice between a government that will kick out the decay, overcome the corruption and prosecute those responsible, and will do it fairly and properly without fear or favour-which is the only choice, as many prominent Liberals have said, that the electors in Queensland have--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance that Senator Stone has proposed today states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The suffering inflicted on homebuyers, farmers and other small business by the very high interest rates resulting from the failure of the Hawke/Keating Government's economic policies. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposal really should read `the suffering inflicted on the Labor Government and the coalition Opposition by the South Australian voters resulting from the failure of either the Hawke-Keating Government or the Peacock-Howard Opposition's economic policies'. It is interesting that so far in this debate both Government and Opposition senators have wanted to talk only about next Saturday in Queensland rather than last Saturday in South Australia. The voters of South Australia have clearly shown that they believe that the suffering, to which Senator Stone referred, inflicted on home buyers, farmers and small business-indeed on the whole community-by excessively high interest rates will not go away simply with the change of government. Kenneth Davidson has said in today's Melbourne Age:</PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that high interest rates were the election issue in the South Australian campaign, and the South Australian electorate is a reasonable reflection of the national electorate, it would seem that, while the electorate is fed up with the Hawke/Keating Government, electors are by no means certain that a Peacock-led Opposition has the answers either. </PARA>
<PARA>He pointed out in that article that the Opposition illustrated by its behaviour in the House of Representatives last week that it was hoping `to ride to victory on the back of high interest rates while proposing policies that, in all probability, could force interest rates even higher'. Perhaps that is the answer to Senator Cook's complaint-that Senator Stone really did not address the issue directly in his contribution. Not having been able to get a full transcript at this stage, I will paraphrase what Mr Peter Duncan, the Federal member for the seat of Makin in South Australia, said on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's radio program AM this morning: `The Liberal Party has almost an identical policy in relation to monetary issues and, given the ideas of John Stone, would probably be keener on an even tougher monetary policy than we have got'. Or I could quote from the speech made by Senator Stone on Friday, although I do not need to because he has said it again in this chamber this afternoon. He said that the Government cannot let interest rates fall and that, were the Opposition to be swept into government, it would not let interest rates fall, but that there is no magic wand; indeed, it is a case of more of the same. To make the point I will again use Kenneth Davidson's remarks in this morning's Age:</PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the voters in South Australia understand that the budgetary stance of the Peacock Opposition is the same as the budgetary stance of the Hawke/Keating Government, which means that they will both have to rely to the same degree on monetary policy and wages policy for restraint. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition in this place cannot take any comfort from the South Australian election. I will cite a few quick figures to demonstrate that. There was a feeble attempt by Senator Stone to take some comfort from the figures. Perhaps we will see why it was such a gentle attempt. The Liberals' vote in South Australia was down; the Democrats' vote was up. The vote was up in a few lower House single-member electorate seats. In the seat of Alexandria, a Liberal-held country seat, the vote was up by 15 per cent, which is unprecedented in our history in that State. It was up 18 per cent in the seat of Devonport, a Liberal-held city seat; 16 per cent in the seat of Heysen, a Liberal-held seat in the hills area of Adelaide; and, just to look at the other side of things, 15 per cent was achieved in several metropolitan Labor seats. We achieved double figures in a number of marginal Liberal-held seats. In the past the Democrats have not really expected that sort of result in marginal seats. In fact, the Liberals lost votes to the Democrats in several seats, among them Bragg, Chaffey and Custance. There were even in some Labor-held and Liberal-swinging seats--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. I was illustrating the context of an election campaign in which Senator Parer's Party ran on the Federal issue of interest rates and Government economic policy. I have finished my statistics, so Senator Parer might feel some relief. Everything I was using to illustrate the situation has occurred because the Opposition does not have a leg to stand on. It cannot show-as it did not show in this debate or in the same debate generated by the same shadow finance spokesman on the appropriate occasion last Friday-that it can do any better or any different. We need to look at the Opposition's record. There has been enthusiastic support for: the Government's deregulation of the financial system; entry of foreign banks; floating of the dollar; and increased foreign borrowings and ownership, in spite of a National Party policy, certainly in Queensland, against this. This was illustrated by Senator Stone and his colleagues voting in this very place against a register of foreign ownership, which register was raised at the instigation of the Australian Democrats. At this point I indicate that there has been a desperate attempt by the Opposition to show that there is some difference between it and the Government, whose policies it is so critical of in this matter of public importance before us today, which difference has focused on the issue of wages policy. In his article this morning, Ken Davidson further stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thus, credibility on interest rates boils down to credibility on wages policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Because of that widely acknowledged similarity in the monetary policy area, on which I have quoted a number of people this morning from both sides, that credibility has to be demonstrated through the Opposition's wages policy. It is not just monetary policy on which the Opposition and the Government have been the same. As I indicated in debate last Friday, they have become birds of a feather in a number of areas: charges for tertiary education, concentrated ownership of the media, and various other areas which the public is now seeing. This desperate attempt to focus on wages policy is about all that the Opposition can come up with. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at that wages policy we see that there is a difference. The Australian Labor Party (ALP), in government, has based its wages policy on the accord. Maybe a comment on that might be appropriate at this point. I refer to an article in the Melbourne Age on 16 November by Ken Davidson in which he pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA> Wage restraint through the accord has been a key factor in the strong growth of employment and output in recent years. And it has been maintained despite the strong demand for labor since the end of 1988, which would have resulted in a wages explosion had it not been for the discipline applied through the accord. </PARA>
<PARA> The Business Council of Australia, together with the Opposition, wants to scrap the accord in favour of enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA>It is important to mention that employer organisations are divided on this issue. That is noted in this article. Among them is the Metal Trades Industry Association, whose head, Mr Bert Evans, in the Sir Richard Kirby Lecture at the Wollongong University, outlined some of those concerns when he said that the move was opposed by the MTIA because it would lead to inflationary wage settlements, as the biggest gains negotiated with one enterprise in the industry would be imposed on the rest through comparative wage justice. He pointed out that the spread of inflationary wage settlements would be facilitated in his industry through factory-by-factory negotiations conducted by national, not enterprise, unions. Ken Davidson suggests that, if Mr Evans is correct in his assessment of the wages policies advocated by the Business Council and the Opposition, the inevitable result would be a precipitation of a devaluation of the Australian dollar and a recession. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said in a debate similar to this debate on Friday, that brings us to what I am beginning to term the Sir Roderick Carnegie solution. Sir Roderick has told us that we can get out of this economic mess in the same way we did in the 1890s and the 1930s. If we reflect on how that occurred, we do see depression. Perhaps we can get away with recession this time-who knows? It is not a very attractive picture if the Opposition does push that one difference that it can show between it and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly there is a need for an alternative. The South Australian voters have demonstrated that many in the community agree with the Australian Democrats when we say that there is a need for an alternative. We have said that we provide an alternative. We have said that an incremental approach in industrial relations, without ideological blinkers towards government intervention and regulation, is important on the basis of social or economic need. Indeed, we have said that often. I will not use our own words this morning. I will refer, again, to Kenneth Davidson's article in the Age this morning. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats, for instance, have just completed an overhaul of their tax policies that could form a lesson in rationality for both the major parties, whose relentless seeking after an electoral majority apparently means they are incapable of developing tax policies that serve both the interests of national efficiency and individual equity. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say that, given that this has developed a policy platform built around the integration of social justice and environmental issues into economic decision making, this has been noticed in the community. This is the sort of policy direction which will be needed. It is the only sort of policy direction which can save us from, if you like, the Carnegie solution. </PARA>
<PARA> In this morning's newspapers we have seen reports of the latest Economic Planning Advisory Council report which has warned that poverty will get worse, that poverty is in danger of being entrenched in our community, that in the 1990s poverty will be worse than in the 1960s. If for no other reason, I think that should motivate us towards and should make us realise the need for the situation reported in an article in this morning's Age newspaper which said:</PARA>
<PARA> A broader range of other social policies will also be necessary, as well as a commitment to maintain them over the realistic period of time, for the problem of poverty to be tackled. </PARA>
<PARA>It is that very integrated approach in policy making, which has been referred to by Davidson, which the community in South Australia has acknowledged is necessary and which it had searched for in the Labor Government and in the coalition Opposition, but all in vain. I do not think it is sufficient for a virtual identical motion to be brought before this chamber today in preparation for yet another State election to get either the Opposition or the Government away from acknowledging what has happened in South Australia. It is important to look at what has happened-apart from the figures which upset Senator Parer so much-and perhaps at some of the commentary in conclusion. The Australian Labor Party National Secretary has responded, as reported in today's Australian newspaper, with this statement:</PARA>
<PARA> `We understand that there's a lot of hurt, a lot of resentment out there because of the squeeze on the hip-pocket nerve, because of interest rates and other factors like that,' he said on Channel Nine's Sunday program. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that that represents a breakthrough on behalf of the people of Australia. Further, Mr Bannon, the narrowly successful Premier, has been reported as saying that the result in South Australia is saying something about the two-party political system and something that the two major parties must have some regard to. In an article in this morning's Sun News-Pictorial Niki Savva said:</PARA>
<PARA> The vote showed there is plenty of room for another major force in Australian politics. At the moment it's the Democrats . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is the message: alternative economic policies are needed, not more of Tweedledum and Tweedle-even-dumber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the matter of public importance raised by my coalition colleague Senator Stone, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The suffering inflicted on homebuyers, farmers and other small business by the very high interest rates resulting from the failure of the Hawke/Keating Government's economic policies. </PARA>
<PARA>This Hawke-Keating Government, by its macro-economic policies over a lot of years and its failure to act on micro-economic reform, has brought the Australian economy precariously close to a Third World country status. What a dismal record after seven years. Yet over the years we have heard the Treasurer (Mr Keating) say that running the economy was fun. It might be fun for him, but it has not been fun for Australians. He said that it was only a matter of pulling levers. Year in and year out the Treasurer has made forecasts about the hard times being over and the economy improving, and each year he has been very wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> All sorts of excuses have been given. One in particular that comes to mind is the unexpected downturn in our terms of trade. Of course there was the classic remark, that home buyers today will only too well remember, that there are too many people in Australia who want a home with a backyard and a Hills hoist. Everyone will remember that great statement. We have heard that the reason for the frightening growth in our current account deficit has been on the one hand a surge in investment spending in capital goods which will pay dividends in the long run. I would have thought that seven years was long enough and most Australians today would say that it was far too long. On the other hand it is claimed by the Government that the cause of the growing current account deficit is that ordinary Australians are spending too much on consumption goods; that is, buying imported goods that we are unable to make in Australia mainly because of an antiquated centralised industrial relations system which absolutely guarantees a comparative lack of productivity and interest rates at a level which precludes new investment and destroys what is already there. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government cannot have it both ways as to the reason for the level of imports. But the response from the Government is to tighten monetary policy-in other words, to treat the symptoms and not the disease that it has had seven years in which to cure. That is the problem. That is what Senator Stone referred to. It is a policy that clearly has not worked. At this stage we are enjoying over a relatively long period our best terms of trade in a decade. In both price and volume terms our exports over the past year in the main have been the best we have had for 10 years. The single lever theory has been: tighten monetary policy, interest rates rise, the exchange rate is propped up, demand for consumption goods will be reduced and imports will be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> What has the Government achieved with its policies? Our current account deficit for the four months from July to October now stands at $8.2 billion. It is estimated that our foreign debt is increasing at the rate of our total annual sugar exports every 20 days. Net foreign debt has risen in seven years of hard labour from about $33 billion to about $110 billion. Home interest rates have risen in the last seven years from 13.5 per cent to 17 per cent notwithstanding promises from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) at the time of the Western Australian election in February this year that interest rates would be down by Christmas. In fact, to check the veracity of this Government and this Prime Minister I thought I would just go back over the period that this Government has been in power and pick out a few remarks, almost on a yearly basis. In 1984 on a John Laws radio program, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . because inflation is coming down and inflationary expectations are down, interest rates will come down too. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1985 on the PM program the Treasurer, Mr Keating, said:</PARA>
<PARA>I still stand by the remark I made in the election campaign that I think there is an interest rate step fall ahead for Australia and its interest rate structure generally to 1985. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1986 the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is so obvious that it is hardly necessary to say it, but everyone in this country would like to see lower interest rates. Of course, what we are about is to secure a situation in which we will be able to enjoy permanently lower interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1987 in the House of Representatives the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>We look to 1987 with a cautious optimism about the economy including a fall in interest rates in 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>On 28 January 1989, when campaigning in Perth before the Western Australian election, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>Now when those things occur (adjustments brought about by economic policy), as I believe they will, it's those sorts of circumstances that will produce the environment within which interest rates can fall. </PARA>
<PARA>On the same day the Melbourne Age reported that, when asked in Perth whether interest rates would fall this year, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>They'll go down this year. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday he was asked whether there was a chance rates might rise before they fell. He said, `No, I don't believe so.'</PARA>
<PARA>These interest rates are driving ordinary, average Australians to desperation. They are pressing families to cut back on essentials and, in many cases, driving them out of their homes. Charities such as the St Vincent de Paul Society and the Salvation Army are reporting record requests from families on or below average weekly earnings just for food and clothing. Of greater long term significance is the inability of young married couples even to contemplate purchasing their own homes. This has occurred over a period of seven years under this Government, and all honourable senators opposite do is get up every now and then and say that they care. All this Government cares about is big government, big unions and a couple of rich mates. This Government has completely lost touch with the aspirations of average Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The Real Estate Institute of Australia found that more than 30 per cent of the average family income in Queensland is now needed to meet home loan repayments. That is well above the established affordability benchmark of 25 per cent of average family income. Queensland families are now paying, on average, $185 more for their mortgages than they were just 12 months ago. The blame for this dreadful situation lies squarely with this Hawke Labor Government and its failed economic policies. It has deliberately pursued a policy of high interest rates in an attempt to dampen spending, as I indicated earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly enough, the Queensland Labor Leader, Mr Wayne Goss, must also share the blame because he continues to support the high interest rate policies of his Federal comrades despite the obvious suffering they are causing home buyers. In fact, Mr Goss said in a television interview some two or three months ago that high interest rates were not an important issue in Queensland. What an incredible statement!</PARA>

In fact, I notice that, even after the South Australian election, the Labor pollster is saying that he thought that, in the recent election campaign in South Australia, interest rates were vastly exaggerated as an issue. I wonder what people over there thought the issue was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the past 12 months overdraft rates for borrowings of less than $100,000 have risen to over 22 per cent. I submit that few, if any, legitimate businesses in the competitive areas of our economy can cope with these sorts of interest rates and an inflated exchange rate. It is impossible for anyone in an industry competing with imports when equivalent rates overseas are around 6 per cent for Japan, 8 per cent for Germany and 10 per cent for the United States of America. This Government has consistently delivered to Australians the highest interest rates in our history and in the industrial world. What a shameful record! Is that all this Government has to show after seven years in office? As I indicated earlier, year in and year out, for seven years, members of this Government have stood up and said, `Things will get better next year'. Of course, we should add to that the month-in, month-out increases in the cost of living of families as reflected in the consumer price index-a figure locked in at around 8 per cent which is 50 per cent higher than the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average. So much for the accord. </PARA>
<PARA> In Queensland the comrades of the Federal Labor Government do not want to talk about these issues. They are doing everything in their power to distance themselves from their Federal colleagues. The Queensland Labor Leader, Mr Goss, is even pretending that he is not part of the Labor Party. It is significant that the only visit made to Queensland in the State election campaign was to Mount Isa where even the local Trades and Labour Council gave him the thumbs down. </PARA>

<PARA> The Leader of the Labor Party in Queensland, Mr Goss, has warned candidates to brace themselves for an avalanche of what he calls `mud-slinging'. Senator Cook was very quick to talk about corruption but he did not mention the corruption brought upon every Australian and every Queenslander by the failed economic policies of this Government. Mr Goss has said that, if any mention is made in this State election campaign of Labor's high interest rates, which affect every mortgagee and every business, and if any mention is made of entrenched trade union power, that is mud-slinging. Let me quote, for example, from what the Prime Minister said just this year in addressing the Australian Workers Union:</PARA>
<PARA> Trade unionists once sought political representation through the political wing of the labour movement; now they are vital partners with the Labor Party in government. </PARA>
<PARA>He was telling the people of Queensland that, if the Labor Party should happen to get into power up there, every committee and every qango would have trade union representation. There would be no attempt to break down the corruption on the waterfront which has almost brought this country to its knees. The waterfront, which affects this country's potential to export, in turn could correct our current account deficit. It has been estimated that that corruption is costing this country over $1 billion a year directly. I think it is a matter of getting this corruption into some sort of perspective. If the Labor Leader in Queensland, Mr Goss, says that, if we raise that matter, it is mud-slinging, so it is. He has said that it is mud-slinging to refer to the continuing price increases in the supermarkets and the cumulative effects of Labor's policies in reducing the standard of living of every Queenslander. As occurred at the South Australian election last Saturday, at the Queensland election next Saturday Queenslanders have the opportunity to give Labor a message: `After seven years we have hurt enough, we have had enough and Labor cannot be trusted'. </PARA>

For example, the State electorate of Newland, which is certainly part of a region of South Australia which has the highest rate of home purchasing anywhere in Australia, had the lowest swing against the Government on Saturday night. I was commentating on one of the television networks and I certainly saw many of the figures that were coming in. It seemed to be the case that the seat of Newland in the Tea Tree Gully region had a very low swing. I understand that the seat of Bright, which is another part of the metropolitan area, the southern part, which is also a mortgage-belt electorate, had a relatively low swing. </PARA>
<PARA> So, I would like to do some further research on the figures. At this stage I must say that Mr Rod Cameron may well be right. If he made the remarks that were attributed to him a moment ago he may well be right-that the State election in South Australia was determined by a range of issues and perhaps interest rates was not the dominant feature. I would like to look at that. </PARA>
<PARA> We have high interest rates in this country because we have a balance of payments current account deficit. Our overseas trading deficit, including services, is in a situation where we expend more overseas than people overseas expend in Australia. We are trying to encourage capital to come to Australia to finance that deficit. The deficit is occurring because Australia's economy has been growing too fast. It is as simple as that. We have had very high rates of economic growth in Australia. The consequence of economic growth is the importation of large volumes of overseas goods. That is the phenomenon that has been occurring in Australia. For example, last financial year the total amount of production in Australia, the gross national product, rose by 3.3 per cent. That is a reality; it is on the record: there was a 3.3 per cent growth in total production in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Total expenditure in Australia-I think Senator Stone is talking about that-gross expenditure, grew by 7.7 per cent. We had that automatic spillover, imports surge if you like, on the products brought in from other countries. Of course, a high growth situation is the reverse of the situation faced by the Liberals when they were in government. They have not ruled in a situation of high economic growth for many years. They are uncomfortable with it. They are more comfortable with doom and gloom, recession and driving Australia's economy into the floor. That is what happened in the early 1980s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the problems we have in Australia is that an investment surge is occurring. I did not make the figures up, and I am sure that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) did not make them up. The fact is that in the last financial year there was a 16 per cent growth in business investment in Australia. An astounding investment boom is occurring in this country to make Australia more productive. It is the biggest investment boom in this country's history, certainly in the twentieth century. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of public importance that Senator Stone has raised in the context of the Queensland election refers to farmers and other small businesses, as well as homebuyers. If there is a 16 per cent growth in investment across the Australian economy, farmers and small businesses must be investing. It is such a phenomenally high aggregate figure for investment expansion in this country that all sectors must be sharing in it. It must be very difficult for anybody to identify a sector which is not experiencing the 16 per cent growth factor. We have to be very mindful of those factors when looking at this matter of public importance. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the alternatives to high interest rates? High interest rates are not existing in a vacuum; they are there for an economic reason. What are the alternatives? One of them would be to let the value of the Australian dollar go down compared with overseas currencies. The short impact of that would be that the prices of imported goods would rise dramatically. Competitors of those imported products would raise their prices and we would find price rises occurring across the board. We would see the consumer price index pushed upwards as import prices rise and we would simply have extra inflation in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the alternatives to the high interest rates we have at the moment would be a higher level of inflation and higher price rises. Do the Liberals want that as an alternative? We have deafening silence from those on the other side of the chamber about what they see as an alternative to high interest rates. The danger is that if we did not have high interest rates, if the capital was not coming into Australia to finance the balance of payments deficit, there would be an inflationary surge in the Australian economy. The Liberals have a very poor record on inflation. When they left office in 1983 we had double-digit inflation in Australia. Not only did we have very high and rising unemployment but also we had high inflation. The consumer price index under the Liberals in their last 12 months in government rose by 11 1/2 per cent. Today they are being very silent about what they see as the alternatives to high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that the Liberal Party in government up to 1983 did as much to reduce interest rates as Harold Lasseter did for Australian gold production. That is the fact, that is the reality. It cannot deliver on interest rates. It is incapable of delivering on interest rates. A key determinant of interest rates is the inflation rate, the deflator for gross domestic product or, more popularly, the consumer price index. Those indexes affect interest rates to some extent. Lenders build into their lending rates their estimate of the inflation rate to ensure that they get a return on their funds in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to compare inflation rates. I just mentioned the rate of inflation under the Liberals a moment ago. It was 11 1/2 per cent in their last 12 months of office. Under Labor that inflation rate has been wound back dramatically. At present we have an 8.3 per cent rate of growth in the consumer price index. We do not have a 9 per cent growth rate in inflation, we certainly do not have a 10 per cent rate of growth in inflation, and we certainly do not have the whopping 11 1/2 per cent surge in consumer prices which occurred when the Liberals were in power. On that one particular determinant of interest rates we have wound back, and I am sure that the management of the economy under Labor will achieve further reductions in, the rate of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> We should also look at aspects of government spending. The Liberals also claim that they would do something to wind back interest rates by cutting government spending. I presume that the argument is the old crowding out effect, which has become a bit discredited in economics. The idea is that if a government goes out and borrows money it somehow forces up interest rates for other borrowers. That seems to be the type of logic being used by the Opposition. It says that it would cut government spending and therefore reduce that pressure on lending rates in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that the Hawke Labor Government has already cut government spending dramatically. We have seen the share of gross domestic product taken by government spending reduced dramatically time and time again under this Hawke Labor Government. For example, when the Liberals left office in 1983 government spending accounted for 28.9 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product. That is a fairly high figure. The figure this financial year under the Hawke Labor Government is not 27 per cent or 25 per cent. In fact, it is estimated to come in at 23.7 per cent of gross domestic product. If there is some validity in that argument about crowding out, government borrowings somehow forcing up interest rates for other borrowers, then certainly the Labor Government has done more than could ever be expected of it in winding back in that particular area. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important to realise that the Liberal Party in its rhetoric about interest rates overstates interest rates in making comparisons with the past. In the past people could not just roll into a bank and say, `I need X thousand dollars to purchase a family home'. When people did that in years gone by they got only part of the loan at the low interest rate and were then sent around to the banks' hire purchase company or finance company or were told to get a personal loan. In other words, they had to have a second mortgage at a much higher interest rate. So the average rate of interest on borrowed funds in the past was much higher than those opposite would have us believe. We have to look at the effective rate on the first and second mortgage. I certainly had to take out a very expensive second mortgage to purchase my first family home. I was simply told to go to the bank's other arm and get a personal loan at a much higher interest rate. I am sure that many Australians did that in the past, but they no longer have to do that when purchasing a home. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the high interest rates this year, more dwellings are being commenced under the Labor Government than were ever commenced under the Liberals in office. Let us get to the real bricks and mortar activity; let us look at the real housing commencements in Australia. When the Liberals were in power there were 105,000 housing starts in its last year of office. Under Labor last financial year the figure was in the vicinity of 160,000. Under the Labor Government there has been at least a 50 per cent rise in the number of annual housing starts in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I noticed that previous speakers on this matter talked about Queensland. It is very instructive to look at the housing starts in Queensland when the Liberals were in power in Canberra and compare them to those of the present day. Under the Hawke Labor Government in the last financial year there were 40,400 housing starts in Queensland, but in the last year that the Liberals occupied the treasury bench in Canberra there were not 40,000 and there certainly were not 30,000: all that could be managed under the Federal coalition Government in that period was 24,000 housing starts. In other words, 15,800 fewer dwellings were commenced in Queensland under a Federal coalition government than there were under the Hawke Labor Government in the last financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> One factor that has boosted housing starts under the Labor Government is the first home owners scheme. It was introduced by Mr Hawke in his 1983 policy speech. It is a targeted scheme and, very importantly, it is income tested: it is not available to the wealthy. Previous Liberal Party schemes were certainly available to people on very high incomes. Lower and middle income people are helped under this scheme to purchase their first home. They get assistance of up to $5,000 over five years to purchase their first home. Nationally, since that scheme started under Labor, $1,400m-I did not say $400m-has been spent on the first home owners scheme and 328,000 Australian families have been assisted. I would like to put on record this afternoon that in Queensland, which, as I pointed out, appears to be the subject of this matter, under the Hawke Labor Government 62,500 families have been assisted under the first home owners scheme, with total approved expenditure in that State amounting to a massive $244m. That is a very large level of spending under the first home owners scheme in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that has not been talked about here today is the cost of building land. The Liberals would have us believe some fiction that the only thing that determines how many houses are built in Australia is the level of interest rates. That is not true. I remember serving on a working party in the South Australian Government over a couple of years, and it was quite clear then that the cost of building allotments was a major determinant of home ownership. The Commonwealth Government itself has made it clear it will put on the market 27,000 allotments over the next five years to boost the supply of new building allotments, not by restricting demand so much but by boosting supply and in that way keeping down the price of building land. The Hawke Labor Government gives priority to housing. The first home owners scheme has been a major initiative and there are more housing starts under Labor than there ever were under the Liberal Government. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I commence by welcoming a report as detailed and as comprehensive as this one. In particular, I pay tribute to those responsible for putting it together in a way which is readily understandable and for providing in it an index of some 11 pages which allows one to seek out within two very complicated departments a quick reference to issues which are of concern. I hope that will become an increasing trend in authority and departmental reports. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to mention only one or two things arising from this annual report. The first is the interesting divergence one finds if one looks at the statistical area of this report, particularly at tables 17 and 18, which deal with notifiable diseases. They give details of the diseases notified according to the necessary statutory requirements and the communicable diseases intelligence information obtained by virus laboratory reports received in the same period. What is interesting is the fact that the two do not entirely coincide. The reason they do not coincide is that in a large number of these areas people in the medical profession do not notify, for various reasons, the extent of the disease which they are treating. When one looks at this within the context of the policy on the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), one sees that the reliance which has often been placed on legislative prescriptions that certain things must be notified is simply demonstrated as essentially a very weak tool to be used as far as monitoring the progress of the disease is concerned. Those who put reliance primarily upon legislative authority in these areas will find that these figures provide further evidence that their best endeavours will be confounded. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing I want to say about the communicable diseases intelligence data is that it shows the increase in the incidence of one particular disease over a period of years. That disease is Ross River fever, which has now declined from a peak of 1,623 in 1984 to a figure of 679 in 1988. I draw attention to the fact that this is one of the diseases which are affected very much by environmental conditions. If the predictions of changes in the Australian climate as a result of the greenhouse effect are borne out, this is one of those environmental-related diseases in which we are likely to see an increase in incidence-a disease that is mosquito borne and transmitted. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer to only two other matters in the very brief time we have available. The first is to draw attention to the details this report gives of the Government's continuing program in the fight against AIDS. I congratulate the Government, which has received bipartisan support on this matter, for the expenditure and the programs which have been undertaken. I still do not believe that the popular media, those in television and those responsible for controlling advertising, are pulling their weight in assisting the Government. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to Mr Warren Talbot, who has recently retired as the Executive Director of the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations to take up a position with the Government of Tasmania where he will be working on the continuing fight against this disease. </PARA>
<PARA> I indicate just how unfortunate the lack of information provided in relation to aspects of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is within this annual report and in particular the false impression which is given that the database study which has been the object of so much attention in this chamber was, in fact, an adequate study and was adequately dealt with. Those criticisms, nevertheless, having been made, I believe this is a useful and significant report. It is well prepared and presented. I hope that it will become something of a model for other annual reports in terms of complexity of major departments. </PARA>

However, I echo the words of my predecessor in this debate, Senator Puplick, that it is a very commendable report. My only reason for rising to make a contribution to the debate is that I was inspired by Senator Puplick's reference to Ross River fever. On Saturday last, a member of my staff, Sue Reid, contacted me at home indicating that her doctor had just diagnosed her as a victim of Ross River fever. She is probably lying in her bed back in Perth listening attentively to this debate. I now put on the record that I wish her a speedy recovery. I am sure that all those senators present in the chamber join me in that. It is a particularly debilitating illness. Its victims certainly know they have an illness.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The document that has been circulated is the third in a series resulting from a successful motion that I moved in the Senate on 29 November last year. In the previous documents 74 pieces of legislation were referred to. This time there are 75. So we do not seem to be progressing a great deal, although when one does a more detailed analysis one finds that there has been progress and that some of the additions are unavoidable. I refer to page 17 of the document. Some of the Acts had been overlooked previously. For example, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy suddenly discovered that there were a number of Acts that it did not know about that had been passed by the Parliament but that were unproclaimed. They are, for example: the Minerals (Submerged Lands) (Exploration Permit Fees) Act, the Minerals (Submerged Lands) (Production Licence Fees) Act, the Minerals (Submerged Lands) (Works Authority Fees) Act, the Minerals (Submerged Lands) (Registration Fees) Act and the Minerals (Submerged Lands) (Royalty) Act. If the Department did not know it had the Acts in its possession I do not suppose anybody else in the community would realise that the Parliament has spent a great deal of time passing Acts which even the Department did not know existed. A fascinating aspect should be brought to the Senate's attention. The explanation which is required says this:</PARA>
<PARA>These Acts cannot be proclaimed until complementary legislation has been passed by the States and the Northern Territory so that a uniform offshore minerals regime may be established in accordance with the offshore constitutional settlement. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us remember that this is a 1981 Act. This is the glacial exercise we sometimes find. The explanation continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Development of this legislation was suspended pending a review of the offshore constitutional settlement, which was instituted following the change of government in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA>That, by the way, was the incoming Labor Government. We are talking about almost seven years ago, when the Labor Government was first elected. The explanation goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Since then the Commonwealth, States and the Northern Territory have decided on major amendments that need to be made to the Minerals (Submerged Lands) Act 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>That must have been a hoot of a committee to sit on. The explanation continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Completion of the drafting of these amendments has been delayed by higher priority bills. </PARA>
<PARA>So presumably they got around to deciding on something but it had to be put aside because priority was given elsewhere. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Subject to the priorities of the Government's legislation program, it is envisaged that amendments of the Act will be introduced during the 1990 autumn sittings of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>Presumably by the incoming Liberal government, I suppose Senator Puplick will probably want to add. It would be somewhat ironic if the whole seven years of the Labor Government were taken up in discussion. We might even start back at the beginning. I will be able to have a go at Senator Puplick on this next year when nothing has been done. The explanation continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Following passage of these amendments-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, these amendments which have not yet been introduced but which might be introduced some time next year-</PARA>
<PARA>the States and the Northern Territory would then be able to finalise their legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us remember that we got into this because it says that the Act cannot be proclaimed until complementary legislation has been passed. So it is a nice little chicken and egg exercise and I am not sure where we come out. </PARA>

<PARA> These Acts cannot be proclaimed until complementary legislation has been passed by the States and the Northern Territory . . . </PARA>
<PARA>However, they cannot get their act in order until we pass our amendments. So presumably when we get these done, the States and the Northern Territory will pass theirs, the legislation will come back and we might be able to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish all of this had been decided on in 1981-it would have made things a darned sight easier-instead of the Parliament spending a good deal of its time pushing something around that nobody had any intention, presumably, of doing something about for another eight or nine years. Indeed, a great deal of the legislation that will go through in the next four weeks could be dealt with in the same fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Health Legislation Amendment Act, under community services and health, was on the previous list. It is on this list also. But progress has been made, let us not fear. Previously with regard to these matters we did not have this agreement. I read from the last explanation we had:</PARA>
<PARA> A decision on whether to amend, repeal or retain the provision is expected to be made shortly. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that honourable senators will be agog to know that this decision has been made shortly and that now we have a new reason as to why nothing is going to happen, which is that there is now agreement at the Commonwealth level that an amendment is required to the definition of `personnel supervisor' in section 3aa. The nature of the amendment is yet to be settled and agreed on by the State health Ministers preparatory to the drafting of the amendment and a subsequent proclamation of the amended section. Presumably we will see that another day. It only goes back to 1986, so I suppose that we should not be too upset about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Under employment, education and training we have a new item. It says in regard to the Student Assistance Amendment Act:</PARA>
<PARA> These sections will automatically commence on 1 January 1990 under subsection 2 (3) of the Act, unless they are proclaimed sooner. It is unlikely that these sections will be proclaimed sooner because the associated regulations are still being drafted. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to draw attention to that because there is now a drafting instruction from the Government which requires that there be that type of provision in the Act. The reason for my drawing this to the attention of honourable senators is that, from a number of comments made by Ministers and others, there is now a concerted effort on the part of the bureaucracy to overturn the motion that was passed and actually makes this type of thing occur. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw this to the attention of the Senate because I believe that if we give in to this move-in other words, if we do not demand the continuation of this in the next Parliament-it would be a prime example of a Yes Minister operation having won out. There is now a backlash from the bureaucracy. People in the bureaucracy do not like the scrutiny of these Acts that is now being exercised by the Parliament and they are now seeking to use a range of devices. Ministers, who presumably know very little about what they are saying, are using the words put into their mouths by the bureaucrats. I, for one, would indicate that there will be a long fight to retain this provision. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the finance item, the following interesting comment is made in relation to the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Amendment Act:</PARA>
<PARA> These provisions relate to benefits payable to parliamentarians who are covered by both State and Commonwealth parliamentary superannuation schemes. Negotiations with the States over the provisions began in 1981 and have failed to produce agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>That is where the matter has stayed. It is a very good example of where a piece of legislation should be taken off the books. If the Government has no intention of doing anything about such a matter, and seemingly nothing is included in the reasons, it should be taken off the books. I say that because the lawyers in this country who advise ordinary Australian citizens have absolutely no way of knowing, unless they have looked at these things previously, which Acts have or have not been proclaimed. We are attempting in part by this method to give some certainty to lawyers, and through lawyers to citizens, of what Acts are or are not in force. Here is a very good example of a reason given in 1981 as to why nothing was likely to occur. There is no associated comment from the Government that it has any intention of taking this measure off the books, proceeding with it, amending it, or otherwise. I do not think it is good enough to give that type of reason to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already mentioned that officers in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy discovered last time around, and even the time before that, a number of Bills that they did not know existed. I am pleased that those Bills have been found in one drawer or another. I think one would have a great deal more confidence had they been found the first time around. The fact that even the Department could not find which Bills it had demonstrates very clearly the need for this return to order. </PARA>

<PARA> A small group of clients has yet to receive forms requiring notification under section 163. </PARA>
<PARA>By the way, this Act was passed in 1983 and these people have not yet received their forms. I hope that, since this is a social security measure, they have not all died by now-but that might be the method by which this matter is finally resolved. The return to order further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Commencement of the 1983 provisions would excuse those clients from notifying changed circumstances. Action is being taken to trace the clients and issue notices. </PARA>
<PARA>It was with bated breath that I turned to the social security item in the current document. I found exactly the same comments about the small group of clients and so forth and so on, and then the following comments:</PARA>

I think that item indicates fairly clearly the need for this continuing overview.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This return to order contains 47 outstanding items that were there last time around. Surely it would be possible-and I think, quite frankly, the Senate would welcome this-to have some type of omnibus Bill to clear these measures off the books and to get us back to where we should be. The matters left would be those with good reason to be outstanding. In this regard, I draw attention to those pieces of legislation regarding the Companies Code. They are outstanding because of the continuing High Court of Australia case which has not yet been settled. That is a perfectly valid and respectable reason and one which I am sure the Senate finds very easy to accept. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether Senator Puplick would agree with me when I say that a piece of legislation to clear off the books measures that have been sitting around for so long would be welcome. It would enable us to get back to a clean state with regard to legislation. We would then be able to scrutinise each new item that is added in a very clear and straightforward manner. We should not still have 47 outstanding measures. I do not believe that anyone should give the rather silly type of excuse that a department is still looking for clients with regard to a 1983 Bill. Quite frankly, it is not worth the effort on the part of the people in the bureaucracy who have to chase these things up. </PARA>
<PARA> We are looking at another election shortly and a new Parliament. A Bill introduced either in this Parliament or early in the next Parliament to clean up this matter would be a way of dealing with this matter with some expedition. I see creeping into some of these reasons and excuses a feeling on the part of the people who are writing them that they cannot get these matters off the books because of the legislative log jam. One way to overcome that might well be to put all these measures together in a Bill. I ask the Minister responsible to take this on board and to discuss it with other Ministers as a means of dealing with the outstanding items that we have. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, let me say that I welcome the moves that have been made in a number of departments to get rid of these pieces of legislation. There are also moves to get rid of a number of other pieces of legislation that we have on the Notice Paper. It is good to see that action is finally being taken with regard to a number of these matters, although it is not enough. Indeed, some departments seem to have taken absolutely no notice at all. I give notice that next time around I actually want to go through in detail some of the departments that have made absolutely no moves whatsoever with regard to this return to order. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Macklin and I are a sort of double act on this matter. We have been for some little time. I support the suggestion that the honourable senator has made for something which might well be called the Statute Laws (Miscellaneous Repeal) Act to be introduced on a regular basis to deal with these matters. Once again, I want to indicate my appreciation of the work that the Clerks, in particular, have done to produce this document, entitled Unproclaimed Legislation. My only caveat or qualification is that it would facilitate our work if the document were dated and perhaps given a volume number. I am trying to work out which of the previous documents headed `Unproclaimed Legislation', is the last and which the first, and that would have been facilitated if the reports had been dated or given some appropriate number.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Like Senator Macklin, I want to spend a short time dealing with one or two of the Acts referred to. The first Act referred to in the document is the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Act 1987. We are told that paragraph 23 (1) (ea) has not been proclaimed because the Government now wants to undertake what the document refers to as `further consideration of the effects of the provision'. In other words, the Parliament has passed the Act because the Government said it needed to pass that legislation. The Government is now suddenly waking up to the fact that it may have some consequence that it did not anticipate would be the case when the legislation was passed. As a result, the proclamation of the Act is being held up. Frankly, I believe that these are the sorts of things that we should expect departments to anticipate; they should not be cases where, after the event, someone starts to think, `Well, what the hell have we now passed? What does it actually mean? What will be its effects?'. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I refer to my old favourite, the Naval Properties Transfer Act 1925, still unproclaimed. We are now told that, because in 1985 the New South Wales Government granted an `easement in gross'-whatever the hell an `easement in gross' means-that protects the Commonwealth's maritime rights, the Act is no longer necessary. I suppose that the rendering unnecessary over a six-decade period is something which, again, should not have been allowed to drag on for as long as it has. Before I go further, I want to say that in relation to these sorts of cases, there are plenty of opportunities in legislation that comes before us to include a schedule in relation to a particular department that actually deals with the question of Acts or parts of Acts that can be repealed because they are redundant or superseded. That sort of provision can easily be tacked on as part of an Act otherwise before us. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to another old favourite of mine-the Koongarra Project Area Act 1981, section 3. In the unfortunate circumstances that he be given the opportunity to make further decisions about uranium mining, the Minister will undoubtedly find it ironic that this part of the Act has not been proclaimed. In fact, he will have it available to him for the purposes of proclamation when he gets around to completing his successful campaign, waged in association with the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), for a review of the Australian Labor Party's uranium policy. It will be the supreme irony that the failure to proclaim has led to a situation that will in fact facilitate something we have been saying ought to have been the case all along. Once section 3 is proclaimed, the decision, if necessary, to proceed with uranium mining at Koongarra will be facilitated. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Amendment Act 1986. Three sections of this Act have not been proclaimed. Indeed, the document states that consideration will now be given to whether they should be proclaimed, repealed or amended. They deal with the question of employment within the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) and the change of arrangements from contractual to statutory arrangements. If there is one thing that will bring into real focus the question of the role of the Parliament, it is where legislation related to something as sensitive and delicate as ASIO and security arrangements can be passed by the Parliament, believing that it is exercising its proper authority over the security services of the country, and then the bureaucrats simply refuse to proclaim such legislation. When it is getting on to three years since an Act was passed, and important issues have simply been set aside by the bureaucracy, some very considerable problems will arise. </PARA>
<PARA> The points I was making about the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Act could also be made about the Circuit Layouts Act 1989 where, again, areas have not been proclaimed because it is believed, in retrospect, that some technical deficiencies have now arisen and need to be addressed. Those technical adjustments, to which the Unproclaimed Legislation document refers may or may not be significant; we do not know. However, we are entitled to believe in advance of legislation being introduced that, in fact, the Government has comprehended such matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the same may be said for the unproclaimed sections of the Copyright Amendment Act 1989 which we are told will not be proclaimed until after certain regulations have been drawn up. Again, it seems to me entirely possible for a properly organised legislative service and properly organised government to have regulations available the moment Acts are passed. There is simply no reason why we should have to wait until all the procedures have been dealt with and then start de novo in terms of regulations, get the regulations in place and make the former dependent on the latter for its proclamation. Again, the Government should be able to anticipate such circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the Customs Amendment Act 1979. A period of 10 years has now elapsed, and yet the amendments to the Customs Act relating to the power to detain and search persons who are reasonably suspected of having prohibited imports-that is, drugs-internally concealed in their bodies have not been dealt with. How can a government claim that it is taking action in relation to drug abuse, drug smuggling and control of the Australian Customs Service if in fact the Parliament has passed 10 years ago legislation empowering customs officers to do certain things, yet that legislation is still not proclaimed?</PARA>
<PARA> I now come to the last two points that I want to make, the first of which was referred to by Senator Macklin. I am talking about the group of Acts related to the Minerals (Submerged Land) Act 1981. At page 17, the Unproclaimed Legislation document states:</PARA>
<PARA>The associated Acts were overlooked in previous returns to order. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the department responsible for the administration of significant Acts of Parliament now claims that it simply overlooked the fact that these Acts were some- how not actually proclaimed. They have been enacted and passed by the Parliament. At the time it was undoubtedly said that it was absolutely vital and essential that they be passed by the Parliament and that democracy or the world as we know it would come to an end if they were not passed. They have undoubtedly been printed. I have not had the chance to see whether they have been circulated and I have them in a book of Acts-the 1981 volume or the loose-leaf version of the whole thing. Nevertheless, one would think they would be there. Yet, whereas we might have used the last two documents as a check list as to whether these things were alive and well, we find, only when the third of these reports comes to us, that this whole batch of Acts relating to a very important part of the natural resources area has not been dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> The final Act to which I refer is the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Act 1985, section 14 (2) of which authorised the conduct of area inquiries. The Government is undoubtedly concerned that if it reviews this area it will find that, if it had actually proclaimed this section of the Act and allowed the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to get on with the conduct of area inquiries, it would have saved itself some of the difficulties which are now attendant upon the mess now facing the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate has played an important role in maintaining some oversight of this matter. I have referred on previous occasions to the work of the Deputy Clerk, Anne Lynch. Her original article, which appeared in the House Magazine on 13 May 1987, entitled `Proclamation of Acts-When . . . How . . . If?' was updated in the House Magazine on 30 August 1989 in an article entitled `Legislation by Proclamation-revisited'. It will be interesting to see what the third article has to say about all of these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by correcting one of my opening remarks. Lest it be thought-heaven forfend-that the Clerks' office has been deficient in any sense in failing to provide proper dating or enumeration of these documents, I am now advised that such documents are prepared by the Government. Once again, it is the executive arm-not the legislative arm-which is grievously at fault in this particular matter. I would not for a moment dare to reflect other than upon the executive arm rather than the legislative arm. I simply repeat that it is clear that the Government has prepared these documents and they ought to be dated. They are documents of public information and record. It is necessary to understand what is going on in order to deal with them in a proper and sequential fashion. That cannot be done where there is no access to adequate dating and no indication of which report we now have. </PARA>
<PARA> That having been said, I believe that the Senate will have an important role to continue to play in the oversight of this matter. I support what Senator Macklin said about the need to tidy up, by a comprehensive repeal Act, all of those things which are genuinely otiose and which can be effectively dealt with in that fashion. I believe that the principle of coming back to us and saying, `These are the unintended consequences of what we said were vital' is not good enough. Least of all is it good enough for departments to tell us now that, on the third time around, they have found another batch of Acts for which they are responsible which have not been proclaimed and which they did not know about on the two previous occasions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply indicate that I have not received a copy of the material on unproclaimed legislation that is before the chamber. Of course, I am aware that the Senate has on its Notice Paper a motion on this question, but it is quite important that in future-so that senators are aware of what will come up-such matters be contained on the red business sheet. The red before us indicates that after the matter of public importance there will be ministerial statements made by leave, Government papers and then the tabling by senators of reports from committees, and the tabling of papers by the Clerk. There is nothing which indicated that this very important matter was to come before the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If, as we all agree, this is an important measure to assist the Senate and individual senators in the performance of their functions-one of their functions being the audit and control of executive government actions-it ought to be contained on the red and individual senators and the Senate itself should have available to them at least-if not distributed-a copy of the Government's response. I understand that it is available in the Table Office. That would be fine, if we had known that the matter was coming on. I do not know whether it is appropriate now to pass the motion that the Senate take note of this paper. As I understand it, that is the motion before the chamber. I would prefer to see it deferred until such time as other senators are made aware of the date and time that this matter will come before the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1G4">Senator DEVEREUX</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Defence Housing Authority proposal involves housing developments at Randwick, Holsworthy and East Hills, Sydney, at an estimated cost of $131.84m at July 1989 prices. At present, a need exists to acquire suitable housing for Defence personnel in the Sydney metropolitan area. Over the next three to five years it is proposed to develop sites at Randwick, Holsworthy and East Hills for integrated Defence and civilian housing. It is proposed to build approximately 100 medium density townhouses at Randwick. At Holsworthy 1,500 residential allotments will provide a mix of conventional, cottage and medium density housing, while the East Hills site will consist of 400 residential allotments providing a mix of housing. The developments will be undertaken through a joint venture arrangement between one or more developers and the Defence Housing Authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The East Hills site includes an area of freshwater wetlands, believed to be the best surviving example in the Sydney area. The Defence Housing Authority has acknowledged the environmental significance of these wetlands and has assured the Public Works Committee that there is no intention to seek rezoning of this area for residential purposes. The Committee agreed with the Defence Housing Authority and various environmental groups at East Hills that development should be excluded from the forested slopes down to the Georges River and that a corridor linking the environmentally sensitive vegetation areas should be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> The report relating to the stage 2 development of the Commonwealth Government Centre, Townsville is for the construction and fitout of a 12-storey office building of 12,600 square metres on Commonwealth-owned land adjacent to the existing Commonwealth Centre. The building will be specifically designed to meet the Australian Taxation Office's office accommodation requirements to service the northern Queensland region, particularly as a result of its computer redevelopment and re-equipment program. The Department of Administrative Services informed the Committee that the existing scattered mix of owned and leased accommodation occupied by the Australian Taxation Office in Townsville was not conducive to administrative efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that the consolidation of the Australian Taxation Office in one building will improve administrative efficiency and security of operations, allow for the rationalisation of other Commonwealth tenancies and effect significant reductions in the rent bill by relinquishment of approximately 6,500 square metres of leased accommodation in Townsville. The Committee accepted the advice of the Department of Administrative Services that the construction of a Commonwealth-owned building is the most cost effective method of satisfying the office accommodation requirements of the Commonwealth in Townsville. The Committee was informed that savings to the Commonwealth for equivalent leased space over a 15-year period are estimated at $21.2m at current prices. I commend the reports to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to Senator Puplick's speaking, I would like to refer to a question that you, Mr Chairman, asked in another capacity last week and to give an additional answer lest whatever I said last week be misconstrued. The question you asked in relation to the National Film and Sound Archive was whether in the supplementary estimates the Government would give sympathetic consideration to the changed circumstances, that is, the lower revenue expectations brought about, as you pointed out to us, by the fact that a number of those who could have been considered likely to donate are now in difficult financial circumstances. The answer provided implied that the Government had already agreed to additional funding of $230,000. In fact, this amount simply relates to the need to obtain additional cash during the Supply period to meet needs and does not imply any additional funding. The question of additional funds will depend on the merits of any case put forward by the National Film and Sound Archive at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee is now considering the votes from Estimates Committee D for the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. I move the following motion:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Committee, having considered the Report of Estimates Committee D, is of the opinion that it is a matter of regret that the instructions given by the Minister (Senator Richardson) to officers of his Department in relation to Coronation Hill were of such a nature as to prevent them from answering questions of a purely factual nature, including the confirmation of details presented in the Estimates Committee documents themselves, and the Committee therefore recommends that the Senate adopt the view of Estimates Committee D contained in paragraph 9 of its Report that:</PARA>
<PARA> ``on future occasions, restrictions on comment of this type should not apply to matters of fact''. </PARA>
<PARA>As it may subsequently facilitate the Government's consideration of matters, let me say that my indication from Senator Haines is that the motion is supported broadly by the Australian Democrats. I wish therefore to commence my remarks on a number of matters relating to this Department with an analysis of the background that has caused me to move this motion. Senate Committee D sat on 5 October 1989. During that day the Cabinet was properly concerned with the resolution of matters relating to final Government decisions, or almost final Government decisions, about the future of Coronation Hill. In the course of my asking questions of officers of the Department, a number of exchanges occurred which simply put the matter on record. At page D127 of Estimates Committee D Hansard of 5 October one sees the following exchange:</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I come to some questions which undoubtedly in large part you will be quite properly not in a position to answer. They relate to Coronation Hill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Mr Blunn, the Secretary to the Department, replied:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator, if I may say so before you go any further, my Minister has instructed me to answer no questions at all on Coronation Hill. </PARA>
<PARA>I subsequently asked whether Dr Roy Green from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's Institute of Natural Resources and Environment had transmitted to the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories a letter setting out the CSIRO view about the Coronation Hill proposal. Mr Blunn replied:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator, I regret that under the instructions given to me by the Minister I cannot answer any questions on Coronation Hill. </PARA>
<PARA>I then asked another question and Senator Bolkus, the Minister on duty at the time, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Chairman, the clear position as put by Mr Blunn is that he will not be answering any questions on Coronation Hill. </PARA>
<PARA>The dialogue then continued:</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I see. That, I take it, includes the questions of fact as to matters which are on the public record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All matters of fact are fact until disputed, Senator Puplick. The fact is that we, as indicated to the Committee, cannot answer any question in relation to Coronation Hill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I do not want to pursue that part of the hearing further. I simply refer to questions which I then sought to ask of Mr Fry, the Supervising Scientist for the Alligator Rivers region. The questions are set out on page D133 as follows:</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Are you in a position to answer any questions in relation to the resources or expenditure involved for the OSS in regard to work currently, or in the last couple of months, being undertaken in the conservation zone? Or is that part of the interdict?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>By `interdict' I meant the instruction given by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) that questions were not to be answered. The Hansard report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Fry-I am not sure. There are figures in the explanatory memorandum, are there not?</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but the fact that things are in the explanatory memorandum--</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Fry-May I seek advice on that?</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, please do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Blunn-Regretfully, I think it would be covered by the Minister's direction. </PARA>
<PARA>I was asking Mr Fry questions not about his opinion but about expenditure involved in work being undertaken at that time or in the previous couple of months, which were matters of public fact. I was asking how much money was involved, which is the very purpose of Estimates committees. The answer was, `I am not allowed to give you any information'. </PARA>
<PARA> The same thing occurred when Professor Derek Ovington, the Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service, was before us. At page D167 I asked:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Professor Ovington, you are under the same interdict as Mr Fry and the Secretary in relation to comments about Coronation Hill?</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Ovington answered:</PARA>
<PARA> It is my understanding that that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA>At page D173 I asked questions of Mr Kelleher, who is the Chief Executive Officer of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and who has also had extensive experience in his capacity as Chairman of the Australian committee dealing with matters relating to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kelleher, what can you tell me about Coronation Hill?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kelleher replied:</PARA>
<PARA> Nothing. I understand that I am not supposed to answer any questions. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not for a moment dispute in any sense the right of the Minister to give instructions to his Department and its officers to decline to answer questions on government policy. That is not the purpose of Estimates committee investigations. That is not the purpose of the committees as they were originally established, although everybody knows that part and parcel of the game afoot is to find out from departmental officers answers to questions on government policy that one cannot get by other means. I believe that it is proper for a Minister to instruct his department and its officers not to answer questions which relate to government policy. But I do not believe that it is proper for a Minister to instruct his Department or its officers to confirm or fail to confirm matters of fact or to fail to give responses to matters of fact that are contained in Estimates committee documents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Estimates Committee documents themselves contain information about Coronation Hill. They are the documents provided to us upon which our questions are supposed to be based. Let me take, for example, page 429 of the explanatory notes. Subprogram 9.5 deals primarily with natural resource management questions and is part of a larger program. Under the heading `Natural Resources Management', it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Appropriate contributions will be made to Government decisions on:</PARA>
<PARA> the review of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service;</PARA>
<PARA> the boundaries of the Conservation Zone associated with the Kakadu National Park; and</PARA>
<PARA> the assessment of the environmental impact of the Coronation Hill project in the Kakadu Conservation Zone. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the documents themselves tell us what is going on, what the Department is seeking an appropriation for, and invite specific questions. When this matter was then considered by Estimates Committee D, it reported in paragraph 9 of its report presented to the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee notes that Senator Richardson was not at the Committee hearing when the issue of Coronation Hill arose because Cabinet was considering the same issue at that time. Government policy on the matter was stated by the Prime Minister in a press release issued during the course of the Committee's hearing. The Committee is of the view that, on future occasions, restrictions on comment of this type should not apply to matters of fact. However, the Committee considers that, in these circumstances, the general thrust of the Minister's instruction was understandable. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not qualify that; I do not disagree with that. I make these points: firstly, in my view the Committee should have been invited by the Minister to return to the question of Coronation Hill after the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) had put out a press statement in which the Cabinet decision was announced. In other words, the Committee was still in session and, indeed, met for quite some hours subsequently and should have been invited to return to the matters which were prevented from being exposed in the Committee hearings because they were under consideration by Cabinet, after Cabinet had, in fact, not only decided the matter but also actually put out a formal statement. It was not a matter of our seeking what was the Cabinet decision before it was announced. The Cabinet decision was announced by the Prime Minister in a press release which was made at the time that the Committee was still in session. In my view the Committee Chairman and the Minister should have invited the Committee to return to a consideration of the matter at that stage. Nevertheless, that is past. We will know better should any subsequent similar event arise. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole of Estimates Committee D-not just I or the Opposition members; its three Labor members, along with the three non-Labor members-concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is of the view that, on future occasions, restrictions on comment of this type should not apply to matters of fact. </PARA>
<PARA>The motion which I have moved does not in any sense seek to censure or condemn Senator Richardson. It simply says that it is a matter of regret that his instructions were of such a nature as to prevent his officers from answering questions of a purely factual nature. It invites the Senate to adopt the view expressed by its own Committee in its report to the Senate that on future occasions restrictions on comment of this type should not apply to matters of fact. I believe that, if we proceed along those lines to make it quite clear that the Senate believes that ministerial instructions not to answer questions should relate only to matters of policy and that instructions should not be given to prevent officers answering in relation to matters of fact, we will have some clarification of where the demarcation line for the conduct of Estimates committees lies. It is a method of inviting Ministers to determine, if they wish to prohibit their officers from answering questions, that that prohibition does not extend to the confirmation or otherwise of matters of fact and, in particular, matters of fact which arise specifically from the information which is contained in the Estimates committee papers from which we are working at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> I have formally moved that motion. I presume that it will not come to a vote until we conclude the whole debate in relation to Estimates Committee D. I have a number of other matters to raise in relation to Estimates Committee D. We can deal with those in due course. I have formally moved that motion. I believe that the Senate will at least be taking some steps to clarify exactly how it believes its committees should operate in that regard with the passage of that motion which, as I say, I understand will be supported by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said in response to a question from Senator Puplick the day after the incident to which he is now referring occurred that I regretted having to give the instruction to the Secretary to my Department in the way that I did. I believe that the motion put forward by Senator Puplick would be of assistance to the Senate in future. I think it should be acknowledged that we were dealing with an extraordinary situation where Cabinet happened to be dealing with Coronation Hill at the very time Estimates Committee D was meeting. In the seven years I have had here, that has not happened before. I do not think it is normal, nor do I think it is likely to happen again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In listening to what Senator Puplick has just said, I think that it does raise a fundamental difficulty for officers even in proceeding in the way in which he has just suggested. Senator Puplick spoke of the difference between fact and policy in questions being put to officers. Of course, he is right. But in my experience there are three sorts of questions that are asked of officers: they are questions of fact, of policy and of opinion. The reality is that, irrespective of the guidelines laid down in the Senate for the way that Senate Estimates committees should be conducted, they have, over time, evolved into a quite adversarial process. There is no question that officers are put under the microscope, at times in fairly heated discussion. It is certainly my experience that the boundary between fact and opinion is almost impossible to define. </PARA>
<PARA> I can assert some facts about Coronation Hill that I know are disputed not just by members of the Opposition, but even by  some--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Puplick" NAMEID="TI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator Puplick</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How can they be facts if they are disputed?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. It is for that very reason that in a court case a whole process is laid down-it sometimes takes 12 months before something goes to court-just to make sure that both sides acknowledge the facts. In the world of science and biology ascertaining a fact can take years. People write learned papers on whether or not something which is asserted by another is a fact. There is no question in the case of Coronation Hill that a number of the facts that I have asserted were challenged. Fortunately, when it came to the crunch the majority accepted that what I was saying was true. There is no doubt that opinion would have been called for, and almost certainly would still be called for, if the Senate is to follow the wording of Senator Puplick's motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said, the Government will not oppose the motion. But I ask that all honourable senators consider that line between fact and opinion. It is a very difficult line to draw. I have not known of its having been drawn properly before. While Senator Puplick was speaking I was sitting here thinking and I still cannot work out just how I would define it. While the Government will not oppose the motion, I still believe that this will present some difficulties for officers and Ministers in the future, let alone for the committees that have to deal with the questions before them. To put this matter into some sort of perspective, I also think that as Senator Puplick was asking Mr Kelleher questions-or was about to ask Mr Kelleher questions-that almost certainly takes us into the realm of opinion because Mr Kelleher had not been dealing with any of the Coronation Hill issues directly. So virtually whatever Senator Puplick was going to ask Mr Kelleher had to be opinion. </PARA>

I just hope that it is one that the Senate gives some earnest consideration to. I could go through some very learned arguments that I have on this question and quote Odgers Australian Senate Practice and a whole host of things. I do not propose to take up the time of the Senate in doing so. I just urge honourable senators to consider the difference between fact and opinion which I know will be of importance on many future occasions.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only phrase that Senator Richardson did not use in his reply was the great Australian tautology `the true facts'. There are facts and there are non-facts or there are statements which are facts and there are statements which are not facts. If the question is, `How much did you spend on X?', the answer is a certain number of dollars. The question, `Do you believe that the money was well spent?' may indeed be a matter of opinion on the part of the officers. It may be legitimate for the Minister on duty to intervene and to say, `As a matter of fact it is the opinion of the Government that all of its money is well spent'. Undoubtedly we can chase that argument around for a considerable time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Frankly, the logic of what Senator Richardson has said, if taken through to its inevitable conclusion, would be very largely to render the whole Estimates committee process unworkable because in truth what would occur is that we would have the Estimates committee document which would allegedly be the presentation of the facts and we would not need to have questions asked at Estimates committees. We could simply say, `Those are the facts; what other facts do you want? Put down a question on notice and we will give you the facts'. The process of Estimates committee hearings is largely to try to tease out explanations of what the purely factual statements about dollars and cents expenditure in the Estimates committee papers actually mean. </PARA>

I do not believe that it is difficult to establish a fairly easily comprehended set of principles which are largely based on simply commonsense as to what is a fact, what is a matter of opinion and what is a matter of policy. That is why we have chairmen at these committees; that is why we have Ministers on duty; that is why over time the Senate has developed a set of procedures for handling these matters. I believe that the passage of this motion will simply facilitate a clear indication that where matters are matters of fact and information has been sought on a purely factual basis, they should be provided and Ministers should not instruct officers not to answer questions purely of fact.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Puplick's reference to the great Australian tautology `true facts' has in `true fact' relevance here. If one looks at the South Alligator River immediately adjacent to Coronation Hill one finds two monitoring stations of effects on the river. One is operated by the Office of the Supervising Scientist (OSS), the other by the joint venturers. They are feet apart. From memory I would judge the distance at about 10 feet. These days I am supposed to give that distance in another form of measurement which I do not understand. Is three metres close to that distance?</PARA></TALK.START>

Both sides would claim that their measurement of effect on the river is correct. Both sides would assert that it is a true fact. However, if the measurements come out differently one wonders how we assert which is the truer true-fact and which is the less true true-fact. It is very difficult. That is the point that I am trying to make. As I said, the Government is not opposing what Senator Puplick is putting down.

There is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that when it comes to the production of documents or information when they are related to Cabinet discussions the precedents are endless. They are not produced prior to Cabinet having discussed the matter and made a decision. Senator Baume is wrong but that is not unusual. All I am trying to say is that the way Estimates committees have developed, in particular on this occasion, would have made it very difficult for the Chairman, let alone the Minister, who was not the Minister who had carriage of the issue, to make the judgments that Senator Puplick thinks are so easy. Nonetheless, the Government is not opposing the motion and I will say no more.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having got that matter out of the way, I intend to make one final observation. That is quite simply to take Senator Richardson's example. It is possible for facts to conflict if the two stations to which Senator Richardson referred measure different things at different locations and using different methods.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If they measure the same thing at two different places using two different methods, it is possible that we will get two sets of results. It then becomes a matter of judgment, not as to which one is wrong, but as to which one is to be taken as the basis for action. But the confirmation that facts are in conflict is something that people ought to know. Much as I am tempted to give a lengthy dissertation on Mr Heisenberg's uncertainty principle at this stage, I shall refrain from doing so. I simply ask for certain matters regarding Coronation Hill, only in the very broadest sense. I do not intend to pursue the debate about Coronation Hill under this heading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I ask Senator Richardson the following: firstly, can he inform this chamber when Professor Taylor's review of the Office of the Supervising Scientist will be completed, and will the review document relating to the OSS be made a public document? Secondly, is he able to indicate, in relation to the whole of his portfolio area, those bodies that have been reviewed, the progress of Government consideration and whether the review documents themselves have been made public? I know that some of them have; indeed, some of them have been provided to me, and I am extremely grateful for that. There are large numbers of areas of the Minister's Department, such as the Australian National Library, the Australian National Gallery and other bits and pieces which have been reviewed. I would just like to have some comprehensive response to the question whether all those reviews have been completed. Thirdly, is Senator Richardson prepared to provide publicly a copy of the report, letter or communication which went from Dr Roy Green of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Institute of Natural Resources and Environment to his Department relating to the CSIRO evaluation in regard to certain matters at Coronation Hill?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the review from Dr Taylor was received in my office in the last 24 hours or something like that. It is hot off the press and has just arrived. I would like a week or two to consider it without the heat of public debate, but I shall table it in this chamber before we get up this year. If the honourable senator gives me a couple of weeks, I will sort that out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can recall the Australian National Library, the Australian National Gallery and the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service having been reviewed. There was also a review on some aspects of tourism. That was quite some time back; I do not actually recall precisely when, but I will endeavour to check that for the honourable senator. As far as I am concerned, it is not possible when reviewing these instrumentalities to do a secret job. If we are to have a proper debate the documents ought to be made public. I shall endeavour to ensure that all those reviews are tabled in this chamber so that the honourable senator can have a look at them. I was asked about a copy of a letter from Dr Green to my Department. Of course, it is normal practice at Estimates committee hearings to ask the sender, not the receiver. If the sender is happy for that letter to be released, so am I. </PARA>

Adequate opportunity will be provided, no doubt, in the weeks and months ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn next to another matter which has been raised in the report of Estimates Committee D; that is, the question of the tendency of officers in the Department to write essays in place of succinct statements about parts of their portfolio. Far be it from me to believe that the arts department is in any sense more inclined to have people within it given to writing essays than any other department. I wanted to make reference to something which appears in Estimates Committee D papers relating to the film industry, not just because it is, in my judgment, an example of where people have gone overboard in writing, but because one does not really know what the status of some matters is. For example, we do not know whether this is the official view of the Government in relation to those matters. I refer to page 198 of the explanatory notes for the Estimates Committee, which deals with the question of film development and production support, part of the overall program which deals with the Australian Film Commission. At this stage I will not even take this opportunity to reflect on Mr Adams's latest comments about who may or may not bear a resemblance to Caligula in dealing with these matters, but I wish to quote from the words that appear in the document. In relation to the film development and production support program, it says:</PARA>
<PARA> An active Australian film and television industry dates from the 1970's when Government support was provided to revitalise production activity of a locally relevant cultural nature. As a relatively new industry, it is still without established lines of credit from financial institutions; the available pool of skilled personnel is limited; it operates in a small market and has not yet achieved regular access to the international market. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a matter of seven lines, and one could dispute almost every line. That `an active Australian film and television industry dates from the 1970s', I think, is a matter of debate, particularly in relation to the Australian television industry'. `When Government support was provided to revitalise production activity', is stated as if one were automatically the consequence of the other. The next part is `of a locally relevant cultural nature'. Again, if one looks at television production, the question of what is `of a relevant cultural nature' raises more questions than it answers. `As a relatively new industry', is the next part of the quote. In fact, in terms of the Australian film industry we are dealing with one of the oldest film industries in the world. Productions which occurred in the 1890s, whether it was the Lumiere brothers' work, whether it was the production of the first film of the Manly ferry arrival, or the 1896 Melbourne Cup--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whether it was the Salvation Army's first feature film, Soldiers of the Cross, or whether it was the first really well-developed feature film of the Tait brothers, The Kelly Gang-these are matters of some pride within the Australian film industry. It does not need to be told that it is a relatively new industry. The next part of the quote is, `without established lines of credit from financial institutions'. Again that is certainly open to a considerable amount of debate. We then have, `the available pool of skilled personnel is limited'. It depends on what we define as `skilled personnel'. If `skilled personnel' are taken to be actors and actresses, the pool is not limited; in fact, the pool is in oversupply. The quote continues, `it operates in a small market and has not yet achieved regular access to the international market'. Yet for years we have been providing money for promotions at film festivals. We have an extraordinarily good record. Indeed, on page 198 of the explanatory notes we find this statement of the Australian film industry:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>it . . . has not yet achieved regular access to the international market. </PARA>
<PARA>On page 200 of that document we find:</PARA>
<PARA> Films funded through the Special Production Fund have had notable exposure in world film festivals . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Frankly, this is a question of which of those two statements is a statement of fact. I suspect that the statement of fact is that it has had notable exposure in world film festivals and that the business of the Australian film industry not having achieved regular access to the international market is simply not true. </PARA>
<PARA> I could go on about this at some length, but the Estimates Committee itself dealt with this matter. At page 210 of the explanatory notes, basically within the same program, we find:</PARA>
<PARA>As a relatively recent phenomenon, film has yet to be widely acknowledged and evaluated as an art form. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Richardson himself in answering a question said that he did not agree that it was a relatively recent phenomenon. He conceded that in the course of the debate. I do not seek to make anything more of it; I simply draw attention once again to the fact that the Estimates Committee in its report at paragraph 11 noted that this was the second year in which this matter had been drawn to the attention of the Department. The Committee accepted the Minister's response that there is a fine line to be drawn between unnecessarily waxing lyrical on the pages of Estimates Committee documents and yet at the same time recognising the need to justify the program. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted with approval the Minister's promise that the problem would be addressed in next year's explanatory notes. I certainly look forward to that. However, I think it needs to be kept in mind that this is the second occasion this has occurred. This assurance was given last year. It simply makes matters much more difficult. We are already dealing with a document in relation to this Department which runs to 547 pages. I know the technique of putting out as much paper as we possibly can in order to ensure that people are buried by it. This is not the only department that Estimates Committee D has had to deal with. The Department of Defence and the defence science and personnel portfolio have to be dealt with also. I think that the Minister would undoubtedly have a burning passion in his heart for the number of trees that have gone into the production of this particular document. I think there is some scope for those matters to be addressed in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish now, rather than making a large number of separate interventions-I have made the point I wanted to make in relation to the nature of the documents themselves-to raise a question. I admit I am really seeking some information because the material that has been given to me does not provide adequate information. It relates to any grants made through the Minister's Department, either directly or as a result of certain bicentennial activities, for the purchase of a motor yacht by the name of Eva and whether any assistance was given for the purchase of this vessel. I understand that money used for its purchase may have been bicentennial money-this is where the confusion arises in terms of who has lingering responsibility for answering questions about bicentennial money activities-and that the vessel was originally in the possession of Societe Generale Australia Ltd. I believe it was auctioned and purchased with the use of bicentennial money for a figure of $1.2m and subsequently resold for between $4m and $6m. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know anything further at this stage about that, although I am seeking to have some inquiries made. The person who I believe both purchased and sold the vessel holds a very senior position as a result of his appointment to one of the statutory authorities which is within the Minister's competence and purview. I will happily indicate privately to the Minister who the individual is. </PARA>

I do not think it is proper for me to use this forum to name the individual concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter that I want to raise at this stage concerns one of Senator Richardson's friends, the Chairman of the Council of the Australian National Gallery. I refer to the foreword to the Gallery report. I ask the Minister whether he is prepared to indicate to the Senate on this occasion whether he shares the opinion which Mr Whitlam presents on page 7 of the annual report of the Gallery for 1988-89 in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>The National Gallery Act is not the only Act which Finance has set out to subvert in its restricted and distorted view of Federal responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister and the officers of his Department undoubtedly share that view. I know that the distinguished Secretary to the Department has issued one press statement in relation to the Department of Finance report What Price Heritage? I like the draft statement better than the final statement, but so be it. However, I am interested as to whether the Department or the Minister intends to give any more detailed response to the Finance Department report What Price Heritage?-whether that now slips into the general mainstream of the debate or whether it is intended that the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding), Senator Richardson as the senior Minister in the area or the Department separately will be putting out a detailed statement in relation to that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I draw attention to the question of the membership of the Council of the Australian National Gallery. Mr Whitlam in his foreword says:</PARA>
<PARA>There has not been an artist serving on the Council since the retirement of Ms Maddock, nor an art historian since the retirement of Professor Margaret Plant on 3 July 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that that is not correct. I think that a recent appointment, that of Miss Marika, may well be taken to be the appointment of an artist, although her area of expertise relates to Aboriginal art. She is a museum curator and also a practising artist. For the sake of the public record, the annual report having indicated that there was not an artist on the Council of the Gallery, that should simply be brought up to date. I take it that the Minister can quite simply confirm that Miss Marika is an artist and perhaps indicate to me whether there is any Government policy requiring or favouring the appointment of practising artists to the Council of the National Gallery or whether, if an artist or an art historian happens to be appointed, that is simply incidental rather than the result of a deliberate attempt to seek somebody with those particular skills to be regularly represented on the Council of the Gallery. </PARA>

It may well be the case that the Australian Bicentennial Authority had some involvement; I would not know. I have no idea. I can be of no help there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the matter of the National Gallery I can be of some more help. I refer to Mr Whitlam's view that `The National Gallery Act is not the only Act which Finance has set out to subvert'. Mr Whitlam and, I might say, some other chairmen of various institutions have had some harsh things to say, or harboured some harsh thoughts, about Finance-probably not as harsh as those Finance has said or harboured about them. Nonetheless, a degree of feeling has been built up. I do not intend to respond to the Finance report. I understand that my Department will do so and that document will be made public. I do not think it will happen in the very near future but some time next year. My own view of these things is that it is not worth pursuing too hard. As they say, it is a question of the proof of the pudding, and we have been eating pretty well in the Budget discussions. As long as that continues, I see no reason to respond. </PARA>
<PARA> I was asked whether there was a policy on having an artist on the Council of the National Gallery. That matter has been debated very often. There is no policy. In fact, there is quite a degree of dissension as to whether it is appropriate and a good idea to put an artist on the Council. Generally speaking, I would like to see that happen, but I would not hold that as a hard and fast opinion. The Council does have a person of expertise to whom Senator Puplick has referred. Aboriginal art has formed a pretty fair proportion of the Gallery's activities in recent years. Its Aboriginal collection probably is now unsurpassed. However, there is no policy, and I do not think there will be one. Perhaps we can consider this matter when we are next looking at Gallery appointments. If artists are appointed there is always the argument about whether they are representing the right part of the art world-should they be into impressionism, into cubism, or into this or that. I do not know. That matter is impossible to resolve. Generally speaking, I do not think it is a bad idea to have a practitioner of an art involved. That is now happening. </PARA>
<PARA> As to Senator Puplick's remarks about the documents, when this matter was originally raised in the hearings, I said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there are some words here which I think on sober reflection might not appear again. </PARA>
<PARA>Having re-read the words which the honourable senator has referred to tonight, I do not think I will change my mind. The honourable senator is correct in saying that this matter was raised with us the year before. We did better. I am sure that the Minister in the fourth Hawke Government next year, whoever he may be, will do better still. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure Senator Button would be delighted to hear it. The matter I wish to pursue-and hopefully this will be my last contribution on this portfolio area-is the question of ongoing funding for environmental research. The Committee would be aware that in October 1989 the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) made a submission to the Australian Science and Technology Council which had been asked by the Government to review the state of environmental research in Australia. This has been the subject of some discussions and comments made by Senator Button at Question Time. The CSIRO submission is disturbing for one of two reasons: either because it draws attention to what is a deficiency in terms of the funding and the nature and the adequacy of environmental research being done by the CSIRO in Australia, if one believes the CSIRO; or, if not, because it raises questions about the intellectual integrity of the CSIRO in terms of whether its claims are, as Senator Button essentially characterises them, simply self-serving claims aimed at increasing its allocation in next year's Budget or getting some particular special vote in order to increase its resources. The CSIRO, in the summary of its submission, says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Solutions to environmental problems will depend not only on environmental research, but on many other areas of research as well. The protection and restoration of the environment should be made a primary goal that underpins the conduct of Australian research in general, including rural, industrial, and minerals and energy research. </PARA>
<PARA> In some cases, environmental research has been essential to the identification of environmental problems; in many cases it is essential to their understanding; and in most cases research and its application are essential to the resolution through the development of better resource and environmental management and more environmental benign industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia possesses the necessary infrastructure for environmental research, but lacks the research capacity to assess adequately the environmental impact of agriculture, forestry, mining, industrial, tourist and urban activities and developments. We therefore cannot ensure the effective integration and reconciliation of economic and environmental objectives, on which, ultimately, the future health of the nation rests. </PARA>
<PARA>The CSIRO in that comment is saying, `We cannot provide any sort of guarantee that from our resources the public will be sufficiently informed or the Government will be sufficiently informed about these questions in order to allow them to make a balanced and proper decision'. The Canberra Times of 9 November reported this submission under the heading, `CSIRO says it cannot guarantee a future balance'. It is very important that we explore this a little further. One of the examples which the CSIRO submission gives in relation to things that it cannot do is research into koalas and the koala populations of Australia. It indicates, for example, that it is unable to provide the sort of baseline data which would be necessary in order to make effective decisions. The CSIRO, on page 13 of the submission, says:</PARA>
<PARA> We do not even know the distribution of one of our national symbols, the koala. Some 25% of our plants and at least 50% of our invertebrates remain undescribed. Invertebrates underpin the stability of the world's ecosystems. Hence they play a key role in determining how ecosystems respond to climate and other change. </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, in dramatising this matter by referring to koalas, the CSIRO has proved the truth of the dictum that one can sell almost anything if one puts a cuddly bear on the front of it. It has taken advantage of that. </PARA>

The Minister is not directly responsible for this but it is, nevertheless, part of the environment portfolio. It is undoubtedly on the basis of information from CSIRO that the Minister undertakes the analysis of particular problems and comes to the conclusions upon which Government policy is based. After the dinner break I will be in a position to continue to analyse this matter a little further.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr Temporary Chairman, I claim to have been seriously misrepresented and wish to make a personal explanation. On the channel 9 six o'clock news this evening, Mr Laurie Oakes purveyed the view that in the course of my remarks this afternoon in the matter of public importance debate I had given support to the Hawke-Keating Government on its interest rates policy. Although I have not yet been able to obtain a transcript of Mr Oakes's precise words, I witnessed them and therefore I am quite certain of the thrust of what I am putting to the Senate. I believe that Mr Oakes reported me as having provided, as he put it, `support' to the Government. He said that support had come from an unusual quarter, namely, the Leader of the National Party in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I simply want to put on the record what I said in the Senate this afternoon on this matter. I will quote from my pinks, which I have in front of me. I said:</PARA>
<PARA>We are not going to do anything irresponsible of that kind-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, signal during next year's election campaign an immediate and large fall in interest rates-</PARA>
<PARA>because we have said all along that there is no magic wand. When a government produces, after what will be seven years of this Government's policies, the kind of mess we have on our hands today there is no magic wand. This Government has put us in the situation where undoubtedly interest rates will stay high for some time. We have policies-and we have announced them in our Economic Action Plan-which will address the issues. But we are not saying that those policies will bring down interest rates with a rush in the next month or so after we are elected. We would be irresponsible to say so. </PARA>
<PARA>As I say, I regard the interpretation given to those words by Mr Oakes in his television presentation this evening as irresponsible and a grave distortion. I can only express my dismay that an otherwise respected senior political correspondent of a major television channel should so misinterpret the clear import and content of my words. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Furry ones, as distinct from the hairy ones that inhabit the National Media Liaison Service. Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was drawing attention to the impact on environmental research which has been occasioned by the cutback in funds provided to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). I referred to the answer given by the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, Mr Barry Jones, to a question on notice on 31 August. He was asked to detail the impact on the CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology since mid-1985 of the cuts in government funds. He indicated that certain cuts had been made in terms of research that was curtailed or terminated and research that was not commenced. What the Minister describes as important research curtailed or terminated includes research into the nature of mouse plagues, the cuts made to the national wildlife collection, the closing down of research on introduced pasture grasses in semi-arid regions, cutbacks in range land research with the loss of scientists working on woody weed effects, cuts in research into the ecology of native forests, bird pest research which had been stopped, research into kangaroo studies which had been reduced, nutritional and diet selection research into koalas which had been terminated, and research into vertebrate population dynamics in rainforests which had been terminated. All rabbit control research other than that funded by the Australian Wool Corporation had been terminated. Research into coastal dune stabilisation by vegetation had been terminated. Regional scale maintenance of kangaroo numbers can no longer be carried out. A recently initiated work on deer farming had been severely curtailed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Important new initiatives which had not been commenced included research into the ecological dynamics in the Antarctic, development of benign methods of fertility control of wildlife, development via molecular biology approaches to introduce sterility in wild rabbits, research into lamb losses with and without fox and/or rabbit control, research into the influence of management initiated fires on forest wildlife species, restoration of mining sites, risk assessment of potential exotic disease outbreak, North Queensland rainforest inventory and mapping which has been deferred, developments in erosion forecasting, conservation management of arid mountain ranges, research into how to prevent species lost, and allocation and management of resources in the Australian coastal zone. The Minister, Mr Jones, indicated that as a result of these cutbacks:</PARA>
<PARA> Agricultural development is proceeding without due consideration for its sustainability. </PARA>
<PARA>He concludes:</PARA>
<PARA> Within Australia the ability of the division to provide the detailed information needed to develop the best national conservation policies is well short of what it should be and in some areas is virtually grinding to a halt. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at that litany set off against the Government's announced priorities. It talks to us about sustainability, about sustainable development, and its cuts have been such that the Minister Mr Jones says that agricultural development is proceeding without due consideration for its sustainability. We are told about the importance of soil conservation, and yet things like rabbit control, feral animal control and kangaroo population monitoring are not being undertaken. We are told about the importance of the Antarctic and yet ecosystem research in the Antarctic is being curtailed. We are told about the importance of genetic diversity and yet research into preventing species loss is not being undertaken. We are told that coastal zone management is important enough for the Resource Assessment Commission to get into it and yet research into coastal dune stabilisation and into matters related to management and control of the coastal zone is being cut. We are told how important the semi-arid lands of Australia are-indeed they are-yet research into pasture grasses in those areas is being cut back. </PARA>
<PARA> This litany which is, by the Minister's own admission, a result of cuts in government funding goes on apace. We see, for example, in the Australian of 31 October 1989 a story about Dr John Greenslade and a principal in the Entomology Division, Dr Bob Taylor, who have been told that funding for their research, which deals with things like the control of aphids, weeds, cockroaches and locusts, has been curtailed. Some of them have been sacked. They are told that this work is no longer central to CSIRO's effort. We saw stories in the Sydney Morning Herald on 22 November 1989 that Dr Tucker, the Chief of the Division of Atmospheric Research in CSIRO, has to go and talk to the Australian Conservation Foundation about how between them they can effectively lobby the Government to do something about their funding. </PARA>
<PARA> We see in the Australian on 20 November 1989, under the heading `CSIRO's key green funds ``left in the red'' ', that funding for environmental research has fallen by 54 per cent since 1982-83 and that the extra spending announced this year in the environment statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) did not make up for the cuts which have previously been imposed upon it. There has been a decline in funding of 40 per cent in real terms from 1979-80 to 1987-88, to $21.5m, having fallen from a peak of $46.3m. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, Senator Button has sought to make light of this matter by saying that it is all part of a special pleading on the part of CSIRO for additional funds. However, we know that in areas like ozone research the CSIRO had to cut back on research expenditure, and then when the thing became a political hot potato the Government was able to throw sums of money at it to try to restore the research effort. However, we cannot turn on and turn off research effort; we cannot find research workers and get back into the field after having made as many cuts to the CSIRO as has been the case. I refer to the editorial in today's Australian under the heading `Decisions in the dark'. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>But what is indisputable is that Australia faces a dangerous trend: the rate of spending on research is not even keeping close to the pace with political pressures for environment regulation, roadblocks to development, and spending on green projects. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result, critical environmental decisions increasingly are becoming leaps in the dark. Political leaders are placing the attractiveness of being seen to `do something' before the need to develop a solid scientific grounding for decision-making. </PARA>
<PARA>The editorial points to a number of examples. It points to decisions taken in New South Wales about ozone protection. It points to ideas floated by the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business for a so-called carbon tax. It points to the Prime Minister's one billion trees program, and says:</PARA>
<PARA> What is the point in providing millions of dollars for planting trees while allowing CSIRO forestry research projects to be cut?</PARA>
<PARA>In terms of the overall integration of issues of environment policy with other Government policies-and this is not a matter which lies primarily within Senator Richardson's Department, as I speak about the cuts to CSIRO-and as the Government goes about allegedly putting together a coherent and developed environment policy, it cannot be pursuing environmental research in one department and cutting back in another department. It cannot be expected to make significant decisions about environmental matters without adequate data. That data will not be forthcoming if the sorts of cuts which are being imposed on the CSIRO, particularly in the areas of environmental research by the CSIRO, continue to be made. That is where I will leave my comments about that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to conclude by asking the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories to comment on two other specific matters, to bring my remarks in this portfolio area to a close. I refer to the question of the International Antarctic Centre in Hobart. An advertisement was put out some time ago by this Centre under the heading `Antarctica-the lure of the frozen south. Come and experience Antarctica in Hobart at the new International Antarctic Centre. Planned opening October 1990.' I understand that, as a result of cutbacks made in arrangements for funding at both the Tasmanian State level and the Commonwealth level, this Centre will not be proceeding. I understand that there has been a decision that the Federal and Tasmanian governments have agreed that the financial resources needed to establish this Centre are not available and that, therefore, the project is to be indefinitely deferred. I would be grateful for some advice from the Minister as to whether in fact the Centre has been indefinitely deferred. If so, what are the reasons?</PARA>
<PARA> The last point I want to make arises directly from the report of the Estimates Committee on which we should be focusing, and undoubtedly you, Mr Chairman, require us primarily to focus our remarks on matters which are in the Estimates Committee reports. I refer to the almost total failure of the Department to provide annual reports prior to the conduct of the Estimates Committee hearings. Paragraph 4 of the Estimate's Committee report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee did not receive advance copies of the annual reports of any portfolio agency, although this is a requirement of the guidelines for preparation of departmental annual reports. The Public Service Act (s. 25) makes these guidelines legally binding on departmental secretaries and their equivalents in other agencies. The Committee noted that the Department failed to meet this aspect of its legal obligation to report to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>While the Committee noted that the Department was diligent in providing other information, it also said that it had manifestly failed. Indeed, it was only today-and this has not yet been tabled in the Senate, I might add-that I received the annual report of the Australian Film, Television and Radio School. Frankly, the Minister and his departmental Secretary have an obligation which in fact is cast upon them by the Public Service Act and the guidelines, which apparently are legally binding on departmental Secretaries and their equivalents in the various agencies, to provide this information. The Senate Estimates Committee has seen fit to draw to the attention of the chamber the fact that the Committee did not receive advance copies of the annual reports for any portfolio agency. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, within this portfolio the agencies are quite numerous and in fact play significant roles. Indeed, most of our attention is focused on a number of those agencies. I am genuinely disappointed about this, because to date the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has had an extremely good record in the way in which it has dealt with Estimates committees. The Secretary and officers of the Department have been assiduous in providing information as and when requested. It is disappointing that on this occasion these reports were not available, primarily from the agencies and statutory authorities to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret that the Committee has had to take this matter to the stage of making a report to the Senate and, in fact, noting that the Department had failed to meet this aspect of its legal obligations to report to Parliament. I hope that there will be some explanation of why this is the case; that there will be some indication that at least the Department understands its responsibility; that the Minister-at least so long as he remains Minister-is cognisant of his responsibilities; and that we will not be placed in this position of once again having to look at these major and important cultural and environmental institutions without the benefit of the annual reports to which this Parliament is entitled and where in fact legal obligations to provide them in a proper and timely fashion are cast upon the responsible officers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The main thrust of Senator Puplick's contribution concerned this question of funds for environmental research and naturally enough he referred to the submission by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in relation to the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC) review into environmental research in Australia. The first point to make is that the very fact that the Government asked for such a review indicated that, in the Government's view, there were some problems in terms of the length, breadth and depth of our knowledge about research into environmental matters. So we asked the scientific community to tell us what they thought of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In evaluating the state of environmental research, a number of factors must be taken into account. One of them, of course, concerns what research is done by the CSIRO. We will no doubt be able to contrast the view of the CSIRO of its role with the general view of the Government as to where and how environmental research ought to be conducted. The main point to make here is that, while it might not be in accord with all of CSIRO's wishes, environmental research is conducted by a number of government agencies-and not wholly and solely by the CSIRO. Obviously it would like to do it all-I understand that-but it has never been the case. In fact, in most recent times it has probably been less the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick referred to a range of areas of research. I will not attempt to cover them all. Having taken some notes of what Senator Puplick was saying, there are a few areas I can refer to. First, he referred to the monitoring of kangaroo populations, which is regularly conducted by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. In recent years, it has expanded its capacity to do so because of the extraordinary controversy which develops every year about the approval of quotas for States for kangaroo culling. My general view, by the way, is that the National Parks and Wildlife Service is doing an excellent job in its monitoring of kangaroo populations. I have been more than happy to defend the Service against allegations from Greenpeace and other groups, even when it recommends that I approve Queensland programs. I can tell Senator Boswell that that is the litmus test of my faith in the National Parks and Wildlife Service's research into kangaroo populations. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick also referred to the north Queensland rainforests and the cuts in CSIRO funds in that respect. Again, I point out that the CSIRO is but one organisation conducting research into tropical rainforests. In fact, the Government funded a consultancy by Aila Keto's outfit-the Rainforest Conservation Society of Queensland. That was used extensively by the Government in its case for listing those rainforests for World Heritage. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick referred to rabbits, which are a big problem-in fact, it is one of Australia's great problems and it receives far too little attention. It is interesting to note that in July this year, at the meeting of the Australian and New Zealand environment councils in Nelson, New Zealand, we were given an extensive briefing on the rabbit plague. The briefing was, in fact, given by people from the CSIRO who were undertaking research in this area. They highlighted one property in South Australia on which there were 24 million rabbits. In looking at the problem, they referred to the possibility of biological control with a disease that has spread from Mexico to China and into Italy. Apparently, that is a source of great hope. Obviously, that research is well under way, and certainly the scientists present who were briefing us were not complaining about the extent of resources. </PARA>
<PARA> We must consider as well the present problem-and it will be a problem possibly in the next century or two-of the ozone layer and the greenhouse effect. So there has been an enormous increase in Government funding for research; it is just that all the funding is not going to the CSIRO. While I can understand the CSIRO being peeved about that, the Bureau of Meteorology is not so peeved as it has received a very substantial increase for which I think it is grateful. I use those examples only to illustrate the fact that, in the field of environmental research, there is a whole range of institutes, universities and government organisations that are undertaking research. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on the environment, from which Senator Puplick quoted, referred to a whole raft of bodies that receive very substantial extra funds for environmental research. The Biological Resources Study-an important and underrated area of environmental research in Australia-has produced, even in the last 12 months, some extraordinary results, and it will produce more as a result of what the Prime Minister announced. In addition, I refer to the Australian environmental resources information network which will provide us with a database that will finally, I hope, supply the information base necessary to make the most important environmental decisions. The Heritage Commission conducts research into wilderness inventories and that research is continuing. My point is that a whole range of areas-whether the Office of the Supervising Scientist, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Biological Resources Study or a number of others-have received greatly increased funds for environmental research. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot, and do not, claim to have conducted a total inventory or weighed up what the CSIRO claims to have lost as against improvements in other environmental research areas. However, if I were a betting man, I would wager that the improvements far outweigh the losses, and I have mentioned only a few of them. I was also asked about the Antarctic Centre. If I have missed any question, I hope honourable senators will tell me. I cannot recall the Commonwealth ever pledging itself to the Antarctic Centre. I know that some arrangements have been made at a State level; certainly, former Premier Gray gave the matter a fairly high priority. As I have said, I cannot recall the Commonwealth ever pledging itself to this Centre. Certainly, I have never been party to a decision which involved that. I have never put forward a submission to Cabinet on it and had it dealt with successfully. I cannot recall anything about it. I do not think the Commonwealth has broken any promise on the matter or backed away from any undertaking. Any further questions on the Antarctic Centre would more properly be addressed to the Tasmanian Government, and I am not certain how it would respond. </PARA>
<PARA> Next, Senator Puplick referred to, in his words, the total failure of the Department of the Arts, Sport the Environment, Tourism and Territories to provide reports. I would like to read, rather than table, a fairly short letter, as I hope it effectively answers Senator Puplick's queries. It is from Susan Gibb, one of my private secretaries, to Peter Hamburger, Secretary of Estimates Committee D. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> May I, on behalf of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, express our appreciation for Estimates Committee D's comment upon the Department's diligence in providing prompt responses to questions on notice. </PARA>
<PARA>It is always good in such letters to have some praise first. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> There is however-</PARA>
<PARA>this is normally the next line-</PARA>
<PARA>one matter which does concern me. </PARA>
<PARA> That Committee commented that the failure to provide ``advance copies of the annual reports'' breached the ``legal obligation to report to Parliament''. As you will recall, we discussed providing to the Committee copies of drafts of annual reports in September, some time before the hearings. </PARA>
<PARA> My record of our conversation is that I advised you that it was unlikely that the drafts would be ready. Your reply was to the effect that the request was formal only and they were not needed. With the benefit of hindsight, it seems unfortunate neither I nor the Department was advised that the Committee particularly wanted the reports and considered there to be legal obligation to provide advance copies of the reports. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be grateful if you would circulate this letter to the members of the Estimates Committee D so that they might be advised that the Department did not deliberately fail to meet its obligations to report to the Parliament. Rather, in view of our conversation, the Department and other portfolio agencies were under the impression that the Committee merely had expressed an interest in obtaining copies of drafts of the annual reports only if they were readily available. </PARA>
<PARA>In view of that letter, it is difficult to sustain this claim of total failure of the Department, as expressed by Senator Puplick. The reality is that the provision of reports is always subject to gaining certificates from the Auditor-General which, I might say, in this day and age is not an easy process. It is something that the Department attempts on every occasion but is not always possible to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that, even in the absence of an Auditor-General's certificate, there are obligations on us. But, having said that, I can say that my office, in its contact with the Committee, attempted to establish clearly what the Committee regarded as our proper obligations, and I do not believe that we departed from our understanding of those obligations and of what the Committee actually required. If we have done so, I can undertake to make sure that it never happens again. However, we thought we clearly understood the Committee's requirements and my clear understanding was that we had abided by that undertaking. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to raise a couple of matters relating to the National Film and Sound Archive. No doubt, Mr Chairman, if you were not in the chair you might well be raising them yourself. They relate to an additional response by Senator Richardson late this afternoon in which he corrected a comment which had indicated that there may be increased funding becoming available to the Sound and Film Archive when, in fact, it now appears that funding is not becoming available. The reason I raise this is that there is clear concern in the printed replies to questions asked at the Senate Estimates Committee relating to the adequacy of the funds available to the National Film and Sound Archive to preserve the nitrate stock of film which is deteriorating rapidly. I raise this because, it seems to me, there is a clear indication in these written replies that the present funding is inadequate.</PARA></TALK.START>

Additional resources would be required to provide for the remainder of the at-risk nitrate film collection still awaiting copying. </PARA>
<PARA>There is then a response as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Resources need to be maintained at the present level until the entire nitrate film collection is copied. Extra laboratory facilities and storage would be required to cope with this part of the Archive's collection. </PARA>
<PARA>This becomes a little more confusing when one looks further on and sees the clear statement that the funding is inadequate to cope. The printed statement on page 9 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Based on known rates of decomposition it can be assumed that all nitrate films ought to be copied by the year 2000. At the current rate of special funding for nitrate preservation, the Australian component of the collection could all be preserved by the year 2005. </PARA>
<PARA>That is five years later than the time that the National Film and Sound Archive says all the nitrate film should be copied. I do not know what the Government thinks will happen during those five years-perhaps, magically, decomposition will cease. There is clearly, in these written replies, a statement of major concern about a five-year excessive time delay between treating this nitrate stock and the time that it ought to be treated. </PARA>
<PARA> The current backlog in processing nitrate material is three staff years, or approximately 700,000 feet of film to be examined and assessed for film preservation. However, the Archive seems to me to go on to raise even greater problems. It states of the current year:</PARA>
<PARA>Target figures for copying of motion picture film materials during the 1989/90 financial year are:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Nitrate based film materials-280,000 feet copied to acetate for preservation. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Acquisition exchange-240,000 feet of nitrate and 400,000 feet of acetate to be examined and, if accepted for addition to the collection to have video copies made for delivery to suppliers. </PARA>
<PARA>The key point is that, of the present stock, only 280,000 feet are to be copied to acetate for preservation. The report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> This will bring the total amount of nitrate based picture film preserved onto acetate based film to approximately 2 million feet or-</PARA>
<PARA>I want to stress this-</PARA>
<PARA>17% of the total nitrate collection. This will leave some 83% of the nitrate film collection for preservation. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, more than four-fifths of the job is still ahead of us by the end of this financial year. There is an admission that apparently we will be five years too late in terms of the target date by which this ought to be done, and nothing is being done to speed it up. These figures clearly indicate that approximately 10 million feet will remain to be done by the target year of 2000. It would take just under a million feet a year to be processed and this year, I point out, 280,000 feet are being processed, not a million feet. If this is to be delayed until 2005 it makes an annual rate of approximately 600,000 feet. In other words, we look to be going at a rate that is clearly 50 per cent too slow to meet the target date. </PARA>

In the case of the National Film and Sound Archive I have been through a number of arguments within government about funding in the last few years. I might say that on each occasion I have been successful in getting the extra funds which the National Film and Sound Archive was seeking. In a field such as this, involving the preservation of these particular films, we are not looking at an exact science. We are finding out more information as we go along.

I imagine that in the next few years whichever Minister in the fourth Hawke Government is responsible for this will come forward with yet another program to increase funds. Again, it will be in accord with what the National Film and Sound Archive assures us is attainable. All we can do in the end is meet the requests that it makes of us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He certainly will be responsible. I now wish to deal briefly with the Australian Tourist Commission. I draw the attention of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) to the fact that in the annual report of the Australian Tourist Commission, in the section entitled `Looking ahead', there are target forecasts of tourists coming to Australia and these figures have an accompanying statement with them. The Tourist Commission describes the airline dispute as a dispute, despite the views of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). The report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The dispute was one of the factors the ATC took into account when it drew up its visitor arrival targets for the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA>The Tourist Commission does not reveal the extent to which it has diminished its forecasts as a result of the airline strike. I wonder whether it is possible for the Australian Tourist Commission to take the rest of Australia into its confidence by revealing the extent to which the airline strike, and this Government's incompetent handling of it, will significantly diminish tourism flows to Australia in coming years. I draw the Minister's attention to a table on page 45 of the annual report which reveals that total tourism for Australia in 1989 is forecast to be down by about 80,000 tourists as compared to last year. That is a fall of about 3.6 per cent involving substantial falls-for example, a 14 per cent fall in tourist numbers from New Zealand; a one per cent fall from Japan; an 8 per cent fall from the United Kingdom and Ireland; a 15 per cent fall from the United States of America and an 18 per cent fall from Canada. The figures in the table go back to 1982-83 and I see from the table that these are the first falls that have taken place since then. I wonder whether the Minister is prepared to give us an estimate of the impact of this strike on tourism-particularly in the context of questions asked by Senator Puplick at Senate Estimates Committee D hearings regarding whether or not the Government's program and the Tourist Commission's program had already been suffering as a result of unfortunate market forces. Page 21 of the Tourist Commission report states:</PARA>
<PARA> However, the US market has clearly demonstrated a resistance to escalating costs in Australia as United States travellers have become more value-conscious. </PARA>
<PARA>It points out that there has been a decline in United States tourism to Australia, with a downturn of 10 per cent in the second half of the fiscal year. This sort of decline, which in this case is mentioned as being clearly due to escalating costs in Australia, is yet another example of the impact of uncontrolled inflation on this country as a result of this Government's policies-uncontrolled in the sense that it is double the rate of our trading partners. Here is a clear instance of the damaging impact of an inflation rate double that of our trading partners. I know that the Minister will say that when the Fraser Government was in power the inflation rate was X or Y per cent. It is not a matter of whether it is lower than it was 10 years ago, but of the level compared with those in the rest of the world. In the Minister's own area the Australian Tourist Commission has stated that United States tourism to Australia was affected even before the airline strike because Australian costs were rising too fast. We should look also at what has been happening in New Zealand. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the New Zealand market cannot be taken for granted. A slowdown in visitor arrivals in early 1989 led to a growth rate of 6.9 per cent for 1988-89 . . . The slowing in growth emphasised the need for fresh and innovative marketing techniques. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that in any event Australia is facing a tourism problem, fuelled by increasing Australian costs, despite some very imaginative work by the Australian Tourist Commission in an attempt to attract tourists. I am not certain as to what extent the targets set by the Tourist Commission are meaningful. Certainly, they predict very substantial growth by the year 2000, no doubt based on the assumption that the pilots strike will be over by the year 2000. I would like the Minister to let us know what assumptions in terms of the pilots strike were used by the Department and the Tourist Commission in setting these very demoralising and depressing targets for 1989 and 1990 which predict minimal or no growth over the next two years compared to the bounding growth of last year. Is it not about time that the Government did something positive to resolve the pilots dispute if that is the major issue, or did something positive to halt inflation if, as seems to be the case, that is the major issue?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Baume has shown an awful ignorance of the industry in his contribution this evening. When one looks at the cost structure of Australian holidays for international visitors there have been some alarming cost increases in the last couple of years. When I had actual day to day responsibility for the industry I made a number of public pleas in speeches to some of the leading hotels around Australia, particularly those in Sydney and Melbourne, not to increase their prices at the rate at which they were. The rate of increase in prices for the major hotels in Sydney is an example of this. It bears no resemblance to inflation. It leaves inflation for dead. There is no comparison.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The years of plenty were brought about by a forward thinking Hawke Government which came in and picked up tourism, which had been for so long ignored by the Fraser Government, massively increased funding for the Australian Tourist Commission (ATC) and did something about attracting visitors. One can only assume that, having done that, and the industry having enjoyed the benefits of those far-sighted actions, for which I must give my predecessor John Brown great credit, the industry decided that things would be good forever. Some of those in the industry took great advantage of that. Expo and the Bicentennial brought home to them just how good things could be, and they had a blow-out. Unfortunately, the costs of the major hotels in some of our capital cities blew out with it. That caused the industry a problem then and, in my view, causes it one now. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I think we should return to the real thrust of Senator Michael Baume's comments. When he was not playing politics he was actually asking some questions. What he called forecasts of the ATC were, in fact, targets. Nonetheless, let me say something about the effect of the difficult situation we have with the pilots and what it means to tourist numbers. </PARA>

I corrected him. If the Tourist Commission is still using that phrase in its publications, then I correct it now. The difficult situation with the pilots in recent times has caused us some problems. Given that I mentioned my foray into London, it is interesting to note that, at the function which the Australian Tourist Commission had for the one day that I was there, representatives of the industry in Great Britain had come along in fairly great numbers. I attempted, in so far as is possible on occasions of this kind, to talk to as many of them as I could. Some were saying that a drop of 15 per cent in numbers coming to Australia from the United Kingdom and Ireland-which, of course, have been our star performers of foreign markets in the last 12 months-was likely over the course of the next three months. I cannot say that that was a universally held view, but it certainly seemed to be a majority view from what I could glean.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think after those three months it will depend upon our capacity to demonstrate that that difficult situation is difficult no longer. If we can demonstrate that, then I am confident that our numbers can go back up. But there is a question of confidence about the capacity of international visitors to fly internally in Australia without discomfort. We will have to satisfy the questions involved in that if we are to get the numbers back up. That was the purpose of my visit to London and I hope I contributed, at least in some small way, to that process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish just to add a couple of other comments to that. September visitor arrivals show a decline of about 17 per cent over the previous year. Holiday arrivals show a decline in that month of about 22 per cent. Obviously we can attribute some of that to a decline over the extraordinary year of 1988 with Expo and the Bicentennial. But, having said that, it is still a significant decline and a worry for Australia. I do not believe that the full impact of the difficult situation we have experienced with the pilots is reflected in just the September figures. Many visitors, already committed to their travel plans for September and probably August, continued with their plans because they could not alter them at short notice. For October, November and December we face the prospect that there were those who could alter their travel plans, and may well have done so. The Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics has projected a decline of 15 to 17 per cent for the December quarter due to the difficult situation created by the pilots, and that is after correcting for a post-Expo effect. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope the guesses made by various experts are of some assistance to the honourable senator in working out what may happen. By announcing a very substantial package of assistance to the industry, the Government is trying to make sure that the Australian Tourist Commission is well and truly equipped in international markets to convince potential visitors to Australia that that difficult situation is less difficult and by the end of the year will present no difficulty at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, I ask the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson): What are his Government in general and he in particular going to do to correct the appalling name that Australia now has in some areas as a result of bitter personal experience by people who have purchased package tours from Europe? A backpacker from Germany who I was behind in a queue at Sydney Airport had booked a tour that included Darwin and was trying to get from Sydney to Darwin. He was told that within the next four days there was no possible way that he would get from Sydney to Darwin unless he was prepared to go via Adelaide and that he could do that at the additional cost of $180 because that route carries that additional cost. I believe that this kind of blackmail and standover tactics by any airline is totally unacceptable. It is unacceptable that we as a nation should encourage people to come to Australia as tourists and then blackmail them into paying $180 to get to the destination that we undertook to get them to. The airlines should be doing the decent thing. After all, they have the use of equipment from the Royal Australian Air Force at a fraction of its real cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us really deal with the substance of this matter. The fact is that we have an obligation to tourism in this country, an obligation that is not being met in that we are forcing backpacker-type tourists-not the elite, the rich people of this world-to pay a premium to get to a destination that we have an obligation to get them to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee is considering a department which is hydra-headed. My cousin, Senator Michael Baume, has just been discussing tourism. I wish to direct some remarks now to territories, particularly the Australian Capital Territory and to the Royal Canberra Hospital in the Australian Capital Territory. I raised this matter during the examination of Senate Estimates Committee F. The matter did not properly belong there. Being the Royal Canberra Hospital, it properly belongs in this Committee and in this group. The problem concerns the human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) which as honourable senators know causes the disease acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). It concerns the national policy which we have developed in this country for dealing with that infection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind members of the Committee that we have two elements to our national policy: the first is to prevent infection of people with the virus; the second is to minimise damage done by the virus to those who are infected. I want to report to the Committee on action by the Royal Canberra Hospital staff that was not in the best interests of patients, that was contrary to the national policy that has been developed by this Government and promoted by this Government, and that was quite contrary to all of the guidelines that have been laid down. After it was raised in the Estimates Committee, when I phoned the hospital to see what it had done about the problem, I discovered that hospital staff were obdurate in their determination to go down a road which was inappropriate and incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts are that there are only certain ways in which to pick up the human immuno-deficiency virus. Normal contact, including nursing someone who is infected, is not one of those ways. Further, when a patient is admitted to the Royal Canberra Hospital-as a certain patient whom I mentioned in Estimates Committee F was; I refer honourable senators and members of the Committee to page F161 and the following pages of the Hansard of 10 October-who is negative on blood tests and is not infected with the virus, there is absolutely no reason in the world to consider that patient to be dangerous to the staff. After all, if someone is not infected that person will not pass on the virus. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to report the case of a patient admitted to the Royal Canberra Hospital for suspected meningitis, a patient who was open and candid enough to say that he was homosexual but who could report, and whose doctor could report, that numerous blood tests had shown that he was not carrying the virus that causes HIV infection, who was then treated by staff at the Royal Canberra Hospital as a high risk patient. By the way, there is no such thing as a high risk patient, there is high risk behaviour. A red sticker was placed on the record at the end of his bed saying `high risk'. Nurses wore gloves and masks when they came to take his temperature or to tend him. He said that his bed linen was not changed for three days. </PARA>
<PARA> All in all the hospital staff behaved disgracefully. We have actually got certain things laid down in the national policy which was released by this Government-I seem to recall that Dr Blewett and Mr Shack together released the policy as a bipartisan matter because it is too important for party politics. First, we laid down the right to confidentiality. What kind of confidentiality did this patient get in the Royal Canberra Hospital with a great red sticker on the end of his bed saying `high risk' when he was not a high risk patient and when it was inappropriate behaviour in any case? Confidentiality as laid down in the policy was breached. Secondly, he was treated inappropriately because there was absolutely no need for nursing staff to wear gloves or masks unless they were doing it for every patient in the hospital, as someone pointed out in the Estimates Committee. Of course they were not. </PARA>
<PARA> It indicates that in the Royal Canberra Hospital at that time, a little earlier this year, there was gross ignorance on the part of line staff about the proper cross-infection control measures to be applied for the prevention of HIV infection. Obviously there was ignorance of the infection control measures which have been identified and publicised for control of HIV infection-and they have been identified. The Australian National Council on AIDS has done so. There was grossly inappropriate behaviour towards this particular patient. That was bad enough. I have to pay tribute to the Department of Community Services and Health. When this matter was raised-I must say improperly raised by me-Senator Cook was the Minister in that Committee and he did not object. The Department promised to raise it with the Royal Canberra Hospital. The Chief Medical Officer had this exchange with me. I said:</PARA>
<PARA> You said earlier that, if you became aware of a State or Territory hospital not abiding by those guidelines, you would be in touch with it. </PARA>
<PARA>That was my question. The Chief Medical Officer, Dr Adams, replied:</PARA>
<PARA> Certainly. We have a governmental committee on AIDS, a member of which would be the Chief Health Officer for the ACT. We can take that up with him immediately to see what is happening in Canberra hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA>This happened on 10 October. I was outraged. We are having enough difficulty in this community to stop hysterical over-reaction to human immuno-deficiency virus infection. It is made much worse if someone comes in demonstrably not infected, who just happens to be homosexual and is treated in this manner. By the way, for those who do not know, about 10 per cent of males in Australia are homosexual. Unless red stickers are to be placed on the beds of 10 per cent of all patients, this is obviously grossly irresponsible, improper and inappropriate behaviour by the Royal Canberra Hospital. </PARA>
<PARA> Following this exchange on 10 October and knowing that Dr Adams would have been as good as his word, one would have thought that the Chief Health Officer for the ACT would have been advised. One could have hoped that at that hospital something would have been done. We know that policy direction on this matter has to come from the top. If we are dealing with businesses, we have to convince the board. If we are dealing with national policy, we have to convince the Cabinet. If we are dealing with a hospital, we have to convince the hospital management. I said that this happened on 10 October. On 25 October, knowing that this committee stage debate was coming up, I decided to phone the Royal Canberra Hospital to see what might have happened. </PARA>
<PARA> First of all, I discovered that the Executive Officer was away on some perfectly proper activity. I could not get on to the Executive Officer but I made some inquiries and on 26 October a phone call was received in my office. It was from a secretary to Judith Robson who is the Acting Executive Officer of the hospital in the absence of the Executive Officer. She said, `I am phoning about the high risk patient'. That indicates that the secretary to the Chief Executive Officer had learned nothing in the fortnight-nothing, not a single thing-because the patient was not a high risk patient. Why did the secretary keep saying that she had rung about the high risk patient? My staff officer replied-we have recorded the conversation, of course-`You mean Mr Young, who is not a high risk patient'. Incidentally, I identified the name of the patient only because he had already identified himself publicly in another publication. So my staff officer said, `Do you mean Mr Young, who is not a high risk patient?'. The secretary to the Acting Chief Executive Officer said, `Yes, Mr Young, the high risk patient'. We were trying to help her. We were trying to give her the signal that he was not a high risk patient. But if we cannot get the management or the Chief Executive Officer in the hospital to understand something about the principles of this illness, God help the rest of the hospital. If we cannot get the Royal Canberra Hospital to understand this illness, God help the Canberra community. </PARA>
<PARA> At present in Australia we have recorded 1,500 people with AIDS. By 1995 we can expect to have 15,000 recorded cases and maybe 150,000 infected people. It will touch all our lives. Every one of us will know, will be dealing with, will be relating to, will be caring for and will be worrying about someone who is infected. We will not do it if we do not understand what the illness is about. My staff member responded and said, `He is not a high risk patient', to which the secretary then responded, `Anyway, I am phoning back for Acting Chief Executive Officer, Judith Robson, who said to phone Mr Wayne Berry's office in a couple of days. They could not help with any inquiries about high risk patients'. So we have an obdurate, obstinate refusal, at the most senior levels of the Royal Canberra Hospital, to teach their own office staff what in the name of goodness this infection is about. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to get an acknowledgment from the Government that what I have said and what I am complaining about is consistent with the policy we have laid down. Of course, we want to prevent infection but we also want to ameliorate the adverse effects of the infection. What we are seeing here is the adverse effects being applied to someone who is not infected. This is scapegoating of the worst kind. It is incompetence and I suggest that we should expect better from the Royal Canberra Hospital and every other health institution. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say a few words in defence of the hospital. We have been dealing with the administrative head of the hospital. Had I gone to certain of the clinical departments I might have got a completely different answer. When this patient was admitted, the clinicians were in charge of his treatment and put the red sticker on his bed and the clinical nurses decided to don gloves and masks to treat him. My concern is that we go in very hard, early, to try to get our policy right and to get it understood. That means having our major health care institutions understanding and applying it as it should be applied. What went on at this hospital to this man was awful. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators and members of the Committee would be interested to know that this man wrote an account of his mistreatment for a journal called AIDS Action which is published by the AIDS Action Council of the Australian Capital Territory. In the August 1989 issue he concluded his article by advising people in the ACT in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> I for one, however, as a result of my recent experience, would strongly advise any person to conceal they are gay, (or an intravenous drug user), especially if they are confident of being HIV negative until procedures at Royal Canberra Hospital are changed. </PARA>
<PARA>He is absolutely right. If the consequences of admitting something about one's personal lifestyle are that one is treated in that fashion, one would be a fool to let people know. The Government and the Opposition have worked together. We have gone to a lot of trouble to try to develop a policy which is appropriate and proper. It is a pity that it is not being applied more consistently or more expertly within the ACT. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Peter Baume intervened in this debate not by asking a question but by making a statement and several accompanying observations which I think it would be improper for the Government not to acknowledge and reply to. In Estimates committee hearings and in debates such as this in the Committee of the Whole, the Government sometimes receives complaints that the procedures of Estimates committees, and the way in which they are practised or undertaken, are misused. This is not the occasion on which I would make that complaint; this is an occasion on which I would say that the vehicle of the Committee of the Whole has proved useful in enabling Senator Peter Baume to ventilate a matter of concern to him and, I believe, to the Government and the wider community as well. I take this moment to acknowledge that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also want to say that Senator Peter Baume-he was modest enough not to refer to it-was a medical practitioner of some distinction before he entered politics. We in the Government would rather that he continued as a medical practitioner because he adds firepower and weight to the Opposition. Nonetheless, he speaks on this matter in this forum with that background and knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> We are dealing with the estimates of departments considered by Estimates Committee D. The matter Senator Peter Baume has raised arises under the territories division of these estimates-a conglomerate portfolio which is before the chamber at the moment. It so happens, by good luck, poor management, or a combination of both, that I am the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett). Later tonight or tomorrow we will take the estimates for Estimates Committee F, in which the community services and health portfolio appears, where this question equally could have been asked. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not offensive to the proposition that has been mounted but, from a territory portfolio point of view, it is appropriate to make the observation that these matters concerning the Royal Canberra Hospital fall outside the purview of the territory portfolio as such. That view cannot be put as strongly, although there are elements of truth in it for the community services and health portfolio. I will treat the remarks raised this evening by Senator Peter Baume as questions on notice for me to answer tomorrow in full expectation, rightly, that this issue should be answered. However, before yielding to the portfolio Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, I regard the events as recounted-events of which I have had some knowledge-as forming a particularly tacky and tasteless affair. They are events which elevate ignorance to a level that is undeserving. In the face of better knowledge, the dogged persistence to stick with the high risk patient category defies understanding. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I wish to make is that it is vitally important for the community to be able to contend with the effects of AIDS and with those who are infected, honestly and directly, without making proscriptive moral judgments and by going directly to the cause and treating that cause in the best possible way. That means that, if people come forward under medical attention and declare their sexual preference-in this case, that they are homosexual-that should be respected as an indication to others that they should too, so that there is a broader understanding in the medical fraternity about what may be the possible causes of any problems, if that be the case. For someone to be penalised, as it would seem in this case, for simply being honest is to invite people not to declare their preferences and thus endanger the whole potential treatment regime that might apply. If nothing else, apart from the behavioural aspects of this particular case, that is the most enduring and damaging testimonial to these events. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a small point because I do not believe that I can let it go by. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson), who is in the chamber, simply by a wave of the hand slurred the hotel and hospitality industry just a few minutes ago when he suggested that it had taken advantage of the good times in the tourist industry by unfairly escalating its tariffs; in other words, having its snout in the trough. He simply does not understand the industry, if I am correct in picking up what the Minister said. All he probably does know is the international hotel circuit, which he would quite often stay at.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WH4">Senator McGAURAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do not; that is quite correct. I do not stand here and defend the international hotel circuit. It has a very high cost structure and undoubtedly its tariffs have gone up to meet that cost structure. It is my personal belief that its exorbitantly high tariffs, over the $200 mark, are not matched by service-good old-fashioned hospitality. Anyone who stays at an international hotel will say that the service is not the same as it used to be and does not match the middle range hotels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not here to defend the international hotels. But I am here to defend 90 per cent, if not more, of the industry, which the Minister would know nothing about because he shows a clear misunderstanding of it. I am talking about small business people, not international chains owned by the Japanese, by Skase or by anyone else. These are the 90 per cent of small business owner operators who get out there and make the rooms, change the sheets and vacuum the floors themselves. They are family industries. Most of them have fewer than 100 rooms and their tariffs are certainly less than $100. Any increase in tariffs that they may have added have only been to match the high cost structures enforced by this Government as a result of interest rates and inflation. They have not had their snouts in the trough. It is a highly competitive industry at that particular level. They cater not only for Australian tourists but for international tourists as well. It is a highly competitive industry and they certainly cannot afford the great hikes that the international hotels have been able to make. </PARA>
<PARA> Was the Minister referring to these people? Of course he was, because he does not understand the industry at all. Are we to believe that the Minister is saying that these people are rip-off merchants? He has been so spoilt in going from international hotel to international hotel that he simply has no understanding of the small business structure of this particular industry. The Minister suggests that the tariffs are so high that the tourists can no longer afford to stay. Again, I come back to the simple point: he knows only the international circuit. Will the Minister please withdraw his comments, or at least enlighten us as to exactly what he meant by those comments?</PARA>

I am not capable of saying anything unkind about anybody from the other side of the chamber. I had to muster up some sort of indignation just to say that much. I raise with the Minister some matters in respect of the inquiry of the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts into drugs in sport, of which I have the dubious distinction of being the Deputy Chairman. The Committee has made a number of recommendations in respect of testing by an independent agency, the criminalisation of the use of anabolic steroids and the upgrading of surveillance by the Australian Customs Service. I ask the Minister to forgive me for not having asked these questions at the Estimates Committee hearing but I was just not available. I will understand if the Minister is not able to give me detailed answers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is it the view of the Government that the recommendations that are contained in the Committee's report ought to be adopted? We understand that the Minister has embraced the proposal for an independent agency. I understand he has indicated that publicly and we thank him for that. Legislative procedures are necessary to implement fully that recommendation. Could the Minister give me an indication as to when we might see that legislation? Provided the Government accepts the recommendation-and I understand it does-when will the Commonwealth and State Ministers meet to look at some of the responsibilities we suggest that they should assume. One might reasonably argue, with the non-dispute that is going on with the pilots, that there is some difficulty in that. Can the Minister give me an idea as to when we might see some action in respect of that? In the event that that meeting is consummated, can we expect that recommendation 10 will be dealt with? Recommendation 10 states:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) agree to make anabolic steroids prepared for human use a Schedule Eight drug;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) agree to make the sale or supply without prescription of anabolic steroids a criminal offence, using the Western Australian legislation as a model;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) subject to advice from Commonwealth and State Ministers for primary industry, and because of the widespread use of veterinary anabolic steroids by sportspeople, investigate the possibility of making veterinary anabolic steroids subject to the same degree of control as applies to anabolic steroids for human use. </PARA>
<PARA>In particular I refer to point (iii) because, while I think some States are amending their legislation-or at least introducing new legislation-to overcome the problem, we had the experience during our Committee deliberations of learning, for instance, that it is inappropriate and an offence, in fact, to provide or administer anabolic steroids to race horses but that it is appropriate to supply the same anabolic steroids to human beings which, by any measure, is a contradiction in terms of one's standards of health and welfare. I will leave it at that for the time being. Could the Minister give me an indication of his present position?</PARA>

In so far as the legislation on the Australian Sports Drug Agency is concerned, as the honourable senator would be aware, the body is already up and running and is being overseen at present by a committee from the Australian Sports Commission. Legislation is currently being prepared. I would not imagine that we would be able to deal with it in the Senate before the New Year, but it certainly will be a priority of mine to convince my colleagues that it is priority legislation for the next session. That legislation will provide for a committee, which will be outside the Sports Commission, to oversee that body. As the honourable senator would know, we have physically removed the body, but we will also take away that oversight role.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I raise the recommendations of the Senate Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts inquiry into drugs in sport, I wish to pick up on a point made by the Minister earlier this evening. While he was talking about tourism he spoke of the airlines being able to fly people around Australia quite comfortably at present. Obviously, he has not flown on the 757 which Ansett Airlines of Australia has borrowed, I think, from a Spanish airline. The seats on it are as hard as concrete. Having spent four hours on it from midnight, Perth time, Perth to Sydney, I can hardly sit down. The other 230 people who were on that crowded aeroplane would be in the same position. Before the Minister makes further statements like that-innocently as it may have been-he should check the suitability of that plane for long distances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to the drugs in sport inquiry. Senator Crichton-Browne has mentioned a couple of its recommendations. One recommendation is that the Australian Institute of Sport investigate the approval of medical supply purchases without medical officer authorisation, contrary to AIS policy. There was a lot of evidence presented to the Committee that medical supplies were bought under the orders of a coach without having been okayed by the doctors. There is a recommendation from Price Waterhouse, which did an inquiry into the books of the AIS. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> In our view, there has been and will always be scope for unscrupulous persons to misuse Institute funds and would point out that, given the nature of the Institute's operations, it would be virtually impossible to devise a failsafe scheme, particularly with regard to travel expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA>A lot of questions were raised at the inquiry as to the acquittal of expenses where coaches and others were taking money overseas. Senator Black is in the chamber. He should remember this. The expenses were not necessarily properly acquitted when people returned. The question I address to the Minister based on that recommendation and on previous recommendations is: What has the Department done to make sure that such handling of money never happens again? One coach at the AIS wrote out a receipt to himself in one case. In other words, he was acquitting money to himself. In another case, the Institute, under the guise of the coach or the other way around, had got some stuff from a pharmacy in New South Wales. The coach was so negligent in covering up his tracks that he put down the pharmacy as having a Victorian address. I know that all of these things are water under the bridge, but I should certainly like to know whether measures have been put into place by the Department to carry out the recommendations that the Committee made on drugs in sport and to prevent these things from ever happening again. The people of Australia must have confidence that the AIS is being run properly. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I am on the subject of the AIS, a certain coach called Lyn Jones got quite a mention in the report. I would like to know whether he is still employed at the Institute; if he is employed, what his position is, what sort of salary he is on and what access he has to funds generally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And some of mine. In any event, he is not employed by the AIS, so I do not claim any responsibility for whatever he is doing. Obviously, the inquiry which has been conducted revealed a number of shortcomings in the way the Institute handled certain matters. In particular, reference was made to the Price Waterhouse internal audit report on the weightlifting expenditure. That report was carried out with the period 1981 to 1988 as the period to be covered. In fact, in was the Institute of Sport which suggested that the Audit Office be requested to conduct its own examination of weightlifting expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Audit Office reported directly to the Committee and a copy of that report has been made available. A summary of the findings is reported in the Auditor-General's report on ministerial portfolios. In summary, the Auditor-General concluded that the scope and approach of the internal audit review was soundly based and that the report represented fairly the matters addressed and the findings of the review. Further, the Auditor-General concluded that the internal audit review was undertaken in an independent manner and that the present AIS systems are generally appropriate, considering the Institute's size. The report recommended areas for improvement, including stock and asset control, the acquittal of goods purchased overseas and controls over sponsorship in kind. Importantly, it detected no evidence of the misuse of funds. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of those areas recommended for improvement the Institute has implemented the following measures: it has revised assets and stores control systems and procedures. Current indications are that the Audit Office is satisfied with these changes. It has revised travel procedures and made sure that we have implemented systems which incorporate improved control over cash advances and acquittal procedures. There are revised procedures for the purchase of medical supplies, including vitamins and food supplements. In particular, the Institute has attempted to marry the efforts of medical staff with sports science staff to make sure that those two bodies are communicating better about what they are prescribing for athletes. There has been some improvement in the control over goods provided as sponsorship in kind. There has been an ongoing problem in that area which is not easily overcome. If one looks at the nature of the arrangements which relate to individual sponsors, that is easy to understand. But improvements are occurring and we will keep working on it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is endeavouring to set up a body which can continue after the legislation is passed and which will not necessarily have to be altered. But that is in so far as staff and procedure are concerned. What is not addressed at the moment and what cannot be addressed until we get the legislation is the question of a proper body to oversee the activities of the agency. That will not happen until we get legislation, which will be in the new year, and I hope that we can get a committee which will satisfy anyone. Its job, by the way, will not be to choose individual athletes for testing. That will still be the job of staff. However, it will be to ensure that justice is applied equally and fairly across all the sports bodies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I point out to Senator Panizza that there are still questions to be answered in the legislation; for example, `What sort of reporting systems should there be on those who are found to have positive tests? Should they be made public? If so, when-immediately or after appeals? Should they simply notify the Minister or do they notify the Parliament?'. I can honestly say that I am still in discussion with a number of people about the best way to go on some of those matters. I am not necessarily convinced one way or the other. We will not get an answer to those questions until the new year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to pursue this matter unduly and offer the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) rhetorical questions, but he would know that this matter has been addressed with impeccable impartiality and bipartisan support for the duration of this laborious inquiry, which I hope has been fruitful in terms of its endeavours and the ultimate resolutions which have flowed from it. I thank the Minister for his response in respect of Customs. I hope that that is a matter that the Minister will address with some vigour. I noticed that Mr Bowman from the Australian Institute of Sport, on return from overseas with some athletes, was quite outraged when he and his athletes were asked whether or not they had anything to declare in respect of this matter. Perhaps he had not read carefully the recommendations of the inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other thing I should say, by way of self-congratulation, is that it is not without significance to note that almost all major amateur sports in Australia-although I can never draw a distinction between amateur and professional in this day and age-have embraced the more significant of our recommendations in terms of drug testing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Almost all the professional and amateur sports, and I think almost without exception, have embraced our recommendation for independent testing-notwithstanding the fact that every single one of them has given us an assurance that their sport is the least likely to be helped by anabolic steroids or any other performance enhancing drugs. But out of decency to their athletes they are going to have them tested. The point that we have all sought to make is that these tests are not to catch the cheats; as much as anything they are to ensure that the decent, honest and endeavouring athletes can be seen to be winning on their own merits so that they are not smeared and coloured by claims relating to use of performance enhancing drugs. One coach who came before us showed us all his athletes' records to demonstrate that they were not on drugs-because their records were worse than anyone else's. Is not that an indictment of where we are at?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister would be aware of the Moscow conference, which was attended by Senator Black, together with another 119 delegates from some 34 countries, and there is the Rome meeting of 13 nations. The Moscow meeting was really to get a consensus at least-to use the expression the Minister used earlier on-to establish the facts. The Rome meeting is to try to get something of a more substantial nature settled. The Minister would know that on 8 December there is a meeting of representatives from the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia, which nations take the bulk of the Commonwealth Games medals. I think about 80 per cent of the medals are won by those countries. The proposal is to have a cross-testing scheme amongst those three nations. One would think that that would be an excellent forerunner to ensure proper, legitimate, independent and discrete testing of all nations by other nations. Did the Minister support the Moscow conference and does he support the Rome meeting? More particularly, is the Government fully embracing the proposals for the 8 December meeting?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes is the answer, I think, to all questions the honourable senator has asked. On my visit to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) a couple of weeks ago I had an appointment with the Russian Minister for Sport, Mr Rusak. Certainly, he indicated that the USSR is very keen to ensure that independent drug testing is carried out on athletes around the world. I do not doubt the sincerity of the USSR's views on the matter. I think the people there are pretty keen to see it carried through. They proudly point out, of course, that it is not their athletes that are getting caught around the world with positive tests. However, they are keen and I think that will be followed up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the Rome meeting to which Senator Crichton-Browne referred, I think so much of it that the very famous Senator Black will be sent over there, along with Steve Haynes, to represent our views. I think that in itself is testimony to how important we regard the matter. As far as the meeting on 8 December is concerned, we are enthusiastic about an agreement and I think an agreement now is pretty much a formality. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I refer to Christmas Island and to air services, which at the moment are not provided. About four to five months ago the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories advertised for a northern charter from Singapore to Christmas Island. At that stage two tenders came from Christmas Island, and those tenders were not successful. A few weeks ago officers of the Department in Perth announced that Amann Aviation had been awarded the contract for flights between Singapore, Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Perth. I believe that the price then was $600 from Christmas Island to Singapore. That price then increased to $700 from Christmas Island to Singapore.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The problems that Amann Aviation had suffered led to the contract being cancelled by the Department. I believe that the plane actually made the trip only twice. On the second attempt to depart from Christmas Island the engines were smoking and oil had to be poured into the engines while people were watching. On the third attempt the plane was about six or seven hours late arriving on Christmas Island. The reason given was that the engines were shuddering so much that the plane had to be flown at a speed that would barely keep it in the air. On the fourth attempt there were no life jackets on board and the Civil Aviation Authority grounded the plane. During this time of non-service the price has increased from $860 return from Perth to $930. People were very lucky not to be involved in a very serious accident. What is the position now regarding flights between Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Singapore and Perth? I know that last Wednesday a Royal Australian Air Force Hercules was put on the Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Singapore route. Mr Woodmore is very keen, with a consortium of Islanders, to form a company that will run its own charter service. Will the Government be prepared to give its blessing to that charter service run by a consortium of Islanders? It is ironical, but I understand that the local garage man who runs the local service station was the man who--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Richardson" NAMEID="4E4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He probably supplied the oil, but he also arranged a charter from Singapore to Christmas Island when Amann Aviation was unable to carry people. I find it slightly strange that the local garage man, obviously a free enterprise spirit, was able to organise a charter. Mr Woodmore is establishing on the island a $26m casino. With the United Credit Union Ltd of Perth and another Islander, Leah Wong, he is very interested in establishing a charter service that would fly from Cocos (Keeling) Islands to Christmas Island and then to Singapore and return the other way. Can the Minister say whether his Government would see anything wrong in letting this service out to tender? If those to whom I have referred were successful in tendering and put that charter service in place, would the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories then operate a Government charter to complete against the private company? If that happened, it would probably make this enterprise uneconomic.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We would certainly not try to run a Government operation to defeat those people for the charter. We are anxious to get some kind of long term settlement of the problem. Since this operation began, the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has gone to great lengths to keep air links going. As Senator Boswell probably realises, the arrangement with Australian Airlines Ltd was ending; I think it ended last July or August. Therefore, the Government was already looking at a replacement, prior to the difficult situation with the pilots arising.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the time, the Department approached the Australian Federation of Air Pilots and asked it for a dispensation, which the pilots refused, despite the isolated location of Christmas Island. The Department requested the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) to make available aircraft and also sought alternative charter aircraft. However, the only way to try to resolve the problem was to seek expressions of interest in providing some sort of temporary service to the islands. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Department did that, a number of operators applied and, out of that process, Amann Aviation was successful. A number of those who tendered an expression of interest were unsuitable because of either the size of the aircraft or the kind of operation they wanted to run. The Department agreed to Amann taking on the job on the basis that the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and the Department of Transport and Communications were satisfied that the operator had all the approvals necessary. On that basis, the operation began. The Department of Transport and Communications agreed with the operator proposed by Amann conducting weekly charter services to the islands until 21 December this year, subject to all the necessary operational clearances from the Civil Aviation Authority being received. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of information provided by Amann, the CAA agreed to the operation of three flights each on a one-off basis. Following the initial information from Amann, the CAA requested additional information, which would have been necessary for the charter flights to operate in the longer term. This revealed that some of the earlier information provided by Amann was not correct, and on this basis the CAA refused Amann the necessary approvals to conduct further operations until it could provide extra information. As events unfolded, the company could not do so, so the Department cancelled the contract with Amann, I think last week. </PARA>
<PARA> That development leaves us in a difficult situation. In the interim we have requested the RAAF to assist us with flights, but that would at best provide only a very temporary solution. Obviously, these flights are important, not just for the movement of people but also for the provision of goods and supplies and staple requirements. There is no emergency service in terms of medical evacuations. If necessary, the Flying Doctor Service of Australia is available for an emergency. </PARA>
<PARA> We will have to ensure a more permanent arrangement. There is a difficulty in getting aircraft of the size required, as they are in very short supply. Thus, merely calling for expressions of interest does not guarantee success. If the local garage man or any other group of Christmas Islanders or Cocos Islanders can come up with the right plane, I wish they would do so so quickly, as we would be anxious to approve the service. </PARA>

Obviously, the situation with the pilots will not have helped that-in fact, it will quite obviously have made it worse-but it must be acknowledged that Norfolk Island, at least, was having problems prior to that situation developing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since the dispute began the Department has placed a very high priority on ensuring that flights to and from Norfolk Island for both cargo and passengers are maintained. At present, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) operates two regular scheduled Hercules services to the Island each week. These flights operate under East-West Ltd flight numbers, and supplement a weekly F28 jet service from Brisbane and Sydney, operated by East-West, three 737 services from Auckland each week and daily commuter flights operated by Norfolk Island Airlines. I understand that East-West will be putting on a second F28 from the middle of December, which will coincide with the announced withdrawal of the RAAF emergency services. Within a very short period of time the capacity for the carrying of passengers to and from Norfolk Island will be as good as it ever was but, I remind the chamber again, there had already been a significant downturn in Norfolk Island tourism. When considering the package, while it is true to say that no money is currently allocated specifically to Norfolk Island, I intend to make sure that some of it is spent in attempting to rehabilitate the industry there. </PARA>

In discussions which the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding) had with the Islanders they made it quite clear that they did not want the court cases going on because that would substantially delay starting up the mining operations. It was my view and Mr Holding's view that in the end the Islanders had to take precedence.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. It obviously must be a very sensitive document or selection of documents. I have been waiting a long time. I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that that commitment was made on 10 October. It is now the end of November and I have not had the courtesy of being told that the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) are dithering about whether they will make it public or not. I make the comment that it must be a very sensitive document or they must be concerned about the legality issue. The Minister at the table should be the best person to judge which it is. The Committee and I are left in the dark.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On page 268 I asked for a list of all allowances still under review with the Department of Industrial Relations and I asked whether that list would indicate the priority that the allowances have been given. I am sure the Minister recalls that question; I have asked it in each Estimates committee hearing. The officials were not prepared for that question, although it has been asked on previous occasions. I would have thought that six or seven weeks would be long enough for the Department to provide that list, but it still has not arrived either. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Newman for her courtesy in letting me intervene for one minute here. The Minister undoubtedly would have been in the chamber all evening and therefore would have missed the pleasure of tonight's Four Corners program. As the Four Corners program is in possession of a document which has on it the code, date or number 89/973, written by his Department to Mr Powell of the Department of Defence and bucketing the Sinclair Knight and Partners Pty Ltd environmental impact statement (EIS) on Jervis Bay, and is also in possession and was waving around on the television screens tonight the 1,200 pages of the draft report on Jervis Bay, is the Minister prepared to make available to me and to the Committee a copy of the letter from his Department to Mr Powell of the Department of Defence, which is clearly in the possession of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and which generalises the deficiencies of the draft EIS report. Could he also make available a document, also being bandied around by Mr Andrew Olle, from the Australian Construction Services which apparently also relates to the deficiencies of the Jervis Bay EIS. As the ABC is in possession of this document, the code number at the top of which is 89/973 and which was addressed to Mr Powell of the Department of Defence, and has been flashing it on the television all night, will the Minister make available to me and to the Committee the same document that is currently in the possession of the ABC and which may help us to understand a little better the public debate on this matter?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a few questions on this subject and, despite the lateness of the hour, I will start on them. They relate to the full bore rifle clubs, under the auspices of the National Rifle Association of Australia, which have been under the umbrella of the Department of Defence since 1904. The Minister may remember that some time last year the Department of Defence decided to move the full bore rifle clubs from under the umbrella of the Department of Defence and to return them to the control of the States, which was strongly opposed by the rifle associations around Australia. It was so strongly opposed that our side of politics, aided by the Australian Democrats, defeated the regulations so that the system went back to the status quo. Since that time I understand that there have been attempted negotiations between the Department and the National Rifle Association of Australia to see what can be done to bring about a more workable situation as there seems to have been a breakdown in communications. What negotiations have been held?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for that reply but I will have quite a few more questions on that matter tomorrow. I suggest that, when the Minister is rousing the officer out of bed, he get all information pertaining to rifle clubs under the umbrella of the Defence Department. His comment that, as defenders of the States, we would be concerned with passing the control to the States is exactly the point that we objected to last year. Full bore rifle clubs have had an association with the Defence Department since 1904 and are subject to uniform safety laws throughout Australia. The National Rifle Association of Australia wants to keep it that way. While the Minister is seeking this information overnight or in the morning-he does not have to get it overnight because the Parliament does not start until 2 o'clock in the afternoon-he should get the whole lot.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During debate in the Committee of the Whole I drew the attention of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) to a number of questions asked of the Department of Defence during the sittings of Estimates Committee D which are outstanding. While the officials are still in the chamber, I wish simply to take the opportunity of foreshadowing that, unless satisfactory answers are forthcoming tomorrow on the questions I have raised tonight and on two or three other issues which questions still remain unanswered, I shall be forced to move tomorrow that the vote on Defence expenditure be postponed until such time as those answers are tabled. Out of fairness to those officials and to the Minister, I flag that the questions outstanding relate to liability in respect of service aircraft in the air dispute, the agreement for the use of the Royal Australian Air Force in the air dispute, the cost per hour of the three aircraft types, matters relating to Arvin Consultancy Pty Ltd and the lobbying by Mr Hickman and his company of the Department. There are a number of questions involved in those issues which have not yet been responded to and will need a response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would also like to draw to the attention of the Senate that it would be very helpful if tomorrow officials could come prepared to the Committee of the Whole with a copy of the schedule dated September 1989 prepared by the director, costing branch, of the determinations of the full cost recovery rates of all service aircraft types. I would also like information on elements comprising the individual items of cost recovery. Finally, if that is not available, I would like to have a copy of the previous schedule, which I understand was dated 1 August 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> In putting those matters on the record on the adjournment tonight, I would, once again, draw attention to the current Department of Finance guidelines which cover the attendance of departmental officials at Estimates committee hearings. Senator Gareth Evans on only 21 November read these into the record of the Senate. They are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The departments have a responsibility to provide witnesses who are sufficiently expert and adequately briefed to provide answers immediately and competently. </PARA>
<PARA> Where they cannot provide answers immediately there is a further guideline which says:</PARA>
<PARA> Requests for supplementary information should be the subject of every effort to have the material provided within seven days. </PARA>
<PARA>How rarely does the Defence Department meet those guidelines? I hope that this will perhaps be some way of encouraging it in the future and certainly encouraging the answers that are required by tomorrow. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -On 27 September 1989 in this House during the adjournment debate I raised a matter relating to the magnificent cathedral of Notre Dame in Amiens, France, which contains a chapel dedicated to the Australian soldiers of World War I who fought so bravely in the defence of France and, indeed, in saving France. An Australian flag is draped from the ceiling of the chapel. It was reported to me that this flag was in a state of disrepair and that this was not becoming of such a magnificent cathedral and such an honourable chapel which is dedicated to Australian soldiers. On that day I requested the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), who was in the House at that time and who I thought was the responsible Minister-it turns out that it is the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys)-to inquire into that matter with a view to replacing the Australian flag. It was a very important request as it is a symbol of Australia so far from our own shores. Every visitor who goes to this magnificent cathedral, indeed the greatest in Europe, and passes by this chapel, has a sense of honour for Australia and Australian soldiers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am pleased to say this evening that I did receive a reply last week from the Minister, Mr Ben Humphreys, on this matter. The extent to which he answered my request is to be commended. I would like to read out three paragraphs of that letter just to illustrate the extent the Minister went to. I quote from the Minister's letter:</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that an Australian flag has been made available to the Amiens Cathedral by our Australian Embassy in Paris. This was provided in sufficient time to enable the Archbishop to have the flag on display in the Chapel for Armistice Day. </PARA>
<PARA> I am further advised that our Defence Attache in Paris, Wing Commander Steinbeck, was to visit Amiens in the week ending 17 November and that he was going to personally check and ensure that the flag was once again in place. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, of course, a number of chapels, small museums and memorials to our Australian dead throughout France. I am, therefore, arranging for a small supply of Australian flags to be made available through the Defence Attache. I believe that this will assist in avoiding problems such as the one which you have raised on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Minister for Local Government (Senator Reynolds), who is in the House, to relay my appreciation to the Minister for his promptness and complete action in this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to thank Senator McGauran for his comments tonight. Quite often when issues are raised in this chamber we are not always sure about the motives. I think Senator McGauran this evening has indicated that he does appreciate Minister Humphreys's very prompt response and I think the House will agree, from the dates he quoted, that that is the case. He has been prepared to come into this chamber this evening and pay tribute to Minister Humphreys. He has adopted a very sound, bipartisan approach to this issue which I think is as it should be. I thank Senator McGauran for his comments. I will certainly take great pleasure in relaying them to Mr Humphreys.</PARA></TALK.START>
