<TITLE>Community Services and Health Legislation</TITLE>
<PARA>To the President and members of the Senate assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> We, the undersigned medical students and medical practitioners of Australia, oppose changes to general medical practice contained in the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989. We believe:</PARA>
<PARA> All Australians should have equal access to our health care system and that there should not be two tiers of medical insurance rebates for general practice and we reject the concept of a vocational register for general practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA> Undergraduate training in general practice should be upgraded and that ongoing medical education should continue to be controlled independently by the profession.</PARA>
<PARA> The mechanism for establishing the vocational register proposed in the legislation violated the ethics of the medical profession as embodied in the Declaration of Geneva, and is totally unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA> We pray that the proposed changes to general medical practice contained in the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 should be rejected outright by the Senate and that it should be replaced with a broadly based consultative process to address the problems within general medical practice and general practice training.</PARA>

<PARA> This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the Senate to the continued Government interference in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme which has severely affected the viability of our community pharmacies and their ability to provide the quality and quantity of services to which we Australians have as a right.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The members of the Australian Armed Forces who served in Vietnam from 1962 to 1973 did so with distinction, valour and professionalism, upholding the traditions of the Armed Forces.</PARA>
<PARA> After World War 2 and the Korean War the Australian Government approved an End of War List of Gallantry Medals for individual acts of bravery that were not rewarded during wartime.</PARA>
<PARA> The Whitlam Government refused to approve such an End of War List at the end of the Vietnam War.</PARA>
<PARA> Your humble petitioners pray that:</PARA>

<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and the Senators in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The Humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That every abortion kills an unborn human baby.</PARA>
<PARA> That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Government's first duty is to protect this right to life.</PARA>
<PARA> That the most defenceless and threatened lives are those of unborn babies for whom the Government is duty bound to take extra steps to protect.</PARA>
<PARA> That in 1987-88 taxpayers funds through Medicare provided Medical Benefits for 61,879 abortions totalling $6.4 million.</PARA>
<PARA> That in the same year Commonwealth grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State Public Hospitals.</PARA>

<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>The Honourable President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA> Medicare cannot pretend to be a Universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hardest hit by proposals to restrict access to items 6469, 274 and 275 on the Medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion.</PARA>

<PARA> The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Australian Parliament expresses its repugnance that the Socialist Republic of Vietnam has kept imprisoned, 47 Buddhist leaders since 1984. And further, that the regime in Vietnam has recently tried and sentenced to death: Thich Tri Sieu and Thich Tue Sy, two distinguished scholars from amongst the 47. Both of these religious academics are intellectuals of the highest order, being scholars in Buddhist Scripture.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore request the House to denounce the intentions of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and to call on the Vietnamese Government for clemency and a remission of the death sentence as being barbaric.</PARA>

<TITLE>Home Ownership</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.</PARA>
<PARA> Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled require the Hawke-Keating government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many Australians out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families.</PARA>

<PARA> 1. They are completely satisfied with the design of the existing Australian National Flag.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. They are aware it properly reflects the immutable characteristics of Australia, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The Union Jack-itself the creation of 3 Christian crosses represents the nation's historical origin and the source of its language and law.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Southern Cross on an azure blue background signifying its place in space.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The large star depicting the advent of Federation in 1901 and each point depicting a State and the Territories of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. They know the flag has been a source of inspiration to generations of Australians in peace and war.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. They recall that millions of native-born Australians and newcomers to these shores from other parts of the world have become united under its proud symbolism.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. They are certain that any change to its form or to its acceptance as the sole Australian National Flag will produce division in the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should ensure that the existing Australian National Flag remains sacrosanct from change and remains the sole national flag.</PARA>

<PARA>EXOTIC ANIMAL DISEASE CONTROL BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to establish an Exotic Disease Preparedness Consultative Council and to provide financial assistance for purposes related to the control and eradication of exotic animal diseases. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's commitment to enhancing the exotic disease preparedness program arose from the Industry Development Review (IDR) which I initiated in late 1987 to review all industry assistance arrangements within my portfolio. The report of the IDR which was published as `Policies for Growth: A Government Policy Statement' formed part of the May 1988 Economic Statement. </PARA>
<PARA> That report identified two principal ways to increase our guard against exotic diseases. First, it recommended an increase in resources to raise our emergency preparedness to an even higher level of readiness to meet any disease outbreak. Secondly, the review saw a need to improve the range and timeliness of advice which the Government receives on exotic animal disease issues. Both of these major recommendations of the IDR are being addressed in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's major livestock based industries have a low-cost structure by world standards. The comparative economic advantage enjoyed by these industries basically arises from environmental and human resource endowment factors, and freedom from the serious pest and disease problems that afflict livestock in many foreign countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Any future outbreak of exotic disease potentially threatens to impose huge costs on the Australian economy. Our exports of livestock and livestock products are presently worth about $8 billion each year. Exotic disease outbreaks would place virtually all of these exports under varying degrees of risk ranging from total bans by importing countries to reduction in the prices which we could command for our products. Probably the strongest risk we face results from the requirement under United States food import laws of a mandatory ban on meat imports from any country for twelve months after any presence of foot-and-mouth disease. The impact on the meat industries and associated industries of such bans would be devastating. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to restriction or closure of overseas markets, exotic diseases pose the risk of diminished livestock production through death, infertility or chronic ill health in animals. Also, rabies, which is a disease defined in the Bill, would pose a serious threat to human health if it were to become established in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In recognition of these risks the Commonwealth has for many years maintained vigilance on two fronts to ensure the relative freedom of Australian flocks and herds from major exotic disease outbreaks. First, it has responsibility for quarantine at our borders. Following the Lindsay Review on quarantine arrangements the Government is presently considering changes to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our quarantine effort. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of our vigilance effort is to maintain adequate contingency plans in the event that the quarantine barrier is breached, as it inevitably will be from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> Contingency planning for exotic disease outbreaks is a joint Commonwealth-State responsibility. For many years the Commonwealth and States have co-operated closely, particularly through the Australian Agricultural Council (which consists of Commonwealth and State/NT Agriculture Ministers) and its officials' committees to maintain a high level of preparedness. Expenses incurred in combating actual disease outbreaks, including compensation payments, are shared equally by the Commonwealth and the States through an existing cost sharing agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Within that context, the Commonwealth is co-ordinating the preparation of the Australian Veterinary Emergency Plan (known as AUSVETPLAN) as an element within the national counter-disaster plan. the objectives of the exotic disease preparedness program are to provide a rapid eradication capability so as to minimise the time during which Australian livestock industries are subject to disease outbreaks and their associated costs and, perhaps more importantly, to prevent such incursions becoming endemic within Australia while eradication is considered to be reasonably feasible. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as co-ordinating the preparation of AUSVETPLAN the Commonwealth is assisting in training veterinary and other technical personnel and in trialling eradication procedures. The States and the Northern Territory also devote considerable resources each year to these activities. Also, the Commonwealth maintains a number of other programs to support exotic disease preparedness: the Australian Animal Health Laboratory at Geelong, the Screw Worm Fly facility in Papua New Guinea, contributions to the strategic reserve of foot-and-mouth disease vaccine in Britain and the feral animal control program. Commonwealth expenditure on these programs totalled $10.7 million in 1987-88. </PARA>
<PARA> A high level of preparedness has been maintained over many years, with past disease incursions such as the avian influenza outbreak in Victoria in 1985 being quickly eradicated. However, in view of the huge potential costs of a major disease outbreak, the Government has decided that more resources should be devoted to the preparedness program particularly for completion of AUSVETPLAN, training of technical personnel and active field testing of eradication procedures. </PARA>
<PARA>Exotic Animal Disease Legislation</PARA>
<PARA> In recognition of the public interest benefits from keeping our herds and flocks relatively free of major diseases, it is appropriate that the Commonwealth should contribute to the costs of expanding the exotic disease preparedness program. </PARA>
<PARA> However, as the livestock industries are the largest beneficiaries of the program, the Government considers that contributions should also be made by the major livestock industries towards additional funding, on an equal basis with the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, this Bill provides for the establishment of the Exotic Disease Preparedness Trust Account to receive annual industry contributions of $750,000, and for expenditure of industry contributions from the Account to be matched on a dollar for dollar basis by Commonwealth grant funds. The industries which will come within the new arrangements are wool, sheepmeat, beef, dairy, pigs, poultry, buffalo and goat industries. Consequential amendments to the Wool Marketing Act 1987, the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Act 1964, the Pig Slaughter Levy Act 1971, the Egg Industry Research (Hen Quota) Levy Act 1987, the Laying Chicken Levy Act 1988 the Meat Chicken Levy Act 1969, the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Act 1986 and the Rural Industries Research Act 1985 are being introduced for collecting industry contributions to the Trust Account. </PARA>
<PARA> It is anticipated that levy rates will be set in proportion to the value of production in each of the industries involved. The annual contribution of $750,000 to be made by the livestock based industries is equivalent to less than 0.01 per cent of their gross value of production. </PARA>
<PARA> Industries which are not presently covered by Commonwealth research levy arrangements-equine, livestock breeding and deer industries-will not be subject to exotic disease preparedness levies. Because of the costs of establishing and administering new levies the Government does not propose to levy these industries for exotic disease preparedness purposes at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning now to consultative arrangements, the Government is seeking to have as wide a range of relevant advice available to it as is possible. Up to now, the main source of advice has been the high quality technical input from public sector veterinarians making up the Animal Health Committee, an officials' committee reporting to the Australian Agricultural Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government feels that advice it receives on exotic disease planning should also clarify the wider managerial, social and financial implications of disease eradication operations. Accordingly, the Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Council will be established under the terms of the Bill to provide this additional range of advice. As well as pursuing its advisory role the Council will propose for the Minister's approval annual programs of expenditure in respect of the additional $1.5m funding which is to be provided for exotic disease preparedness. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be comprised of 8 members, headed by an independent chairperson. The Australian Agricultural Council and the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industries and Energy will each have a representative on the Council, and it is envisaged that these members will be professional officers with experience in exotic animal disease preparedness. Two members of the Council will be appointed on the nomination of the National Farmers' Federation to ensure that the views of the livestock industries are effectively represented. In addition, it is proposed to appoint three members with special qualifications to the Consultative Council. These members will collectively have expertise in disaster and emergency management; communications and public relations, agricultural marketing and the veterinary profession. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to incorporate my second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims Bill will greatly increase the amount of compensation available to victims of a maritime accident. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is currently party to the International Convention relating to the Limitation of the Liability of Owners of Seagoing Ships, 1957 and its 1979 Protocol. The Convention and Protocol, which are implemented by Part VIIIa of the Navigation Act 1912, establish upper limits for claims arising from a maritime incident in which loss of life, personal injury or property damage occurs. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to widespread concern that the limits set by the 1957 Convention were too low, in 1976 a diplomatic conference adopted the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims. This Convention entered into force internationally on 1 December 1986. Sixteen countries are now party to the Convention, including the United Kingdom, Japan, Liberia, the Scandinavian countries, France and the Federal Republic of Germany. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will enable Australia to become a party to the 1976 Convention. The inadequacy of the 1957 Convention is demonstrated by the fact that the total amount of the compensation fund for claims involving an incident to a ship of 10,000 gross tonnage would be only about $3.22 million. If there were 193 claimants (the number of people killed in the `Herald of Free Enterprise' disaster in 1987 in Belgium) the average amount per passenger would be $16,700. The equivalent figures for passenger claims under the 1976 Convention would be $39 million and $202,000, a twelvefold increase. </PARA>
<PARA> At the 75th meeting of the Australian Transport Advisory Council in December 1987, Federal, State and Northern Territory Transport Ministers agreed that Australia should accede to the 1976 Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> Article 6 of the Convention establishes upper limits for two types of claims: claims for loss of life or personal injury and property claims. These limits are expressed in Units of Account. A Unit of Account is the Special Drawing Right of the International Monetary Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> For personal claims, liability for claims concerning ships with tonnage not exceeding 500 tons is limited to 333,000 Units of Account, or about $520,000. For larger ships, further Units of Account are added for each ton in excess of 500, on a sliding scale. Therefore, the limit for a ship of 10,000 gross tonnage would be 3,914,000 Units of Account or about $6.1 million. </PARA>
<PARA> For property claims, that is, claims such as for damage to other ships, property or harbour works, the system of determining the upper limit is similar. The limit for a ship of 500 gross tonnage is 167,000 Units of Account or about $260,000, for a ship of 10,000 gross tonnage it is 1,753,500 Units of Account or about $2.7 million. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of this, article 7 of the 1976 Convention provides for the establishment of a separate fund for loss of life or personal injury to passengers. Here, the shipowner's liability is limited to 46,666 Units of Account multiplied by the number of passengers the ship's certificate authorises it to carry to a maximum of 25 million Units of Account. Therefore, the maximum compensation available to passengers on the `Abel Tasman' would be about $39 million. </PARA>
<PARA> As a trade-off for the vastly increased amounts of compensation available, the Convention provides for a virtually unbreakable system of limiting liability. It declares that a person will be deprived of his ability to limit liability only if it is proved that the loss resulted from his personal act or omission, committed with the intent to cause such a loss, or recklessly and with knowledge that such loss would probably result. </PARA>
<PARA> There are several other issues I should mention. </PARA>
<PARA> First, unlike the 1957 Convention, the 1976 Convention does not permit State parties to exclude damage to harbour works, basins and waterways and aids to navigation from liability. However, parties are permitted to give such claims priority over other property claims in their national law. The Bill includes such a provision. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, the Convention provides that a State party may regulate the system of limitation of liability to apply to ships intended for navigation on inland waterways or which are of less than 300 gross tonnage. The Bill is to apply to all seagoing ships, of whatever size. The Bill also contains a savings clause, which will permit any valid State or Northern Territory law which may be passed to apply the Convention's provisions to ships coming within the legislative competence of that State or Territory to the exclusion of Commonwealth law. </PARA>
<PARA> Third, the Bill provides for the exclusion of limitation for claims in respect of salvage or wreck removal. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would mention that the Bill provides for commencement on a day to be fixed by Proclamation. This is necessary to allow for Australia's accession to the 1976 Convention and denunciation of the 1957 Convention and 1979 Protocol to coincide with the commencement of the Act. When this Bill receives Royal Assent, the process for denunciation of the Convention and Protocol will be initiated. As the denunciation becomes effective one year after lodgment of the instrument with the depositary, I anticipate that this Bill will be proclaimed in the second half of 1990. The Bill therefore provides for proclamation to take place within 18 months of Royal Assent. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak in support of the historic legislation before the Senate to establish the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. I would like to congratulate the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) on these Bills. They fulfil a commitment given by him and by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to this Parliament. I believe the legislation is immensely ambitious. It is far more than a simple coordination or rationalisation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programs and administration. It is a plan for the future rather than a bandaid solution for current problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Addressing the situation of indigenous peoples is high on the agenda of governments of all types around the world. Even though there is no single universal solution, the Bills being considered today are a progressive package of legislation which might well act as a model or an inspiration for other countries. In formulating the legislation I believe that the Minister has thought long and hard and to good purpose. He has consulted widely; he has listened with care and with an open mind to the arguments put to him during the consultative process and then acted on the merits of these arguments. He has been prepared to alter his original proposal on the basis of those merits. In other words there has been a genuine consultative process. It has not just been window dressing. The Minister has provided a creative and constructive solution to a most complex set of issues. His proposals have faced stringent testing and emerged strengthened, and despite what I believe are mischievous claims from the Opposition, they have emerged with widespread support in the Aboriginal community. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true to say that there has been apprehension in the Aboriginal community about the ATSIC proposals, and I pose the question, `Why wouldn't there be?'. Firstly, ATSIC is a fundamental and wide-ranging reform which charts unknown territory and affects many aspects of the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is never an easy task to introduce such changes, but it is a task that is the responsibility of any genuinely reformist government. I believe that the ATSIC legislation lies very firmly in the best traditions of reforming Labor governments. Secondly, when the Aboriginal people look back on two centuries of policies which at the very best could only be described as paternalistic and misdirected, they are quite entitled to take a very hard look at any legislation which affects them. They are quite entitled to press the Minister closely on the Government's intentions and its underlying philosophy. It is to the credit of the Minister that the Aboriginal people were given ample opportunity to do just that in a full and frank way. In addition, the Government will ensure that after this legislation is carried, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders will have time and resources to work out the nuts and bolts of ATSIC. They will not be asked to rush into making decisions and they will have had time to inform themselves and to deliberate before regional councillors and then commissioners are elected. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has got it right. The structures he is proposing are a major improvement on past arrangements and should serve Aboriginal people well. ATSIC does not seek to impose specific programs or specific solutions. Instead it lays down the challenge and the opportunity to Aboriginal people to bring to practical reality the philosophy of self-determination and self-management. The central point of this legislation is that Aboriginal people, through their own system of regional councils and the Commission, determine their own priorities and develop their own programs. By making self-management and self-determination a reality, it brings with it the potential for a new era in the planning and development of Aboriginal Affairs. The Minister has perceived clearly that if he sets up structures for self-determination and self-management he must set up structures that work. To establish defective structures would be to set up Aboriginal people to fail and to face more of the damaging criticism they have had to deal with over recent years. The Minister has realised this, as did the Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> In this debate we have heard a great deal already about accountability. Accountability is of course a cornerstone of the ATSIC legislation. Aboriginal people made it clear to the Minister and to the Government during the consultative process that they wanted mechanisms for full accountability and responsibility. They obviously want ATSIC to work. However, it is important to realise that this accountability is not a one-way street. The legislation ensures that the Commission answers to the Aboriginal people as much as it answers to the Minister. For example, it provides mechanisms for the Aboriginal population to petition the Minister for the removal of regional councils or commissioners. It also requires both the Commission and the regional councils to report back to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA> The establishment within ATSIC of an office of evaluation and audit is also part of the accountability mechanism. It will report to the Commission and the Minister on evaluation matters. The establishment of this body considerably strengthens the proposals contained in the original legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, of course, takes ultimate responsibility for the working of the system and it is a responsibility which he must accept under our system of government. However, the legislation also places a responsibility on ATSIC to inform the Minister about projects and programs encountering difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me go to the question of the preamble to the ATSIC Bill, because I believe that opportunistic attempts to discredit the preamble and have it removed from the legislation in a very real way symbolise what has been so offensive in this debate over ATSIC. The supposed basis to the opposition to the preamble is that it is claimed to have legal force in any future litigation relating to Aboriginal land claims. This, of course, has been shown to be quite specious. For example, the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs looked into this aspect closely and concluded that the preamble does not have force in law. The Minister said in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA>The preamble is in no way intended to recognise land rights claimed to exist, to create new rights for land or compensation, or to remove or qualify rights under existing law. Nor was it, or is it, intended to restrict any future developments in the law. </PARA>
<PARA>So as regards legal force, the second reading speech does, in fact, carry some legal force within the courts in indicating the intention of the Government in the legislation, and the Minister could not have made his intention clearer about the relationship between the preamble and any future land rights claims.</PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the coalition parties did have some success in stirring up debate around the question of the preamble to the Bill and I believe they played on irrational fears in some sections of the community with the meretricious arguments that they put forward. However, those arguments have been demonstrated to be entirely without merit and should be laid to rest. I must say that I have been troubled by the nature of this debate on the ATSIC legislation. I accept that it is impossible to have a bipartisan approach to issues such as this. Nevertheless, we might have hoped that despite some fundamental philosophical differences on the whole question of the future of the Aboriginal people in Australia, the Opposition might have recognised that this is an area requiring a decency and honesty in debate. It should not be an opportunity for political pointscoring. I have come to the conclusion that although there is some cynical opportunism in their opposition to the legislation, the fact of the matter is that the perception of the Liberal and National parties is so fundamentally flawed that there is virtually no common philosophical meeting ground with the Government. I must say that this contrasts somewhat with the position of the Democrats, because although the Democrats have quibbled about some sections of the Bill there has been enough similarity on basic philosophy on the whole question that the Government has been able to negotiate with the Democrats in a constructive and meaningful way. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition parties have always said that they have no problem with the basic thrust of self-determinist policies for Aboriginal people. If this were genuinely so I believe that over the past couple of years differences over precise structures could have been sorted out. However, their opposition has remained so comprehensive and so virulent that I can only come to the conclusion that there exists a hidden agenda, and I am afraid that the hidden agenda is one of implacable opposition to the concept and principle of self-determinism. After all, the recent directions in which the Greiner Government in New South Wales is moving in relation to Aboriginal policy most probably show us what any future Liberal government would do at a Federal level. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take education. Education is central to the advancement of Aboriginal aspirations. State and Commonwealth Labor governments have long been committed to overcoming the educational disadvantages experienced by Aboriginal people, and also to increasing understanding and appreciation of Aboriginal culture and society by non-Aboriginal Australians. They have recognised the obvious-that special resources need to be allocated to that end. The previous Labor Government in New South Wales, for example, had some outstanding success in encouraging Aboriginal participation in technical and further education. Unfortunately, these are the very successes that the Greiner Government is currently dismantling, or mainstreaming, to use my least favourite word in the English language. In fact, the Greiner Government is putting into practice for all to see the rhetoric borrowed by their Canberra soulmates. It is, I think, the rhetoric of newspeak where equality of opportunity, if it is heard at all, serves only as some sort of marketing tool, a veneer over the reality of what is really occurring in New South Wales-that is, the exact opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> Mainstreaming is the current buzz word in Aboriginal affairs in my State. Mainstreaming, assimilation, call it what you will, it all adds up to an attitude that I thought was totally discredited decades ago. Obviously, I was wrong in that belief. Obviously it had only gone underground until the opportune moment. I pose the question: What is the thinking behind this philosophy? I can only come to the conclusion that some members of the Opposition believe that Aboriginal people are inherently incapable of handling their own future. Some seem to want to return to the times when all decisions were made and implemented by white bureaucrats. Some want a hand-out mentality to persist. I know that white Australia began as a colony, but I believe that 200 years is long enough to shake off those sorts of colonialist attitudes on the part of white Australia. In the debate in the House of Representatives the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) said:</PARA>
<PARA>I acknowledge to the Minister that there are problems in explaining something as complex as this to Aboriginal people . . . </PARA>
<PARA> It is probably fair enough to accept that this remark was made off the top of his head, and it was not intended to be deliberately offensive to Aboriginal People. Nevertheless, it is a very revealing remark. If it is representative of a patronising attitude by the coalition about the ability of Aboriginal people to participate in deciding their own futures, and in operating their own structures, it is hard to see how there could be much common ground with this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> While certain peripheral complaints have been made about ATSIC, the Opposition has put forward no constructive alternatives to the proposal. The process of opposition appears to have been wholehearted and comprehensive white-anting of government attempts to set up structures of self-determinism which will really work. I have read what the current Leader of the Opposition, Mr Peacock, said in defence of its stance when he spoke to the Menzies report. Obviously he felt that finally he had to put together some justification for the intransigence of the Opposition. However, having read what he said, I am afraid that I am none the wiser. He referred to ATSIC as `an ideologically motivated scheme'. I do not resile from that; of course it is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am proud of it. You are right, Senator. The Leader of the Opposition's opposition to ATSIC is just as ideologically motivated. I am happy to leave it to the Aboriginal and wider Australian community to decide which is the more appropriately motivated ideology. The Leader of the Opposition also claimed that ATSIC is unjustified and unnecessary. He claimed that the Government is creating `what will virtually be a black parliament'. I wonder whether that is part of the wider debate on multiculturalism in which the Opposition propagated the reactionary view that Australians who came from other backgrounds could not be true Australians unless they forgot their cultural and linguistic heritage. I would be very concerned if that is what he meant, because if that argument were extended to the Aboriginal community it would take on a very sinister dimension.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I mentioned previously the Opposition's attempts to have the preamble ousted, which it supported with a spurious claim about legal ambiguities. But that really begs me to ask about the fundamental principles that are enunciated in the preamble. Does the Opposition really believe that the Aboriginal people were dispossessed? Does the Opposition believe that redressive measures are needed? Does the Opposition in fact support one word of the preamble to the ATSIC Bill? My argument is that the preamble is essential to this legislation. It is a statement of historical fact-part of a healing process which I hope will continue into the next century. In recognising the past we are not blaming the present. We are merely recognising that there is a duty on us to do a lot better than was done in the past. To deny this would be an abrogation of responsibility on the part of the Australian Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The large majority of the Australian community has acknowledged those historical facts. I ask why the Opposition seems to lag behind. I hope that the Opposition realises eventually that it is swimming against the tide. It is not a question of it being out of tune with the Government-we expect that-but it is out of tune with the aspirations and desires of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I believe that it is also out of tune with the wishes of the wider Australian community. It should cease muddying the water in the apparent hope of interfering with a future for Australia which can embrace diversity and special needs within our community. This is the future that I want for Australia and I believe it is the future that most Australians want. I urge honourable senators to support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also have great pleasure in speaking in this debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill. I had the honour of chairing the relevant Australian Labor Party platform committee during the period before the 1988 conference when the earlier stages of the planning for this Bill were being explained to Party members and receiving unanimous support. I was around at the time when the principles were being articulated, when the ideology was being adopted and, like my colleague Senator Faulkner, I am proud to be associated with that ideology. In this day and age to sit in the Senate and listen to statements such as those that have been made by some members of the coalition during this debate has been an extremely painful and somewhat salutary experience to those of us who believed, who hoped, who prayed at times, that the Australian community was moving towards a position where we could acknowledge the rights of every individual in this nation and, above all, the rights of the original owners of this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We were subjected last night to some diatribes which, on the whole, are not worthy of comment, but a few of the inconsistencies that have come through from the coalition's case, I think, do bear a little discussion, a little analysis. The general tenor of what we are being told by the coalition seems to be-though I am confused here, I must admit-that Aborigines really are not in a position to adopt the self-determination which many of us believe is their route to dignity and self-esteem, to which they are entitled. On the other hand, we are told that there is a growing sophistication not only amongst urban Aborigines but amongst rural Aborigines and those who are quite remote from urban centres of population. We are not quite sure what this means-maybe that their sophistication is developing from such a low base that it will be another century before they are capable of self-determination, or maybe that there is some different set of criteria which apply only to them. I would describe Australian society generally as growing in sophistication and would not care to make any distinction between parts of our community simply on the basis of race or skin colour. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had claims of the impotence of regional councils under this legislation. On the other hand, we have had claims that regional councils would override the interests of smaller communities. Once again, one is confused, and I feel that probably the Opposition is confused and not understanding at all well what the legislation intends. We have had much in the way of paternalistic rhetoric. Protection, says Senator Boswell, is what Aborigines need. That is what some of our grandparents and great-grandparents believed, and the results of that philosophy are there for everybody to see. The sooner everybody in this nation can recognise that the needs of Aborigines are ones that they themselves strongly and clearly articulate, the sooner we will be in a position to accede to those needs, which, as I hear them, are for dignity and for self-esteem. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a fair bit of analysis of the legislation so I would like today to demonstrate, if I can, and I think it will not be difficult, that not only is our Aboriginal community very capable of self-determination, but also it is in a very good position to take advantage of the new structures which we hope to see in place before very long. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past 12 months, with the enormous amount of turmoil that has surrounded Aboriginal politics, some have implied, if not actually said, not only that the Hawke Government and Labor governments generally have done nothing for Aborigines but also, by association, that Aborigines have done nothing for themselves. You and I know, Mr Acting Deputy President, as I think many others do, that nothing could be further from the truth. Over the last 20 years those of us who have long enough memories, those of us who take the trouble to get out to our Aboriginal communities on a regular basis to see what changes are taking place, have seen quite extraordinary changes. </PARA>
<PARA> We know perfectly well that the needs of our remote communities are very similar to those of remote communities everywhere else in the world. I have just visited six Asian countries and was struck by the fact that the agenda there for getting services and the `benefits' of civilisation to areas that are remote from the centres of population is very much the same. Always among the imperatives are a clean water supply-water for drinking, water for sanitation-hygiene and the capacity to dispose of rubbish, a not inconsiderable concern when one looks at the areas in which many of our Aboriginal communities are located. Another imperative is the need for electricity and not just for lighting, heating and power for households, though that is a great advantage in many cases, but primarily so that they can store fresh fruit and vegetables. It is an immediate advantage to communities to be able to provide their children particularly with fresh fruit and vegetables. A well run store can be a source of income for the community and many have demonstrated how the community store has financed a truck or even a plane which will put that particular community into closer contact not only with its sources of supply but also with its sources of emergency health care.</PARA>
<PARA> An all weather airstrip is crucial to many very remote communities. It may sound like a bit of a luxury but in the monsoon belt where for six months of the year communities may be cut off from their sources of supply by heavy rains and flooding, an all weather airstrip is crucial for dealing with medical emergencies as well as for ensuring that supplies can come in. All the other obvious things-housing, education and health-are crucial as well. Also, in common with developing nations, we have the imperatives of education, especially for the women, to help them to understand what is good nutrition for their children and how to space their families, and income generating activities. There we have the agenda which one finds in very many places. </PARA>
<PARA> Now to the allegations that we have done nothing. Senator Faulkner suggested that there may well be a hidden agenda behind the virulent opposition to this legislation. One of the most crucial things for Aborigines-their possession of their land or their identification with their land-may well be one of those issues that are so disturbing the minds of those who oppose the legislation. We have not moved as far or as fast as we could do on land rights, and this I am the first to admit. But Aboriginal people now have title to about 12 per cent of Australia compared with less than 2 per cent for the indigenous population of Canada and less than 4 1/2 per cent for the indigenous population of continental United States. </PARA>
<PARA> In my own State of Western Australia, since 1983, at which time we elected a Labor government in Western Australia as well as federally, 34 Aboriginal communities have received living area excisions from pastoral properties and vacant crown land. This is quite an achievement. Twenty-eight of these excisions have occurred since 1987 when the Commonwealth Government established in Western Australia the Aboriginal communities development program, a five-year $100m agreement. The Commonwealth and Western Australian governments have jointly funded this agreement. Each government will contribute $50m each year over a five-year period to 1990. A further 61 excision applications in Western Australia are currently under negotiation. There are currently 29 Aboriginal pastoral stations in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We come now to questions of infrastructure, those issues about which I have already spoken. The examples of programs that have been operating now for some years are the accelerated community infrastructure program, providing funds to provide water supplies to 23 communities and sewerage disposal to 13 communities. Expenditure has been set out for 1987 and 1988 for those purposes. I referred earlier to the difficulty of sewage disposal in some communities. For example, until quite recently the community of Jigalong in Western Australia, established in a purely arbitrary area 40 miles from the nearest water supply, was having enormous difficulties with the disposal of its rubbish let alone its sewerage. It is no wonder at all that the incidence of ear, eye and chest infections, particularly amongst the children, was so high. The people in that community were simply unable to live in any satisfactorily hygienic circumstances. They simply did not have the facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> To see Jigalong of course would be to understand exactly what I mean. It is on rock hard ground in a very remote locality. To dispose of rubbish meant putting it on a truck and just driving it off into the desert and dumping it out there-hardly a satisfactorily state of affairs. This community like many others now has a reliable water supply. During the `wet' other communities are completely surrounded by water for long periods and during those periods usable water is at a premium. I was at one community some years ago to be told by the people that they were running short of clothes. This I found hard to understand until they told me that there was precious little water for drinking, simply no water for washing clothes so when their clothes were dirty they simply were discarded. They had somehow or other to find new clothes and this was at a time when they had been cut off for some time by the floods. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a town campus assistance program. In 1986-87 12 camps gained tenure to their land, 20 had water supplies installed or upgraded; 23 camps had appropriate waste disposal systems installed or upgraded at a cost of the better part of $6m. Many people are moving to outstations, of course, creating more infrastructure difficulties but we are providing assistance for them, particularly in the provision of adequate water supplies, which are the most important of their requirements. Our accelerated communities development program in the first two years provided $6.81m to upgrade water, sewerage and power facilities to communities. </PARA>
<PARA> Another program called the priorities communities development strategy is designed to break the back of the disadvantage suffered by the most impoverished communities. We are doing some prioritising here, providing $49m over two years to meet the critical needs of housing, essential services and other facilities. The most impoverished communities do tend to be those that are most remote, not invariably but quite often. Fifteen targeted communities plus all the Torres Strait Island communities will benefit from this program, examples of which are Brewarrina in New South Wales, which will build 32 houses, renovate 16 houses and totally upgrade the water and sewerage systems as well as providing stormwater drainage, footpaths and street lighting. </PARA>
<PARA> Under these programs we have installed water to town standards in more than 20 major communities, reticulated sewerage systems in 12 major communities, power supplies in 12 communities, improved roads and built airstrips. This is only a beginning in regard to the many needs of the many communities but, provided we maintain this impetus, in time we will be able to see, as I have seen over the last few years, the standard of living of people in the communities in Western Australia, in the vast majority of cases, very greatly improved. Environmental health is a matter of considerable concern and we are proud in Western Australia of the program that is being conducted by our Aboriginal Health Service to train predominantly young people, but some of a more mature age as well, as medical aides; people who are identified by their communities as potential leaders, who go to the city for 12 months for a program, carefully crafted by the Aboriginal Medical Service, and who are provided with the skills and knowledge which they take back to their communities. This program has the capacity to greatly enhance the standard of health in those communities. </PARA>
<PARA> The statistics available regarding Aboriginal health are not particularly satisfactory in epidemiological terms. A time frame of six years, which is the only period over which we have had reliable figures, is far too short to provide realistic measurement of mortality and morbidity rates. We are obliged nonetheless to recognise that the standard of health of our Aboriginal population is very poor by comparison with the population generally. The Australian Institute of Health is responsible for developing comprehensive national Aboriginal health statistics and is seeking cooperation from State and Territory health authorities. We have known for a long time that infant mortality is regarded as the principal indicator of health status, and this is an indication too of how poor the data has been in the past. In 1971 the only States we knew about or that we had any figures from at all were Western Australia and the Northern Territory. The average infant mortality at that stage was 99.5 infant deaths per thousand live births-an enormous tragedy. By 1986 this had reduced once again, on the basis of what statistics were available, and bearing in mind the accuracy of those statistics, to 24 per thousand live births. That is still far too high; there is no doubt about that, but the problem is yielding to the many quite dramatic changes that have occurred during that time. The number of Aboriginal medical services in existence when we came into government in 1983 totalled 27. That has increased to 62 in 1988-89 and this in itself has been a very significant factor in the improvement of Aboriginal health generally. Many of these services of course are so highly regarded in the communities in which they exist that they are used by the whole of the population, even in quite large towns. They are the clinics of choice for everybody, not only the Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA> We have implemented a national education training program to reduce diabetes, heart disease and other lifestyle diseases. It is one of the great hidden tragedies of our Aboriginal history that so many Aboriginal women die at quite an early age, between perhaps 25 and 40, of diseases which in the general population are considered to be diseases of old age. I refer to diabetes particularly, of course, and heart disease, and in many cases the effects of alcohol exacerbate early deaths in these women. Plenty of attention has been given to the deaths of young men, especially when they die in gaol, on the roads or in other violent ways. But the young women tend to die quietly. Many of our dear friends have succumbed much too early in life to what we now talk about as lifestyle diseases. One can make an educated guess that they as children suffered from poor nutrition, that their mothers were very poorly nourished and that their chances from birth, in fact, have been severely prejudiced. </PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of antenatal and obstetric care for Aboriginal women is absolutely crucial. This should be provided not only in the traditional Western fashion. We are becoming more and more conscious of the fact that in some cases Aboriginal women wish to have their babies delivered in the same way as their mothers and their grandmothers were-in their own lands and using their own traditional methods. Western medicine, and Western obstetrics particularly, face the challenge of trying to find ways of providing the safest possible conditions under which women can be cared for prenatally and postnatally and being sensitive to the desires of these women and the traditions of their communities. </PARA>
<PARA> An immunisation program for Aboriginal children against hepatitis B has been implemented. We know now that up to 90 per cent of Aboriginal children in western New South Wales, for example, have been exposed to hepatitis B by the age of 16, and that 12 per cent become active sufferers and carriers of the disease. Our programs to improve ear health and hearing services for Aboriginal children are particularly crucial. It may not be widely known, but hearing loss amongst Aboriginal children subsequent to chronic ear infection is very widespread. The establishment and support of 45 Aboriginal substance abuse programs throughout Australia is another initiative of the last few years. This program has been accelerated subsequent to the inquiry that was conducted by a House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Another very important issue in Aboriginal health and the health of remote communities everywhere is the necessity to eradicate parasites and, of course, improving the health of dogs is crucial here. There has already been a documented reduction in the number of young children requiring treatment for skin disorders such as scabies in communities such as Kalano and Burunga where the program has been operating for some time. </PARA>
<PARA> Achievements in education have been slow but steady. I made inquiries the other day about the students who I knew were studying medicine at the Newcastle University. I was told there were now 20 in the course and that several of them are close to graduation. Back in the early 1970s we could identify those individuals who actually had tertiary degrees by counting them on the fingers of one hand. The number of Aboriginals participating in tertiary and further education courses has doubled between 1986 and 1988. The number of students enrolled in courses leading to higher education has increased by 50 per cent between 1983 and 1988. The number of Aboriginals graduating from tertiary institutions has risen quite dramatically from 73 in 1983 to 149 in 1987. In real terms, these may not be enormous figures. I know that 149 people does not sound like very many, but in a total community of, I think, 2,230 people, it is not inconsiderable. When one appreciates the fact that these are individuals who have struggled through primary, secondary and tertiary education, individuals of considerable stamina and talent who invariably will make an enormous contribution not only to the welfare of their own people but to Australian society generally, one gets an idea of just how probable it is that Aborigines, given the opportunity, through our new legislation, of self-determination, to work through their own policies and to decide their priorities and how they should be implemented, will be extremely effective. </PARA>
<PARA> Employment expenditure is an extremely important aspect providing the capacity to be in the work force, to generate income and not to be reliant on social security benefits. There has been a great deal of advance in this area.</PARA>
<PARA> In the few minutes available to me one other issue I would like to touch on is Aboriginal broadcasting. Among other advantages, their own languages are being used to get information to them and it gives them the opportunity to be involved in their government. We have been pursuing a detailed strategy for the development and extension of Aboriginal broadcasting and telecommunications. As a result, 30 Aboriginal groups are now producing more than 180 hours of programming of public radio throughout Australia each week. In addition, four regional resource groups produce more than 60 hours of programming for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). These groups employ 65 Aboriginals. I had the great joy of being at the official launching of the Western Australian Aboriginal Media Association about 12 months ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Those people were in a position to produce a program in `Language' that was targeted at Hall's Creek. I have mentioned deafness among children subsequent to chronic ear infections. It has been very difficult to treat these ear infections. Even getting to Aboriginal families with children who needed this treatment was quite difficult, although we had excellent specialists available, providing their time, able to travel and so forth. As a result of one broadcast in their own language, the people in Hall's Creek suddenly realised that a specialist would be available to look after their children's ears. How significant this was in ensuring that these children did not proceed to deafness. They were advised what they should do about it and when they should take the children to Hall's Creek for treatment. Suddenly this whole community was aware of how the problem could be dealt with and what they should do about it. That is a simple and very obvious way of getting health education to our Aboriginal community; it is happening through Aborigines themselves, through the development of skills, through the preparation of programs and through the encouragement we, as a government, are able to give them to start to deal with what previously have been intractable problems. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I reiterate that I and my colleagues have every confidence in our Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand), in his legislation and in the Aboriginal community to make the best possible use of what is far-seeing, innovative and highly principled legislation. I wish it every success. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill, which we are debating today, is arguably the most serious legislation relating to Aboriginal affairs that the Senate has had to deal with in at least the last 22 years-the period since the 1967 referendum. We are at a crucial turning point in our history: either we can adopt this legislation, with its focus on separate development for Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders apart from the wider Australian community, or we can concentrate on ensuring that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are encouraged to take their place as equal, responsible and independent Australians. That is what, in essence, this Bill is all about. In the view of the Opposition, this Bill absolutely and totally negates the prospects of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people being encouraged to take their place as equal, responsible and independent Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Giles, who has just spoken, said that the Australian Labor Party has every confidence in the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand). If the Australian Labor Party has every confidence in the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, I can assure the Senate that the Opposition does not, nor do the great majority of Australian people and nor, most importantly of all, do the great majority of Aboriginal Australians. The disquiet about the trend of policy and this Government's actions under the present Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and his predecessor, Mr Holding, has grown, and is growing daily. The simple fact is that Aboriginal affairs policy in this country is out of hand-but in Hand with this Minister!-and is growing in a direction that is absolutely contrary to the interests of the Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two important aspects to this Bill. The first is the preamble. It is of crucial importance because it gives the flavour of the motives behind the legislation as a whole. This preamble recites the prior ownership of Australia by the Aboriginal and Islander peoples. It also refers to their dispossession without compensation or agreement and the current disadvantaged position they occupy within Australian society. It sets out a number of objectives for action, including rectification of past injustices, real and lasting conciliation, and furtherance of self-determination and self-management for Aboriginal and Islander peoples. According to the Minister, the preamble is `an historical expression of philosophy and principle'. Yet it has already met with widespread concern from all quarters in the Australian community. It is a gesture designed to somehow right the wrongs of the past. I will quote from one of Australia's leading Aborigines on the subject-Bob Liddle, a well-known and successful Northern Territory Aboriginal businessman. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will endeavour to do so, Madam Acting Deputy President, but with Senator Bolkus sitting opposite it is extremely difficult. One again, Senator Bolkus has demonstrated his penchant and the capacity of the Labor Party for denigrating important leading Australians and giving them political tags in a way which I-and, I am sure, they-find extraordinarily offensive. Bob Liddle said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When it comes to policy, regret is pointless and atonement gives satisfaction only to the atoner-not the one who may have been offended. </PARA>
<PARA> In trying to achieve the impossible-just how past wrongs in a past era can be rectified without generating new wrongs and injustices-the attempt signals, I believe, a new-found but extremely worrying tendency in radical circles, namely, to single out the Aborigines for reasons of race and deny them their fundamental rights as equal, responsible Australian citizens. As a nation, we say that we are abhorred by the apartheid system in South Africa; yet, if this legislation passes, we are about to let slip through what I believe to be the whole raison d'etre for the establishment of such a system in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> One may say that the reasoning provided in the majority report of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs on the Bill against the concern that the preamble would create problems in the future implies that it is really not very important, that it is not much more than harmless rhetoric. In that report it was argued that the preamble could not be used as a tool by a future High Court in an activist mood to make declaratory findings on continuing Aboriginal ownership of land derived from Commonwealth acknowledgment of prior ownership. But just as the Aborigines with their remarkable 50,000 to 60,000 years experience on this continent know, symbols adopted by a people go to the very heart of their culture. They determine the direction, habits and the world view of a people. </PARA>
<PARA> The preamble is nonsense. Let me quote from one of the leading spokesmen of Aborigines in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, including many of the following tribes and corporations. I will name just a few: Iminji, Junjuwa, Kadjina, Kurlku, Yungnora, Kurnangki, Looma, Warrimbah, Yiyili, Bayulu, and others. On the preamble, that spokesman stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The real Aborigines of Australia have forgiven the white men of yesteryear for their cruelty towards Aboriginal tribal ancestors. The present day Aboriginal majority does not hold today's white population responsible for past massacres. In the outback, Aborigines and whites work together, play sport together, live side by side in towns and respect each other . . . White Australians must be careful not to don yokes of guilt, concerning events that happened in a bygone era, which the land rights activists are so determined to place upon them. The past is forgiven. </PARA>
<PARA>There are many stories in the relatively short period that whites have been on this continent of a tremendous bond of friendship and cooperation between Aborigines and whites. The deep and enduring bond that developed between Professor Strehlow and the Aborigines he lived with is but one example. Strehlow's ability to speak several Aboriginal languages, and Aboriginal elders passing over to him many of their ancestral secrets, speaks volumes of that relationship. Anne McGrath's description of the positive relationship that existed amongst the Aborigines and drovers in the early twentieth century in the Northern Territory is another case study of cooperation between Aborigines and whites. Many other such incidents in the Portland and Warrnambool districts in the 1850s can also be found. We all know that when someone is about to embark on something that seems impossible to achieve we use the expression `Buckley's chance'. The derivation of that expression is a story of the kind of profound friendship that can be found to have developed between Aborigines and whites long before any of us here were born. </PARA>
<PARA> My point in raising these examples is that not all of the white-Aboriginal history is one of bad treatment-very far from it. We should recognise that there are many examples of the opposite-of cooperation and integration. It is this experience that we should be building on-not denying its very existence, which is what I believe this preamble, the radicals in Aboriginal affairs and the Labor Government have tended to do. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two or three other points about the preamble that I wish to comment on. The first deals with the historical inaccuracies. To some extent I have already touched on that. A careful reading of the preamble reveals that it assumes that the relationship between Aborigines and Europeans from the very beginning was essentially antagonistic, brutal and thoughtless. But that is contrary to the facts. It is true that some settlers were never charged with crimes they committed against Aborigines. Others who were charged were probably wrongfully acquitted. Nevertheless, white settlers were hanged for murdering Aborigines. Missionaries and other officials sought to have white and Aboriginal policemen and settlers who were suspected of murder prosecuted. One of Governor Phillip's first instructions read out at the proclamation on 7 February 1788 was:</PARA>
<PARA>You are to endeavour, by every possible means, to open an intercourse with the natives and to consolidate their affections, enjoining all our subjects to live in amity and kindness with them. And if any of our subjects shall wantonly destroy them or give them any unnecessary interruption in the exercise of their several occupations, it is our will and pleasure that you do cause such offenders to be brought to punishment according to the degree of the offence. You will endeavour to procure an account of the numbers inhabiting the neighbourhood of the intended settlement, and report to our Secretary of State in what manner our intercourse with these people may turn out to the advantage of this colony. </PARA>
<PARA>That was one of Governor Phillip's very first instructions in 1788. The next concern that I have very deeply about the preamble is the fact that there seems to have developed in this country amongst some politicians, journalists, clergymen and propagandists a tendency to denigrate the achievements of our forebears. Perhaps the most astonishing instance of this was a couple of decisions by the Hawke Government during last year's bicentennial celebrations. Those celebrations were for all Australians regardless of country of origin; yet in a remarkable and embarrassing decision by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), Gerry Hand, as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, was given prime ministerial permission not to attend any of the bicentennial celebrations. This was said to be an act of solidarity with the Aborigines. The effect of the decision was obvious: it was a decision that was very divisive. It officially set the Aborigines apart from other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> That was not the only official act by the Hawke Government relating to the bicentennial which cut the very raison d'etre from the celebrations. The Hawke Government and its Australian Bicentennial Authority also refused to support financially the re-enactment of the voyage of the First Fleet and banned re-enactment of the actual landing by Captain Phillip at Botany Bay on 18 January. Again, this decision was somehow to be an act of solidarity with the Aborigines, but the effect was to drive a wedge between Aboriginal and other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> When the privately funded fleet arrived at Jervis Bay last year, the Australian flag and the Aboriginal land rights flag were flown side by side, with equal status. The Hawke Government has given official recognition to the Aboriginal flag. I understand that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs here in Canberra flies the Aboriginal land rights flag instead of the Australian flag. The effect of that decision is also divisive. The Aboriginal flag was designed to become the flag of a foreign state, an Aboriginal state to be carved out of Australia. Anyone visiting Canberra could well think that the Department is a foreign embassy. </PARA>
<PARA> The preamble also concerns the doctrine of terra nullius. The first three clauses of the preamble suggest that European settlement in Australia was a thoughtless and unjust invasion and that thereby the Aborigines have been dispossessed. It gives the impression that Captain Cook and Governor Phillip acted in an illegal and unjust way in taking possession of the land by proclamation and settlement. It is also a de facto attack on the doctrine of terra nullius and eighteenth century international law and doctrine. Terra nullius did not mean that no-one inhabited the Australian continent before European settlement. Rather, inhabitants were considered to be in such a primitive stage of development that no treaty with them was possible. In 1770 the Aborigines had no agriculture as we understand it. They raised no animals. Their few utensils, weapons and ornaments were, by Western standards, crude in the extreme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They had no single common language and no political institutions. It might be an interesting qualification but it is a very important point that we should recognise. The legal history of the settlement of Australia was very thoroughly discussed by Sir Richard Blackburn in his authoritative judgment in Milirrpum v. Nabalco, the Gove land rights case of 1971. Since that judgment there has developed a litany of academics and propagandists who have worked vociferously to attempt to rewrite the history of Australia. This preamble is merely the latest manifestation of the attack. It is neither historically accurate nor morally defensible. To persist with it is yet another act by this Government, the consequences of which are essentially divisive. Despite the recommendations of the special Senate inquiry, which had a majority of Labor Party members, and despite the recommendations of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, the Minister has refused to remove the preamble and submit it to the Parliament as a single item.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me turn to the Bill itself. The body of the Bill sets out its practical elements. The first ATSIC Bill-this is mark II; how many more we will have is an interesting question-was so badly flawed that it was withdrawn by the Government. The Bill we are debating today is a second version. Nevertheless, the main practical intent of the Bill remains unchanged-namely, the establishment of ATSIC. ATSIC is to be established as a body corporate with responsibilities across the whole spectrum of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. It is to replace the existing Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal Development Commission. It envisages a system of 60 regional councils elected by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander residents. These would determine priorities and develop regional plans. A commission of 20, of whom 17 will be elected by regional councillors grouped in zones, would also be established. The new commission would administer programs and provide funds directly to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations and individuals. Finances for ATSIC will be provided in the normal Budget process if the legislation is passed. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many administrative problems remaining in the Bill despite its redrafting. The Opposition will be discussing these in great detail during the committee stage of this debate. It is on the general thrust of the proposal and its implications that I shall focus the rest of my remarks. My concern is not principally that the consultation process by the Minister in devising the Bill was scandalously deficient and involved the handing over of many thousands of dollars to fringe Aboriginal organisations that boast well-known radical activists. That goes some way to explaining how such a rotten piece of legislation ever came into being. It goes only some way. Nor is my main concern about the serious, yet inevitable, difficulties arising from the Bill's deficiency regarding how the voting for the regional councils is to take place. That issue will also be discussed in very considerable detail during the committee stage of the debate. The severe constraints on accountability of the expenditure of public funds is another aspect of the Bill which deserves consternation. It too is a spin-off of what I believe to be the essential flaw in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation does not merely have a few loose ends that need fixing. My concern and my Party's concern is that this legislation is fundamentally flawed. Let me quote Miss Flo Grant, spokeswoman of the Wiradjuri Christian Development Ministries-a self-funded organisation representing thousands of Wiradjuri people living in rural and semi-urban New South Wales. In a letter to the Race Discrimination Commission Miss Grant said that the proposed commission is a `black parliament'. She said it is `paternalistic' and will `promote social unrest' and place Aboriginals in a political ghetto. I could not agree more with Miss Grant. She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The concept of ATSIC totally cuts across the family oriented aboriginal people's autonomous community structure, yet we are told that this is an Aboriginal concept-what garbage. </PARA>
<PARA>Again she goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> ATSIC will further retard the growth and development of aboriginal people because it will cause social unrest. In this kind of separatism you don't allow for development of self-determination because the economic structure of your society is totally dependent on the commitment of Government budgeted handouts to Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>The whole concept of ATSIC treats Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders as a single group. It assumes that by virtue of their race they are the same, that we can lob them all together separately from us. That is enormously insulting, both to the Aborigines and to the Torres Strait Islanders. Anyone who has any familiarity with Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders knows that there is a wealth of tribal and other associations. There is an enormous heterogeneity. This Bill attempts to say that Aborigines themselves are homogeneous and that Torres Strait Islanders are homogeneous with Aborigines. That is absolute nonsense. It is a total insult. There is not one Aborigine living today who has not had some contact with modern industrial civilisation. Nor does ATSIC address the aspirations of the small minority of Aborigines who wish to live, who are capable of living and who will be entitled to live the traditional tribal life. The proposed regional councils do not accord with the traditional boundaries of Aboriginal tribes. The whole ATSIC set-up is anathema to traditional tribal Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA> Why does the Minister think that most Aborigines in 1989 do not share aspirations for their children, for jobs and a higher standard of living in line with other Australians? Why does he want to strip them of their equality with other Australians? There is a positive alternative to the Minister's separatist vision. It fundamentally revolves around recognising that Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders are fully-fledged Australians and deserve to be treated with the respect automatically given to all Australians regardless of their country of origin. Let me quote from Bob Liddle again. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Aborigines played a part in developing Australia. Aboriginal troopers and soldiers defended it. They want to share in Australia's future, not contest it. </PARA>
<PARA>Aborigines who wish to live and are capable of living a life in accordance with their traditions should be allowed to do so, unfettered by the shenanigans and snake-oil that is so pervasive in Labor's ATSIC proposals. Aboriginal affairs in this country are in a precarious state. This Bill will exacerbate the problems; it will not go any way towards solving them. </PARA>
<PARA> That referendum vote more than 20 years ago to welcome Aborigines as fully-fledged Australians was a hallmark in our history. It promised great improvements in the lot of Australia's Aborigines. Since then successive Federal governments have implemented a wide range of special programs for Aborigines on top of those of State governments. I believe that one of the saddest things about these past 20 years and the injection of billions-not millions, but billions-of dollars is that Aborigines continue to fare badly by virtually every social and economic standard. That is a disgrace. Rather than enhance confidence, initiative and self-reliance Aboriginal policy has resulted in welfare dependence. In the words of Australia's first Aboriginal tertiary graduate and now Director of the Aboriginal Training and Cultural Institute, Margaret Valadian, around 70 per cent of Aborigines' income is dependent upon welfare. </PARA>
<PARA> As a member of the relevant Senate Estimates committee I have been appalled by the evidence of widespread lack of professionalism and accountability in many sections of Aboriginal affairs administration that those Estimates committee hearings have unveiled. Other inquiries have found the same. Waste and inefficiency have become a prominent feature of the Labor Government's period in office. Inefficiency in spending and programming has become legion. Of course, it has proliferated under Clyde Holding and Gerry Hand, the two most recent relevant Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> The sad thing is that the victims of this maladministration and inefficiency have been those Aborigines most in need. It is time we stepped back and thought again about the direction Aboriginal affairs have taken. The facts indicate that the separatist policy direction that has been pursued has backfired. It has caused great harm. It has prevented Aborigines from participating in Australian life as fully as they should. There is an alternative to this separatist solution. We pride ourselves on our belief in racial equality. So far as Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders are concerned, this means that we should be implementing policies that provide Aborigines with education and employment opportunities and confidence to participate in Australian society as equals, not as inferiors. The whole thrust of the policies of the Hawke Government has been in the wrong direction. </PARA>
<PARA> There are great examples of Aborigines succeeding in Australian society. I have already mentioned some but there are many others in all walks of life, including the professions, the arts, sport, education and business. Much has changed since that historic vote more than 20 years ago when the overwhelming majority of Australians-more than 90 per cent-elected to change the Constitution to enable Aborigines to be counted in the census and to give the Federal government power to legislate regarding them. The preamble, indeed the entire Bill that we are debating today, should be scrapped. Its chance of improving the lot of Aborigines is worse even than Buckley's. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had 20 years of the welfare state approach to Aboriginal affairs. Over the last six years of the Hawk Government we have seen an enormous escalation of that. It has not worked. This legislation is merely more of the same-the same paternal and guilt-ridden approach that is so destructive of Aborigines. We need a whole new positive approach to Aboriginal Australians. This Bill will perpetuate and intensify the very worst features of Aboriginal affairs policies which have been so damagingly obvious under this Government. This Bill is damaging; it is dangerous; it is technically, fundamentally and philosophically flawed. It must not be allowed to proceed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill 1989, the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Bill 1989 and the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill 1989. The Government is very pleased finally to be debating legislation to establish the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). Members of the Opposition have tried everything to prevent this debate from occurring. They spent months attacking people in this chamber in an attempt to discredit this proposal. They have failed. They set up a Senate committee to try to discredit the Government's plans for long overdue reforms in Aboriginal affairs. They have failed. They have tried to malign and smear the reputation of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand). They have failed. Finally, they attempted the tired old tactic of the filibuster. They were hoping that, if they stalled long enough, the Government would not proceed with this debate. They thought that if they threatened a lengthy and drawn out debate the Government would back down. Again they have failed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been two years since the Government first announced its proposal to set up a new administrative body for Aboriginal affairs. Since then much has happened. The original proposal, announced by the Minister in December 1987, has gone through some changes. The principle has not changed but some of the mechanics have. The first changes occurred after a round of extensive consultations with Aboriginal and Islander people in the early part of 1988. The Minister's consultations were not token consultations. The legislation we are debating today reflects the very changes suggested by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people during those consultations. In fact, the legislation we are debating today reflects the views and demands that Aboriginal and Islander people have been promoting for many years. They have said again and again, `We have to have a say in the decision-making process. We have to decide what is best for us'. </PARA>
<PARA> Today the Senate has before it a piece of legislation that will implement Aboriginal and Islander involvement in the decision-making process. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission will allow people to be part of the system rather than just being on the receiving end. Members of the Opposition have said that the existing system does not need to be changed. Senator Peter Baume repeated this yesterday when he quoted the old saying, `If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it'. At the same time, members of the Opposition have quoted relentlessly from the Auditor-General's report, which has highlighted the range of problems that in many cases date back to the Fraser Administration. This is particularly so with the Aboriginal Development Commission. The reality is that the system is broke and it desperately needs fixing. To quote the words of the former Secretary to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Perkins, the system is old and tired. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Baume said that the Government should not change the system, it should reform it. Despite the fact that `it ain't broke', according to the Opposition it needs reforming; but there is no mention of these reforms in the Opposition's policy on Aboriginal affairs. The Opposition, according to its policy, wants to hand over the administration of Aboriginal affairs to the States. Why has not Senator Baume argued that course in this chamber? Whereas ATSIC is based on the principle of Aboriginal involvement in the decision-making process, the Opposition's policy advocates reducing the involvement of Aboriginal people in the delivery of services-for example, in Aboriginal-controlled medical and legal services. The reality is that the Opposition has no idea how to improve the delivery of service to Aboriginal and Island people. Members of the Opposition have not put forward one workable suggestion that would bring about sustained changes in the current system. All they have done is criticise the Government's plans for change. They have said that the Government has not made a case for ATSIC. This is absolutely wrong. The case for ATSIC has been made over and over again. </PARA>
<PARA> The current system needs to be changed. It is old, tired and in need of reform. The Aboriginal and Island people have very little input into the current system of administration. They have few opportunities to determine the programs that would best suit their needs. Where Aboriginal and Island people have had the opportunity to determine programs and priorities, the success rate has been far greater. An example of this is the way in which the combined Aboriginal organisations at Alice Springs operate so successfully in determining the priorities of Aboriginal people in their region. The administration of Aboriginal affairs needs to be decentralised. Resources should be where the people are, not just in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the Opposition, the points I have made do not justify a case for ATSIC. If that is so, how does the Opposition respond to the very real need for Aboriginal involvement in the decision-making process? Does the Opposition feel that the ADC, with its Government appointed board, or hand-picked commissioner, to use its words, adequately addresses this real need? Does the Opposition believe that handing back the administration of Aboriginal affairs is going to bring about the reforms that Senator Baume was talking about earlier? Where is the Opposition's case? Why have not Opposition senators come in here and argued these very points? They have not done so because they have no argument. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's case against ATSIC can be summed up in one word-paternalism. Senator Baume's comments reflect that view. The Opposition has said that Aboriginal people cannot operate as administrators as well as elected representatives. Why? Senator Baume argues that they are susceptible to family and peer pressures, that we can cope with that but Aboriginal people cannot. What paternalistic rubbish! The reality is that the Opposition has no case. It has in fact gone backwards in its policies and views on Aboriginal affairs. It offers no worthwhile contribution. ATSIC is needed and it will work. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will properly be part of the decision-making process and it is that very fact which the Opposition cannot condone. That is a very sad reflection on it. I support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Devlin seems to have at least heard what the Opposition has been saying in relation to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill 1989 but he does not seem to have understood. Perhaps the honourable senator would understand what we are saying if I repeat the Opposition's position. I will give him another opportunity for this to sink in. He is correct when he points out that we say that the Government has not made a case for a statutory authority, nor for the radical changes in the administrative arrangements that are proposed. We point out that the minority report of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs found, firstly, that the proposal for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) was unjustified, unnecessary and culturally inappropriate and, secondly, that it would operate to the detriment of Aborigines and lead to worse services and to less accountability both to Aborigines and all Australians. I suggest that Senator Devlin should have taken the opportunity to address those points in his speech. Let him point out why those remarks are inappropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We further say that the consultation process preceding the proposal for ATSIC was inadequate. We say that the majority of Aborigines neither understand nor identify with it. We say that ATSIC will regionalise and centralise control and that, as a bureaucratic means of representation, it will undermine traditional and local Aboriginal networks. It will set priorities, despite the expressed desire by many Aboriginal people for more local authority. </PARA>
<PARA> We say that the proposal is fundamentally flawed in that it seeks to incorporate representative and administrative processes in the same structure. We say that there is no attempt to propose constructive interaction between the States and the Commonwealth and that the proposal will add to waste and the duplication of programs at all levels of government. I could go on. But I chose to reiterate a number of the Opposition's concerns in relation to ATSIC, to draw them yet again to Senator Devlin's attention and give him the opportunity to reflect on his views. </PARA>
<PARA> My main reason for choosing to speak in this debate today, however, really relates to a function of the Senate perhaps rather than the Bill. I want to use the Bill as a means of highlighting this particular function of the Senate. I want to make reference to the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, one of two standing committees of the Senate that look at legislation. The other is the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances which, of course, looks at delegated legislation. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee looks at Bills with respect to a number of principles. It ascertains whether the Acts of Parliament, by express words or otherwise, do a number of things: firstly, whether they trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties; secondly, whether they make rights, liberties and/or obligations unduly dependent upon insufficiently defined administrative powers; thirdly, whether they make such rights, liberties and/or obligations unduly dependent upon non-reviewable decisions; fourthly, whether they inappropriately delegate legislative power; and, lastly, whether they insufficiently subject the exercise of legislative power to parliamentary scrutiny. These are very important principles. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last couple of days we have had significant debate about the role of the Senate. We know what the Government thinks about the Senate. We know how useless it thinks it is. The Government does not understand the good work that is done here. I am seeking this opportunity to point out some of this very good work. We are all realists. We understand that every senator and member cannot possibly read every piece of legislation, go through it clause by clause and understand all of the ramifications. Consequently, we have committees that do a certain amount of that work. Senators and members who have an interest in a particular area can use the good work done by a committee as a resource for furthering that interest. They can also gain an understanding of a Bill and be aware of its implications and what the Government is trying to do. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is the case with the package of Bills now before the Senate. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee, which is a specialist committee, has gone through the legislation. It has looked at it in terms of whether it does the five things that I have mentioned and it has made some recommendations to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand). There has been interaction between a bipartisan committee and the Executive in the form of the Minister. It is a matter of a bipartisan committee saying, `Look, in this case we think that you are trespassing unduly on personal rights or inadequately defining rights and liberties and making them subject to unre- viewable decisions'. All these things impact on people in some way. It is all very well to sit here and pass legislation knowing what the intent of it is. It is another matter to get down to the nitty-gritty detail of it and say, `Well, in practice, when this Bill is put into place, apart from whether it achieves its policy objectives'-and that is what Senator Devlin was arguing about-`does it at the same time do some things that we do not want to do in relation to individual Australians?'. This is very important. Many people come into this place with fire in their bellies on particular issues. They become so intent on achieving those policy changes that they do not concentrate, understandably, on the method to achieve that goal. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to what the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills has said in relation to this package of Bills. I refer to only a number of the points that have been raised as a means of outlining to honourable senators who may not have looked at this report and to other interested parties the good work that Senate committees can do prior to a Bill coming on for debate. A number of clauses of the Bill were drawn to the attention of the Senate in Scrutiny of Bills Alert Digest Nos 5 and 6 of 1989. These comments are really preliminaries to its report. The Committee referred to clause 8 and clause 7 (m), which confers power. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee points out that clause 8 of the Bill allows the Prime Minister to confer a departmental function onto the Commission by means of a notice placed in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette pursuant to a particular clause. The Committee wanted those notices to be subject to tabling in Parliament to enable them to be scrutinised by Parliament. Fair enough. If the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) wants to do something the Parliament ought to be able to scrutinise that action and it ought not to have to pour through the Gazette, piece by piece with a microscope to find out what activities the Prime Minister has slipped in. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister responded to the Committee and indicated basically that he did not agree. The Committee thanked the Minister for responding, `Tough luck, I don't agree with you'. But it points out that it regards it as appropriate that these notices be tabled in the Parliament. It does not want the notices to be subject to disallowance. It is not seeking to give power to the Parliament to say to the Prime Minister, `You won't do that because we will disallow that notice'. But the Committee thinks it is appropriate that the notices be tabled so that Parliament can scrutinise what the Prime Minister wants to do. The Committee draws that to the attention of any honourable senator who chooses to read the report. That is one example of where the work of a Senate committee has drawn to our attention activities that can come about by the passing of a Bill which will in the Committee's view allow some things to happen without the scrutiny of Parliament. I think that is an important matter to draw to the Senate's attention. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also drew subclauses 20 (1) and 20 (3), in relation to non-reviewable decisions, to the Senate's attention. These subclauses would allow the Commission to give written notice to a person or body who had received a grant under the Act that that person or body had failed to fulfil a term or condition of the grant. However, the decision of the Commission could not be reviewed as to its merits, only as to its legality. If a decision of this nature were to be made by the Minister, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee considers that it should be subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Committee was concerned that there was no provision for appeal on the merits of a decision of the Commission. The Committee sought clarification from the Minister as to the possibility of including merit review for decisions made by the Commission pursuant to clause 20. The Minister replied:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill has now been amended by the House of Representatives to provide for the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to review Commission decisions on these matters;</PARA>
<PARA>He then referred the Committee to the relevant clauses that achieve that aim. The Committee thanks the Minister for his response, which meets the concerns of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> That is an example of how some of my colleagues and some colleagues of honourable members opposite in the House of Representatives may think that it is by their wit and wisdom that this Bill has been amended and that it has all been fixed up in the House of Representatives. With the greatest of respect, that is a load of rubbish. It has been fixed up because a Senate committee has done its job. No doubt the reports on any of those amendments will not refer to the Senate committee at all. It will simply be implicit that the Government has by its own wit-that is probably where the credit will go-amended this Bill. I do not want to nitpick. I am pleased that the Bill has been amended. If it is an improvement, that is all well and good. </PARA>
<PARA> The third aspect that the Committee drew the Senate's attention is clause 23. This clause requires certain documents to show authority. It requires the Commission to ensure that documents it issues in relation to loans and funding by the Commission meet certain requirements. That is fair enough. If money is to be dished out we all want certain requirements to be met. We in Parliament want that. The taxpayer wants that. The terms of that clause, however, do not indicate the consequences of the Commission failing to meet those conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister responded, `If they don't do what they are meant to do, they are obviously going to be subject to public criticism'. Obviously, the Minister suggests that that is a big enough stick to keep the Commission in line in that respect: public criticism by the Office of Evaluation and Audit and by the Attorney-General's Office. Perhaps that is right. But it is not the point I want to argue here today. The Minister added that there was a possibility that, if one could show the commissioners had consciously not complied, that might constitute misbehaviour under another clause of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Committee thanks the Minister for the response and hopes that his response will be of assistance to it. This Committee is not a case of a bipartisan committee saying, `You must do this'. The Committee basically says `You decide what you think of this Minister's response. If the clause is not complied with, are public criticism through those respective offices and the possibility of misbehaviour charges enough?'. Excellent work has been done by a committee to enable a Minister to make a choice about whether he is going the right way in the first place. It is not as though the Committee keeps all its good work in the Senate; it goes to the Executive to ask whether it wants to change its mind, gives the Executive the opportunity to improve legislation before it comes here and, in the event of there being a disagreement, simple notes it and leaves it up to senators to decide. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth aspect I want to refer to deals with the termination of appointment of a commissioner. When I commenced speaking on this matter I referred to the fact that often parliamentarians will want to support a Bill because they endorse the policy changes they believe it will implement. It is always important when adopting that course to look at whether the means which are chosen for doing so, inadvertently or otherwise, trample on individual people's rights quite independently of what the policy aims to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee points out that the effect of this clause is that a commissioner subject to a suspension does not necessarily have the opportunity to put his or her position to the Minister. The Committee notes that a commissioner subject to the provision can challenge the legality but need not necessarily have that opportunity to appeal to the Minister. It is a very important issue for someone to be dismissed and not have the opportunity to have a say is very un-Australian. We all like to think that everybody has a say, particularly someone whose future is about to be affected by the decision of another person. The Minister responded to that point in this way:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee takes the view that the requirement for the Minister to consult with the Commissioner is not adequate, and that a Commissioner to be suspended ought to have the opportunity to show cause why he or she ought not be suspended from office and perhaps terminated as a commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the real outcome. The suggestion was: `If you want to dispose of someone, why don't you issue a notice that that person has to show cause why you should not?'. That would give the person the opportunity to have a say and to defend his or her position. The Minister responded:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government sees no problems with such a provision, and will make an appropriate amendment at the earliest opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA>This is another example-and I have not checked to see whether this has happened in the House of Representatives and I do not know whether it will happen in the Senate but I will be watching in the committee stage-of the work of a Senate committee achieving a change that will stop Parliament and the Executive inadvertently and inappropriately trampling on people's rights. That has to be good work. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth matter raised by the Committee that I want to refer to is the question of entitlement to vote, which appears in paragraph 99 (a). This particular paragraph lists one of the qualifications to vote in regional council elections as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>That the person is an Aboriginal person or Torres Strait Islander. </PARA>
<PARA>It points out that there is no provision for determining when the qualification is satisfied and that the Minister in his second reading speech suggests that there will be a process for determining entitlement. That will presumably be included in some electoral rules. The Minister points out:</PARA>
<PARA>The electoral rules to be made . . . will provide for voters to certify that they are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander persons. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not want to get into that debate, but I know that some people would very seriously like to debate how one ascertains who is an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. With respect to the electoral rules, the Minister continues:</PARA>
<PARA>They will also provide for liaison officers who will be engaged to assist in the conduct of the election. Where a person is unable to satisfy the liaison officer that they are in fact Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander persons, their vote will be set aside. </PARA>
<PARA>Voters challenged by the liaison officer will have eight days from the date of the election to satisfy the senior liaison officer for the region of their eligibility. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, voters who have been unable to satisfy the senior liaison officer will be able to appeal to the Court of Disputed Elections. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee simply notes the clarification given by the Minister. That gives any honourable senator familiar with the cultural structures of the Aboriginal community the opportunity to assess whether the process of questioning someone who purports to be an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander would be a suitable mechanism to establish that person's identity in that sense. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth point I make is also in relation to people's rights. Subclause 128 (2) deals with ineligibility to stand for re-election. It provides that a person whose appointment as a commissioner representing a zone was terminated for misbehaviour is ineligible to stand in the next election. Not only is his appointment terminated, he is also unable to stand next time. The Committee points out that the provision might result in a person having his appointment as a councillor terminated for misbehaviour as a consequence of his contravening a ministerial direction when the councillor may have been acting in response to requests from constituents. The Committee's view is that in those circumstances it is inequitable for a person not to be able to be re-elected as a representative of that zone. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Baume knows a lot more about the Aboriginal community than I do. The report of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, in raising the issues, provides for senators and members interested in an issue a further resource document on which to base their views. People will no doubt be interested in the Minister's response. In my words, he has said that if we look at the Bill we will see that, if a commissioner's position has been terminated because of that person's misbehaviour, he cannot stand again. In other words, the Minister has said, `Tough luck; don't like that idea; not going to do anything about it'. In that case the Committee did what Senator Baume would say was some good work. It identified a problem in the Bill, wrote to the Minister about it, and received a reply from the Minister saying, `I don't agree'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have tried to raise a variety of examples-cases where the Minister has taken no notice and the matter will be left to the Senate to consider; cases were the committee simply notes the Minister's response, almost inviting honourable senators to look at the response; and other cases where the Committee has actually said that it is not satisfied and it thinks something would be better done in a different way. </PARA>
<PARA> I will go a little further and look to the same Committee's report on the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill. I raised the question of merit review and the situation in which someone could lose his rights and be unable to go to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. In the previous Bill the Government decided that it was a good idea to provide for merit review. The legislation went through the House of Representatives and people so affected are now able to go to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; that is well and good. But when we turn to another Bill related to this one we see the same problem. To paraphrase the Minister's response, he said that the proposed section merely replaces the provision presently set out in another provision. We can see that. The Minister also said that the ADC Act presently has no review provisions equivalent to those in the ATSIC Bill. That is fair enough. If it is good enough for one Bill to allow people to have a decision reviewed by the AAT, why not also for this Bill? In what I interpret as a reason for not including these provisions, the Minister gave this answer:</PARA>
<PARA>These present amendments do not represent a comprehensive attempt to revise and update the ADC Act, but are merely the minimum amendments necessary to ensure proper accountability pending the commencement of the proposed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>That tells us something about the speed with which this matter has been put together. The Minister is saying that a proper job has not been done with the legislation, that only the minimum amount of work has been done in order to get the show on the road. That is a bit like aircraft technicians saying that they have not done a thorough overhaul of a plane but enough to get it up in the air. That is exactly what the Minister has said. I again read to the House his response:</PARA>
<PARA>These present amendments do not represent a comprehensive attempt to revise and update the ADC Act, but are merely the minimum amendments necessary to ensure proper accountability pending the commencement of the proposed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he is saying, `We will do as much as we have to do, but anything else, whether it has merit or not, can just go by the board at the moment because it does not suit our purposes'. That is not a reflection on the Committee's work, it is a reflection on the Government's response to it. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the examples I have raised have done two things: first, it has pointed out the good work that Senate committees do, credit for which is often taken by the House of Representatives or the Government itself; secondly, it has put the Government on notice that it might as well come into this chamber at the committee stage with adequate answers to the report of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill will do much for Aboriginals. It will do a lot more for society in general. In a good and decent community, everybody is treated as a full citizen, as a person able to obtain whatever office there is in society, the jobs and privileges that go with any community. The old and well-worn thought-old and well-worn because it is true-that race, colour, creed or culture should be no bar, should be adhered to in a decent society. Any society with a bar against anyone runs the risk that that bar will be progressively extended to apply to more and more of its citizens. The way we deal with Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders determines how well we deal with other sections of the community. Society in Australia at the moment consists of a mixture. There is an ongoing debate as to how that mixture ought to be dealt with. If any one of the components of that mixture does not act as a decent and proper society, then every other component is put at risk. That is why when we deal with this Bill we are dealing with issues that go very much to the heart of our society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In Australia at present everybody is equal before the law. Unfortunately, the reality, as distinct from theory, is different. According to the laws of this nation all citizens can enter the judiciary, the Executive or the legislature. According to the law, each and every man and woman can become a captain of industry. People can enter whatever club they choose and their children can attend whatever school they want to. That is the law, and it is a good law. It ought to remain as such. </PARA>

Senator Boswell typifies what is best in the Opposition. He is a person of great heart and great disposition. What concerns me about his interjection is that it typifies why there is a need for ATSIC. He asks what this business of society, justice and doing the right thing by various components of society has to do with ATSIC. He asks what this concept of justice and community has to do with ATSIC. It has everything to do with it. That is what it is about. We are saying to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders, `Let us forget about history for the moment for the purpose of this argument. When we look at your situation and status in Australia, at where you are presently placed as a matter of reality as distinct from theory, we see that you are, on the evidence, very much disadvantaged compared with other sections of society. Senator Boswell adorns this chamber, as do others on his side. I see Senator Peter Baume and Senator Knowles there. They join him in adorning the other side. I do not see many Aborigines over there.

They say, `This Bill really does not do anything about it'. I am not sure how the Bill will work out in reality, and nobody else knows, but I can say that it is the best attempt that has been made to see that something is done. It embodies all those concepts which are proper and right. It embodies a practical program which at least gives more hope than has ever been given before. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand said, `I have an idea, a concept'. Whatever else people may say about Gerry Hand, he is a practical man.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us take that as conceded. The truth keeps coming from Senator Boswell but it is a little skewed at the edges. Senator Boswell says that Gerry Hand is a man with a great heart. Everybody concedes that. I am glad to have got that very generous statement from Senator Boswell. The other side agrees that he is a man with great compassion, great heart and great intent. Senator Boswell says that he is not a practical man. When we analyse that, what does it mean? It means that he does not do what the Opposition proposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I understand it, the Opposition proposes to give more money in one area, help with the housing problem in another, build more schools in another and give more medical attention somewhere else. All the things that go towards creature comforts are encouraged. Mr Hand says-and I understand this has been called impractical by the other side-`We are a nation. Europeans have come here, followed by people from other places on the globe, and have set up what is called the Australian society'. That society changes. As different people come from around the world, the character of the culture in this country changes. What is conceived of as Australian culture now is not what was conceived of as Australian culture in 1945, 1918 or whenever in the past. Mr Hand says, `All right, we keep changing, but one thing that is fundamental to all this is that people should be given a fair go'. I imagine that he would be saying, `When you look at the history of the Aboriginal people in Australia the reality is, on the evidence, that they have not been able to participate fully in the sort of community we have, and they still are not able to do that'. </PARA>
<PARA> To contradict that statement one would have not only to point to people from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities represented in the judiciary, the Parliament, the Executive, industry and so on, but also to concede that great numbers of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders may be able to enter those areas. One would have to be able to say, `Tomorrow we will find that'. I mean 19 August; I do not mean tomorrow in the sense of the next decade or the next century. When we are asked what Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders have achieved in those areas the only answer we can give is that given by Senator Baume when he said, `We have as a Party produced one Aboriginal in the history of the Commonwealth, and isn't that good?'. </PARA>

The Liberal Party has done better than the Australian Labor Party in this respect. Senator Baume's Party has put an Aboriginal on to the benches in this House, but the problem with Senator Baume's statement is that he is saying Aboriginal affairs is really a partisan issue; it is a political issue. He is saying, `We are better than you because we can produce one more person than you can to whom we have given a seat in this House. Therefore, we are good. Therefore, we win. Therefore, don't pass this legislation. Therefore, let us go home and do no more about it'. If we are going to approach this debate on the basis of whose daddy did better in the war we will not get anywhere. I am sure that, when Senator Baume thinks about it, he will not approach this issue on that basis because if this debate, which will go on for hours-it has already gone on for a long while-is to proceed on that basis, then we are in trouble.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I return to what I said about the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand). He has been called impractical. I say, as he says, that in this era-given the history that has led up to it-the way out is to enable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, who are, as a matter of reality on the basis of the evidence that is before us, unable to take the same stance in the community as others, to have the opportunity of some self-determination-and it is only some self-determination. It does not create a separate nation. It does not create a separate parliament that is not within the jurisdiction of this Parliament. It does no more than enable them, as a group, to take a particular approach on the way to obtaining their place in the sun. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that there are lots of instances in society of special groups which have a lot to say about how things go on in the community'. There is the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the National Farmers Federation. Nobody says of them, `Look, here is a group of people which, to some extent, is separate from the rest of the community'. It is not that they should not be-nobody says that-but as soon as some attempt is made to overcome a problem which exists, and which everybody concedes does exist, the partisan politics arise and we get into the sort of debate we are getting into now. If there is an effective alternative, let us hear it. If there is an effective alternative, why has it not been put into operation before, and why has it not worked? That statement can be made in respect of both parties which have operated as the Government in this House over the years. </PARA>
<PARA> On the evidence, it is wrong to say that Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders have the same opportunities as everybody else in society. In reality, that is wrong. What Mr Hand has done with this Bill is address the problem. It has been conceded that Mr Hand is a man whose heart beats large. What he is accused of is a lack of practicality. It can also be said that he is a man who has had the strength of will, the capacity, to get this Bill up and running. A person who does that is a person who has creativity to fall back on. It is terribly hard, in any society, to create things. It is very easy to criticise. It is very easy to criticise who is chosen for a particular sporting team, and who is batting where. It is very easy to criticise what the Executive of a peak business body like the Confederation of Australian Industry does, or what a peak body like the ACTU does. It is always very easy to criticise. </PARA>
<PARA> If one has listened to the debate that has taken place concerning this particular Bill, one will have heard that there has been a long litany of criticism. Critics say it is wrong to say, as does the preamble to the Bill, that the Europeans invaded this country. They say it is wrong to set up a committee such as this, and it is wrong to set up a commission. They say it is wrong to do this, and wrong to do that; this will happen and that will happen. Anybody can say something is wrong. It is very difficult to put up something that will operate. </PARA>
<PARA> I challenge those who follow me in the debate to put forward, firstly, a concept that will work; secondly, a practical working out of that concept, as has been done in this Bill; and, thirdly, an arrangement for the passage of such a scheme through the House. That is what has got to be done. There are problems which have to be faced with the concept, and how to get it up and running. There has to be a plan so that the problems we are faced with can be overcome. That is a very big task. The second big task is to put that plan into legislative form. All sorts of difficulties arise in that exercise, and they have been described today. Thirdly, how can the legislation be passed through the House? That is the biggest problem, because people, legitimately, debate it-that is what we are all here to do-have problems with it and send issues off to a Senate committee, and that is a proper process, but it is a process that limits what people might want to do. It is a helpful process, in the sense that the bumps in the plan can be smoothed out, but it is also a very frustrating process for a group of people which has a scheme in mind and wants to get it through the Parliament. It would be wrong, as has been done, simply to condemn this process out of hand. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a proper process for Senator Coulter of the Australian Democrats-I see he is here-to say, `Look, I have some concerns about particular issues. I can understand the general scheme that you are putting forward, but I have some problems with the way certain things work out, and I want you to make these amendments'. It is a tremendously helpful contribution that Senator Coulter has made. We got this legislation into some sort of form, we will finally get it into its present form and it will go through. That is a very different process from the blanket refusal to even consider it, or parts of it, and to simply say, `The whole thing is wrong, let us throw it out', and leave nothing in its stead-that is the real problem-except to say, `We will treat Aboriginals as ordinary members of society'. How many people in this chamber-there are not many here, in fact, at the moment-who are entitled to be in this chamber do bring Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders into their clubs, homes and political party bodies that promote people for election, preselection and so on? Very few. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very important-absolutely essential-to this debate to keep distinguishing between theory and reality. What has blighted this debate from go to whoa is that these two things have been confused. People say, `We have seen before that some white people were hung for killing Aboriginals in the last century, and that made it all right, because that showed that the law operated equally.' They point to the fact that Aboriginal flags are flown with the Union Jack or the Australian flag, or that somebody smiled at an Aboriginal at a race meeting, and that makes it all right. But one cannot look at symbols and say, `There is a symbol here, a symbol there, and one in this place. Therefore, it is all right'. One has to look at the reality of how society operates. One has to look at the reality of how we live as a community and see the role that Aboriginals play in that. That is our problem. </PARA>
<PARA> People say, `Forget the past. We did not kill, slaughter, maim or take land from Aboriginals. Therefore, it really does not matter. History is history; the past is the past'. That approach is reasonable but also very dangerous. I will tell honourable senators why. Most of us were born here, and our parents and grandparents were born here. We say that that matters. We say that we are Australians and that, because of our history in this land, we are able to say to people who want to come here, `You will come only in limited numbers. We will have an immigration policy. We have a defence force because, if you try to take this place from us, we are going to defend it. Why? Because we were born here. We live here; we have a commitment to the place. We think you ought to respect that'. That is fundamental to the way society is run and to the way that we look at not only our country but also other countries. We say to the United States of America, `That is yours. You have been there. That is your territory. You have a history there'. We say the same thing to the Chinese, to the Italians, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> If we ignore the claims that history gives to people who occupy a country, we are risking anarchy. We will have anarchy in the world if we live by the rule that people can simply say, `It does not matter who is there now, we are going to take it off them'. That is why it is important, not only for the Aboriginals but also for ourselves, to understand that the prior rights of people who have lived here-in the case of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders, it is centuries, millenniums-ought to be respected. In giving them that right, we are giving ourselves rights to protect ourselves from those who might otherwise want to take this place from us. That is why the sorts of objectives set out in the preamble and encompassed in this Bill are certainly important for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders but, in a way, are more important for us and for the concepts that run through international law, which keep us and, hopefully, our children, grandchildren and so on-presuming the children marry-safe in the future. History is important. </PARA>

In that philosophy-as well as, I would have thought, in nearly every philosophy that operates-there is a great regard for traditions and cultures that have survived for thousands of years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Aboriginal and Torres Straits Islander Commission Bill. I say that quite clearly because people who listened to Senator Cooney's contribution might have wondered what exactly we were debating. This Bill for the restructuring of Aboriginal administration remains no more acceptable to the Liberal and National parties since it was revamped and, in the style so typical of this Hawke Labor Government, railroaded through the House of Representatives last May in the early hours of the morning. We have seen that with a lot of important legislation in the last few years. Because the numbers are in the House of Representatives, Bills come in one door, do a quick turnaround, and shoot straight back out again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A piece of legislation as important as this should have been debated properly in the House of Representatives. For that reason, I take great exception to the contribution, minute as it was, from Senator Devlin this morning. He accused the coalition of simply filibustering on this Bill. That could not be further from the truth. Our concern about this legislation is absolute. I do not know why he made that accusation, when one looks at the contributions made this morning and who made them. Many of the people who made contributions from the government benches this morning have previously admitted that they have little or no contact or experience with any Aboriginal community. That is a very sad reflection on their supporting such a gross piece of legislation. At least the people who have spoken from the coalition parties have direct experience and see the Aboriginal communities on a regular basis. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Peter Baume, who has responsibility for the carriage of the passage of this Bill for the Opposition, has an enormous degree of background in Aboriginal affairs, as he was the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in the former coalition Government. It is my pleasure to be able to support my colleague Senator Peter Baume and my other colleagues in the outstanding contributions that they have made to the detail. </PARA>
<PARA> Changes made to the original legislation do not alter the substance of a Bill that is fundamentally flawed. It confuses advocacy with administration and welfare with self-help. Aboriginal Australians will have to adapt to the structure rather than the other way about. That is one of the fundamental differences that we have. This Bill still contains a preamble that, at best, is an exercise in political self-indulgence and, at worst, could open the door to racial divisions upheld by the legal force. Neither the Minister nor the Government has been able to show that Aboriginal Australians have been adequately consulted as to the final form of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). There is no doubt that other Australians with a legitimate concern for the direction of Aboriginal policy have not been consulted at all. It is beside the point for the supporters of this Bill to claim that ATSIC is not an Aboriginal parliament because it does not have the literal power to make laws. What it will involve, however, is a combination of representative and administrative roles-an inherently political body charged with the administration of $500m worth of public money and assets worth $1 billion. It cannot be denied that these are major characteristics of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition cannot endorse the absorption of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC), which for all its errors represents the ethic of enterprise and self-help, into what is otherwise the administration of social welfare. While the Government has bowed to pressure and removed the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies from the main Bill, the same arguments apply for the separation of the ADC from welfare assistance and from representative mechanisms that, to some degree, are certain to be politicised. Thoughtful Australians cannot fail to be concerned when the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) talks of self-determination as if it meant nothing more than the self-management that all of us would see as the desirable outcome for Aboriginal Australians. Once we speak of self-determination, referred to in the preamble of this Bill, this Parliament could be giving effect, having regard to its actual legal definition, to the right of a specific territory or race to choose its own form of government without the consent of the nation to which it belongs. Last year Professor Colin Hughes warned:</PARA>
<PARA> We should not be in the business of creating a sub-nation with a sub-Parliament, with enormous powers to claim land and other property as its own. </PARA>
<PARA>Whether or not this is the intent of the Labor Government, it is most certainly likely to be the outcome of this very flawed legislation. Not only is the concept of ATSIC dangerous, but its whole representational structure has been called into question as inappropriate for those 60,000 Aboriginal Australians who are attempting to remain within their traditional social organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> This Hawke Labor Government has failed to heed such voices as that of Pastor Paul Albrecht, who states that the system of councils being set up and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . are in fact destructive of what is left of the Aboriginal culture and social organisation, because they not only ignore but also actively denigrate existing Aboriginal leadership, responsibilities and structure. </PARA>
<PARA>Pastor Albrecht states that these councils:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . are solely funded by government . . . they are elected and operate on non-traditional lines, and therefore are not controlled by the people they are supposed to represent, nor are they accountable to them. </PARA>
<PARA>If that is not a cause for concern, what is? The truth of this allegation is now borne out by the moves within the Northern Territory to break away from the major land councils which clearly have failed to provide appropriate representation for many traditional communities. </PARA>
<PARA> I have very little confidence that the 60 regional councils and the 17 zones specified in this Bill will function so as to convey the wishes of traditional Aboriginal communities to the governmental structure, let alone deliver them the outcomes that they actually need. The entire Kimberley and Pilbara regions of Western Australia containing thousands of Aboriginal Australians, some within traditional structures and others in what can only be described as a state of social breakdown, will have the same representation on the Commission as the Torres Strait area or Tasmania. Where is the equality in that? Tasmania, with a single region containing a few thousand Australians of sometimes tenuous Aboriginal ancestry who for generations have been integrated within the general community, gets one-third of the zonal representation of Western Australia, which has 38,000 Aborigines in 13 regions. </PARA>

<PARA> The coalition maintains that ATSIC has been formulated without proper consultation with Aboriginal Australians, despite the protestations of the Minister that he sat down under innumerable trees some 18 months ago. Many of us have sat down with Aboriginal communities, many of us have talked with them at length, but so few of us have come up with this harebrained idea that Minister Hand has come up with. It was made very clear in the dissenting report of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs that the consultative process has been totally inadequate. Aboriginals were asked for their approval only on an in-principle basis, with a firm understanding in their minds that there would be further discussions. What happened with the further discussions? They did not eventuate. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts are clear that over the last 12 months there have been no such further consultations, nor have the Aboriginal Australians been given the opportunity to consider different models of service provision and self-management. More serious are the allegations that Aboriginal communities were, to put it as politely as possible, encouraged to agree with the proposals of a government that dispenses specific and direct funds. It is indeed admitted by the Minister that in the course of his consultations in the early part of 1988 he made off-Budget commitments of $808,000. Even if we accept these funding proposals, there is surely a flagrant impropriety in dealing with consultation and funding conjointly. It does not augur well for the future integrity of ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA> The chairman of the Aboriginal Development Commission, Mrs McPherson, was reported last December as stating that the `Toyota dreaming was well and truly in operation', on the evidence of prominent and knowledgable Aboriginals, so that enticements were part of the consultation process, with measures taken to conceal the fact. The actions of this Government can only be described as treating Aboriginal Australians with contempt, with `paternalism' far too inadequate a word. </PARA>
<PARA> The intentions of the Minister in this legislation have to be judged against the record of his actions. For this reason the Senate should recall that on 11 May 1988 he arbitrarily dismissed those ADC commissioners that he was empowered to remove for no better reason than their disagreement with the ATSIC proposals. Moreover, these very same commissioners, originally appointed by the Hawke Labor Government, received no acknowledgment of their services and were thus treated like wrongdoers, pawns in a political numbers game. What did we end up with? We ended up with Hand picked commissioners. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not forget, either, that these people were subject to press reports implying their responsibility for the disappearance of $670,000 in public money. While Estimates committee hearings revealed the falsity of the allegation, the new Board of the ADC never saw fit to issue a denial to clear the names of its predecessors but, more importantly, neither has the Minister.</PARA>

There can be no question that those who the Minister lacked the power to dismiss have been subjected to harassment and humiliation. It is a sorry record that undermines and discredits his professed concern for Aboriginal Australians. None of us, whatever our difficulties and deprivations, needs this kind of authoritarian messiah. Ministering angels should not wear jackboots-that is Minister Hand. Are we supposed to accept on trust from this Hawke Labor Government that ATSIC will magically improve outcomes for Aboriginals Australians, whose living standards so notably fail to improve, despite the vast sums of public money spent on their behalf? If that is so, and if that allegation is correct, why do the Aboriginal communities not believe it? It is a con. It is a bluff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While the record shows that $4 billion has been spent under the Aboriginal heading by this Government since 1983, unofficial calculations have put total spending at a current annual figure of $1.2 billion, or $40,000 per average Aboriginal Australian family. Yet the statistics taken from the last three sets of census data show that the real median income of Aboriginal Australians over 15 years old declined over the decade 1976 to 1986 and Aboriginal income per head remained at little more than half the national level. Such figures do not show how many Aboriginals suffer from dependency upon the welfare dollar directly or indirectly, not having attained genuine self-management, which would enable them to participate in the social mainstream. </PARA>
<PARA> Because ATSIC has been formulated in true Labor centralist fashion, without consultation with the States, we can expect that the present wasteful duplication of services will continue. It is interesting that Senator Giles, a senator from Western Australia who gave a speech in this chamber this morning, failed to mention-and other Labor senators have also failed to mention this-that on 16 May this year the Labor Premier of Western Australia publicly stated his lack of confidence in the Aboriginal policy of his Federal colleagues, attacking the duplication of services and stating that Federal policies `tried to assuage the middle class Vaucluse guilt'. This is something that the Liberal and National parties have been pointing out for years. </PARA>
<PARA> Western Australia has only recently received an object lesson in the abuse of power from the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs when on 12 April he solemnly declared that part of the site of the old Swan brewery near Perth was a significant Aboriginal area under serious and immediate threat of desecration. While I have no intention whatsoever of canvassing the rights and wrongs of the brewery redevelopment, it is relevant to this debate that the Minister saw fit to override and overrule the State Government at the behest of some radical activists within the Aboriginal community. The Minister ignored the fact that a prominent Aboriginal figure, Mr Ken Colbung, with full knowledge of Aboriginal law and customs, not necessarily shared by the protesters, had warned that the activists were bringing Aboriginal tradition into disrepute. Moreover, genuine doubt has now arisen that the brewery site is the same area that in the last century was recorded as being significant to Aborigines. The Minister launched his thunderbolt not only at the wrong time but also, yet again, in the wrong place. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians should be in no doubt that this Labor Government will use its powers to halt developments whenever radicals choose to do a bit of grandstanding with support from a person such as Michael Mansell, who knows nothing about the traditions of real Aboriginals but whose stated objective is the separation of half the Australian continent in a self-governing Aboriginal state. Michael Mansell is probably whiter than I am, but he professes, like other white advisers-like Stephen Hawke, the son of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), up in the Kimberleys-to advise Aboriginal communities. It is nothing short of a disgrace and cannot be allowed to continue. Needless to say, Mr Mansell has been quick to get in on the Swan brewery act. All the way along the line it is the person with an extremist agenda who stands ready to benefit from the irresponsible policies of this Hawke Labor Government towards Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The contents of this Bill cannot be divorced from its preamble, which expresses an outpouring of guilt, not shared by the majority of Australians who believe that Aboriginals may well deserve practical help to raise living standards but who do not accept the stupid lie that Australian prosperity is somehow the cause of Aboriginal poverty. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. I remind the Minister that for the past two days senators on this side of the chamber have asked a number of questions concerning the Government's punitive Budget decision to change the arrangements for the collection of company tax. Has the Minister noted the comments by the editorial director, Robert Gottliebsen, in today's issue of the Business Review Weekly, in which he points out that the Budget decision to require payment of 85 per cent of company tax within 15 days of the end of the financial year means that the companies must prepare themselves for massive outflows of funds in May and July next year? Has he further noted that Treasury officials, when this was pointed out to them in the Sydney Budget lock-up, seemed genuinely stunned at what they might have done? Mr Gottliebsen said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Canberra's PAYE-paid politicians and public servants do not understand that most businesses run on cashflows rather than profits.</PARA>
<PARA>Did the Government consult with businesses prior to its horrendous decision affecting them? Does the Government now realise the full consequences of what it is doing, especially as far as small and medium-sized businesses are concerned? Will he reconsider this Budget decision?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not read Mr Gottliebsen's comments that were published this morning but I will do so. I am not in a position to say whether Treasury officials were stunned in the lock-up in Sydney. I probably never will be. It is a very subjective judgment to determine whether people are stunned. In regard to the point about consultation with business, the Treasury regularly consults with business about various matters. In terms of the Budget, the fiscal position, the size of the Budget surplus and the contribution which this change of payment time of corporate taxation will make to the Budget, I draw the honourable senator's attention to a publication put out by the Business Council of Australia on 30 April this year. It listed a number of options which the Government might explore. On page 7 of that document it said that the Commonwealth can save large amounts. It went on to set out various ways. It stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>A number of options are available to further spread out PAYE, company and provisional tax receipts.</PARA>
<PARA>It then went on to discuss some of the options which are available. That statement by the Business Council must have fully comprehended that this was one of the options available. I think it is likely that it comprehended that in the light of the fact that in making this decision about the time for payment of corporate taxation, the Government is doing no more than moving into line with what is done internationally. For example, the system in some countries-Canada is one which I know about-for the time for collection of corporate taxes is far more onerous than it is even here under this provision that has been introduced. In terms of the general debating point which the honourable senator has made, it has to be considered that the Business Council did make that suggestion but it probably made that suggestion in the light of international experience. Having said that, I come back to the points that I have made on numerous occasions at Question Time: that it is a matter of equity in the taxation system and, if it is to be done, it should be done at the right time having regard to high levels of corporate profitability and the other arguments which I have put to the honourable senator before.</PARA>
<PARA> No doubt the honourable senator will ask me a supplementary question which will be directed to his point about whether I understand that cash flows, rather than profits, are important to companies. Of course, I understand that. For example, this hard view was put by one analyst in the Australian Financial Review the other day:</PARA>
<PARA>But if companies are surviving just because they were given tax free credit from the Tax Office then probably those companies don't deserve to survive in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not my comment; that is a comment from a business analyst published in the Australian Financial Review. Of course, it goes to the other extreme. In any Budget changes are made to the taxation system which will impinge on the traditional way taxpayers operate. In that sense this is consistent with what has happened in previous Budgets and, undoubtedly, what will happen in the future.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="413" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="RESOURCES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the first part of the question is that the Commonwealth selected three of the members of the research team; the New South Wales Government selected the other three. The names put forward of the three selected by the Commonwealth are as follows. The first is Dr Bryant Richards, the Honorary Fellow and Chairman of Ecosystem Management in the University of New England (UNE). He was previously Associate Professor, Natural Resources, Chairman, Biological Sciences; Head of the Department of Ecosystem Management; and Head of the Department of Botany at UNE. His work has focused on natural resource and environmental policies with an emphasis on forest management and forest ecology. He has particular experience in soil microbiology. His most recent publication is entitled Microbiology of Terrestrial Ecosystems. He has worked extensively in these areas in Australia, the USA, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Bangladesh.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Professor Henry Nix is the second member of our team. He is the Director of the Centre of Resource and Environmental Studies at the Australian National University (ANU). I believe that Professor Nix's qualifications are more widely known, but I just mention that he has spent 25 years with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, principally in the Division of Water and Land Resources, and his research interests have focused on the development of improved computer-based methods of land inventory, evaluation planning and management.</PARA>
<PARA> The third member, Dr Kenneth Shepherd, is the reader in the Department of Forestry at the ANU. He has been there since 1967 and he is a pre-eminent scientist in his field.</PARA>
<PARA> The other members of the study team nominated by the New South Wales Government are: Dr J. Turner, Chief, Wood Technology and Forest Research Division; Mr R. G. Bridges, Leader, Ecology Research Section of the Wood Technology and Forest Research Division; and Dr R. A. Curtin, Deputy Chief, Management Planning Division.</PARA>
<PARA> In answer to the first point raised in Senator Dunn's question, we have, therefore, a team of extraordinarily qualified people. The Commonwealth component of that team-the component for which we take responsibility-is very well balanced right across the diversity of interests concerned. They are top professionals. By employing them in this study we are actually using them as conduits to their institutions, which have many other resources and which are pre-eminent in the field. I also note that they are able to employ consultants and subcontract where necessary. Given their level of professional competence, it is not for us to query their professionalism, nor is it appropriate to comment that they lack resources. Resources are available through their institutions or, by their own decision, through the hiring of contract or consultancy staff. The New South Wales component, which represents the New South Wales Forestry Commission, which manages the forests, has been conducting its own biological studies which will be considered in the context of all this.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Dunn concluded by saying that she did not wish to criticise the professional competence of this team. One of the ways in which the standing of this study could be undermined would be by criticising the team. I do not believe that those allegations and any inference that the team lacks competence are reasonable or fair. I think we should wait for their results, which will be published and made available, and I think that should be the basis upon which they are judged.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by making the point that in today's Sydney Morning Herald it was reported that there is now conclusive evidence of the existence of the long-footed potoroo in part of the south-east forest. That establishes the validity of the advice tendered to me by Senator Richardson, who in January of this year advised that we should conduct a study in the area of the south-east forest. It is in exactly the area of the south-east forest that Senator Richardson recommended that we study, and in an area for which we negotiated protection and exemption from logging in the agreement with New South Wales, that these sightings have been confirmed. That is acknowledged by none other than the New South Wales Minister for Natural Resources, Mr Ian Causley. Now that those sightings have been confirmed in an area that we have prevented from being logged, I am sure the scientific team we have in place will be able to conduct those studies properly.</PARA>

There was less than a 2 per cent increase in investment, and that included the resources boom. What is the Budget figure for the last five years? It is 10.8 per cent. That is very relevant to a shift of resources into the traded goods sector. There is room for disagreement about where the investment is going. Undoubtedly, some of it will be going into the service sector and some of it into increasing capacity, but the relationship between the service sector and the manufacturing sector in this country at present, as in all countries, is so interchanged, so interwoven, that improvements in productivity and performance in the non-traded goods sector, particularly in a whole range of computer services and things like that, are extremely important.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Is it a fact that on 7 June 1989, three days after the Tiananmen Square massacre, the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) allocated $76m to the People's Republic of China (PRC) Government for its population control program? Is it also a fact that the United States Government strongly condemned this action and reiterated its stand not to fund UNFPA because of UNFPA's support of the PRC's population control program, which involves violations of human rights, including coercive abortions and involuntary sterilisations? By contrast, is it a fact that the current Budget doubles the amount Australia pays to UNFPA and that Australia's delegate at the UNFPA meeting on 7 June 1989 gave strong support for the payment of aid moneys for China's population control program? I hold in my hand the text of a statement from Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which I remind the Senate was made only three days after the Tiananmen Square massacre. Some departmental official has written on the bottom of this document, `Was no reference made to the political environment?'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not familiar with the particular statement that may have been made by the Australian diplomatic representative on that occasion or the precise context in which it was made. I do not find attractive Senator Harradine's obvious attempt to link his own perception of the nature of the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) program in China with the circumstances of the Tiananmen massacre.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The population control program that is conducted in China, as elsewhere-although it has been the subject of allegations made by Senator Harradine and his ilk over the years-has never been one about which I have seen evidence to justify the allegations that are being made about coercive abortion, involuntary sterilisation and so on. This particular obsession of Senator Harradine's, which he has long had and will continue no doubt to pursue, is not an obsession I share, unless and until I get a lot harder evidence than I have ever had from him or anyone else to justify the concern that he articulates.</PARA>
<PARA> The point about the UNFPA program is that population control measures of the kind that UNFPA supports are crucial for the successful achievement of the aims of aid programs worldwide, including those in which we participate. They are humanitarian in character and they are developmental in character for the obvious reason that population growth rates remain one of the most crucial inhibitors to the effective alleviation of poverty in innumerable countries around the world. I personally place the highest priority on the UNFPA program. I have given it strong personal support. It is through my very direct personal intervention that we have succeeded in a difficult budgetary climate this year in restoring the level of aid contribution to UNFPA that we were making in the mid-1980s and that regrettably fell away quite dramatically over the last three years. I think the UNFPA program is outstanding both in its aspirations and in its operational execution, from everything that I have seen of it. I am quite proud that Australia is now back on the record firmly, fully and effectively supporting that organisation with the contribution that we have made in the Budget this year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Resources aware that large quantities of methane are present in coal, perhaps as much as 40 billion cubic metres in New South Wales and Queensland alone? Is the Minister aware that methane is at least five times more effective as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, to which it can be burnt with the release of substantial quantities of energy? Will the Minister therefore investigate and report to the Senate on the amounts and distribution of methane in coal in Australia and also on the feasibility of tapping methane as an energy source so as to increase coalmine safety, conserve energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions both directly and indirectly?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, since the subject of methane has been raised in terms of its greenhouse gas contribution, let me say that methane is a naturally produced gas. Methane emissions come mainly from the rice paddies of Asia and the increasing number of ruminant cattle in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to Senator Coulter's first question, I am aware of the facts. Australia's coalbed methane reserves are substantially greater than Senator Coulter suggests. In the northern Bowen basin alone coalbed methane resources are estimated at 3,850 billion cubic metres in place, with recoverable reserves estimated at 2,500 billion cubic metres. As to the second question, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation advises that methane emissions are six times more effective than carbon dioxide emissions on a molecule for molecule basis as a greenhouse gas.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the third question, I can advise that under the national energy research, development and demonstration program the drainage of methane from coalmines and the feasibility of utilisation of that methane have been successfully demonstrated already. Methane drainage has resulted in increased coalmine safety, increased coal productivity and the conservation of energy. Methane drainage is now commercially applied at a number of underground coalmines in New South Wales. More specifically, at a coalmine I visited recently-the Westcliff coalmine-and at the Appin collieries drained methane gas is used to generate electricity for on-site use, with excess power generated from that source being fed into the New South Wales electricity grid. The draining of coalbed methane and its use for on-site electricity generation is a positive step in the reduction of greenhouse gases when compared with the alternative of bringing coal based electricity into the mine. The coal industry and the electricity generating authority in New South Wales have cooperated well in this area and are to be commended for it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 6 July when I visited Townsville, I had discussions with representatives of Queensland's Yabulu nickel refinery. Because of a nickel shortfall from the Greenvale mine and the probable need to import nickel from Indonesia in a way that would require careful environmental assessment, I consulted with my colleagues the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. In Townsville I announced that the Commonwealth Government proposed to establish a task force and that we would invite participation of the Townsville City Council, because it had demonstrated an interest in the subject, and would invite the Queensland Government to look at issues associated with the further development at Yabulu.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The current value of exports from that operation is $300m a year. The company wishes to invest a further $200m in expanding its nickel concentrate refinery, which would bring in export income to Australia from 1991 of $500m. It would employ an estimated 700 people all up. The task force representatives are specifically from the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, my own Department, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, and the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. We have also invited participation from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, Dallhold Investments-the owners of the nickel refinery-and, because of its representations, the Thuringowa City Council. The task force will meet as soon as the public comment period of the environmental impact statement has concluded. I expect the meeting to be held some time shortly after 11 September 1989 in Townsville. I also had a discussion with conservationists and fishing interests in Townsville and arranged for them to have an input into consideration of the issue. This is an example of where the Commonwealth Government has taken an initiative to speed up consideration of an important development.</PARA>

There is a lot of disagreement among economists on the relative importance of the issue of the level of our foreign debt.

Senator Chaney initially asked whether I regarded the composition of the foreign debt as of little consequence. My answer to that question is that nobody in the Government regards it as of little consequence. It may be that Ministers in the Government have said that the Commonwealth is doing its best with the current enormous surplus and the public sector borrowing requirement not yet reduced but in credit, as it were-an enormously successful performance. It may be that Ministers have suggested that the Commonwealth has been doing its bit in retiring debt, but I do not think anybody has said that the composition of the debt is of no consequence.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, in the interests of the record, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a question asked by the Hon. Gordon Scholes in the House of Representatives on 15 June and the Prime Minister's response to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The question and answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Mr SCHOLES: I ask the Prime Minister: Is he aware of concerns by pensioners and other Australians at repeated claims that they are liable for the repayment of thousands of dollars of Australia's overseas debt? Is it a fact that the Australian Commonwealth has no overseas debt? Can the Prime Minister inform me whether or not pensioners and others in Australia are actually responsible for the repayment of the debts of the President of the Liberal Party?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr HAWKE: I thank the honourable member for Corio for his question without notice. I think it is terribly regrettable that some expositions are made by some people opposite and other commentators which would imply that every Australian family and pensioners have some degree of responsibility for Australia's overseas debt. Nothing could be further from the truth. In the process of those sorts of fear campaigns and suggestions being made, comparisons are made between Australia's debt position and that of countries such as Argentina and Mexico. Those sorts of comparisons are thrown around recklessly and without any foundation whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA> The situation is that Australia's net foreign debt amounts to 31.6 per cent of gross domestic product GDP, which is down from the 32.4 per cent of a year ago. There is absolutely no comparison to be made with countries that are mentioned in this sort of stupid nonsense that is peddled by the Opposition. In the case of Argentina and Mexico, their foreign debt is of the order of 70 to 80 per cent of their GDP, as against the much lower proportion in Australia. The other major distinction between Australia and those countries is that in their cases it is debt which is substantially owed by government, whereas in the composition of Australia's debt the honourable gentleman will see the total absence of any basis of fact for the frightening suggestions that are made.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the composition of Australia's net debt. Who owes it? The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics statistics-those for the December quarter of 1988-show these simple irrefutable facts. The private sector owes 61 per cent of Australia's net foreign debt; the States owe 14 per cent; and Commonwealth and State authorities owe 25 per cent. There is no net debt at all owed by the Government of Australia. Those are the facts. Either those on the other side of the House, who would say to every Australian family and every pensioner, `You have this debt hanging over you', are ignorant, which would not be entirely surprising, or it is a deliberate attempt to misrepresent and intimidate the pensioners and others in this country.</PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the Commonwealth Government owes no debt. In fact, because the Commonwealth Government has pursued the tight fiscal policies it has over recent years, we have had no borrowing on behalf of the Commonwealth Government since March 1987 and in the period since then we have been repaying debt. In that way we have reduced the public sector borrowing requirement to zero and we have reduced the level of national indebtedness. We have not been prepared to rest on our laurels. Not only have we conducted the tight fiscal policy in regard to our own budgetary decisions, but in the most recent Premiers Conference we announced cuts of around $1.2 billion off the approved borrowing limits for Commonwealth statutory authorities and about another $1 billion off the borrowings by the States.</PARA>
<PARA> So, the facts are very simple. The overwhelming proportion of the debt is owed by the private sector, and that represents decisions which have been taken by commercial enterprises in this country on the basis that with that borrowing they will be able to undertake enterprises which will generate an income which will give them profit and the capacity to meet their indebtedness. Those are the facts. I repeat that no debt is owed by the Commonwealth Government of Australia, and therefore those on the other side--</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Ian Cameron: I rise on a point of order, Madam Speaker. I would like to ask the Prime Minister to whom the Commonwealth owes $8 billion a year.</PARA>
<PARA> Madam SPEAKER: Order! The honourable member for Maranoa will not do that again. He was totally out of order.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr HAWKE: I would suggest that if the honourable member for Maranoa is interested in who owes who what, he should have a thorough investigation into his own Party in Queensland. He will then find out where debts are owed there. That would be a nice, grubby story, which would be much more interesting than the honourable member's inane, irrelevant and ill-based interjections in this place.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was going to say something ruder, that is true. I thought of something less rude just in time. For those who are interested in Kalgoorlie, it is worth remembering that in 1976, because the price of gold was low, the last of the big mines there was on the brink of closing. What saved it? A big equity injection from an American firm called Homestake. That is what saved the last big mine in Kalgoorlie in 1976. The Mt Charlotte operation was considerably expanded. The American firm which saved the last big mine in Kalgoorlie when the industry was in its last period of low prices paid tax in Washington. It was not one of these bludgers in Australia who are whingeing about applying to the goldmining industry the same taxation arrangements that apply to everything else; it was not one of these bludgers who seek a tax-free ride. An American company came in and saved the big mine in Kalgoorlie at that time, and it paid its tax in Washington.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For those who want to argue that it is important for companies involved in goldmining to keep the profits they have generated for future investment, that can also be done. They can issue franked bonus shares. The shareholder gets the advantage of the tax having been paid by the company, and the company retains control of the funds for reinvestment if it wishes to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator McKiernan, I am disappointed to notice that Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) also got some silly comment about this reported in the West Australian a couple of days ago. I would have thought that the spivs and bludgers of St George's Terrace who have never mined a bit of gold in their lives could be left out of it. All they have ever mined is paper. I would not expect anything better from them. But I am disappointed that a company of BHP's size and prestige has joined in this silly exercise. What is more, it is absolutely futile because the policy is now fixed. The same tax rules now apply to goldmining as to mining in general. The policy will not be changed. BHP and all the other companies that are involved in goldmining should get on with doing what they ought to be doing-that is, mining gold, instead of whingeing about the application of a level playing field for their industry.</PARA>

In relation to recommendation 38, the Government continues to work on the statement of procedures for responding to a nuclear weapons accident in an Australian port-notwithstanding the fact that the Committee referred to the risk of such an accident or incident being insufficient to warrant contingency planning. Irrespective of that, the Government will continue its work on that problem. I think, overall, the Government's policy has been pretty clear.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government's commitment was to index and maintain the real value of the ABC's grant in 1987-88, less the efficiency dividend which is demanded of all statutory authorities. That commitment was formalised by a Cabinet decision which specifically identified a cash figure of $450m for the 1988-89 financial year and made it clear that that particular cash figure would be indexed by the appropriate indicator so that a real rate of return would be achieved for the following two years. The difficulty that has arisen is that the figure of $450m, which was identified in perfectly good faith by me, the Cabinet and the Government, was based on an estimated inflation factor rather than the actual outturn factor. In fact, the outturn figure was slightly higher than that which was applied when the original estimation was made, and that has generated the angst that we have seen in the public print.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I made it perfectly clear to the ABC at the time this matter was raised with me that some problem of this kind could arise if the 1988-89 inflation outturn figure proved to be different from that which drove the original estimate. I made it clear in response at that time that the ABC would have to live with that possibility, and that if it felt it was being disadvantaged it would have to approach the Government at a later stage. That is where the matter was left. I think the real situation has been pretty well understood within the ABC, despite the hype and drama that we have seen in recent times. Although the commitment has been expressed in various ways, including by me in some of the correspondence to which Senator Alston refers when I wore that earlier hat, the truth of the matter remains that the commitment was as I have described it-$450m maintained in real terms for the following two years. The fact remains that the ABC was aware that that was what it was locked into very shortly after that decision was made last year.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of press reports, and several matters that have crossed my desk in the last few days, indicating the Government's intention that those who engage in serious crime against this community should suffer confiscation of their assets and severe monetary penalties. This relates particularly to those engaged in drug trafficking, the importing of drugs into Australia leading as it does to the degradation, the misery and occasionally the death of our vulnerable young Australians in particular. Therefore, I was very pleased to see that in the Federal Court Cornwell and Bull were subjected to judgments which meant that some $6.9m is required to be paid by Cornwell and some $300,000 by Bull in relation to the importing of drugs into this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think anyone would disagree that not only is this extremely appropriate as an individual penalty on those who seek to make great profits out of the degradation of their fellow Australians, but also it helps to undermine the economic base of crime in this country, so that those assets are not available for more nefarious activities or to be laundered into apparently legitimate businesses.</PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that in the course of this week a couple who were prosecuted under the Proceeds of Crime Act for laundering money reasonably suspected of being the proceeds of crime have been convicted of laundering more than $1m. As a result of that prosecution one of the married couple, the male, has been sentenced to four years and six months imprisonment on 10 charges relating to the money laundering section of the proceeds of crime legislation. In addition, he has been ordered to forfeit two vehicles under the provisions of that statute. His wife has been committed for trial on similar charges.</PARA>
<PARA> I think that indicates the wish of this Parliament that those who are convicted of serious crimes, particularly to do with drug importing, should suffer a severe financial penalty in order that the assets which have been garnered by these people through their criminal activities be returned to the community. That particular set of statutes is beginning to take effect and, I believe, will help to undermine the economic base of crime in this community which, as I say, up to now has been available for carrying out more nefarious activities and has even been laundered into legitimate businesses, undermining legitimate business and commercial activity in this community.</PARA>

I deny the allegation made by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) that I have said that interest rates will fall to 5 per cent during the first three to four years of the next Peacock Government. I believe that Senator Richardson was referring to radio and subsequent newspaper and television reports of an interview which I had on Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio 4QR Brisbane with Mr Rod Henshaw on 2 August. I believe that the treatment of that interview by some journalists is a classic example of selective reporting and the influence of the National Media Liaison Service. I rang Mr Henshaw to tell him of the news reports that I had suggested that interest rates could fall to 5 per cent. His immediate response to me was that I had not said that, and that was not my recollection of what I had said either. Indeed, Mr Henshaw was so concerned about the media reporting of the comments made by me on his program that the first thing he did the next morning on his radio program was to make an explanation.

<PARA>Transcript of Comments by Rod Henshaw on Radio 4QR Brisbane 3.8.89</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Henshaw: Before we get into today's stories I'd like to take you back to one our studio guests yesterday, Senator Austin Lewis who spoke to us just after ten o'clock yesterday morning. As a result of that interview the statements of Senator Lewis made national news on both the ABC and the commercial networks. Newspapers have also picked up on the interview. However, most of the attention has been placed on a perception that Senator Lewis predicted interest rates falling to five per cent. He was referring to an economic climate 20 years ago when such rates were the norm for housing loans. In the same sentence he hoped this would be achievable within three or four years of the Peacock lead Government and he went after a question from me to talk about achievable interest rates of 12.5 to 13%. Unfortunately it seems that while it appears Senator Lewis hoped for 5%, I frankly believed he was doing that interview, while he was doing it, he was referring purely to a climate when that might have been possible. Unfortunately, his qualification was not emphasised in the same way. Now this is how that portion of the interview went to air on our programme live yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA>``Lewis:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is trying to prop up these things with taxpayers money, not attacking the basics and that's the solution. Once we get down to inflation and interest rates, you see it doesn't seem to me to be so many years ago when interest was running at the rate of 5%. You could get a bank loan for 5%. Now, . . . gosh when are we going to achieve that again! I hope within three or four years of the next Peacock Government . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Henshaw:</PARA>
<PARA> But what are going to be the elements which will enable banks to say, OK we'll bring it down to even 12.5, 13, 14%? I don't think we'll see those sort of rates anymore, but at least 15%. </PARA>
<PARA>Lewis:</PARA>
<PARA> Well, we believe that 12.5-13% is achievable within the first three years of the Government. We believe that once we start to free up the labour market and to direct the Reserve Bank to attack inflation . . . that overseas investors will get the message and instead of looking at short term investments in Australia they'll start to look at long term investments and business people in Australia, instead of looking at say, investing in real estate or even buying an 18% bank bill will start to say well perhaps I could expand in this area. Small business people will start to use the initiatives which we know that they have and the entrepreneurial skills that they have. And once that happens we genuinely believe there will be a flow right through the community of people starting to look forward to the future instead of worrying about the immediate future.''</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I come to the matter of public importance, I must deal with an exchange which occurred during Question Time earlier today and which goes to the heart of the matter. In response to a question from my colleague Senator Lewis, Senator Button appeared to pour scorn upon the view that the Reserve Bank of Australia was criticising the Government's policy by saying two things. First of all, he said that the Reserve Bank report was finalised months ago and, secondly, he said that the Reserve Bank would not even have known the size of the Budget surplus. Unfortunately, Senator Button is not present in the Senate at the moment, but I trust that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson), who is in attendance, will convey these remarks to him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First of all, a draft of the Reserve Bank report would certainly have gone forward to the printer probably towards the end of June or possibly early in July because that is normal practice, and the Reserve Bank would have considered the first draft-the first draft to go to the Board at least-at its meeting probably on 4 July. As would be normal practice in the case of the Reserve Bank Board's settlement of its annual report to the Parliament, that is not the end of the matter. The Board would then have considered a further draft at a subsequent meeting probably held on 25 July, although possibly on 1 August. I simply point out to Senator Button that the idea that the Reserve Bank Board would have finalised the report months ago is simply ludicrous. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point is that the Reserve Bank would not have even known the size of the surplus. I draw Senator Button's attention to section 13 of the Reserve Bank Act 1959, a section which I have some recollection of. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Governor-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Governor of the bank-</PARA>
<PARA>and the Secretary to the Department of the Treasury shall establish a close liaison with each other and shall keep each other fully informed on all matters which jointly concern the Bank and the Department of the Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA>Since the size of the Budget surplus is, after all, a matter with some bearing on the conduct of monthly policy, I would have expected that degree of close liaison to have been maintained between Mr Fraser and the then Governor, Mr Johnston, or his acting successor, Mr Phillips. I simply leave the point there while expressing, for Senator Button's benefit, the view that he may have been in some danger of misleading the Senate today in his response to Senator Lewis. I urge him to check his facts and, if necessary, to come back after next week's recess and make a retraction. The matter of public importance before the Senate is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The repudiation by the Reserve Bank of the Hawke-Keating Government's economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Usually it is Senator Walsh upon whom we rely to give the annual post-Budget commentary on why the Hawke-Keating Government's economic policy is inadequate and flawed, the most classic case of that being after the 1987 Budget when he warned that Australia was headed down the Argentinean road. This year the Reserve Bank is taking up the role from Senator Walsh in repudiating this Government's economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that in last year's Budget Speech the Treasurer (Mr Keating) told us:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . our balance of payments deficit will be halved from its peak of just three years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>Our foreign debt burden has already stabilised and begun to fall. </PARA>
<PARA>The annual report of the Bank provided to the Parliament yesterday starts off in a somewhat low key way in relation to that comment by simply noting that for 1988-89:</PARA>
<PARA>Our international indebtedness rose, resuming the upward trend as a ratio to GDP that it had followed in the years up to 1986. </PARA>
<PARA>Everyone is familiar with the Treasurer's often repeated statement over the last six or nine months that the large and record current account deficit in our balance of payments has arisen from large rises in investment spending and the imports that they have generated that would boost Australia's future competitiveness and thereby reduce our debt at some time in the future. In last Tuesday's Budget Speech, the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the balance of payments did not fall as we expected, leading to higher investment rates. </PARA>
<PARA>This has been the price we paid for the massive modernisation of Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday, in its annual report, the Reserve Bank repudiated that thesis. It noted:</PARA>
<PARA>This package of policies-</PARA>
<PARA>the Government's policies-</PARA>
<PARA>produced a marked increase in investment spending in 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA>To that extent it is agreeing with the Treasurer. But it goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>While much of the investment should contribute to future productive capacity, some of it . . . was in areas not especially oriented to increasing output in the traded goods sector. </PARA>
<PARA>The Reserve Bank is saying to this Government of ours that investment has been directed in those respects to meeting Australian domestic consumption rather than delivering an improvement in the balance of payments. What about interest rates? In the Budget Speech the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>All in all, the substantial Budget surplus, the forecast slowing in demand and the expected improvement in the balance of payments, establish a framework for lower interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>In the two days since that speech was delivered, we have heard the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), in his usual way, going even further and actually beginning-notwithstanding his assertions that he will not do such a thing-to forecast a fall in interest rates sometime in the first half of next year. Again, the Reserve Bank flatly repudiates such views. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>While the indicators are still mixed, the Bank believes the current setting of monetary policy is now dampening growth of private demand. Higher interest rates gradually seem to be having an impact on all categories of spending. However, the general buoyancy of the economy has been such that rates may need to remain high for quite some time to achieve the desired effect. </PARA>
<PARA>What about the focus of policy-his whole focus of policy; this one-dimensional focus of policy on interest rates which the Government has been following for the last 17 months or so, since April of last year? We can remember statements from the Treasurer such as the following:</PARA>
<PARA>For the future, while other instruments have taken a greater share of the weight, monetary policy must continue to play its vital balancing role in the overall strategy of restraint. </PARA>
<PARA>The Reserve Bank, by contrast, said on page 7 of its report that tight monetary policy, higher interest rates:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . should, with a lag, cut into the demand for imports and thus the current account deficit. However, this is not the primary objective. In fact, in the short run, there may be perverse effects on the balance of payments if higher interest rates produce an exchange rate appreciation. Some of those effects were evident in 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA>The bank is saying what every sensible commentator has been saying to the Treasurer for months past now-namely, that his total concentration upon the use of higher and higher interest rates to crush demand and hence crush, he hopes, the demand for imports in this country has had the totally counterproductive effect of raising the exchange rate of the Australian dollar against other currencies, thereby cheapening the cost to Australians of imports and thereby going on to worsen our balance of payments, not improve it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;More damning, however, is the bank's next paragraph, which Senator Colston has enjoined me to read. I will be delighted to satisfy him. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>On its own, monetary policy will not produce the longer-term structural benefits Australia is seeking. Beyond a point, it may even inhibit the structural change because of the effect of high interest rates on investment of all types. </PARA>
<PARA>I note that in the Budget Papers the rate of growth of business investment this financial year is forecast by the Treasury to be on average some 6 1/2 per cent higher than it was in 1988-89. This implies that throughout the course of the year-a matter which the Budget Papers enjoin us always to look at carefully-from the last June quarter until the June quarter of next year, we will actually see a fall in the rate or the level of business investment. It will be a fall of about-one cannot be sure of these things because the Government has not so far produced the quarterly breakdown of its forecasts; I asked the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) about them yesterday at Question Time-8 per cent between the two June quarters. That is what the Reserve Bank means when it says:</PARA>
<PARA>Beyond a point, it-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, high interest rates-</PARA>
<PARA>may even inhibit the structural change because of the effect of high interest rates on investment of all types. </PARA>
<PARA>This is in direct contradiction, for example, to what the Treasurer wrote in a Sydney Morning Herald article on 28 April this year. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Because we cannot risk demand continuing to run ahead at an unsustainable rate we have targeted it-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, demand-</PARA>
<PARA>with the most effective instrument we have, monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Here is the Reserve Bank of Australia in its annual report saying that it may be an effective instrument for some purposes and for a limited time. But it is implicitly saying that when applied in such a crushing manner and over such a prolonged period it is going to have perverse results on the whole process of business investment which is fundamental to structural change. Clearly, the Reserve Bank of Australia, which is one of the Government's two major sources of economic advice-the other is the Treasury-is repudiating the whole cast of Government policy over the past 15 to 18 months. Even more ominously, the bank goes on to warn on page 13 of its report about what will be the outcome of retaining this kind of policy stance. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Retention of the present stance of policy should produce more significant restraint of spending as 1989-90 progresses. </PARA>
<PARA>There is not the slightest doubt about that. No-one is arguing about that. The bank then says:</PARA>
<PARA>Whether this will also be sufficient to lay the groundwork for winding back the current account deficit is uncertain; there are risks that it may not. </PARA>
<PARA>We may be going through all of this holocaust of high interest rates that the Treasurer has been imposing increasingly upon this economy for 17 months and which he is continuing to impose upon us at least for the balance of this calendar year and, according to the Reserve Bank, possibly even longer, yet it may not even do the trick. It may not even reduce the balance of payments deficit on current account to an acceptable level. There are risks that it may not and these are the bank's words. The bank adds as a postscript to that sombre comment:</PARA>
<PARA>These risks will be much greater if there is a substantial slowing of world growth and a decline in commodity prices. </PARA>
<PARA>Those possible eventualities are quite outside the control of our Government. We do not have time, in my case, to speculate upon the possibility of their coming to pass. The bank is simply flagging the point that there is a risk; that even if those things do not happen we will not get an appropriate diminution in the size of our balance of payments deficit. But it is adding that, if this does happen, there is no chance of an appropriate outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> However, let us not assume that pessimistic additional condition. Let us assume that the world continues to grow at some moderate pace and that commodity prices do not fall further than the Government's economic forecasts suggest they may. What if the Government's strategy, if one can call it that, works? Where does that leave us? It leaves us with a highly depressed level of total demand in the economy; a highly depressed level of activity in the economy; and a highly depressed economy-an economy in which our growing work force, compounded by a reasonably high level of immigration, will no longer find jobs. Under those circumstances, unemployment will start to mount. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, it leaves us with a stagnant economy-with a classic description of stagflation. There will be recessed demand and a still rising inflation rate of about 17 1/2 per cent because this Government has entered into a Faustian compact with Mr Kelty and the Australian Council of Trade Unions on which the Industrial Relations Commission, as it is called today, has set its rubber stamp to provide an inflation of cost levels of 6 1/2 per cent-it says; in fact, it will be more than that-in the 12 months or so ahead; that is a classic description of a recipe for stagflation. As I have said, it will leave us with a stagnant economy. Nothing will have been done about the fundamental structural problem about which Senator Chaney and some others spoke in the matter of public importance debate last Tuesday afternoon. The Reserve Bank delivers that very message to the Government in words that are as clear as possible. On page 8 of its report it states:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia needs a major shift of resources into the traded goods sector to stimulate increased exports and, more importantly, to replace imports. This cannot be achieved if domestic demand is growing faster than productive capacity-</PARA>
<PARA>again that is common ground-</PARA>
<PARA>but simply slowing demand is not enough either. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet that is the only process which this Government is bringing to bear. It is slowing demand through the application of a one-dimensional policy of crushing interest rates. The Reserve Bank report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>There is also a need for greater productive capacity, improved productivity and a better overall price performance, at least as good as our competitors. </PARA>
<PARA>In a later passage the Reserve Bank points out that the vital key to this is inflation-that matter that the Government virtually failed to address in its Budget Speech, accepting, in a spirit of complacency that pervades the whole of that failed document, that once again this year we will have an inflation rate stuck where it has been for the past two years, at 7 1/2 per cent. The fundamentals of structural reform-micro-reform, as the economists call it-have simply not been addressed by this Government and particularly not in its latest Budget. The report does not stop simply at repudiating everything that the Treasurer has been saying about economic policy for goodness knows how long; the report also takes a sideswipe, in passing, at the Prime Minister. On page 7 of the report the bank states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bank does not share the opinion expressed in some quarters. . . </PARA>
<PARA>We all know that the bank is referring to that jejune opinion expressed by the Prime Minister some months ago about the distinction between government debt and private debt and that we should not be worried about the fact that we owe foreigners a lot of private debt. The bank states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bank does not share the opinion expressed in some quarters that, since most of the debt is owed within the private sector rather than by government, it is a matter of little consequence. </PARA>
<PARA>The bank goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>The extent to which resources must be diverted to its future servicing-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the future servicing of that debt whether it be government debt or private debt-</PARA>
<PARA>is the same whether the debt is publicly or privately owed, and the investment which it has enabled will not automatically ensure that these resources are available. </PARA>
<PARA>That would be plain to a schoolboy but it does not appear to have been plain to our Prime Minister when he uttered that mischievous and misleading, if not just merely foolish, statement at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by noting that this Reserve Bank report follows earlier comments by the then Governor of the Reserve Bank. Last May he noted that the Government had made `a major miscalculation' on the economic conditions throughout 1988-89 and that, if the necessary policies are not followed and we do nothing at all-in other words, if we have a Budget like the one that has just been handed down-we will simply set the scene for a very brutal adjustment of the economy at the behest of market forces. This independent view from the Reserve Bank is a far cry from what the Treasurer said at his February press conference on the balance of payments when he was asked about the Reserve Bank's views on monetary policy. He said, `They do what I say; I can assure you of that. That you could put your money on'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must confess to feeling some apprehension at the thought of being given the task of speaking first for the Government after an eminent economic representative such as Senator Stone. I have read the report of the Reserve Bank of Australia and I did not see how Senator Stone would get 20 minutes worth of significant attack on Government policy. I thought: He must have found something that I have not seen. There must be some hidden, profound, economic meaning that my mere Bachelor of Economics degree that I obtained years ago from the University of Western Australia did not gear me up to find. After listening to his 20-minute speech, I am relieved to find that that was not the case. Senator Stone, with his significant economic knowledge, which I accept, found no new, profound, hidden meanings. It was simply a question of selective quotation and enthusiastic interpretation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to say a number of things about the report of the Reserve Bank, things with which I agree strongly, some comments on its interpretation, and some comments on the general economic situation. I want to make some points about Senator Stone's contribution. He quoted from a large part of page 7 of the report but he kept missing sentences that did not fit the thesis he wanted to put forward. For example, he talked about the extent to which monetary policy had played a role as a major instrument of Government economic policy in the last period, but he did not quote this bit on page 7:</PARA>
<PARA> Excess demand and its prospective spin-off to inflation made that--</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the role of monetary policy-</PARA>

<PARA> Senator Stone subsequently quoted from a section on page 13 of the report. Economics is a wonderful study. I was about to say `science' but I think we all agree that that would be promoting it beyond its due standing. Senator Stone and Senator Button both quoted exactly the same paragraph to support their arguments. I was also going to quote-and I will do so-the paragraph on page 13 which Senator Stone quoted as some crushing indictment of the Government's policy. Those of us on the Government side who have read it and agree with it think it is a substantial, sensible contribution to an analysis of the economic situation. I will come back to that matter later. I simply refer to it to say that economics is a great discipline and perhaps a fine art. We can all interpret it differently, and that is essentially the point with which we are confronted today. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very interesting to note that this is the first occasion since the Budget on which the Opposition here in the Senate has sought to debate economic policy. Even now, those opposite do not want to talk about the Budget. After last night's speech by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Peacock, it is very easy to understand why. As Michelle Grattan said in the Age this morning, it said almost nothing new; it has got nothing to say. That is why it is saying nothing. There is a discreet silence. Where was the great savings scheme last night? I suspect that it has gone back to Brazil, where it belongs and where, to his credit, Senator Stone consigned it fairly effectively on the day of its birth. He was absolutely correct. I enjoyed hearing him say it then and he is probably quietly enjoying having the rest of Australia, except for the Leader of the Opposition, confirm his correct assessment. </PARA>
<PARA> There were no details of the policy that the Opposition is hoping to put forward some time between now and the election. If I might divert for one minute of my valuable time to give a piece of gratuitous political advice, from my experience in these matters, I say to the Leader of the Opposition: `Do not carry on with all this dodging, evading and trying to be like the Teflon man with no policies sticking to you at all'. That might have been all right in the 1960s and 1970s, but it is not appropriate in the 1980s. The public will not cop it. It is old tactics in a new era, or what Paul Keating would call old politics. </PARA>

<PARA> I turn to the question of the substance of the Reserve Bank's position and the arguments that have been put forward by Senator Stone to interpret it. The Reserve Bank correctly says in its annual report on page 13-and it is a quote that both Senator Stone and Senator Button have used today:</PARA>
<PARA>Retention of the present stance of policy should produce more significant restraint of spending as 1989-90 progresses. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not quote the rest of that paragraph, to save time, but I acknowledge the remainder of that paragraph and the proper reservations that are put in there by the Reserve Bank, with which I agree. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Stone" NAMEID="LJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator Stone</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And I agree with that sentence.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and I agree with the other two. As far as I know, everybody does. What it is saying, quite correctly, is that this is an important but necessary instrument for slowing spending with no guarantees of success. I have never heard of an economic weapon that had a guarantee of success. There is an element of risk in every economic policy decision, because the statistical base is always a bit out of date, the responses are never exactly as one predicts and, of course, exogenous variables always come in to knock the best theory. Ceteris paribus is the great excuse of all economists: if only all other things had been equal, my thesis would undoubtedly have been correct, but some external factor came in, as they always and inevitably will.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To put the worth of the Reserve Bank's assessment into perspective, when the Reserve Bank makes its prognostications for this year-and I am certainly not disparaging of the Reserve Bank, which is a very fine institution-it also acknowledges that it was wrong last year. It says on pages 11 and 12 that it substantially got it wrong, as did everybody else. It is not to be condemned for that, but it certainly means that it cannot be taken as gospel this year. It may be right; everybody else might be wrong. But it may also be as wrong this year as it was last year. For example, like everybody else, it underestimated the impact of the 1987 fall in share prices. I will not follow my colleague Senator Walsh and quote some other people's problems with that because had I been asked to quote-fortunately, in the position I then held I never was-I would have got it wrong too. Everybody that I know did. It led to some monetary policy problems, because that was the way we all thought we should appropriately respond to what seemed to be an impending crisis. The bank is saying that we are going in the right direction but that it is not risk free. </PARA>
<PARA> The Reserve Bank is saying-Senator Stone also quoted this, and I agree-that monetary policy cannot do all the job. If anybody thought that any one lever could do all the job, he would be quite profoundly wrong. There are times when there is only one lever that can do the extra bit that needs to be done. There is a need, in a situation where one wants to restrain demand and achieve a soft landing, for very tight fiscal policy. I would not have thought that a $9.1 billion surplus was too bad as a statement of tight fiscal policy. It is the biggest surplus in monetary terms-of course, that is not so meaningful; but it is the biggest surplus ever as a percentage of gross domestic product. That is a pretty good indicator not only that monetary policy is working but also that the Government is running a very tight fiscal policy. On wages policy, there has been a long period of effective wage restraint in Australia. If one wrote an economics text book, and I wrote an article myself to this effect--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If one could get what is the implication of Senator Stone's interjection, which is in the last year about a one per cent increase, that would have had some beneficial economic outcomes. So would zero inflation, or 6 per cent growth, or whatever one wants to achieve. It is easy just to pluck out a figure and say, `If I can only achieve X, things would be better'. Anybody can do that: economics, first year, Paul Samuelson. If one got it out and read it, it would tell one all those things. But it does not say how one is going to achieve it. There is no magic wand, no quick fix. That is the one thing that the Reserve Bank is telling us, to which the Opposition is not listening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report states that interest rates will not achieve a structural boom. On page 6, it states, quite correctly, that much of the investment which is going on in the investment boom is contributing to future productive capacity. The phrase `much of the investment' has been disparaged. It is true that some of it is not. The only way one can avoid that is to have some sort of regulation about where people can invest, which is not the way the Government or the Opposition, quite correctly, choose to go. I do not say that the Opposition does that, but people will always make bad investment decisions. Some people will make sensible investment decisions which are in their own interests but not in the national interest. That is always the case in a free market economy. There is no way that that can be avoided. But much of it is going to contribute to future productive capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> I divert briefly to the significance of the public-private composition of debt. I am delighted to hear what Senator Stone has said. I have always thought that it was his view that private sector borrowing and investment was inherently more efficient than public and that, therefore, there was great significance in this composition of public and private sector debt internally within Australia. I have always understood that to be his thesis. I have heard him argue it. I do not necessarily share it. If the logic of that position is followed, it means that the likely outcome of creating extra growth to meet the interest demands on private debt would be more substantial than the growth generated by public debt borrowing, which may not generate such substantial returns. I would have thought that that was the logic of his position, although not necessarily of mine. The significance of the distinction is to contrast the situation in Australia, where the substantial body of the debt is borrowing for investment-we have already had the discussion about the appropriateness of some of that investment-against the situation in some Latin American countries where the borrowing has been for recurrent government spending, which generates no new capacity to repay that debt. I do not dispute at all what the Reserve Bank says-that whoever borrows the money still has to pay it back and that it is a draw on the economy. I would not challenge that and I do not know of anybody who does. </PARA>

That is an obvious point, and I do not argue it; as far as I know, nobody does. If the Reserve Bank wants to make that point, it is allowed to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Reserve Bank says some other important things that do not seem to have been mentioned by the Opposition, although I am happy to say that the independent commentators have. The figures have been substantially interpreted in the financial media-I think correctly-as showing that the Government can expect to achieve a soft landing. There is hidden in that an interesting comment on inflation prospects. The commentators have said that the unsustainable surprisingly high rate of demand has meant that the higher value of the dollar that we had, and to some extent still have, did not translate into lower prices for imports because there was no competitive pressure to force down the prices. </PARA>
<PARA> As an aside, let me say that I am pleased that the Prices Surveillance Authority is looking at that question; however, that is not the point I am trying to make. Logically what this leads to is that when the demand falls, as it will-and there is no dispute about that either between the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Government or between the Government and the Opposition-the preconditions will exist for a greater fall in prices than might otherwise be expected because of a fall that has been artificially restrained by the demand situation. </PARA>

A substantial economic statement has been made since the Reserve Bank report was written. I am not arguing that the bank did not know those factors. That is a separate question about which I accept Senator Stone's experience. He has been on the Board of the Reserve Bank and I have not. Nevertheless this has happened since the report was written. Some other figures have come out which I suspect the Reserve Bank could not have incorporated, although I do not have first hand experience.

Although I could relate it to the Reserve Bank report, it is on a bit of a tangent so I will not pursue it.

I want to talk about the Budget and interest rates in relation to what the Reserve Bank has said. In this instance I welcome the fact that the Leader of the Opposition last night correctly acknowledged that there is no easy solution to the question of interest rates and accepts, by implication, the statement of the Reserve Bank that, irrespective of which government is in power, interest rates will stay high for quite some time to come. What `quite some time to come' means-three months, six months or nine months-nobody is prepared to say. The Reserve Bank is not saying, Mr Peacock is not saying-nor should he, I would have thought-and I am not saying. But there is substantial pressure to keep interest rates high. The Government's position is that they will not fall until the economic indicators show that the underlying economic circumstances warrant that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Reserve Bank is quite correctly saying, as are the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating), that the signs are mixed and asking whether the slowing is sufficient. Since the Reserve Bank report has come down, in a way that the bank could not conceivably have known, we have now had the June quarter national accounts showing that gross national expenditure grew by only 0.6 per cent in that quarter and that, after three-quarters of import volume growth in excess of 8 per cent, imports grew by only 1.2 per cent. Those are new elements in the equation. They do not settle the question finally but they tilt the balance in favour of saying, `We are getting the slowing down that is required at the rate for which we were hoping'. There are significant underlying reasons to suspect that demand will slow and create a substantial reduction in imports and a potential for increase in exports and it will deal with the balance of payments problems in the way in which the Government had hoped: that is, to achieve the soft landing, the slowing down, without a recession, which is what distinguishes the Government from the Opposition. That is the difference in approach. The figures are starting to exhibit the prospect of success in that approach. That explains why the Australian people have re-elected this Government twice and why I am confident they will do so again next year. </PARA>

<PARA> The repudiation by the Reserve Bank of Australia of the Hawke-Keating Government economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Like Senator Stone, I spent much of my working career in the Treasury. At that time I had a great deal of experience and observation of the relationship between the Treasury and the Reserve Bank of Australia and the way in which the Reserve Bank went about getting its messages across to the Government and to the wider financial community in Australia. In those days we tended to read between the lines a little whenever the Reserve Bank had a go at the policy of the government of the day. Officers of the the Reserve Bank were bits of Delphic oracles. They did it very subtly and very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA> All I can say is that this year's message delivered by the Reserve Bank to the Government in its annual report is delivered with all the subtlety of Delphic characteristics of a sledgehammer. This annual report would without doubt represent the most critical assessment of a government's policy in the history of the Reserve Bank. I do not know whether the Treasury, had it been given a free hand to write the Budget Speech of the Treasurer (Mr Keating), would have said the same sort of thing. It may well have done so. It may therefore be that the opening paragraph in the `Economic Comment' of David Potts in the Australian today is a very telling comment. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> For an unexpurgated version of what the Treasury really wanted to say in the Budget, read the Reserve Bank's annual report published today. </PARA>
<PARA> There is not a single word of endorsement of the Government's budgetary strategy in the Reserve Bank's annual report, since it is not the nature of central banks to criticise publicly their political masters, the silence has its own tongue. </PARA>
<PARA>In my view the tongue was very much a sledgehammer tongue, and very rightly so. Much of the criticism is very explicit and it does not need too much reading between the lines. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Stone has already drawn attention to many of the discrepancies between what the Reserve Bank had to say in its report and what the Treasurer and other Ministers of the Government have been trying to say for some time. I do not particularly want to go over that same ground today but some of the disagreements and differences of view are so telling that it is impossible not to do so. Reference should be made to them time and time again because, if there is one thing I give credit to this Government for over the last six years, it is its ability to snow the Australian electorate and many of the more intelligent members of the financial community who should have known better into thinking that it is a good economic manager. This Government and this Treasurer are without peer, at least in the postwar period, in terms of economic mismanagement. The more often the Australian public is made aware of that, the better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Stone has just said, one has only to look at some of the basic statistics and at the question of foreign debt, the biggest problem facing this nation. We have a foreign debt almost without equal in the world, and I will come back to that later. This is a debt that has gone up fivefold in the six-year reign of the Hawke Government and it has left us with a legacy which will require generations of hard effort, toil and reduced living standards to get back to an even keel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I come to some of the points in the Reserve Bank report to see how they contrast with what the Government has been saying. The bank says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the general buoyancy of the economy has been such that rates-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, interest rates-</PARA>
<PARA>may need to remain high for quite some time to achieve the desired effect. </PARA>
<PARA>It says that in the context of the need for high interest rates, given the other things that the Government has failed to do in terms of an economic policy mix. The Reserve Bank is saying quite clearly that interest rates may need to remain high for some time to achieve the desired effect, which is a slowdown in demand in the economy. What did the Treasurer say? He did not quite say that in his Budget Speech the other night. The Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>All in all, the substantial Budget surplus, the forecast slowing in demand and the expected improvement in the balance of payments, establish a framework for lower interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, it also seems to go against the statements by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on Wednesday night and by Senator Walsh yesterday morning that interest rates would fall. There is a fundamental conflict there, and there could not be a more fundamental conflict to take into account, because the Government has been allowed only one policy by the trade unions and other vested interest groups who are beholden to the Government and to whom Labor is beholden. They have refused over the last six years to allow the Government to take the hard decisions that are needed in all the other areas of economic policy, both macro-economic and micro-economic. So, there is the first conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> Then the bank goes on to make a very telling statement. It talks about the size of the task ahead of us and says it should not be underestimated. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Inflation appears set to remain above the average for industrialised countries, even if demand pressures are contained. </PARA>
<PARA>What did the Government tell us in the Budget the other night? It told us that inflation figures for the year as a whole would be about the same as in 1988-89; but the Treasurer also said that, because we were starting the year with a much higher rate than we started the year before, by June of next year the inflation rate would be much lower. In other words, he is saying that inflation will fall during the year, but he is not game to tell us what the figure is going to be at the end of June. Why is he not game to tell us what it will be at the end of June? It is because he made a monumental mistake in it last year, just as he has made monumental mistakes in virtually every economic forecast he has made in this place in the six years he has been Treasurer. In the Budget last year he forecast, if I recall rightly, that by the June quarter of this year inflation would be down to 4 1/2 per cent or thereabouts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He said 3 to 4 per cent this year. What is the inflation rate now? The inflation rate, on a fiddled basis compared with the method of calculating it a year ago, is running at a figure closer to 8 per cent. For the Treasurer to come in here and imply-without having the guts to say what the figure will be-that the figure in June next year is going to be a lot lower than in June this year is absolute nonsense and is not supported by any of the objective evidence that is available amongst the other indicators in the economy. The bank makes this point:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . it is imperative that there be a return to progress on reducing both the rate of inflation and the current account deficit over the coming year. </PARA>
<PARA>Then there is the telling sentence:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bank does not share the opinion expressed in some quarters that, since most of the debt is owed within the private sector rather than by government, it is a matter of little consequence. The extent to which resources must be diverted to its future servicing is the same whether the debt is publicly or privately owed, and the investment which it has enabled will not automatically ensure that these resources are available. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Button was asked questions on this in the Senate today. He absolutely refused even to attempt to answer those questions. He did not even seem to comprehend the basic thrust behind the question, that is, whether there is a difference in consequence between government owed foreign debt and privately owed foreign debt. The reason he was not prepared to answer that was, quite clearly, because he knew that his Prime Minister had it all wrong when in the House of Representatives on 15 June he responded to a dorothy dixer from his colleague Gordon Scholes. In response to that question the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>The other major distinction between Australia and those countries-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, others with high debt problems, such as Mexico and Argentina-</PARA>
<PARA>is that in their cases it is debt which is substantially owed by government, whereas in the composition of Australia's debt the honourable gentleman will see the total absence of any basis of fact for the frightening suggestions that are made. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, Australians now owe the rest of the world something like $7,500 to $8,000 for every man, woman and child in this country. He made the claim there absolutely without equivocation. The implication has to be that the Prime Minister of this country sees, in terms of the resources that are required to meet our foreign debt, a distinction as to whether that debt is publicly or privately owed. We all know-any economist that has done week one of an economics degree knows-that there is no fundamental difference between private debt and public debt in the sense that the resources that are required from our nation out of our own savings and production to repay that foreign debt are the same whether the debt is private or whether it is public. The bank in this paragraph is taking a very deliberate, calculated and deserved blast at the Prime Minister, who claims that he has all this great economic knowledge but has never shown one whit of evidence of that since he became Prime Minister. </PARA>

<PARA>On its own, monetary policy will not produce the longer-term structural benefits Australia is seeking. Beyond a point, it may even inhibit the structural change because of the effect of high interest rates on investment of all types. </PARA>
<PARA>If ever there were a cry from the heart of a major economic institution in this country which has a responsibility only for monetary policy, saying to the Government, `For heaven's sake, put in place some of the other policy reforms and changes that are needed to get this country back on the straight and narrow and growing again and becoming competitive in an increasingly competitive world', then this is it. It is an absolute cry from the heart. Also it is totally at odds with the recent claims of the Treasurer, including, I think, in the Budget Speech, that we are undergoing massive modernisation as a result of the policies of this Government. Nothing could be further from the truth. The simple fact is that the structural reforms needed in this country today are far greater than they were when Labor took office in March 1983. For the last six years Labor has failed to take any of the basic reforms that are needed to get this country back in the competitive shape and anti-inflation shape that it needs. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose we really have to ask ourselves whether the Treasurer knows anything about economic policy. Does he know anything when he gets off his set brief? I conclude my remarks by drawing to the attention of the Senate the Treasurer's reply to a question about how many more months of billion-dollar-plus current account deficits we can stand before interest rates have to rise further. When asked this question three or four months ago the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>Well its I mean you don't seem to understand the point I'm making to you, that is there is a structural increase in the current account coming off the net income deficit as a permanent feature, there is some sort of implication the question that once we get to some point of tightness it all sort of falls away, what falls away is the increment and the increment falls always as the merchandise trade deficit or as the merchandise trade deficit overcomes the net income to reduce the current account deficit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the benefit of those who are listening to the debate I would just like to mention that we are discussing a matter of public importance which was submitted by Senator Stone about the alleged repudiation by the Reserve Bank of Australia of the Hawke-Keating Government's economic policy. Senator Stone, of course, was referring to comments which were made in the report of the Reserve Bank of Australia for the year ending 30 June 1989. A careful reading of the section headed `The Year in Review' would hardly allow an unbiased observer to refer to the comments as a repudiation of the Hawke-Keating Government's economic policy. I suppose that Senator Stone, as a member of the National Party of Australia, is entitled to misuse the English language and refer to a repudiation but the bank's comments are about a multifaceted problem which requires a multifaceted approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The comments of the Reserve Bank can hardly be regarded as a criticism of Government policy, let alone a repudiation. It is interesting to look at some of the comments of the Reserve Bank. Some of these were looked at by Senator Stone and my colleague Senator McMullan. I cannot recall whether the previous speaker, Senator Short, referred to any of them. First I would like to quote from the report of the Reserve Bank of Australia in the section `The Year in Review'. Some of the quotes will be similar to those of Senator Stone but I draw a different interpretation from them. The report was speaking about the Hawke Government's economic policies. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> This package of policies produced a marked increase in investment spending in 1988/89. </PARA>
<PARA>I wonder what is wrong with that. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>While much of the investment should contribute to future productive capacity, some of it-in response to price signals which reflect tax and inflation considerations-was in areas not especially oriented to increasing output in the traded goods sector. More importantly, it came at a time of widespread unexpected strength of domestic spending, adding to the pressure of demand on resources. </PARA>
<PARA>In that paragraph the report talks about an increase in investment spending. There is no repudiation of our policies in that area. In another section the report says:</PARA>
<PARA> As the economy moves into 1989/90, monetary conditions are tight with short-term interest rates high in both nominal and real terms. While the indicators are still mixed, the Bank believes the current setting of monetary policy is now dampening growth of private demand. </PARA>
<PARA>If I might interpolate, that is the reason why we have high interest rates-to dampen the growth of private demand. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Higher interest rates gradually seem to be having an impact on all categories of spending. </PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what we are trying to do. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>However, the general buoyancy of the economy has been such that rates may need to remain high for some time to achieve the desired effect. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PF4">Senator COLSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was never my intention to delete some of this, and if I did delete the word `quite' I will read it again:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>However, the general buoyancy of the economy has been such that rates may need to remain high for quite some time to achieve the desired effect. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Stone referred to that and said that it was a repudiation of our policy. Nobody has said that. There is nothing different from what Government spokespersons have been saying about interest rates. Indeed, the Government has made it clear that interest rates will not fall until the economy can sustain lower rates of interest. I suppose we can all ask what `quite some time' is. Is it one month, two, three, six or 12 months? Nobody wants to make an estimation at this time. The Reserve Bank did not want to make an estimation; it just said, `quite some time'. I repeat that the paragraph says nothing different from what we on this side of the House have been saying-that interest rates will not fall until the economy can sustain lower rates of interest. To do so would be economic folly. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to quote two further paragraphs. The first was also quoted by Senator Stone. Unfortunately he neglected to quote the last sentence which makes a great deal of difference to the whole paragraph. I invited him to read the paragraph, and he did except for the last sentence. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA> On its own, monetary policy will not produce the longer-term structural benefits Australia is seeking. Beyond a point, it may even inhibit the structural change because of the effect of high interest rates on investment of all types. </PARA>
<PARA>That is quite correct, and we acknowledge that, but I shall now quote the sentence that Senator Stone neglected to add:</PARA>
<PARA>Nevertheless, monetary policy has an essential role in supporting structural reform. </PARA>
<PARA>That is hardly a repudiation of our policies. On page 13 of the report there is a section which deals with risks that can be undertaken with certain policies. Senator Stone mentioned these and talked about the risks. My colleague Senator McMullan quite properly indicated that there are risks in any strategy undertaken because of the types of data that one has to base the strategies on. But what intrigued me was that neither Senator Stone nor Senator Short indicated what their strategies might be. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to turn to something that Senator Button mentioned earlier this afternoon in Question Time. He said that our economic policy is a mix of strategies and that a multifaceted approach had to be employed. It is regrettable that the Opposition has decided to zero in on one particular area of economic activity, flog it to death and neglect other areas of a sound economy which do not suit its harping criticism of the Government-a government which has shown itself to have chalked up significant economic achievements since it was elected just over six years ago. Put plainly, the Hawke Government has the runs on the board, and those runs are in stark contrast to the sorry mess left by the previous Liberal-National coalition. It would be quite interesting to have the Reserve Bank's comments about the coalition's past performance. </PARA>
<PARA> Foreign debt received a lot of attention this afternoon. Yes, the Government is concerned about foreign debt, even though that debt is not owed by the public through the Commonwealth Government. If the Government was not concerned it would not be using high interest rates to dampen demand. It would not have the political problem of explaining to the Australian people why interest rates must remain at levels which are far greater than borrowers would prefer. This Government has not taken an easy way out. It has shown that it is prepared to make hard decisions for the well-being of the economy, even though they may be electorally unpopular in the short term. A suggestion was made this afternoon that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) believes that overseas debt is not important because it is owed principally by the private sector. The Prime Minister's comments were quite deliberately misrepresented. The question to which Senator Short referred, for readers who wish to look at it, was incorporated in Hansard earlier today. Mr Hawke said, in part:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . it is terribly regrettable that some expositions are made . . . which would imply that every Australian family and pensioners have some degree of responsibility for Australia's overseas debt. </PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to comments that every man, woman and child owes a certain amount of the debt. He went on as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the composition of Australia's net debt. Who owes it? The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics statistics-those for the December quarter of 1988-show these simple irrefutable facts. The private sector owes 61 per cent of Australia's net foreign debt; the States owe 14 per cent; and Commonwealth and State authorities owe 25 per cent. There is no net debt at all owed by the Government of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . those . . . who would say to every Australian family and every pensioner, `You have this debt hanging over you' . . . a deliberate attempt to misrepresent and intimidate the pensioners and others of this country. I repeat that the Commonwealth Government owes no debt. </PARA>
<PARA>I have quoted parts of the answer, which is a long one, and I invite others to have a look at the question and answer. It is quite clear that the Prime Minister did not say that Australia's overseas debt was unimportant because a great deal of it is owed by the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have liked to look at some of the achievements of the Hawke Government since it gained office in 1983 because the previous speaker, Senator Short, made some remarks about them. I could talk about the rise in employment during that period. I could talk about the reduction in unemployment from double digit figures to a figure of about 6.1 per cent, which is much more acceptable, although the Hawke Government does not regard that as the bottom line. I could talk about the double digit inflation which we inherited at a rate of 11.5 per cent. That is now down to 7.4 per cent-again, larger than the Government would prefer but far better than what we inherited. Inflation is mentioned in the report of the Reserve Bank, which stated the obvious, that the rate of inflation should be reduced. In relation to inflation, it was mentioned in the Budget Speech that the consumer price index in the September and December quarters this year will be high because of higher interest rates and State charges which will hold up the average figure for the year, but the quarterly figures for the second half of the year will be far lower. </PARA>
<PARA> A great deal has been said this afternoon alleging that the Government has one policy only and that that is a policy of high interest rates to dampen demand and attack the problem of overseas debt. The fact that this Government produced a Budget surplus of $9 billion is an indication that it is not looking at monetary policy only; it is looking at fiscal policy in association with monetary policy. In the short time I have remaining I say only that I regret that the Opposition, in criticising the Government, did not state its own policies so that we would have an idea of where it might go in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am astounded that two junior backbench members of the Government are all that has been put up to debate the vitally important issue of the way the Reserve Bank of Australia has damned this Government's economic policy, criticised its Budget by clear inference and repudiated some of the statements that Ministers in this place and in the House of Representatives have made about the outlook for interest rates. It is incredible that, when the Government takes this criticism so lightly and is so contemptuous of it, there is no Minister here either willing to respond or capable of responding to it. The Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, apparently has time to sit in here on duty but does not have time to take part in what is a vital debate about a massive conflict between the arms of advice that his Government has been receiving-a massive conflict, one would imagine, between what is clear and sensible advice and the advice that the Government has been preferring to follow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The clear attack by the Reserve Bank in its annual report on the policy basis of the current Budget is not a sudden one. For many months the now retired head of the Reserve Bank, Mr Johnston, has been warning of the consequences of the Government continuing its half-baked policies of relying so overwhelmingly and ridiculously on monetary policy and not doing the vital things that are needed. It is interesting to note that in this annual report the Reserve Bank keeps using words such as `it is imperative', `it is vital', `it must have top priority', `it is essential', and so on-urgent, desperate words about a whole series of policy directions that this Government has ignored in the Budget it has just brought down. Not one of the Reserve Bank's major cries for action has been followed in this latest Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of that, the Reserve Bank has clearly denied the deceptive inference by Ministers of this Government that interest rate falls are just around the corner-the sorts of falls we had before the Western Australian election, for example, when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) quite disgracefully, irresponsibly and, it turned out, falsely asserted that interest rates would fall. What do we have now? We still have the prospect of interest rates falling, according to the Treasurer (Mr Keating), the Prime Minister and Senator Button. What does the Reserve Bank say? It says that rates may need to remain high for quite some time to achieve the desired effect. It is not just a question of whether the glass is half empty or half full. The fact is that it is vital for the markets to receive a genuine indication of the Government's policies. This market is now convinced, by the babblings of the Prime Minister and Senator Button, that the Government will go soft on monetary policy in the run-up to the next election, because those Ministers themselves are talking about the prospect of lower interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us hope that the Reserve Bank remains firm and resolute in its recognition of the need for interest rates `to remain high for quite some time to achieve the desired effect'. The Reserve Bank says that that in itself is not enough, anyway. It says that a lot more is needed. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Retention of the present stance of policy-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, tight monetary policy-</PARA>
<PARA>should produce more significant restraint in spending as 1989-90 progresses. </PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Whether this will also be sufficient to lay the groundwork for winding back the current account deficit is uncertain. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, winding back the current account deficit is one of the vital, essential issues the Reserve Bank says must be addressed. It then states that the Government's current policy, in effect, leaves a serious doubt, a major doubt, over the prospect that we will be able to wind back the current account deficit. This is the vital thing that must be done, and that this Government has not addressed at all in the current Budget. The Reserve Bank continues:</PARA>
<PARA>These risks will be much greater if there is a substantial slowing of world growth and a decline in commodity prices. </PARA>
<PARA>If we look at the wool price at the moment, we will see that at recent auctions the Australian Wool Board has been having to buy enormous proportions. I wonder whether that economic problem has been written into the record $18 1/2 billion current account deficit forecast that this Government is budgeting for. </PARA>
<PARA> I am intrigued to see that the future Governor of the Reserve Bank, the present Secretary to the Treasury, has said, `Oh well, the disastrous current account figure of $1.7 billion for the latest month is in the groove'. I suppose if one is talking about records one would expect it to be in the groove. But, let us face it, we need a bit of needle here, more vigour, a bit more policy approach to fix it, rather than be content that something is in the groove for a record disaster. That is why it is absolutely vital that, as the Opposition said some months ago, the independence of the Reserve Bank be maintained. We have to recognise that the Reserve Bank has, for some time, in a quiet and modest way-with its usual conservative language-been criticising and damning this Government's indolence and incompetence in economic policy. This has made it rely almost entirely on monetary policy, in other words, high interest rates that price people out of their homes, that destroy small businesses, that increase costs and that add to inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> A headline in the Australian of 31 March 1989 stated `Reserve warns economy at risk'. An article in the Australian Financial Review headed `Time running out for trade deficit: RBA chief' states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . Mr Bob Johnston, warned yesterday that Australia was running out of time to solve its trade crisis before world growth slowed. </PARA>
<PARA>When he said that Australia was running out of time, that means that the Government was running out of time, that by doing nothing it is creating a major crisis. He said that if nothing was done there would be a brutal adjustment forced on the economy by market forces. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> He also urged greater emphasis on micro-economic reform to make the economy more productive and to reduce costs in net export industries. </PARA>
<PARA>Was that matter, dramatised by the Reserve Bank chief in May, addressed in the recent Budget? Not on your life! There is no micro-economic reform-the vital thing he said was needed. There was none of that in the Budget. There were no attempts to cut private sector costs. In fact, costs have been added by way of a huge $1.4 billion tax bill. The issues that the Reserve Bank said in its annual report were vital and essential, matters that must have top priority, have been totally ignored and were not addressed at all in the Budget, which is supposed to set the economic framework for Australia in the year ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> The Reserve Bank said that changes on the micro-economic level are essential-not just wanted or would be nice-if we are to avoid a re-emergence, in the next upswing of the problems of the past year. The report states that the vital key is inflation. What is this Budget doing about inflation? It has budgeted for a rise in inflation. In this Budget there is no cut in inflation; this Government is doing nothing about the vital issues the Reserve Bank says must be addressed. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Restructuring is much more difficult, even impossible, in a high inflation environment which destroys competitiveness and discourages saving. Altering this situation must have top priority. </PARA>
<PARA>What does the Government say? Does it say that altering the situation must have top priority? It said nothing at all in the Budget about what the Reserve Bank says must have top priority. That is why this motion notes the repudiation by the Reserve Bank of the Hawke-Keating Government's economic policy. All this Government can do is put up three backbenchers to try to pretend somehow that the words do not mean what they say. I wish them well. So far we have heard from two of them, and the Government's case is no further advanced. </PARA>
<PARA> This report is an overwhelming repudiation of the Government's policies. What concerns me is what will happen next. There has been widespread concern about changes at the top of the Reserve Bank. I note that this Reserve Bank annual report, which was no doubt largely prepared under the previous Governor, Mr Bob Johnston, has in fact been presented by the Deputy Governor, Mr M. J. Phillips. Mr Phillips has been bypassed for the job of Governor of the Reserve Bank. He has been pushed aside by this Treasurer. When one sees the freedom of thought and expression evident in this report-the only report he will present-one understands why this arrogant, dominant, dictatorial Treasurer will not have a bar of a man such as Mr Phillips running the Reserve Bank. Mr Phillips is prepared to disagree with this Government and his Board is prepared to go along with him and disagree with this Government and state clearly why it is wrong, why its policies are not working and how this excessive reliance on monetary policy being forced on the bank by an incompetent and inept government is in fact counter-productive. The report states in effect that in the short run this heavy reliance on monetary policy may have perverse effects on the balance of payments if higher interest rates produce an exchange rate appreciation. Of course, that has happened. It also states:</PARA>
<PARA> On its own, monetary policy will not produce the longer-term structural benefits Australia is seeking. </PARA>
<PARA>The Reserve Bank says structural change is vital and that micro-economic reform is essential. But this Government has been relying on monetary policy. The Reserve Bank says that monetary policy will not produce the structural benefits Australia is seeking. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it may even inhibit the structural change because of the effect of high interest rates on investment of all types. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Government's policies, as in the Budget, are criticised not only for not addressing the major issues but also for damaging the objectives that the Reserve Bank says are absolutely vital. There is a freedom of spirit in the Reserve Bank annual report. Will that remain the case?</PARA>
<PARA> I have been very disappointed indeed to learn that the new Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Bernie Fraser, a man for whom I have the highest regard as Secretary to the Treasury, seems to me to have become involved in far too much of a `Canberra view'. It may be a comfortable Keating view but it is a Canberra view of economic forecasting and what the Government should do. On Wednesday, Mr Bernie Fraser, the Treasury Secretary, who has been closely involved in giving advice to Mr Keating-advice that, in so many key areas, has been proved dramatically wrong; that is, if it was his advice and the Government did take it-said that Tuesday's Budget could lead to a reduction in home loan interest rates and that it had put in place a framework that should allow the rates, now at the 17 1/2 per cent mark, to fall. Is it not interesting that Mr Fraser, the next Governor of the Reserve Bank, talks about interest rates falling, but the Reserve Bank talks about keeping them high for quite some time-an incredible difference of emphasis. The fact is that there are real concerns about the freedom and independence of the Reserve Bank. This annual report dramatises how vital it is that the Reserve Bank should remain independent and how wrong it was of the Government to impose the Treasury Secretary-in other words, Mr Keating's top adviser-onto the Reserve Bank Board. One hopes that there will be no diminution. I assure the Government that the Opposition and the business community overall will be keeping a very close eye on the activities of the Reserve Bank to see whether this freedom will be snuffed out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I do; I do have a tertiary education in economics, for the honourable senator's benefit-and I think the terms of the matter of public importance are a gross overstatement, or even a distortion, of the thrust of that report. Even if the report did, to any extent, appear to repudiate the Government's economic policy, as Senator Button pointed out in Question Time earlier today, that report was clearly written some weeks ago. Apart from the fact that it is the report of the year to 30 June 1989-that is, six weeks ago-as Senator Button said, the material was probably at the printers for some weeks. It is not in any way a response to the Government's economic policy, as expressed in this week's Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I address any specific points relating directly to this matter of public importance, I would like to say that I remember very clearly the human effects of the economic policies of the Fraser Government, to which I understand Senator Stone would have been a major contributor. Inflation averaged 10 per cent over the seven years of that Government and unemployment was at its highest level since the 1930s. In the 1930s much less was known than in later years about ways which were available to address that problem effectively. As a student counsellor in a high school during those Fraser years, I saw at first hand the effect on families of that rising level of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area near Melbourne where I worked there was at one time during that period a rate of one available job for every 32 school leavers. Our achievements in the area of employment alone are truly a matter of great public importance-reducing the national unemployment rate to around 6 per cent and, in my own State of Victoria, under a responsible Labor government, down to around 3 per cent. When walking around the streets of Melbourne and the industrial suburb where I live I have noticed vacancy signs, which are things that have not been seen for many years. Since we came to office in 1983 the teenage unemployment rate has more than halved, from 27 per cent to 14 per cent in June this year. That is a matter of great public importance to anyone who cares about the future of young Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Stone alleged at the beginning of his speech this afternoon that Senator Button had `poured scorn on the Reserve Bank Board report'. I am sure an examination of the Hansard record would show that Senator Button did no such thing today. He merely pointed to the fact that it was written before the Budget and could not, therefore, have taken into account the policy expressed in the Budget or in the details of the Budget figures. Importantly, the Reserve Bank Board could not have known the magnitude of the Budget surplus; it could not have known the extent of the surplus position of the public sector borrowing requirement without knowing the details of Budget outlays. Nor could the Reserve Bank have known that the June quarter national accounts would have shown that gross national expenditure grew by only 0.6 per cent or that the growth rate of imports would fall from over 8 per cent to 1.2 per cent in the June quarter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Reserve Bank in its report correctly drew attention to what it saw as risks to the present situation in the world economy. Of course, the Government is aware of those risks and has acted accordingly. For example, the report rightly draws attention to the risk of a decline in commodity prices. As a country which is still very dependent on commodity exports to balance our imports, Australia has acted to minimise these risks by taking action to reduce the current account while the world economy is relatively buoyant. The Government is also addressing that problem in another way through its efforts to reduce distortions in world markets which result from the excessively protectionist policies of the United States and some of the countries of Europe. In a recent visit overseas, I found international recognition of what Australia is trying to do in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The Reserve Bank report, on pages 12 and 18, also refers to the economic risks arising from an increase in demand resulting from an increase in private consumption. It rightly identifies that the growth in private consumption is linked to increased employment. Surely the Opposition does not suggest that this trend should be reversed. Maybe it does. The Reserve Bank gives the figure of a 4 1/2 per cent increase in employment in the year 1988-89 and notes the fall in the unemployment rate from 7 1/4 per cent to 6 per cent over the same period. The balance of payments position must be viewed in this context. </PARA>
<PARA> The Reserve Bank report also points to the sizeable reduction in that part of the external debt which is owed by the Government. I believe it is a pity that the Opposition does not encourage its supporters in the private sector to do likewise. The Reserve Bank report on page 17 states:</PARA>
<PARA>Domestic producers faced high levels of demand and were under little pressure to restrain costs and prices. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, I hope that the Opposition may encourage its business supporters to look at their efficiency and their pricing policies so that something can be done to reduce the level of inflation. What is its alternative economic policy? Unfortunately yesterday's House of Representatives Hansard is not yet available, so I have not had the benefit of reading Mr Peacock's speech of last evening. But from what I have heard about it, it offered nothing of substance-once again feathers without meat. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Was it? Well, that is not unexpected. Importantly, the Hawke Labor Government's economic agenda has directly complemented our social agenda, unlike the economic agenda of the previous Government, which made major cuts in areas which directly affected ordinary people, particularly low income earners-cuts in education, in health, in child-care and housing-in an unsuccessful attempt to correct the economy. People suffered needlessly in those years. I think the Opposition will find that the Australian public accord the greatest importance to the measures in the Budget which will assist them now and in the future, such as the retirement incomes policy and the youth strategy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will quote briefly from the Budget briefing, which is available to all honourable senators opposite. I sincerely hope that they have read it. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The 1989-90 Budget is directed at protecting the social and employment gains of the past six years by easing Australia's over-heated economy down to a more sustainable pace. In other words, the Budget will secure a `soft landing'. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not what we would have expected from a government composed of the people opposite. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, the Budget furthers the Government's ambitious program of far-reaching economic reforms. It meets the challenge of Australia's ageing population by establishing a comprehensive policy to encourage today's working Australians to save now for their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA>In doing so the Budget provides genuine incentives to stimulate private savings, helping Australia in a real way to close its savings imbalance. </PARA>
<PARA> The immediate problem the Budget tackles is that in 1988-89 spending in the Australian economy grew much faster than what the nation produced. Some of this spending-by business on investment equipment-will generate big returns in future years. But the short term result was a widening gap in our balance of payments. Because the nation had to borrow to fill that gap, interest rates rose. </PARA>
<PARA> Three key elements of the Budget establish a framework for lower interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>- an increase in the surplus from $5,899 million to $9,122 million, further building public savings;</PARA>
<PARA>- a slowing in spending growth in the economy from 7 3/4 per cent last year to 2 per cent this year. </PARA>
<PARA>- an improvement in the balance of payments as 1989-90 progresses. </PARA>
<PARA>The Reserve Bank report states that the size of the task facing the Government in managing the economy `should not be underestimated'. The Government is certainly not underestimating that task. I believe that our record shows that we recognise that task and that we are equal to it. </PARA>
