<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>The Honourable President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA> Medicare cannot pretend to be a Universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hardest hit by proposals to restrict access to items 6469, 274 and 275 on the Medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners humbly pray and request that the Senate will vote against any attempt to restrict access to abortion or any abortion-related items on the Medicare schedule.</PARA>

<TITLE>Company Tax Collection System</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's Budget decision to change the company tax collection system will be a crippling blow to many small businesses, already suffering as a direct result of the Hawke Labor Government's high interest rate policy.</PARA>
<PARA> The earlier remittance of company tax payments to the Government will substantially reduce the cash-flow position of thousands of small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA> Many small businesses will be driven under as a result of the Government's decision-unable to find funds for both tax commitments and new stock, only able to borrow at record high interest rates and unable to claim any tax relief on such borrowings to meet their tax commitment.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's proposed changes to the company tax collection system has only been introduced as a greedy grab for more tax revenue.</PARA>
<PARA> The small business community would prefer the Government to completely abandon the proposal rather than make only minor alterations to the original Budget decision, which are not likely to alleviate the situation to any significant extent.</PARA>

<PARA> The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That we the undersigned, having great concern that Canberra is now the ``Porn Capital'' of Australia and because of the spread of moral pollution in our nation, call upon the Federal Government to introduce immediate legislation in support of existing State Legislation:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. To provide strict controls over the importation, production, sale, hire or mailing of video-cassettes particularly in the A.C.T., with the open sale and/or hire of only G, PG, and M-rated video cassettes; and the total prohibition of the sale or hire of R rated video-cassettes, so that R rated films can only be viewed in an adult theatre by persons over 18 years. We totally reject the concept of ``X'' rated or ``N.V.E.'' rated video-cassettes, which would allow the legal sale and hire of hard-core pornographic videos for viewing in the homes of our nation, which would endanger our children; and</PARA>
<PARA> 2. To give whole-hearted support to Senator Walters's Private Member's Bill to implement the recommendations of the Select Committee on Videos; and</PARA>
<PARA> 3. To dramatically improve the Federal Attorney-General's Guidelines for Classification of Video tapes/discs, which restrict the importation, production, sale or hire, screening in private homes and especially mailing by Australia Post, so as to include the total prohibition of any pornographic, obscene or blasphemous video cassette, or film which exploits or degrades women as sex objects, or which contain child pornography, bestiality, sodomy, group sex or violent sex acts with women, such as rape and pack rape, sadism and torture, etc., or which promotes homosexuality or lesbianism;</PARA>

<PARA>The proposed reforms will:</PARA>
<PARA> Restrict the legitimate use of credit checking by businesses which sell/supply goods and or services to their customers on credit terms.</PARA>
<PARA> The proposals/reforms will prevent businesses from determining the solvency of their customers and will increase the financial risk of credit providers, leading to an increase in company liquidations and individual bankruptcies.</PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short statement of the Committee's concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Health Insurance (Vocational Registration of GP's) Regulations, as contained in Statutory Rules 1989 No. 270 and made under the Health Insurance Act 1973</PARA>
<PARA> These Regulations provide for entry on, and removal from, the Vocational Register of Practitioners. Only general practitioners on the Register are entitled to use certain new item numbers in the Medical Benefits Schedule. The Committee was concerned at the lack of external, independent review of the merits of discretions which may be exercised pursuant to the Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> Regulation 14 provides that the Minister may terminate the appointment of a member of an Eligibility Committee or an Appeal Committee, which are committees established for the purposes of the Regulations, ``for misbehaviour or physical or mental incapacity''. Each of these grounds contains an element of subjective judgment and there appears to be no avenue for independent review of this decision. Membership of such Committees does not have financial advantages but, as all members are themselves medical practitioners, removal on any of these grounds would be a very serious matter. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, all the review process in relation to entry on, or removal from, the Register appears to be internal. There seems to be no external avenue of review of the merits of decisions either for refusing to admit a practitioner to the Register or for removing a practitioner from the Register. </PARA>
<PARA> Practitioners who are on the Register have substantial reputation and professional prestige. Removal from the Register, on the other hand, would involve personal stigma. The Committee believes that in such cases an external right of review, possibly after internal procedures, should be provided. The Committee has often expressed its preference for such review to be conducted by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which is an external, independent, expert body able to underwrite the fairness and integrity of in-house procedures. The Committee will accept that an internal appeal mechanism is more appropriate than external merits review only in exceptional circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>Migration Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1989 No. 267 and made under the Migration Act 1958</PARA>
<PARA> These Regulations provide for the payment of a fee for a temporary entry permit. Refugees, persons under a special humanitarian program and the spouse or child of an applicant are expressly exempt from payment of the fee. The Committee has no concerns with these objective classes of exemption. </PARA>
<PARA> The Regulations also exempt, however, ``a class of persons in respect of whom the Minister has determined in writing that no fee is to be payable''. This is an open-ended discretion with no criteria to limit and guide its exercise and apparently no provision that classes of persons determined by the Minister should be subject to tabling and disallowance in Parliament. The power to exempt a ``class'' from an obligation, or to grant some other privilege, or to impose a burden on a ``class'', is a typically legislation function and, as such, should be subject to disallowance. If such a power is in respect of individuals rather than a class, then a right of external review of the merits of an adverse decision affecting an individual, would be appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was also concerned that the power may be subject to delegation. If this was the case the Committee would be particularly concerned. While a Minister is subject to personal questioning of his or her actions in Parliament, a delegate is not subject to such rigorous scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA>Quarantine (Animals) Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1989 No. 272 and made under the Quarantine Act 1908</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from correcting a small grammatical error, the sole purpose of these Regulations is to remove mandatory quarantine Forms from the Regulations themselves and thus not only from the possibility of Parliamentary disallowance but even from tabling for the information of Parliament. In addition, the Forms in future will not be approved even by the Minister, but by a public official, the Director of Quarantine. Failure to use the forms is punishable by a fine of $1,000. The Explanatory Statement only advises that ``There is now a need to update these forms to bring them into line with current forms design. To effect this and to facilitate any future changes which may become necessary, amendment of the Quarantine (Animals) Regulations is desirable to enable a form to be revised without amendment of the Regulations''. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has requested a full explanation from the Minister as to why the amendments cannot be made by Regulation and why it is ``desirable'' to exclude Parliament from a full supervisory role in respect of the Forms in favour of instruments made by a public official. </PARA>
<PARA>Interpretation Ordinance 1989, as contained in Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands Ordinance No. 3 of 1989 and made under the Ashmore and Cartier Islands Acceptance Act 1933</PARA>
<PARA> The concerns of the Committee relate to the legislative policy which determined the form of this Ordinance. The Committee is not concerned with the policy merits of instruments it examines, restricting its scrutiny to matters of personal liberty or Parliamentary propriety. Where the legislative policy behind a particular instrument affects its terms of reference, however, then the Committee will raise its concerns with the Minister in the same way as with any other instrument. </PARA>
<PARA> In this case the legislative policy is the form of drafting of the Ordinance which makes it extremely difficult to ascertain the state of the law. The drafting policy of the Ordinance is to incorporate substantial provisions of other legislation from four separate Commonwealth, State and Territory jurisdictions rather than draft a separate ``stand alone'' instrument. This is generally effected by mere reference to section numbers of particular instruments. Sometimes these provisions are amended without any discrete reference to the substance of the Acts which are so affected. In addition, most of the incorporated material applies as amended from time to time. The result is a confusing instrument which requires substantial legal research to ascertain the state of the law. The Committee is also concerned at four definitions in the Ordinance which appear to be circular. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill proposes amendments to the Excise Tariff Act 1921, to incorporate into that Act an excise tariff proposal tabled in this Parliament during the last sittings, and to effect a minor technical amendment to take account of the fact that the Australian Capital Territory has attained self-government. </PARA>
<PARA>Liquefied Petroleum Gas</PARA>
<PARA> The excise duty for naturally occurring LPG is adjusted six-monthly on 1 April and 1 October each year in accordance with the Government's LPG excise policy announced in April 1980. The excise rate is calculated as 60 per cent of the amount by which the realised price for naturally occurring LPG exceeds $147 a tonne. The realised price is based on the weighted average of the prices received from exports and local sales of LPG during the immediately preceding six months. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the petroleum excise arrangements introduced from 1 July 1987, LPG produced from onshore fields is exempt from excise, so the excise now only applies to offshore fields-that is Bass Strait. No excise is payable on refinery-produced LPG. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 4 of the Bill will amend the excise rate with effect from 1 April 1989, from $6.25 a kilolitre to a rate of free. The decrease reflects the fact that the excise threshold of $147 a tonne has not been reached on average over the immediately preceding six months. </PARA>
<PARA>Minor Technical Amendment</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity has also been taken to effect a minor technical amendment to Item 10 (a) of the schedule to the Act. This amendment concerns the treatment under the act of government business enterprises established by the Australian Capital Territory Government, now that the Territory has attained self-government, and is explained in more detail in the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>FINANCIAL IMPACT STATEMENT</PARA>
<PARA>Liquefied Petroleum Gas</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government will not raise any revenue from excise on naturally occurring LPG for the six months from 1 April 1989. With a zero excise rate to apply from 1 April total LPG excise receipts for the 1988-89 financial year are estimated at $11m compared with receipts of $19.8m in 1987-88.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night a letter to Senator Macklin was tabled. It identified the need to clarify what appeared to be a misunderstanding in relation to totally and permanently incapacitated veterans. Where a veteran dies in the circumstances described in the letter to Senator Macklin, his wife would be entitled to a lump sum equal to seven times the combined service or age pension which the couple was receiving at the time of his death, less any ongoing age or service pension paid to the widow. As at 1 January 1990, this would be up to $1,247.40.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second entitlement is a lump sum equal to six times 100 per cent of the general rate of disability pension as at the date of royal assent of the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1989, which would be $1,126.20, the war widows pension, currently $291.20 per fortnight, and a funeral benefit of $550. In relation to the question Senator McLean asked last night, I think I responded on advice from the officer that there was a misunderstanding, either in relation to the interpretation in the letter, or in relation to the article the honourable senator quoted from Age Pension News. But that is the advice the officers have come to me with this morning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Another area of concern, particularly among Vietnam veterans, is the ongoing vexed question of agent orange and exposure to chemicals in Vietnam. I know that the Minister and advisers are well aware of the fact that there has been a considerable shift in the climate in North America according to North American studies. North American legal findings in the last year or so have given rise to a series of judgments which have been substantially in favour of veterans and which have substantially shifted the frequency of compensation in favour of veterans. In view of the fact that what happens in North America has in the past been the yardstick upon which the Department and governments have taken positions here, can the Minister give me some guidance as to whether there is acknowledgment in the appropriations that these shifts are occurring? Could the Minister also advise me as to what level of appropriation has specifically been directed to the Dapsone study and in what timeframes it is anticipated by the Department that the Dapsone study will come to conclusion and, therefore, be in place as a policy base?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Budget provides $325,000 for the study. It is to start before Christmas and it will take approximately three months. I am well aware of Senator McLean's interest in and concern about this area because he has raised a number of questions about it in the chamber before. The Dapsone study was recommended by the Evatt Royal Commission on the Use and Effects of Chemical Agents on Australian Personnel in Vietnam. In fulfilment of the Minister's undertaking on the Royal Commission recommendation, the Department of Veterans' Affairs asked the National Health and Medical Research Council for advice on the study. The matter was referred to the Australian Institute of Health, which has agreed to investigate whether it would be able to carry out the study.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr Donovan has been selected to carry out the investigation. This has been based on a preliminary investigation of the study's feasibility and likely costs. An appropriation was made for the conduct of the study during this current financial year, as I have indicated. A detailed protocol for the study is presently being developed. The Minister has stated that ex-service organisations will be given the opportunity to comment on the protocol before its finalisation. As with previous epidemiological studies relating to Vietnam veterans, the Minister will be appointing a scientific advisory committee of distinguished scientists to provide him with independent advice to guarantee the objectivity and scientific validity of the study. The Minister has asked for nominations from the National Health and Medical Research Council, the Australian Epidemiology Association, the Australian Public Health Association and the Australian Statistical Society. </PARA>

A growing interest there concerns the conclusions regarding the effects of 2,4-D, which has been a very widely used chemical in Australia, in civil and commercial use as well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Estimates Committee A in dealing with the parliamentary departments generally, and in particular the Department of the Senate, found several matters that were of some considerable concern. Concern was expressed that the method of setting the appropriations for the Senate itself could lead to the Senate's business being curtailed by simply not sufficient money being allocated for the running of the Senate. Indeed, the Clerk, in answer to a specific question from me, said that the time could be reached in the future when the appropriation that was fixed for the Senate might be insufficient to allow proper staffing for committees which had been established by the Senate, and therefore the Senate could be unable to carry out its work properly if appropriations were not sufficient. This is of a good deal of concern to members of the Committee, and to some members in particular.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the wording in the report, I think it is quite significant to say that Opposition senators did not feel it necessary on this occasion to prepare a reservation as has been necessary after previous Estimates Committee hearings, because there was a commitment made by both Government senators and Opposition senators as to the serious nature of the matters that are raised through the report. So the fact that both Government and Opposition senators are in agreement on these matters I think is most important. I ask the Minister whether he shares the concern of the Committee that there is a risk-that in relation to the Executive arm of government appropriating funds for the Senate, the time could come when we are curtailed in our funding because of the inappropriateness of those appropriations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe there is absolutely no substance to what Senator Bishop suggests may be a rationale behind government. Whether that is the result of actions is a separate matter. There is no desire by the Executive wing of government to curtail the activities of this chamber or the Department of the Senate or in any way to restrict its operations. I can only say that on the basis of my own experience in the Budget process, which is not as extensive as that of some. The fact is that no-one likes stringent fiscal times. The amount of gross domestic product devoted to government expenditure, or expenditure by this Parliament in the ultimate, has been reducing, and everyone and every department has had to share some of those cuts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If anything, I think it could be argued that the Senate in general has fared better than the House of Representatives in terms of funding. That is certainly an argument I have heard put with some bitterness from the other place, that in fact funding here in the Senate has held up better than it has in the House of Representatives. It raises the age-old question of the Executive versus the Parliament relationship. It raises the question of whether Parliament should be able to allocate its own money-which I have never agreed with and could never agree with-and have just a carte blanche arrangement. Also, probably the whole argument has been somewhat exacerbated by the move to this place, where the running costs are inevitably higher in an architectural place such as this, with costs being higher than original estimates, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> Getting back to the central point, it is not the intention of the Executive, of the Government, to squeeze the Senate. If the Senate has to make its contribution to economic restraint, it should; it should not be exempt. It would be very strange if the Senate allocation was increasing in real terms when everyone else's was reducing in real terms. That would be a very strange thing. Again, I warn Senator Bishop, in a friendly way, that this sort of incestuous concentration on our own role sometimes does distort public policy and too often diverts our attention from what the real issues are. Senator Bishop has asked me whether that is the intention. No, it is not. She then asked me to make a judgment about whether it could ever happen. Although anything could happen, I do not think it will be the case that the Senate Department would be so constricted. </PARA>
<PARA> I also have to say that this place is not run efficiently. This Parliament is not run efficiently. It was only a year ago that we had five departments-five little departments. We have 17 departments running the whole of Australia, and this place has to have five departments to run it, with five departmental heads, all jealous of each other, with no-one wanting to concede an inch. It reminds me a little of the amalgamation of councils in Victoria; the only ones ever in favour of it are those that would absorb others. That is the problem we have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not suggesting that at all. Let me get back to the point. There is a responsibility-and it does not devolve just to this chamber, by the way; it would be very unfair to say that-to have this overall building and Parliament run with some efficiency. I think there have been enormous attempts by the Presiding Officers and their advisers to get more efficiency into the system. Of course they will make mistakes from time to time, and those mistakes will probably be criticised by Estimates Committee A.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But I have to pay tribute to President Sibraa, Speaker Child and Speaker Child's successor for attempting to get this whole place to run more efficiently. It must not just be a big building on the hill at which we throw a bucket of money every now and again. On the other hand, it also has to have enough money to operate efficiently. Do not tell me that this place operates efficiently when, on the sixth day of debate on the Estimates in the Committee of the Whole, we are going through a perverse and perverted process, and when 90 per cent of the questions that should have been asked during the sittings of the Estimates committees are being asked in the Committee of the Whole. It has become a joke. It was a crisis when it was thought that the Supply Bills would not be passed by 11 November. We are now approaching 30 November and there is no certainty that we will get the Estimates through by tomorrow night. </PARA>
<PARA> I have even heard it said by some honourable senators opposite that, because we are not jumping up and down, we are not serious. That does not happen to be my style-it was the style of Senator Gareth Evans. Seriously, if this chamber and the other chamber want more money, a bit of productivity would not hurt now and then. We are approaching 30 November and we have hardly passed a Bill. The only reason we have passed a few Bills-and I have to thank honourable senators for that-is that we are coughing them through on a Thursday at lunchtime. </PARA>
<PARA> Getting back to the point, I think that there is a more efficient way of running this place and that it could be run on the basis of one or two departments, with all the economies that that would bring. The real problem is that no-one wants to give up his turf. The Department of the Parliamentary Library, the Joint House Department and all the rest of them were very sensitive when these issues came up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer to the points that the Minister has just raised. I agree with him that this whole question raises the problem of the theory of the separation of powers, which breaks down under our parliamentary system because parliament represents the people and the executive government represents what, in the olden days, used to be the king. The parliament was put in place to restrict the powers of the king. Unfortunately, under the Westminster system the parliament, in effect, was corrupted when the role of the king was taken over by certain members of parliament who became the executive officers. So the people, when they vote for the Parliament, think they are voting to put into Canberra or Westminster, or wherever, their representatives but in fact end up, in the case of the House of Representatives, electing an electoral college that then chooses the government of the day. That government of the day purports to be the representative of the people but in fact is standing in place of the king or a dictator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I realise that that raises problems. I am not suggesting that there ought not to be more efficiencies in this Parliament; clearly there should be. But, I make the following points to the Minister: first, the creation of megadepartments is not necessarily the way to go to achieve efficiency. Sometimes, it is more efficient to have small departments with a degree of actual responsibility, rather than trying to create some megadepartment. Salary structure must be considered. The salary structures of those administering small departments should not be the same as those who administer some megadepartments. That is one way of looking at the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister seems to confuse the question of the efficiency of administering a department with the ability to get Bills through this place. Of course, there is no relationship between--</PARA>

If the Minister reads page 3 of the report of the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing he would see what has gone wrong. The Senate set up that Committee to resolve these matters. The Committee met and came up with a sum of money that it believed was necessary. It may have been an ambit claim; it may have been too much. The problem is with the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh). Senator Ray might say that in the Budget processes the Government is trying to be fair to the Parliament. But the truth is that the Minister for Finance ignored the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing. He treated them with the usual contempt with which he treats everything to do with this Parliament. Senator Walsh is interested only in executive government. He is not interested in the Parliament in any way.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> On the day before these matters were to be considered, over six weeks after this Committee had reported and far too late for there to be any consultation, Senator Walsh wrote a letter to the President saying, `We are going to cut $1.8m off your expenditure'. It was not `Please, Mr President, come and talk to me. We think we ought to cut $1.8m off your expenditure', but simply a blank statement saying that the Government intended to reduce the expenditure by $1.8m.

I am saying to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs that this is no way for the Executive government and the Parliament's Committee to resolve the problem of the conflict which occurs under the Westminster system and to which the Minister has already referred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is needed is consultation. Ultimately, what had to happen was that Senator Button, representing the Government, and Senator Chaney, representing the Opposition, had to get together and ask the Minister for Finance whether he would please meet with them and with the President in order to resolve these difficulties. At one stage it looked as though Senator Walsh was going to ignore Senator Button, his Leader, and Senator Chaney and not meet with them. Finally, as a last desperate gamble, he did meet with them and they were able to confer and come to a resolution of the problems. If Senator Walsh had done that six weeks earlier there would not have been the conflict which is reported in the Committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Minister that the Government is absolutely without a defence in this matter. It is the Government's President who was trying to negotiate with Senator Walsh. I have no doubt that he telephoned the office of Senator Walsh and probably tried to speak to him at various places, but Senator Walsh ignored him because of the feelings that Senator Walsh has about the Parliament in that, as far as he is concerned, if he were to cut all the expenditure of the Parliament he would have done his job. That is not the way to resolve these situations. That is why we will be moving the motion proposed by my colleague, Senator Crichton-Browne-and I hope the Australian Democrats are listening to this debate, because I hope they will support the motion-confirming the October 1985 statement passed by the Parliament that there must be negotiations, and that the Government must face up to its responsibilities in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a couple of points I would like to make in supporting the remarks made by my colleague Senator Lewis. Firstly, nobody in this place-particularly on this side of the chamber-has any argument with the need for efficiency or for things to be done in a more efficient manner. However, one of the unfortunate things about democracy is that it does get in the way of the Executive government. It does involve the people and it does involve having proper forums where work can be carried out for and on behalf of the electorate. It is also important to point out that the Clerk, in giving his evidence, did not ask for additional money; he was simply pointing out that the situation could arise where the Senate would simply not have sufficient money to carry out its task because of the action of Executive Government. I do not think we have heard anything which says that may not occur at some time in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne's motion reaffirms the position reached in 1985-which is a time before I came into the Parliament-and here we are, about to enter the 1990s, still in this unfortunate situation. I again stress the important point that the report of Estimates Committee A was a joint report by Government and Opposition senators. At page 3, it simply states:</PARA>
<PARA>Several Senators expressed the view that the Senate cannot be master of its own destiny if it does not have the ability to raise its own funds. The constitutional situation is that appropriations have to be introduced by Government and these appropriations have to be approved by both Houses of Parliament. It therefore follows that an appropriation for the Senate has to be determined by agreement between the Executive Government and both Houses of Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly the point that Senator Lewis was making when he said that there was no consultation as to the method of making this place, in the Minister's terms, more efficient, or whether the cut which Senator Lewis mentioned was justified. It was simply a statement which came down from on high which said, `This shall be so'. The fact that there is an Appropriation and Staffing Committee in existence, which is charged with the task of entering into those proper negotiations, and which has been totally ignored in this situation, is yet another example of the arrogance of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister has said, here we are, at this time in the month, still debating the Estimates. I intend to restrict myself basically to the report which has been put down in this place, but the point is that, if democracy is to work, perhaps greater attention should be given to drawing up the sitting program at the beginning of the year. It was a long time before we came back at the beginning of this calendar year. It could be that we ought to have been sitting for longer periods earlier in the year so that we would not have got into this ridiculous situation which has occurred since I was elected to this place in 1987. The problem seems to me to be badly managed time. The Government has care and control of that and I would be pleased to see it more efficiently handled. </PARA>

If the Opposition ever wins government it will find it very frustrating sitting here, unable to get legislation passed and having legislation with start-up dates which become inoperative. That is a debate I will have another day, and maybe I was at fault for introducing the matter originally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Bishop and Senator Lewis have stressed the point about negotiations. I am hardly the one to discourage negotiations between the relevant people and the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) over the appropriations. I think that point is well taken. In the normal course of events those sorts of negotiations are desirable, but I do not believe that this chamber should have the right to set its own expenditure. It really does not specifically raise the money. I do not know how such a system could be controlled. </PARA>

That is the difference. I would not trust us, sometimes, to set our own expenditure levels. I think that would leave us open to an enormous public attack.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nevertheless, in this debate so far Senator Bishop and Senator Lewis have indicated that they are unhappy with the way the last round occurred. Obviously, I will draw that to the attention of the Minister, and I do not suppose it will come as a surprise to him. It is probably a little unfair to single out just the Minister for Finance, because these things must go through a Budget process to some extent. If there is anything wrong-and I am not conceding there is-the blame would have to be shared among the Executive rather than just one Minister who is the target of all criticism. If honourable senators think their criticisms are tough, they should come and listen to the other Ministers when they talk about the Minister for Finance. There is only one thing worse than the Minister for Finance and it is not that one. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate reaffirms the resolution of 2 December 1985 relating to the determination of appropriations for the Senate, and calls upon the President, the Leader of the Government in the Senate and the Minister for Finance to observe and comply with the procedures set out in the resolution. </PARA>
<PARA>I am obliged to move that motion because the terms of the resolution of Estimates Committee A on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1985 reaffirmed the provisions of the resolution in the Senate on 25 March 1982. Those provisions have, thus far, been totally ignored by the Government, more particularly, the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh). I want to pick up one point that was made by Senator Robert Ray. I am not sure what caused him to meander off on the track of amalgamating the departments of the Parliament, but he will perhaps remember that a Bill was introduced-the Public Service (Parliamentary Departments) Bill of 1988-into the House of Representatives which was designed to amalgamate the three parliamentary departments. Senator Ray says that that is a step towards cost saving and greater efficiency. I just remind the Committee of what was stated in the explanatory memorandum to that Bill:</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments are not expected to have a major effect on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue. Some minor savings are expected from the amalgamation of the 3 parliamentary departments, but the amount is not easily quantifiable.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there was to be an amalgamation of three departments with no savings. As the President and perhaps honourable senators will well know, there have been a number of inquiries into the efficiency and effectiveness of the Parliament and the cost of running the Parliament. But not one report of any commissioned inquiry has demonstrated any savings, least of all efficiency savings. I say to Senator Ray that it seems from the argument that he has put forward thus far that he thinks accountability ought to be substituted for efficiency. The truth is that democracy is not necessarily the most efficient way of running a country or a society. </PARA>

But the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing has been charged with certain responsibilities which include setting the expenditure levels for the Senate. A motion agreed to by Estimates Committee A in 1985 stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>the estimates of expenditure for the Senate to be included in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill shall continue to be those determined by the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Ray says that he does not agree with that. But that motion was moved by Senator Richardson when he was Chairman of Estimates Committee A in 1985, carried unanimously and agreed to by the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, and Senator Button. The resolution sets out the very clear mechanics in the event that there are disagreements between the Government and the Senate as to the ultimate level of funding required and the level of appropriations submitted to the Senate is less than those, in the view of the Committee, required for the minimum functioning of the Senate. We will watch with considerable care to see what levels of additional appropriations are submitted in due course. </PARA>

I think the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) was right when he said there were some difficulties in reaching a base figure when we moved from the old Parliament House to the new Parliament House as far as the appropriations for the Senate were concerned. I just want to refer briefly to a meeting that took place between me, Senator Chaney, Senators Macklin and Coates, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, and the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh. I thought that that meeting was quite productive. It probably took place too late for any great improvements on this year's appropriations, but it did take place and, arising out of it, the allocation that we were requesting for additional equipment, that we sought in the appropriations, has been agreed to.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The first problem is that the responsibility to raise taxes and to bring Bills into this Parliament which permit the disbursement of public money lies with the government of the day. That is a constitutional matter. No-one from the Opposition is suggesting that that should be changed. On the other hand, there is the responsibility of the Parliament to act as a parliament, as a legislature and at times as a check on the government. At times its role is to be unpopular with the government. Senator Ray nods and concedes that. There is always a risk. The risk has been above the table and made apparent during the life of this Government by some of the comments of the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, who, when he has been a bit cross, has actually implied that the Senate may not get the money that it needs to do certain things. </PARA>

<PARA> The Senate directed itself to this matter and Senator Crichton-Browne has pointed out that the resolution which established the new procedure of the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing was moved by a present Minister of this Government, Senator Richardson. It represented an attempt by honourable senators from both sides of the chamber to bring together those potentially conflicting elements. The procedure was aimed to bring the Executive and the Senate into dialogue in the preparation of appropriations. That is basically what is required and has been put down and supported by the Senate time and again, and I am sure will be supported by the Committee again today. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept the accuracy of and adopt what the President has said about the recent meeting. But the difficulty is that I think neither the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) nor the Minister for Finance sought to actively involve themselves in the process in the way that is required if it is to work. There were exchanges between the officials of the Department of Finance and the Department of the Senate which did not resolve the disputes. The political elements of the equation, that is, the Ministers, the President and the Opposition representatives on the Committee, were not brought into the dialogue as expected and hence we got to a situation where Bills were presented which did not represent in any sense an accepted view. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of Senator Ray's concerns, anyone who has attended the Appropriations and Staffing Committee meetings, as I have done throughout this period, would have to say that the Committee has genuinely tried to accommodate the responsibilities of the Executive government. There has never been any suggestion that the Senate should ignore the general financial approach being adopted by the Government. There has never been any suggestion that the Senate should ignore the need to pay regard to the Government's responsibilities. We have sought a sensible compromise. I remember occasions when Senator Macklin for the Australian Democrats and Senator Crichton-Browne for the Opposition have thought that the Committee has been far too reasonable and so on. But there has been genuine dialogue at the Committee level. </PARA>
<PARA> The meeting that was referred to by the President represented a determined effort by the Committee-it was led by the President but I think he would concede that it was with strong support from me and other senators-to get the dialogue going that is required. I agree with the President that the meeting which we held and which involved the senior Ministers from the Government, Senators Button and Walsh, the President himself, Senator Coates, Senator Macklin and me did come to grips with those issues. </PARA>
<PARA> My purpose in standing to speak now and in taking time in what has been a very extended and extensive debate on the Appropriation Bills is to say to Minister Ray, who is at the table, and, through him, to his colleagues that the next period of a few months is actually vital to the sensible working of this system and to the avoiding of unnecessary friction. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that we have not yet finalised and got on a satisfactory basis the base level of funding, post the shift to this chamber. The Minister has very sensibly put forward a procedure which, once we get a satisfactory base, will involve an incremental change on that year by year and the avoiding of arguments of things which lie within the base. It is a sort of global funding approach, the sort that the Opposition, when it was in government, used in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, for example, to enable greater flexibility within the institution, if you like. I think that is a very appropriate approach for the Senate. I support the idea of there being, in a sense, an annual adjustment which does not go to the detail in the Senate's operation, because that is a matter which is relevant to the Senate's continuing institutional independence. I think in principle that is good and it avoids unnecessary argy-bargying between public servants employed by the Senate and public servants employed by the Department of Finance. There is a procedure for new initiatives which may involve additional calls upon the funds which are raised by this Parliament at the behest of the Government. That is a procedure which, again, I think is potentially workable, provided we have reasonable good faith and dialogue on both sides. </PARA>
<PARA> My point though is that, if in the next couple of months-and they are the critical couple of months-there is not a sensible appreciation from the Department of Finance and the Minister for Finance that we need to settle that base in a sensible way, then we will be back to having a real problem next year which will, no doubt, flow on. My purpose in speaking is simply to remind the Government, through the Minister at the table, that we are in a ludicrous situation where, if a bit of goodwill and commonsense does not prevail, this question will arise: does the Senate use a sledgehammer to crack the nut of the incremental concerns it has about its own financial program? The fact is that this Government cannot get any money-no government can get any money-without the legislative cooperation of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate has a role and, in a sense, has a remedy, but the remedy is, if you like, disproportionate to the problem which is being addressed. I think that a sensible approach which is based on an understanding of the respective roles of the two and a bit of involvement at the ministerial level is the way to go. I commend the original recommendations that were adopted by the Senate as being a very pragmatic approach which is completely in accord with the principles that the Government has to have regard to and in accord with the principles that the members of the Senate have to have regard to. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I thank the President for the leadership he has given over the last couple of months in trying to resolve this matter. I trust that that will see the satisfactory resolution and that the Supplementary Estimates next year will put to bed the major concerns that there have been in the Senate about the operation of this Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to put one thing on the record before I leave the chamber. It is this: I do not know whether it is out of good taste or otherwise, but there has been something missing from this debate. It could be said that the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) may be persecuting this chamber because he does not like it. In general it has been thought that that may have been a probability. To substantiate that one would have to compare the money allocated to the Senate and the House of Representatives and prove some disappropriate share. I just make that point. It may be out of good taste, because we do not normally look at the House of Representatives estimates in any sense in this chamber, that that may have been overlooked. I think that it is an important tool of analysis when one is looking for motive of the Executive or a Minister concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as I know, the House of Representatives has been treated equally with the Senate. We do not have a majority in the Senate; we do in the House of Representatives. One can ask: Having a majority there that effectively rubber-stamps-and I am not beating around the bush when I say that-why should it not be rewarded for being good, if the Senate is being punished for being bad? Yet there is no dichotomy at all between the funding; if anything, I suspect, the negotiators in the Senate have probably finished marginally in front on occasions. I do not know whether that is because Senator Sibraa is a good negotiator; I do not think so. I know that the previous speaker, Senator Chaney, was a marvellous negotiator as well. But that point is missing from this debate, and I make it in case people say that the Minister for Finance or someone else is trying to punish the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to lengthen the debate. I do not want to debate the last couple of matters that were raised by Senator Ray to the extent that they have been raised so far. To this point there has not been a sense of goodwill on the part of the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) and the Government in their endeavours to resolve the problems which the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing has been confronted with. I note here that on 6 September I was required to write to Mr Terry Brown, Secretary of the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing, following a telephone call from him one month after the Appropriations and Staffing Committee meeting where it was determined that a delegation should meet with the Minister for Finance. I wrote back and said, `Inasmuch as you have been unsuccessful so far in your endeavours to make communication with the Minister for Finance, cease your attempts and report progress to our Committee'. On that very day that this correspondence was delivered to Senator Sibraa, through his efforts and the efforts of one or two others Senator Button and Senator Walsh agreed to meet us. To that point we did not even have a commitment-not a date, but a commitment-that they were prepared to meet us; and that made it somewhat difficult and compromising, in my view, for the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the funding for the House of Representatives and the Senate, let me say this: the House of Representatives does not have an appropriations and staffing committee. Its method for determining funding is negotiations between the Speaker and the Minister for Finance. To say that to measure what is appropriate, necessary and adequate for the House of Representatives in terms of individual details is all that is required for the Senate is quite wrong. I have no doubt that, if the House of Representatives had an appropriations and staffing committee made up of representatives from all political parties who were giving input as to what they considered to be the minimum required for the effective and efficient functioning of that chamber, its level of expenditure would be considerably higher than it presently is. At present the Speaker negotiates, with no bargaining position, with the Minister for Finance, and that is where it is resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> As for these final expenditure items, the truth of the matter is that this was the first attempt by the Committee to come to grips with funding. Before we had a notion that the Minister for Finance was going to cut them further, we made cuts of our own volition. We made very significant cuts seeking to pare the level of expenditure to the absolute minimum required for the functioning of the Senate. We ultimately discovered that that was very unwise of us because the Minister for Finance totally ignored that and wrote to us that he had unilaterally decided that the funding would be a great deal less than the minimum necessary. Members of the Committee then went back to review its funding requirements, went through the items and really could not find another dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> The cuts in the items became notional; they became absurd; they were simply made-up figures. We were taking salary cuts that could not be sustained. We were reducing expenditure for committee outlays that could not be sustained. We were reducing operational costs that would never be sustained, and we knew it. In the end we just said to the officers before the Committee, `Make the cuts wherever you like because they are all pretend'. The cuts could not genuinely be made. That is the truth of the matter. That is why the supplementary appropriations are so important. </PARA>
<PARA> The sad thing is that, in the Committee's seeking to find a baseline figure-that is something that the President has been very conscious of-because of the move from the old Parliament House to the new Parliament House, it has been very difficult to comply with guidelines set down by the Minister for Finance. I might say that we did not get the guidelines until some weeks ago. Those guidelines set down for government departments are incompatible in terms of their implementation and their application to the Department of the Senate because we have moved buildings and we do not yet know what the minimum requirements are. I have no doubt that the Joint House Department is still agonising in trying to determine the minimum that it requires, because that baseline figure has not yet been arrived at. It is ever so true of the Senate's position. The Department of the Senate cannot yet say, `This is the minimum required', because that has not yet been determined. We are still settling into the building. We are still seeking to find what the necessary minimum requirement is. To simply say that departments will have a baseline now-and we accept the need for a baseline-means that we will be subjecting and committing ourselves to a figure below that which is the minimum necessary for the functioning of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of the day we know that these problems that we are confronted with now are brought on by the difficult and strident nature of the Minister for Finance and of the Government. For Senator Robert Ray to talk about efficiency in the Senate contrasts starkly with the conduct of the Government in terms of the efficiency that is required. When we have sought guidelines for funding, when we have sought negotiations and meetings, we have been scorned at every turn. It is caused by the failure of the Government to even now accept the motion. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to hear Senator Robert Ray say that he now does not believe in the Senate being allowed, or it being appropriate, to determine its own level of funding. This flies in the face of unanimously carried resolutions in 1982 and in 1985. In 1985, as Senator Chaney says, the motion was moved by Senator Graham Richardson. We are now having that resolution overturned. When I interjected on Senator Walsh on one occasion and asked him why he had voted for it if he thought that it was wrong, he said, `I thought the resolution was as much a waste of time then and as useless and as irrelevant as I do now. So I could not care less whether or not I voted for it'. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is the attitude of the Government and the Ministers to the funding of the Senate, need we wonder why there is some difficulty in determining what the level of the funding of the Senate is? Ultimately we are confronted with levels below those necessary for the functioning of the chamber. As somebody said earlier, we are back to the days of the Stuart kings, of Charles I. When a government can arbitrarily, unilaterally, determine the funding of a parliament, the efficiency, the effectiveness and the independence of that chamber are very badly compromised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am loath to prolong the debate but I want to make a few comments on what Senator Robert Ray raised and on the responses by Senator Lewis, Senator Bishop and Senator Crichton-Browne. The questions raised by Senator Ray had nothing to do with the challenging of the separation of powers. I do not think that anything that Senator Lewis, Senator Bishop or Senator Crichton-Browne had to say detracts from the thrust of what Senator Ray was putting because he was talking about the efficient operation of Parliament. Senator Lewis made the point that he thought that this was irrelevant and a separate question from the one at hand. I do not think it is separate because it is directly related in the sense that the efficiency of the Senate is very much part of what we are talking about when we deal with appropriations for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The process that we are currently going through is an example of a gross inefficiency, as Senator Ray has already drawn attention to: the double handling of issues, dealing with these things in Estimates committees separate from this place and then coming in here and asking exactly the same questions again or questions that senators forgot to ask in those committee hearings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are numerous examples; read the Hansard. Talk of a mega-department is quite ridiculous. Unifying the departments, as Senator Ray was suggesting-and I do not think that that is inappropriate to raise either, because it directly relates to the inefficiency of the Senate-would not produce a mega-department. In business or in Public Service terms, this organisation as a whole, involving about 3,000 employees, is a tiddlywinks organisation in terms of its budget. It could be very much more efficiently run if there were more unity and not so much double handling of things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am disappointed that, in moving to a new, modern and efficient Parliament House with its new communications and other technologies, we did not at the same time modernise the procedures and the management processes. The management processes and the procedures in this place are in my view an anachronistic joke and leave observers, the visitors to this Parliament House, bewildered as to how the place works: people speaking in empty chambers; people running around to bells like Pavlovian dogs; the constant repetition of quorum calls or divisions. There are numerous examples of areas which we could reform, had we the will to reform them. I think that we need to look very seriously at that. As I have already indicated, there is room for reform in relation to Estimates committees. It seems absolutely absurd that we should repeat the process in Estimates committees and in the Committee of the Whole. There is room for reform in the way in which the committee stage is handled. For example, why can we not hold this stage of the process in committee rooms in a much more free and open way-they could be open to the public in the same way as usual-where we genuinely debate across a table rather than across a large chamber the minor differences that occur between us in relation to minor amendments to Bills?</PARA>

Why can we not use electronic voting procedures to speed up the process of voting? Why do we have to go through the silly processes of quorum calls as we currently do?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have to look at some of the causes of these inefficiencies. I think that part of it is the inherent conservatism of the Opposition, which will make it very difficult at any stage to get any sort of change. I am not suggesting that some of our own senators have not at times been very old-fashioned when it comes to such change. I remember a debate in the old House which related to design of the chamber. I believe that even some Government senators wanted to bring the old chamber into this one complete with its old seating and its old colours and furnishing. I thought that that debate, which went on for an awfully long time, was totally irrelevant, not to say tasteless; so we have that problem of the inherent conservatism of the Opposition. We also have the business paper itself. We are always so busy and there is a constant backlog of legislation. This simply does not allow time for debate of procedural questions. We will never have the time set aside by agreement between parties, when there is a legislative program backed up behind us, to have the full debate that we need to have about the processes and the efficiency of this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it also has to be said that, from time to time, we have obstruction from parliamentary officers-not all of them, but certainly some of them. There are territorial arguments that we have to overcome. If we are to be sincere in our attempt to get this Parliament operating as efficiently as we can, we have to address all those problems and give them some serious thought. If, as Senator Chaney said-and I agree with him-dialogue is not working, we really have to make sure that we get dialogue working at the highest levels of this Parliament and that this chamber and the other chamber make their own determinations about how the processes should work. We should not allow ourselves to be manipulated by the territorial claims of individuals within this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The contribution that Senator Beahan has just made is really quite irrelevant to this debate. The question of reform is quite separate from the question of the funding of the business of this chamber. I refer this chamber to evidence given on 26 September during the hearings of Estimates Committee A when I asked a very specific question of the Clerk and the President. I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr President, to be clear in my own mind, I wonder whether or not the establishment of a new committee, or the reference of a new matter to a standing committee, is considered to be a new policy initiative in terms of funding. </PARA>
<PARA>The answer from the Clerk was this:</PARA>
<PARA> Yes. Unless there is some way in which it can be met from existing funds by some savings, that would be regarded as a new item requiring additional expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA>I then said:</PARA>
<PARA> Basically, the situation that we are in is that the business the Senate can do is determined by the executive arm of government, namely, the Minister for Finance. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is a potential in the existing situation for that to occur. There is a potential, which has been identified by senators in debate, for the executive government to be in a position to have a veto, as it were, over some new committee activity, for example, that the Senate might determine. </PARA>
<PARA>I said:</PARA>
<PARA> Theoretically, if the said Minister or the executive government determined that they did not like a particular line of inquiry they could simply fail to provide the funds and that could stop that line of inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is that potential in the current situation. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what we are debating and that is the position that Senator Crichton-Browne is trying to remedy by moving his motion. It is a serious question. Nobody would like to see an extravagant allocation of money for the running of this place, but it is necessary to allow the free flow of information and debate to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week I watched on television members of the communist regime in Prague sitting around a table doing what they had done for decades-that is, determining how the people would live their lives without the free flow of information. The Government of East Germany has been destroyed because the people of that country do not have the freedom to express their views. The matter we are now considering is one of efficiency versus the right of the people to have their views heard and expressed in a public forum. There is a need for proper financing to be made available so that this precious freedom, which is enjoyed in a minority of countries, can continue. People who suggest that senators are indulging in some sort of self-interest by saying that they are concerned to preserve the system which guarantees us freedom should be ashamed. It is a precious freedom, a precious right, and I, for one, intend to defend it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to make the terrible mistake of talking the Government out of agreeing to my motion. I should comment on the remarks of Senator Beahan. I can only assume by his fresh and flush contribution that he has not followed the history of this debate. He talked about amalgamations having a capacity for achieving greater efficiencies. He obviously has not read the hundreds of pages of reports, the comments on reports, the observations on reports and the reports on reports on the capacity for improving the functioning of the Parliament as a whole. The golden thread which runs through every single report and every comment on them is that amalgamation does not necessarily lead to any efficiencies and, certainly, any effective savings. As I said before, this determination was made by the Government when it introduced its legislation, I think in 1987.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Michael Beahan might think it is an anachronism to attend divisions, to be in this chamber to listen to debates when nobody else does and to argue that the forms of the Parliament are redundant and, therefore, ought to be removed. Perhaps he has been in Western Australia too long and has been infected by WA Inc., where big is beautiful. We have seen the disaster that that has caused in terms of taxpayers' funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth of the matter is-and perhaps I can be judged as a reactionary-that certain forms, standards, guidelines, baselines and parameters which are a measurement of decency, honesty, integrity, a sense of purpose and morality ought to be preserved as benchmarks. There seems to be an obsession by some to change fundamentally some of the systems for the sake of change; in the name of efficiency but simply for the sake of change. I am not opposed to changes which lead to efficiency yet preserve the integrity of the chamber and I do not think any reasonable thinking person would be. But to sweep something aside because it is a reflection of the past in my view leaves us in a vacuum when making judgments about what is proper and what is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, democracy is not the most efficient, effective, and certainly the cheapest, form of government, but it is the fairest form I know. It can be best preserved by having parliaments and chambers of parliament that are able, unencumbered, to preserve and fulfil the obligations which are cast upon them by the system within which they work. When that nexus is broken, when we have a system where the Executive government determines exclusively the capacity for the Parliament to function, we will no longer have a parliament with independence and the people will no longer have a voice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Department of the Parliamentary Library presented the Estimates Committee with several problems-two of them major. One of them related to the appointment of the new head of the Parliamentary Information Systems Office (PISO), and one related to the creation by officers within the Department of the Parliamentary Library of a secret and illegal account, which terms I will stick with as being technically correct by way of dictionary definition. I will deal with the euphemisms that the Auditor-General chose to use when I come to that item.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, I will deal with the appointment of Mr Walsh to the position of head of the Parliamentary Information Systems Office, replacing Mr Goodall. Some disquiet surrounded this appointment, and I think it is worth while going through that disquiet and looking at the questions that were raised. I stress that the Estimates Committee report is a report of both Government and Opposition senators. We all agreed that these matters were of a serious nature. Without in any way questioning the right of the Presiding Officers to appoint whomever they so choose to that position, it is nonetheless necessary and prudent to examine what in fact occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> The Parliamentary Librarian, Mr MacLean, indicated in evidence that was placed in the report that he took the responsibility of advertising and establishing a selection panel in the normal way for the appointment of someone to the position of head of PISO. The interview panel was selected. It consisted of two senior parliamentary officers and two outsiders who had particular expertise. These people undertook a series of interviews and forwarded a report which identified four applicants as being suitable for the position. However, the panel recommended that only one of those people be appointed. When that report went to the Presiding Officers, we heard evidence that there were some significant concerns felt by them about the recommendation that had been made. So they put those concerns to the Acting Librarian, Mr Brudenall, because Mr MacLean was overseas. If my memory serves me correctly, the timing of his return from overseas and the timing of Mr Brudenall being asked for his opinion were very close indeed. One may ask why it was felt necessary to bring Mr Brudenall into question when he had not been involved in the panel selection process. In no way am I disputing the right of the Presiding Officers to appoint whomever they wish, nor am I reflecting on the person who was subsequently appointed to the position. But what is important is to go through the process. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a distinct, concerted effort by the Executive arm of government to say that a distinction should be made between process and outcome-that somehow the process does not matter and that only outcomes should be looked at. Those statements have been made by departmental heads and they have been made by Ministers in a number of statements. There has been a distinct and concerted effort to do this. It is one I totally reject. If one does not look at the process one can have an outcome which is corrupted by a corrupted or improper process, so it is important to look at the whole scheme of things. </PARA>
<PARA> Where this position got very difficult is here. We heard evidence from Mr MacLean. I might say that it was very difficult to get evidence from him as he was what one might call a very reluctant witness. We did not have the opportunity to hear from the other members of that panel. One of the members of that panel was so concerned that that person felt an obligation to impart the view that the Senate Estimates Committee had been misled in evidence given. There was no avenue available under the Estimates Committee for us to subpoena or to call for those additional panel members to give evidence to it. I specifically asked the President whether, firstly, he would let me read the report; and, secondly, whether we could call additional witnesses. Subsequently, upon negotiation, the President did share information in a sanitised way-without my sighting it-with Senator Lewis and me. But the question of doubt remained. I repeat: in no way am I disputing the right of the Presiding Officers to appoint whomever they will. My concern was that it was also reported to me that the responsible departmental head, namely the Librarian, did in fact take some action to try to prevent that report in any way becoming public. I find in that a good deal of disquiet. </PARA>
<PARA> The report outlines three procedures that the Committee believes ought to have been followed. Firstly, the Presiding Officers could have sent their reservations back to the original interview panel for further consideration. Secondly, the Presiding Officers, given their reservations, could have simply overturned the original recommendation and proceeded to make their own recommendation on the basis of information before them, which they were perfectly entitled to do. Thirdly, the Presiding Officers could have referred their concerns to the head of the Department for his consideration and recommendation when he returned from overseas. The reason I have raised these matters in this sequence is, again, set out in the report of the Committee. We recommend that in the future, wherever possible, the Presiding Officers refer their concerns to the interview panel prior to making their decision. In this way credibility and confidence will be maintained in the normal interview and appointment procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat: none of what I have said is said to reflect upon the right of the Presiding Officers to make the appointment, nor to reflect upon the person who was the subject of the appointment. What I am saying is that in these matters-and it is a very sensitive office-things must not only be done correctly but must also appear to be done correctly, and the correct procedures must be followed. If we do not have guidelines and some system, we will lose the public's confidence or the confidence of this place. Indeed, during some of the evidence we heard there was a great deal about the electronic system in this building about which we do not know and over which we do not have control. It is not a new thing that I have raised that matter. From the time we moved into this building I have been concerned about security, about the ability of people to hack into our computer systems, what effect the addition of modems to our computer systems will have, and the fact that there is a more secure system for the executive arm of government than there is for ordinary members and senators. I still find those things of grave concern. </PARA>
<PARA> So in these sensitive areas I think we should be extraordinarily prudent that we follow form, that we ensure not only that things are done properly-that we get a good result-but also, indeed, that things are seen to be done properly and that proper processes and procedures are followed. </PARA>
<PARA> There are several other matters that I want to raise in regard to the Department of the Parliamentary Library. As I have said, I have already flagged the question of the secret account. I also wish to raise the question of the secret account. I also wish to raise the question of the appointment and use of consultants, and the additional information dealing with the question of consultants, that came to the Committee after the hearings were concluded. I seek your guidance, Madam Temporary Chairman, as to whether I should continue to use the five minutes available to me or whether it would be better to restrict the debate to the question of the appointment of the head of PISO at this stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it might be better if at this stage I dealt with some of the remarks that Senator Bishop made so that then she will have a full 15 minutes to spend on whatever else she is going to raise arising out of this report. There are some comments I should make. I do not have any difficulties with the report of Senate Estimates Committee A as it refers to senior parliamentary appointments. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Committee is not disputing the fact that Presiding Officers do have the right to make appointments, regardless of whether their appointments are in agreement with any interview panel that may have been established. </PARA>
<PARA>I think Senator Bishop said that on two occasions. In the past, for some quite senior positions within the parliamentary departments there has not even been an interview panel. But on this occasion an interview panel was called. Senator Bishop says there were four suitable applicants, of which Mr Walsh was one. The Speaker and I had some great concerns that in the Parliamentary Information Systems Office (PISO) what we needed was what I would call a hands-on manager and not another technical person. We were concerned enough to refer this back to the acting head of the Department, who was Mr Brudenall. It ought to be pointed out that there was a week between when we referred it back, on 27 August, and when Mr MacLean was to return, on 4 September. Further on in the report it says:</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, the Presiding Officers, given their reservations, could have simply overturned the original recommendation and proceeded to make their own recommendation based on the information before them. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course we could have done that but I think we probably still would have been criticised in the way we are being criticised this morning. Then the report says:</PARA>
<PARA>Thirdly, the Presiding Officers could have referred their concerns to the head of the Department for his consideration and recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA>I put it to Senator Bishop that that is exactly what we did. Technically and in every way we referred it back to the head of the Department who at that stage happened to be Mr Brudenall. But as I say, I do not have any difficulty with the recommendation of the Committee or the points that are made by it here. Personally, I believe that everything that has happened in PISO since the Estimates Committee met has vindicated Mr Walsh's appointment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to comment on this matter, as I was the Chairman of Estimates Committee A. I agree with what the President has said and disagree with what Senator Bishop is implying. The President of the Senate has read out the Committee's three considerations. Senator Bishop has said that there are unsubstantiated allegations. The Committee has taken the action it has because it has no evidence. It is not good enough for Senator Bishop to say that somebody has said something to her-that is not enough to warrant being taken up by a committee. Senator Bishop alleges that the Librarian tried to do something, but we have no evidence of that and we have no evidence that a person who was on the selection panel has done anything because that person has not had the intestinal fortitude to come forward and make a statement, to do anything or to use any of the forms available. As far as I am concerned, the Committee cannot act on the basis of unsubstantiated allegations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Bishop concluded with another proposition. Although she alleges there is no proper process or not enough concern on the Government's side about proper processes, once again we have something that is, I suggest, in Senator Bishop's mind-the belief that the security system in some way has been tampered with. That is close to being paranoid thinking. All the questions we put to the people concerned indicated that there is no evidence of that. It is always possible, but there is no evidence at all of anything untoward in the security system that exists here for the protection of members' and senators' communications systems. We need much more than what has been raised so far. Senator Bishop is re-raising matters that could not be agreed with at the time. In regard to the action the President took, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The President indicated that the Presiding Officers had some significant concerns about the recommendation and put those concerns in writing to the Acting Librarian and asked that this matter be given further consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>The existing state of PISO is of concern. The fact is that the Presiding Officers acted to try to clear up what was clearly inefficiency. In the previous discussion about the parliamentary departments it was stated that there cannot be increased efficiency. When we discussed what existed in PISO-subsequently I will move a motion related to that, arising from the Committee's report-we could see every indication, as can be seen in any department or bureaucracy, of people abusing power and doing things that are absolutely incorrect. The Presiding Officers should be commended for taking action. Once they became aware of rumours that existed at the time, they were concerned and took action to make sure that a stronger, firmer hand was taken to this Department. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to deal with one point that was raised by Senator Childs and that is the question of evidence. Both the appointment of the head of the Parliamentary Systems Information Office (PISO) and the creation of the secret account of $88,000 were subject to rumour around this place. We were able, because we had the appropriate witnesses appearing before the Estimates Committee, to gain the evidence which nailed that account. I refer to the problem that one of the members of the selection panel has with that person's conscience and the belief-which is a correct belief according to a formal advice that I have been given-that if someone knows or believes a committee of the Parliament to have been misled and takes no action about it, then that person is in breach and in contempt. That person had that sufficient concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I explained earlier, the Estimates Committee had no power of subpoena, as other committees of the Senate do. We had no way of calling a witness and therefore we had no way of testing what began as rumour and gradually became more sustained. It still remains an unresolved question but, as I said, none of that is relevant to the question of whether or not the Presiding Officers had the power or otherwise to appoint whomever they chose. The whole point in raising the issue is simply to say that, particularly in sensitive areas, but in non-sensitive areas as well, it is important that we have a proper and predictable process through which we go and that we have a system in which we can all have confidence. I also said that none of what I said in any way reflects on the person who was in fact appointed. But I am concerned about some of the actions that took place and the way the matter was dealt with. I think for the record it is important to have that said. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would be unfortunate, to put it mildly, if this debate in the Committee, proper though it is, should in any way be taken by anyone who might be listening or who might read the Hansard as reflecting on the capabilities and integrity of the successful candidates, or indeed of the unsuccessful candidates. That is important. It has been agreed by the President that he has no difficulty with the recommendations contained in the report that is currently before us. It has been agreed that it is the prerogative of the Presiding Officers to make appointments. I, and I am sure other members of the Committee, would have confidence that in making such appointments the Presiding Officer, of this chamber at all events, would have regard to certain requirements for which he alone has responsibility in ensuring that they are adhered to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take what the President has said as an indication that appropriate procedures will continue in relation to appointments, discussions and consultations taking place. The major reason for my speaking at this time is to express my concern lest anything that has been said-and, as I say, properly raised in this chamber-in any way reflects on the appointee to the position or indeed on the efficiency of the unsuccessful candidates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I now turn to the question of the appointment of former officers as consultants. During the Estimates Committee hearings we heard of the example of one Dr Thistlewaite, who was an example of the classic Friday to Monday syndrome-that is, that person ceased to be a public servant on a Friday and began being a consultant to the same department, carrying out basically the same responsibilities, on the following Tuesday. The reason he did not commence on the Monday was that Monday was Anzac Day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important that we have some guidelines and some understanding, which we do not have in place at the present time in a sufficient manner, as to how people who are public servants one day and purport to be the consultant the next day are to be dealt with. So that we know exactly what transpired: Dr Thistlewaite was on a salary of $46,000. He was then appointed as a consultant at the rate of $420 per day for one contract, carrying out basically the same work as he was involved in as a public servant. He then got a second contract, where his daily rate rose to $730. </PARA>
<PARA> During the period of examination of witnesses in the Estimates Committee hearings it became quite apparent that the job for which Dr Thistlewaite was paid at a rate of $730 was to assist various people in the various things that they were doing. In total, Dr Thistlewaite was able to earn in 11 months $101,270, as distinct from the $46,000 he had earned previously. Dr Thistlewaite did take the opportunity to turn himself into a proprietary company, which was paid the fee. Indeed, this met the classic example which Mr Boucher, Commissioner of Tax- ation, identified in one of his rulings as the Friday to Monday case. This was dealt with in a very severe way by the Australian Taxation Office, but we still seem to be able to have it in other parts of government. </PARA>
<PARA> No guidelines came from the evidence given to the Estimates Committee. The Parliamentary Information Systems Office (PISO) has not adopted any guidelines relating to the re-employment of former employees and nor does it have a clear policy regarding the quarantining of employees who indicate that they will be resigning to take up a position outside the appointment. Indeed, that became relevant in the case of Mr Goodall himself, who was the previous head of PISO and who has gone off to join the private sector. We said in the report:</PARA>
<PARA>Without any such guidelines or quarantining procedures the potential will always be there for conflict of interest and the accusation that any future contracts were not undertaken at arm's length. </PARA>
<PARA>The concern that we have as a committee is that proper procedures ought to be in place. It was interesting to receive in November Estimates Committee A Additional Information Received, Volume 1. An answer was provided to a question asked by both Senator Michael Baume and me about the number of former government employees who have become consultants. It is interesting to note that the answer on page 50 says:</PARA>
<PARA>In respect of contract staff provided by Computer Power Pty Ltd during 1988-89 Computer Power has advised that 13 contract staff have formerly been public servants at some stage. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know from whence they came. I do not know what their area of expertise is or whether there is any conflict system. I would like further information about that. However, I do find it quite interesting that 13 such people were provided by way of consultancies during that period. It is for this reason that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts has been very concerned to ensure that government departments comply with the guidelines, and indeed the law, that require them to publish details of consultants in their annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA> When one finds a single example such as this the question which immediately springs to mind is: How many others are there? The question that flows from that is: How do you find out? The answer is that at the moment it is very difficult-one cannot. It could indeed be a quite useful and helpful addition if, when we are dealing with consultants, we could have published details of any background that they have had within the public sector within, say, a reasonable period of time. Certainly, with regard to the Department of Defense in the United States if someone leaves that Department they cannot become a consultant within a two-year period. It may be that we should be looking at something of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole question of who appointed Dr Thistlewaite and who approved his terms and conditions of employment seems to have been a little shrouded in mystery and difficult to ascertain finally. But, as I have said, my main concern is that I am certain that this is not a one-off example. I would like to find some way in which we could ascertain that we are properly served and that there are not any systems being worked that enable people simply to get a greater share of the public purse by changing their status. Again, Mr Temporary Chairman, I would like to ask whether I should move on to the question of the secret account of $88,000 at this stage or whether other senators might wish to contribute to the debate concerning Dr Thistlewaite. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps I should take this opportunity now to make a brief point. I accept the points made by Estimates Committee A and by Senator Bishop this morning. Mr Walsh has informed me that a code of ethics is being prepared for the staff of the Parliamentary Informations Systems Office based on the code of the Australian Computer Society Inc. This will include re-employment and quarantine arrangements, and I would think that, once it is available, it could be made available to members of the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the President for that advice; it is pleasing indeed. I now move on to that section of the report at page 7, where we deal with the matters under the heading of `The ``Unofficial'' Account-PISO'. I begin by referring to the definition of the word `unofficial'. It is defined by The Macquarie Dictionary as `not official; informal'. `Informal' is in turn defined as `not according to prescribed or customary forms; irregular'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the Estimates Committee hearings, I chose to use the word `illegal' and that was challenged by Mr MacLean, who told me that that was yet to be determined, so I settled for the word `secret'. I think it is useful to look at the definition of those terms. `Illegal' is defined as `not legal; unauthorised'. `Secret' is defined as `done, made, or conducted without the knowledge of others; kept from the knowledge of any but the initiated'. `Kept from the knowledge of any but the initiated' seems to be a very good working definition. </PARA>
<PARA> I put to the Senate that the use of the word `unofficial' is very simply a euphemism, and one chosen to be used by the Auditor-General in the report that he furnished to the Committee concerning the establishment and use of that secret and illegal account. I will stick to the term `illegal' because indeed the Auditor-General finds that the practices that established and operated that account were in breach not only of the Constitution but also of the Audit Act. I reckon that makes it pretty illegal and a hell of a lot more than unofficial. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts of the matter were disturbing indeed. When one sees the sort of temptations to which people can succumb, the sum of $88,000 is perhaps not so paltry as some may in the beginning think it is. The evidence given before the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales shows that Mr Ross, who was employed by the Department of Administrative Services, was tempted for sums far smaller than $88,000. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should think so. With regard to the question of the secret account, it was established that so-called obsolete Honeywell equipment, which was somehow inherited by the Parliamentary Information Systems Office (PISO), was sold through Computer Power Pty Ltd and some $88,000 was received. This money was put into a secret and illegal account from which purchases were made and accounts were paid. One of those payments was to pay for four Canberra-based officials, including Mr Goodall, to go to the Sydney Hilton Hotel, remain there for three days and have a little conference together. They were allegedly to have spoken with people from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, but the Auditor-General found that somehow they found it was not necessary to talk to people from the ABC, and so no-one came to that alleged conference but the four gentlemen from Canberra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Mullane, who gave evidence, told us that, in his understanding, Mr MacLean, the responsible departmental head, had known of these plans; that Mr Goodall had authorised travel by aeroplane for two of the four officers to fly to Sydney to stay at the Sydney Hilton Hotel so that they could have discussions with each other for three days; and that an office car was also made available. In evidence before the Estimates Committee, Mr Mullane also told me that Mr Goodall had not stayed at the Sydney Hilton Hotel. I specifically asked whether or not, as Mr Goodall left in July and as this function was held at the end of June, this might have been for the purpose of a celebration to farewell Mr Goodall. Mr Mullane told me that Mr Goodall had not stayed in the hotel, but yesterday he wrote to the secretary of the Estimates Committee, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>CORRECTION TO EVIDENCE PRESENTED TO THE COMMITTEE ON 3 OCTOBER 1989</PARA>
<PARA> In answer to a series of questions from Senator Bishop on 3 October 1989 (Hansard page no. A124) I advised that the former Manager, PISO (Mr Goodall) did not stay at the Hilton Hotel to my knowledge. My answer was given in the context of questions which I interpreted as seeking to establish whether Mr Goodall had incurred expenses which were charged to the unofficial account. In accordance with my knowledge I advised the committee that Mr Goodall had not incurred any such expenses as his accommodation arrangements were private and my answer to the final question ``not to my knowledge'' was given in this context. This answer was, however, strictly incorrect . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It was just plain incorrect. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . as I was aware that Mr Goodall had stayed at the hotel under private arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I did not earlier advise the committee of this matter as I considered that my evidence was not significant to the extent that I was aware, following the committee's hearings, that Mr Goodall's accommodation arrangements were likely to be advised to the committee in any case through the Auditor-General's report. Nevertheless, I have considered the matter further and have determined that my responsibility to advise the committee was not discharged by the committee obtaining this information from the Auditor-General's report. </PARA>
<PARA> I trust this letter discharges that responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA>So the whole sorry story is that the use of this account-whereby some $1,600 was paid for this so-called workshop at the Sydney Hilton Hotel, together with the purchase of microwave ovens, having pictures framed, and other bits and pieces-was all strictly illegal, yet the Auditor-General chose to file a report in which his conclusions were not substantiated by his own report. I have been a very strong supporter of the Auditor-General and the Australian Audit Office. I was a member of the Public Accounts Committee Subcommittee that prepared the report entitled The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament, yet so much of our system depends on the strength and courage of the Auditor-General. This report, couched in the terms it is, with the use of euphemisms, I find an affront to this Parliament. Accordingly, when the matter was dealt with by the Committee, there was shared indignation. Later in this debate Senator Childs, as Chairman of the Committee, will move that the whole sorry mess be referred to the Public Accounts Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General found that there were several breaches of Finance Regulations, that there were breaches of sections 81 and 83 of the Constitution and that there was a breach of the Audit Act. He found as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> PISO officers-</PARA>
<PARA>including the responsible departmental head; and what is responsibility all about, unless that is where the final responsibility lies?-</PARA>
<PARA>had no cause to be unaware-</PARA>
<PARA>a nice double negative, but the message is strong-</PARA>
<PARA>that prescribed procedures must be followed by all Commonwealth departments, including the Parliamentary Departments and should have acted accordingly . . . </PARA>
<PARA>How can a departmental head conceivably have become aware, as Mr MacLean did in July, that this illegal account existed and do absolutely nothing about it with regard to calling in the Auditor-General until September? For the Auditor-General to come in and say, `It's okay, fellas; they really didn't mean it', is simply not acceptable. What messages are we sending out to the rest of the public sector? Is it that proper behaviour is not required? The report said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no evidence to suggest that PISO officers, and the persons employed by Computer Power under the prime contract between PISO and Computer Power, acted in other than good faith, nor is there any evidence of fraud. </PARA>
<PARA>They may have indulged in illegal and highly improper practices, but the Auditor-General has said, `It's okay, fellas; you really did it in good faith.' What a ridiculous situation that is. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a matter of shared concern. A strong message has to go out that says, `This form of behaviour is unacceptable'. Just as the President has said that Mr Walsh is putting in guidelines for dealing with the appointment and quarantining of consultants who have previously been public servants because of the example of Dr Thistlewaite, so a strong and determined message should go out to the rest of the public sector to say that this sort of behaviour will not do, and the persons responsible will be held accountable without a whitewash. Without a strong Auditor-General our system cannot function. He is the interface between the Executive and the Parliament. In the earlier debate on the Department of the Senate we went through the history of why it is important that final power should lie with the Parliament. Simply to have a whitewash, and for the Department of the Parliamentary Library to go on as before, will not do. It is certainly pleasing to see that both Government and Opposition senators are supporting a call for a further and distinct inquiry by the Public Accounts Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to draw attention to the following statement in the report of Estimates Committee A:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>On reading the Auditor-General's report, the Committee is of the view that the summary and recommendations do not address fully all the matters raised in the body of the report, particularly the findings and conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA>I propose to move a motion submitting a number of points to be considered by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. I refer to that introductory paragraph because some of the attitudes that Senator Bishop expressed are her own. Her attack on the Auditor-General is probably going further than any of the other members of the Committee would be prepared to go. However, the Committee is concerned about the matters that have been raised. </PARA>
<PARA> First of all, I should thank the President, who acted with every speed to make sure that the Auditor-General's report was provided to the Committee literally at the same time as he received it. So we were able to look at that report, but, in the whole process, we were under some pressure because of the exigencies of getting the Estimates through and preparing our report. Also, because of the limitations of Estimates committees, our view was that it would be better for a thorough examination to be undertaken by the appropriate body, which is another joint parliamentary committee. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Committee, having considered the Report of Estimates Committee A, recommends-That the following matter be referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts for inquiry and report:</PARA>
<PARA> An examination of the events surrounding the establishment and operation of the `unofficial PISO account' with particular reference to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the role and responsibility of the former manager of PISO;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the role and responsibility of the Parliamentary Librarian;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the role and responsibility of Computer Power as prime contractor to PISO;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the role and responsibility of consultants employed by Computer Power on behalf of PISO;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) whether a conflict of interest did arise when a consultant, employed by Computer Power, acted in a line management position;</PARA>
<PARA> (f) the role and responsibility of other managers of PISO who were associated with this account;</PARA>
<PARA> (g) the apparent lack of involvement of the Finance Section, Parliamentary Library with the auditing procedures of PISO's accounts and the role and responsibility of the Auditor-General in oversighting this matter; and</PARA>
<PARA> (h) whether the breaches outlined in the Auditor-General's report warrant further action. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a comprehensive series of questions that will require further detailed consideration. I think that everybody agrees that this section leaves everything to be desired as far as efficient administration is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> I am just as amazed as Senator Bishop is at this ridiculous letter we have received from Mr Mullane, the Director, Planning and Administration. A person who could write this letter after the specific questions that were asked at Estimates Committee A is a person whose word I would not be able to trust at any future meeting that I attend. He clearly ducked the question that was being asked and gave the impression that the person concerned was in some private place and not in the very hotel that he was being quizzed about. This is the sort of thing that justifies the President's concern about the administration of the Parliamentary Information Systems Office (PISO). I am fortified by the early response to the management control of PISO, and no doubt Estimates Committee A will keep this matter clearly under its purview in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we are at a stage now where the appropriate decision has been made because, within a very short time, we can expect a detailed and thorough examination to take place. It is also fair to say that the Auditor-General's report had to be compiled very speedily. There was pressure from Estimates Committee A to have the report before it as quickly as possible and, if there are any further revelations, I think we will have control of the situation. The alarm bells have been rung. In those circumstances I commend the motion, which comes from Estimates Committee A, as a way for all the facts to come out under a thorough examination by a parliamentary committee, which can, with all the advantages of a joint standing committee, in the next parliament give us the information that we still require on the incidents that have occurred. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have any difficulties with the motion that has been moved by Senator Childs. The matter was considered by Senate Estimates Committee A at length. It has been the subject of an Auditor-General's investigation. The Auditor-General's draft report was circulated to honourable senators on that Estimates Committee. As Senator Childs said, I gave it to them within a matter of minutes of receiving it from the Auditor-General's office. I believe it has been referred to the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) for advice. I point out that I will table the final report later today during the sitting of the Senate. Estimates Committee A has recommended that the matter be referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. As I have said, I have no problems with that. The Auditor-General's office has been quite strongly criticised by Senator Bishop. It can answer any criticisms made of it at the hearings of the Public Accounts Committee. I point out that the Parliamentary Librarian has issued a circular advising his staff of the applicability of the Audit Act, Finance Regulations and Finance Directions and has recommended that the heads of other parliamentary departments be advised to do likewise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to refer specifically to answers that were supplied to questions that I asked at the hearings of Estimates Committee A and that were taken on notice. Considering the discussions that we had this morning about efficiency, it is really quite important to highlight some of these answers. It had come to my attention that the cost of light globes in this building was outrageously high. I asked whether it was true that the figure for replacing these lights was in the vicinity of half a million dollars a year because the architect had required that the light fittings be imported. The answer states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The total cost of purchasing globes and tubes for a full year is estimated on this basis to be in the region of $400,000. </PARA>
<PARA>I also asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Is the reason that it is so expensive because the Architects specified that the globes be a variety that have to be imported?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer was:</PARA>
<PARA>With respect to fluorescent tubes this is the case because the architect specified a tube to produce a soft warm light, in keeping with his design intent. The Australian equivalents are a much more brilliant white and thus do not produce the same visual effect. </PARA>
<PARA> In other instances such as lamps required for the Chambers, Members Hall, Great Hall foyer and other monumental spaces there is no Australian equivalent to the imported lamps. </PARA>
<PARA>My next question was:</PARA>
<PARA>What is the exact cost of importing light globes for this building?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer was:</PARA>
<PARA>The purchase cost of imported lamps was $225,601 from 1 May 1989 to 10 October 1989. From this it can be estimated that the probable cost in a full year with the lighting being maintained at optimal levels will be in the order of $365,000. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask you: When we are talking about efficiency and proper running of this place, how on earth has this become a permanent maintenance cost? Many queries were raised during the Estimates Committee hearings about building design faults and who will be responsible for correcting them. Remedying something as fundamental as lighting is difficult to come to terms with, but it seems that there was a good deal of sloppiness in the oversight of some of the costs that went into this building. Although I imagine we will not be building anything of this magnitude for at least 200 years, I hope that some important lessons have been learned. In the meantime we seem to be stuck with a bill of $400,000 for light globes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again, I am restricting my comments at this stage to those matters that have been raised in the report of Estimates Committee A. Page 14 of the report deals with offsets and the partnerships for development program. There are several matters of a continuing nature concerning the offsets and partnerships for development program. They have been the subject of report No. 270 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which predated my coming into the Parliament. They have also been the subject of the report of the Inglis Committee of Review on Government High Technology Purchasing Arrangements, the subject of a Department of Finance minute and of a review of the Finance minute by the Public Accounts Committee, which will soon table its report. They have also been the subject of much discussion in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will refer to one particular item that was dealt with in examination of witnesses concerning how the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce (DITAC) operates these programs. In doing so, I am in no way looking at the question of policy. It is the right of the Government, as the Government, to set policy. However, it is the task of the scrutiny committees to ensure that the administration of those policies is effective, efficient and accountable. </PARA>
<PARA> Two particular aspects came to light in the course of the Estimates hearings which I think need to be dealt with today. The first relates to an item that was raised by my colleague, Senator Lewis, in this chamber in a question addressed to Senator Button concerning a report in a computer specialist publication that three of the partnerships for development had been underperforming. The report went on to say that advice had been given to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) that, if a news release was put out with particular wording, the fact that these three partnerships had been underperforming could be camouflaged. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of Estimates hearings we were able to identify the person who gave that advice to the Minister. Where it became most important was, after looking at the annual report on offsets, one picked up an intention that there were to be audits and it became apparent that pilot audits were being conducted on three of the partners. In answering questions from me to the officer concerned, evidence was given that two of the firms that were subject to the pilot audit were two of the three firms that had been underperforming. A press release was duly issued by the Minister in the way in which he was advised, so the fact that these companies had been underperforming had been camouflaged. The really worrying aspect is the degree of close questioning that is necessary to find out the real answers. The question which I posed, which I was interested in, was whether or not at the time of writing the memorandum the officer concerned had the reports of the pilot audits. I received an answer in the negative. </PARA>
<PARA> On further examination it was shown that the officer knew what was in the reports of the pilot audits, although he did not actually physically have them. It is of a great deal of concern when one looks further at the partnerships for development process that one sees, again from evidence given in various committees in this place, which is all on the public record, that in seven out of 15 contracts which existed in June 1989, if my recollection serves me well, there was a clause which required the Commonwealth Government to maintain a healthy economy. They are not the precise words in the contract. The beginning of the clause states, `The Commonwealth of Australia shall'-not `may', `strive to', or any of those sorts of terms, but `shall'. Nobody in his right mind could say that we are maintaining a healthy economy in this country at the moment. Consequently it is quite open to any so-called partner-I refuse to call these agreements contracts because they are totally unenforceable-who feels that it is all a bit much to simply say, `Well, you haven't upheld your end of the bargain. The economy in this country is lousy. We are off the hook'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department seems to argue in all the cases of offsets in partnerships for development that there is no way that it can give any meaningful penalties. I do not accept that. The messages that go out to industry are basically that the Government is not serious. Let us take a look at a specific example. Again, in evidence, we had a look at the way in which the Department values transfers of technology. We looked specifically at the question and one company, SNECMA. Examples are given in the report at pages 15 and 16 of the way in which the Committee was concerned at the sloppiness of the administration of these programs. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other worrying pieces of evidence that came from those hearings dealt directly with the question of placing value on an obligation being discharged. An officer gave evidence of a figure that was accepted as discharging an obligation under an offset program. When we finally tested how he arrived at that figure, we found that it basically came from the company which had undertaken the obligation in the first place. It then passed on the figure to the Australian beneficiary who passed it on to the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Fitzpatrick from DITAC answered questions. We heard that there are still no guidelines for determining values of discharge of obligations in this area. We found that, although they had been talked about and were first raised by the Auditor-General in 1984, they are still being dealt with in a totally ad hoc fashion. The Committee was further critical of the results that failed to flow from highly expensive overseas trips of senior departmental officers. Although that information was supplied to the Committee in confidence, we can look at the global results without breaching that confidence. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, it is the Government's right to set policy. It is the obligation of the scrutiny committees to ensure that the taxpayer gets value for money. There are those who argue that the way in which the situation has been set up now means that the costs incurred by people who wish to compete in the largest single information market in Australia-that is, the Federal Government-are enormous and the benefits which they receive are minimal. In looking at the offsets and partnerships for development program, one can question whether or not the Australian taxpayer is getting value for money. Basically the evidence that was given did not sustain that thought, at least for this member of the Committee. The Committee shared concerns in the areas that I have outlined in the report. As I have said on several occasions before today, it is important to note this is a joint report of Government and Opposition senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am addressing my remarks to the matters that we have dealt with in the report. Accordingly, I am concerned to deal with the question of the Australian Trade Commission, Austrade, and with some concern that we had regarding evidence that was given about development and oversight of strategies which Austrade uses. The Committee makes this point:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst the Committee appreciates senior officers being available to answer questions, it defeats the purpose of parliamentary scrutiny if too many questions have to be taken on notice. </PARA>
<PARA>What occurred and prompted that comment was that we had appearing before the Committee the General Manager of the Export Development Group of Austrade. I was concerned to ask him questions about strategies which Austrade had developed for particular categories of export. I was particularly interested in the category of therapeutic devices. My interest in that stems from having sat on the Public Accounts Committee inquiry into therapeutic goods, the publishing of a report, the various debates that have taken place in the lower House and will soon take place in this place, and the effect that that legislation will have on any marketing strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> When we come to debate the Therapeutic Goods Bill honourable senators will find that I will take issue fairly seriously with some of the statements made by the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, Mr Tickner, about my attitude to what is in that therapeutic goods report. We have in the Public Accounts Committee a practice of publishing whenever possible-and it has been my experience that this is the case-a unanimous report; therefore, that means that we have to accommodate all points of view. I will be arguing those later. The long and the short of it is that the legislation which is before the Senate now and which has been dealt with by the House of Representatives will impose great cost burdens upon Australian companies dealing with therapeutic devices. Some people are unkind enough to say that it imposes a tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I asked the good officer who appeared before the Committee whether he had a strategy concerning the export of therapeutic devices, to which I got an affirmative answer. Then I asked him to tell me something about it. He could not. Then I asked him how many other strategies he had. He said that he thought about 15 or 20. I asked him whether he could tell me about any of those, and he could not. Then I asked him-seeing that he had a strategy and that he was the export manager-for how long he had held that position. He told me three years. I asked him whether or not he was aware of the Public Accounts Committee report dealing with therapeutic goods. He had never heard of it. Then I asked him whether he was aware of the fact that at that stage the legislation which will impose these cost structures was before the House of Representatives. He had not heard of the Bill either. </PARA>
<PARA> I find that of grave concern. It prompted this comment in the report:</PARA>
<PARA> While the Committee appreciates senior officers being available to answer questions, it defeats the purpose of parliamentary scrutiny if too many questions have to be taken on notice. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a polite way of saying that the officer was not on top of his area. Austrade is a very important part of Australia's endeavour to become a competitive exporting nation. Austrade has a vital part to play. I am sure there are very many other things which Austrade is doing which are highly successful, well-informed and serving the nation in a good sense. But when this sort of thing occurs in a public hearing, when somebody is simply not on top of the work that that person is supposed to be doing, we can forgive the public for starting to lack confidence. The comment that I read out from the report is a very polite way of saying that it just will not do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can inform Senator McKiernan of what new developments there are in the Government's tree planting program because today I announced that $1.48m would be allocated to 20 tree planting projects throughout Australia. Those projects are located in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia and they involve activities such as tree planting to assist in controlling salinity, reversing the effects of eucalypt dieback, and rehabilitating land affected by over-clearing and mining. Tree planting is also undertaken on farms and for the enhancement of natural regeneration. The program under which we have allocated these funds is the national afforestation program. Already this year I have announced some 50 projects that have been funded under this program to the level of $6.5m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All of that funding is catalytic in nature-that is to say, the Commonwealth is not bearing the full cost of any such program. The Commonwealth is contributing funds to programs in which other costs are being put up either by the States or by commercial interests. The value of the total program is much more than the Commonwealth's contribution, but the Commonwealth's contribution makes such a program possible.</PARA>
<PARA> To conclude my answer I need to reply to the last part of Senator McKiernan's question. Earlier this week I think Senator Puplick asked me a question relating to why we were funding hardwood plantations in the Australian Capital Territory for the purposes of trialling them for fuel for wood-burning by consumers. The contribution trees and plantations make to the environment is vitally important and, in announcing the grants that I have awarded, I have referred to many contributions. But the significant point is that trees are sinks or traps for carbon dioxide; they consume carbon dioxide and generate oxygen. In that sense they make a positive contribution--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The memorandum of understanding makes it clear that the Commonwealth's contribution was to be $30m, with the exception of costs which might have arisen out of design changes that came about at the Commonwealth's instigation, or with the exception of fit-out costs. I understand that the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, Mr Holding, met with the New South Wales Minister a few days ago. The Commonwealth has made its position very clear; there is no doubt that the memorandum of understanding sets this down. We are surprised, particularly in view of previous discussions, correspondence and arrangements entered into between the governments, that at this late stage the New South Wales would make the claims which it has now made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Certainly, the Commonwealth holds strongly to the view that it should provide $30m, plus perhaps some small extra amount. There is an argument over whether the design of the American gallery alterations might have involved the Commonwealth in extra costs. I am not certain of the exact details of that, but we are talking of very small amounts-nothing like the $40m which was mentioned by Mr Hay yesterday. In fact, from estimates which the Commonwealth has been able to discover, the $70m figure was right out of the blue. We had believed that it was somewhat closer to $50m or $55m than it was to $70m.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is correct. It has to be remembered that, when Darling Harbour was getting under way a few years ago, the estimate of $30m was considered to be pretty close to the mark. There were massive blow-outs in construction costs at Darling Harbour and this is but one of them. However, the difficulty for the New South Wales Government is that the memorandum of understanding makes it quite clear-and I reread the language this morning-that the Commonwealth is up for $30m. I understand why that State would attempt to change that, given that it does not like to pay the bill; but pay the bill it shall.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Medicare levy arrangements ensure that payment is made according to a person's ability to pay, providing health cover for each according to need. It redistributes from the rich to the poor and from the healthy to the sick. It is a fair system for all and one which Australians overwhelmingly support. There is more than sufficient evidence of support for Medicare by ordinary Australians. Indeed, annual polling on that subject has shown that the incidence of approval has lifted from 55 per cent at the point of introduction to around 74 per cent now.</PARA>
<PARA> The Sydney Morning Herald article reveals an Opposition agenda to destroy that system of Medicare and to introduce regressive arrangements which favour the rich and hurt middle and low income earners. Another piece of its long awaited policy has now dribbled out, and it reveals that those who do not take out private health insurance will be forced to pay a levy or a tax penalty. That offers us repeats of the past, a rerun of the 1970s when Fraser had under his Government God knows how many versions of Medicare, which totally confused the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1975 Malcolm Fraser said, `We will maintain Medibank'. He then broke his promise and in 1976 introduced a system, like that which is now proposed, under which those who did not take out private health insurance were forced to pay a higher levy of 2.5 per cent. In other words, it was the big stick approach. The Opposition is now offering the same, although it is yet to reveal the level of the levy, in its seventh attempt at a health policy by the fifth Opposition spokesman on health. The opting out arrangements would mean a redistribution to people on high incomes who could find payment of flat rate insurance cheaper than current levy arrangements at the expense of low income earners who would pay more through an increased levy to make up the shortfall. It would destroy the stability, security and simplicity that Medicare offers to produce a costly, confusing mess. Just as happened in the 1970s, it could not be sustained and inevitably there would be constant change. All this is to solve a problem that does not exist.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition says that its aim is to resolve imbalances between public and private sections which are supposedly occurring under Medicare. The fact is that more people than ever before are being treated in our hospitals-both public and private-and that under Medicare the private hospital share of the total number of patients treated has actually increased. The Opposition is therefore proposing to destroy Medicare to fix up an imbalance which has not occurred, the result being, again, that the rich will pay less and the poor will pay more. That, from the Opposition, has a very familiar ring about it. It is another example of the capital gains tax syndrome of helping rich mates at the expense of the poor and the needy. The Opposition's pledge to destroy the capital gains tax would bring about the most massive redistribution of income from the poor to the rich in this nation's history. Now it is proposing to do exactly the same in health. On that basis, the Opposition's policy will obviously be rejected.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) secretariat report on trading policies which has criticised the United States of America for its increased protection for various industries and its inclination to use trade retaliatory measures outside the general agreement. I also refer him to the decision of the disputes panel of GATT earlier this year which upheld an Australian complaint that the United States (US) quotas on sugar imports are illegal under the GATT rules, and the United States commitment referred to in the GATT newsletter of July 1989 to agree to the adoption of this report. I ask: firstly, has the United States changed its trading policies and its commitment as a result of the GATT ruling?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are still some problems with US sugar import restrictions. The US announced on 12 September that the current US sugar quota year, which was to have ended in December 1989, would be extended until the end of September 1990 with an additional global quota of 860,000 tonnes being established. Australia is entitled to ship some 70,000 tonnes in the extended quota period. On a pro rata basis this announcement represents the status quo plus an increase in access for foreign suppliers of one to 2 per cent-that is all. In announcing the change to the quota, the Secretary of the US Department of Agriculture, Mr Yeutter, noted that this was not related to the recent GATT panel case on the US sugar quota system, but was to cover a market shortfall in the remainder of 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A GATT dispute settlement panel was set up at Australia's request in 1988. It found that the import quotas on sugar currently maintained by the US are, as Senator Macklin has intimated, inconsistent with GATT rules, and recommended that the US be asked to terminate these restrictions or otherwise bring them into conformity with the GATT. The panel's report was adopted by the GATT Council on 22 June this year.</PARA>
<PARA> The recent change to the quota system that I have described does nothing to bring the US into line with GATT rules. It leaves unclear the access to be permitted in the calendar year 1990. As to what we are doing about this, the endless process of bilateral discussions is under way again. Bilateral discussions on the means of bringing the US sugar import regime into conformity with the GATT have been held at officials level and, most recently, by the Minister for Trade Negotiations, Mr Michael Duffy, during his meeting with US Trade Representative Carla Hills and Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter in Washington in mid-October.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Zakharov's question relates to a most important aspect of the Federal Government's family policy. It is important for two reasons: it is an aspect that is very well targeted to areas of need, and it delivers substantial payments to those particular areas of need. The Senate probably does not need to be reminded, but the importance of this aspect of policy was highlighted I think in September 1987 by Bill Kelty, who said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Left to our own bargaining capacity, it would take at least 50 to 60 years to increase the lowest wage earners (to rates) represented in the family package.</PARA>
<PARA>Recognising the importance of the FAS, the Government has been keen to ensure access to it across the community. It should be said that the increase in access to FAS has been dramatic and impressive. In late 1987, in the vicinity of 60,000 families were receiving the family allowance supplement. This has now risen to 190,000 families. That amounts, on a general average over the two years, to something like 1,250 families per week signing up for FAS payments, which amounts to 7,700 children per week on a general average. There has been a dramatic increase in an area which delivers impressive financial support for families in need. At the moment, 190,000 Australian families are receiving benefits. That amounts to 1.2 million Australian children. It also amounts to more than 25 per cent of all children under the age of 16.</PARA>
<PARA> As I said, it is an enormous achievement in that it delivers tax free assistance to low income families. This increase in the number of those claiming has been brought about by a successful publicity effort by the Federal Government, particularly the Department of Social Security. As the average amount of FAS payments to families is about $50 per week and a quarter or so get extra rent assistance, we are really talking about a substantial contribution by government to areas of need.</PARA>
<PARA> Having achieved this, the campaign, as Senator Zakharov implies, needs to continue and it will continue. The strategy is to promote and encourage further awareness of FAS payments. It is a strategy which is targeted, for instance, to mothers in hospital at the time of the birth of children, to schools at the start of the school year and generally through radio and press advertisements. This is an important part of the Federal Government's social justice program. It is a responsible, well-targeted program which the Government will continue to promote in order to assist families in need.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator REYNOLDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister Humphreys is most concerned about the remarks attributed to Mr Bickle. I am not sure whether Mr Bickle was reported accurately, but his remarks are wide of the mark and could cause many in the ex-service community to worry unnecessarily about their future health care. As I have said before in this chamber, the Federal Government will always retain responsibility for the health care and treatment of veterans and war widows. Under this Government, veterans' health care is being sensitively and professionally delivered. This would not change with integration. It is, therefore, not true to say that veterans and their families might be `deprived of their rightful care' if the repatriation general hospital at Greenslopes were to be integrated into the Queensland hospital system. Both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs have said that there will be no integration if the ex-service community or staff associations have reasonable grounds for concern about the arrangements finally developed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In response to concerns expressed by some members of the ex-service community about guaranteed access and quality of care after integration, the Government has circulated a proposal which, if adopted, would effectively give veterans a private patient health care scheme. Many in the ex-service community see real advantages in such an arrangement. I draw that to Mr Bickle's attention.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in the Courier-Mail-I am not sure whether it is yesterday's or today's Courier-Mail-an advertisement was placed by the south-eastern district branch of the Returned Services League headed `Keep the Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital for the Veterans'. The Minister is disappointed that this advertisement, which has appeared on the eve of the Queensland State election, does not provide an accurate picture of the facts about proposed integration.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clearly, Senator Lewis will be interested in the answer and so I will give him the benefit of a fulsome answer. Yes, I did know about this investment; I was advised about it this morning. It is important because this is a large investment that is taking place at Whyalla. It is part of a strategic export development program of BHP, and most of the investment by BHP in steel, which has been very large since the formation of the steel industry plan, has been at Newcastle and Port Kembla. The new investment is in a high technology continuous caster at the Whyalla steelworks. BHP believes that this investment will provide higher quality structural sections and rails for the domestic market and will provide a significant boost to its export capacity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Work on the project will commence in early 1990 and provide over 200 new jobs during construction, and it will give a substantial boost to South Australian industry, with Australian content being around 80 per cent. I welcome this decision by BHP, which shows a high degree of confidence in being able to establish internationally competitive manufacturing operations in Australia. This latest $200m is in addition to the $650m already announced for new growth recently, and export projects for the steel division as a whole. BHP's announcement coincides with the publication today of the September quarter national accounts, which show that total private capital expenditure for the 12 months to the September quarter grew by over 13 per cent. This investment surge has come mainly from factory construction and equipment to fit out these factories. It represents, of course, a slight decline in investment in the September quarter, but from a very high base, and is an example of the productive investment phase currently under way in Australia. I should make the point that the October balance of payments, released last week, showed a 39 per cent increase for the month in the exports of machinery, transport equipment and manufactured goods.</PARA>
<PARA> This continued investment in the steel industry, an industry which produces cheap steel by world standards and which is based on both raw material advantage and technological advantage, is consistent with investments taking place in other sectors of the economy. For example, current investment in food processing is $225m in four different plants of which I am aware. In pulp and paper the investment currently is $300m. In chemicals it is $420m, with another $20m being announced today. Also, investment in basic metals is over $2 billion. In various sectors of the economy where capacity is desirably being enlarged, this investment is happening. The Government very much welcomes that and the BHP investment announced today is a further sign of it.</PARA>

As the Minister is no doubt aware, Myanmar, formerly Burma, is now reported to be moving towards reforming its trading practices by opening its doors after nearly 30 years of a centrally planned economy. The country's Trade Minister, Mr Abel, recently said that the Government realised that its trade and economy had to be boosted in order to move forward.

Australia has been and will remain at the forefront of those countries encouraging authorities to hold free and fair general elections and to improve the observance of human rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australian aid to Myanmar was suspended last year with the exception of some humanitarian aid under the United Nations Children's Fund and the Mandalay dairy development project on which work was resumed in March for reasons I have explained on the public record. As I said in Parliament on 15 August, I am not inclined to consider a full resumption of Australia's aid program unless and until there is substantial evident progress towards a restoration of human rights and electoral democracy. Australian Government assistance to economic reform in Myanmar must, of course, be subject to the same considerations.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the private sector, Australian companies are free to enter into joint venture agreements in the country on the basis of their own commercial judgments of the prospects and risks. The Government places no inhibition on such activity. Finally, I should say that it is clear that the opportunities for such activity will be much greater with the economic reform that would inevitably accompany political reform. That is the lesson being learnt all over the world at the moment from Vietnam to Czecho- slovakia.</PARA>

Will the Minister assure the Senate that he will ensure that no Australian military equipment will be exported to countries guilty of human rights abuses, and that sales will not be made to countries that are acquiring arms at `levels that are well beyond those needed for self-defence', as described by the Minister in his speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3554" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the subject of our disarmament credentials, I think Australia stands very proud. In the context of multilateral forums, our role particularly on nuclear issues is well known and appreciated, I hope, by Senator Dunn in regard to the comprehensive test ban, non-proliferation treaty, and so on. Of course, that has been translated into a regional context with our active support and promotion of the South Pacific nuclear free zone, which has recently been ratified into effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the conventional context, the major regional activity in which we have recently been involved in pursuing, among other things, our obligations under the particular resolutions to which the honourable senator refers is, again, chemical weapons. Our hosting of a regional seminar and a series of associated activities involved in raising consciousness about the implications of chemical weapons has been widely acknowledged and applauded not only in the region but elsewhere around the world. It was the subject of particular attention at the Government-industry conference on chemical weapons a little while ago and is an example which has subsequently been picked up elsewhere in the world, with Venezuela in particular indicating that it is about to launch a similar initiative in a Latin American context. So, whether we are talking about nuclear or conventional arms, Australia's credentials are impeccable.</PARA>
<PARA> On the subject of defence exports, I think that Senator Richardson has already addressed that matter today. The Minister for Defence is primarily responsible for the administration of that area, although there is a process of consultation between the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, the Attorney-General and me before any defence exports are permitted in accordance with our present Government policy. Government policy provides that the so-called controlled defence equipment will not be exported to governments that seriously violate their citizens' rights, unless there is no reasonable risk that the goods might be used against those citizens. The whole policy is premised on the assumption that other countries have the same right as Australia to provide for their defence. The guidelines which govern this are quite elaborate and make it clear that we will observe United Nations Security Council embargoes.</PARA>
<PARA> The policy is applied and enforced in the context that we remain concerned at the destabilising international effects of escalating arms supplies but continue to play an active role in the UN on effective monitoring of arms transfers. At the end of the day, we do not think-as Senator Dunn appears to-that there is anything fundamentally wrong about defence exports in an environment where, unhappily, armies still have to be supported and maintained because of the potential situations in which they can become involved in this complex world. But within that general policy we acknowledge the need to apply stringency and rigour in the way in which our exports are directed, and that is the way the policy is administered.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer to the Minister's new position on Cambodia announced last Friday, devised for domestic political reasons and described in the Sun-Herald editorial as `naive in the extreme'. Is it the case that the Minister's proposal will require the support of the Hun Sen regime? Will it not also require the support of the Khmer Rouge? If not, how can it be implemented without the support of these two particular Khmer factions?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3555" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad to hear that Senator Hill is lifting his game and getting some policy input now from media publications as sophisticated as the Sun-Herald. I am sure that will contribute no end to his appreciation of foreign policy constraints in the real world and to the formulation of Opposition policy because, clearly, there is nowhere to go but up with that particular foreign policy at the moment. In the context of the Opposition's Cambodia policy, I am reminded again that as recently as two weeks ago-mid-November-there was a major shift in Opposition policy, articulated by its Leader, Mr Peacock, adopting a new, hard-headed realistic approach to the Cambodian settlement which involved, among other things, a quite explicit recognition of the desirability of the Khmer Rouge having a role in a transitional administration. That is the position that was adopted with absolute clarity and vigour and without equivocation by Mr Peacock, and he has been scrambling ever since to recover the ground that he lost on that occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The policy adjustment that I explained in this place a few days ago was not premised in any way on domestic political considerations. It was premised on my judgment that, although there was a perfectly sound, logical and intellectual foundation for that particular aspect of the comprehensive settlement process, which involved a quadripartite transitional administration-an aspect obviously sound enough to appeal to Mr Peacock as recently as two weeks ago-the prospects of that approach being adopted were becoming more rather than less remote. This was not only because of the continued resistance of the Hun Sen administration in Phnom Penh to any suggestion of participation of any kind by the Khmer Rouge in a transitional administration, but also because of the way in which fighting was escalating, making it more and more difficult to contemplate those factions sitting down together and administering together the government of that country, and because of the way in which worldwide opposition was building up to the concept of any role being given to the Khmer Rouge in that context. Those considerations have been building up and becoming more and more apparent over time, but it was not until I had had the opportunity to canvass the concept of a United Nations (UN) controlled administration with a number of interlocutors that I felt it was timely to put that proposal on the public record.</PARA>
<PARA> This is not something that sprang full blown from my or my Department's brain in the last week or two; it is an idea that has been around for some time, advanced in particular by Stephen Solarz, the United States congressman, in one form. It is something I discussed with him in New York a few weeks ago. In particular, it was an idea that I felt it necessary to discuss and talk through with, among others, the visiting Deputy Prime Minister of Cambodia in the Hun Sen administration, Mr Kong Som Ol. As I have made clear on the public record, that conversation was very interesting because, notwithstanding my expectation that there would be an outright dismissal of this concept as not being realistic, to use Senator Hill's expression, in relation to a government that is exercising de facto control over the country at the moment, Kong Som Ol-I do not want to go into the details of the conversation-said that he accepted that this was something which might be worth considering further, and he undertook to consider it further, in discussion with Mr Hun Sen. No doubt that subsequently occurred, and I will be interested to see what the outcome is.</PARA>
<PARA> The initial reactions from elsewhere-through both public channels and private diplomatic channels-have not been in the slightest bit dismissive. Everybody, myself included, knows perfectly well what the practical constraints are in getting any agreement between not only the internal Cambodian parties but also the external parties. I have acknowledged frankly from the first moment that there are practical difficulties involved in getting Hun Sen to step back from his present position of de facto authority and, at the same time, getting agreement from the other factions, in particular the Khmer Rouge. I have noticed, as Senator Hill may have, Prince Sihanouk publicly expressing support for this particular concept. At the moment, he is working very closely with the Khmer Rouge, as we all know, within the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea. That is an interesting indication of what might happen. If the Khmer Rouge is to come further into this process it will need some incentive to do so in terms of the position that is adopted by China; but, again, that is true of every other proposal now on the table.</PARA>
<PARA> I make no claims for the practicability of this particular proposal other than that it is at least as practicable as any other proposal on the table. It is a darn sight more attractive than most such proposals on the table. I believe, not just on the basis of my own intuition but on the basis of the process of consultation I have already undertaken before putting this on the public record, that this idea will make a useful contribution to the further process of trying, not to score points about this but, for once, to bring to an end this tragic human conflict in Cambodia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It obviously cannot be implemented without the support of the Hun Sen regime. Whether it can be implemented without the support of the Khmer Rouge remains to be seen. Much depends not just on the position of the Khmer Rouge but on the Chinese Government standing behind it and continuing to supply it. Whether people are prepared to take risks with an isolation scenario in relation to the Khmer Rouge-which is the favourite solution of many people-depends very much, as I say, on whether external supply will continue to it. The Khmer Rouge stands to gain something from this particular proposal if its rhetoric is to be taken seriously about its willingness to ultimately participate in free elections in that country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The whole situation is very difficult and very complex-much more difficult and complex than the Opposition is capable of appreciating.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Contrary to the report in the Australian of 29 November, the decision to refuse the Cooke inquiry subpoenas for three Australian Electoral Commission staff to give evidence was not made by the Government. The decision was made by the Australian Electoral Commission, which, of course, is an independent statutory authority established by the Parliament to conduct Federal and industrial ballots. I am advised by the Commission that the decision was made on constitutional grounds. On the basis of the Commission's legal advice, State commissions of inquiry are not competent to compel the attendance of Commonwealth officers. Any attendance pursuant to the subpoenas that were issued could create unwelcome precedents on that basis alone. Furthermore, the Commission has current industrial ballot prosecutions in train which could be prejudiced if the officers were required to give evidence and be subjected to cross-examination on these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the suggestion that the Government might authorise the officers concerned to give evidence, the position is that it is not a matter for a government; it is really a matter for the Commission. I should add that the Commission is cooperating fully with the Cooke inquiry and has made and will make available to it everything that is on the public record and anything that any citizen may obtain under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. On the other hand, the Commission has also made it clear to the Cooke inquiry that it will not make available any material that is exempt from disclosure under the Privacy Act. As the matter is still before the Cooke inquiry and may be subject to further litigation, I will not in general comment further on it other than to say that the Cooke inquiry was essentially set up as a political exercise.

<PARA> In the interests of an early end to the devastating pilots' dispute, the need for the Government to instruct Australian Airlines to open discussions with the Australian Federation of Air Pilots to test the sincerity of the AFAP's claimed willingness to negotiate on pay, productivity, hours and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not surprised to see a large number of Australian Labor Party senators absent from this chamber because they have shown absolutely no interest in obtaining a settlement of this dispute. We are repeating the request that we have made consistently to the Government over a number of months to take a constructive approach to this dispute and try to get a settlement on proper terms. For many Labor senators it appears to be a matter which is extremely boring and not a matter of concern. I suspect that many people in the Australian community are also rather bored with the pilots dispute. But for others this is a matter of life or death. Many individuals and firms in the tourist industry have seen their livelihood struck down. If Labor senators are doing their jobs and spending any time in the community they will know that many people are desperate. I see that Senator Collins, who is going to participate in the debate today, is giggling away. Senator Collins comes from the Northern Territory which, as much as any other part of Australia, is being devastated by this dispute. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad to hear Senator Collins say that he does not think I can tell him anything about that. But I hope that Senator Collins is urging the Government to take a more constructive approach than it has adopted to this point and to make a more serious attempt to find a solution. As I go around Australia, I find increasing incredulity about the length of this dispute and at the failure of the major parties to seriously come to grips with the need for a settlement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We find all this happening in a context of common ground that there will be a very lengthy dispute. The estimate of the airlines is that it will be over six months before they can see a return to 80 per cent of capacity. That estimate was given not by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots but by the airlines themselves. We have had a whole series of reports on the very limited nature of the services being provided. Many of the estimates that have been given in this chamber and elsewhere about the services have been proven to be absolutely false. They have been described as pie in the sky by some commentators. Others simply reserve for themselves the right to correct the claims of capacity which have been made both by the airlines and by Ministers speaking as mouthpieces for the airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> On 31 October we read a report of the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that the pilots dispute was over. Of course, that brought a great horse laugh around Australia. But there was something less than a laugh on the faces of those people who have been directly affected. Within a day of the Prime Minister's saying that the dispute was over, Sir Peter Abeles told us that there might be a resumption of normal services by March of next year. More recently, the Australian Flight Attendants Association has told us that the idea of full services for Christmas is just a joke. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had confirmation after confirmation that this dispute is running on, that the capacity of the airlines to do the job that is required for Australia is not there and that for many individuals this is crushing. I was in Tasmania on Friday and Saturday. I met with people whose businesses and whose lives are being ruined by this dispute. They are completely bemused as to why the Government is not prepared to take some constructive step to try to encourage a full return to work. Over the last 24 hours I have been on the telephone with residents of the north-west of Western Australia who are suffering the most severe reduction in services available. Those people who are in businesses associated with the tourist industry are finding themselves decimated. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, the information which has come from Broome in the north-west of Western Australia is that accommodation capacity is down between 40 and 80 per cent-a 40 to 80 per cent downturn; hire cars are down 30 to 50 per cent; restaurants are down between 25 and 50 per cent; souvenir shops are down by up to 50 per cent; service stations are down between 10 and 25 per cent; the museum is down by 60 per cent; and so on. These are bare statistics but they reflect the destruction of an important sector of the Australian economy. They reflect a most destructive attack on the individuals who have put their life work and their life savings into this industry. Some people who have attempted a global commentary say that this will damage Australia to the tune of $3 billion-an Australia which is tumbling ever deeper into debt; an Australia, according to the figures published today, with reducing living standards and productivity. We have a situation where nothing constructive is being done. </PARA>
<PARA> We have speakers in this debate from the State of Queensland and from the Northern Territory. They can speak for their respective territories. But it ought to be understood by every senator in this place that in the north of Queensland, in the centre of Australia, in the north of Western Australia and in the State of Tasmania in particular, there is a total decimation of the tourist industry and there is, at the same time, an extraordinary long term blow being struck against the Australian economy. The impact on international tourism cannot be accurately measured as yet, but obviously it will be vast. </PARA>
<PARA> Everywhere I go I find this air of incredulity about what is going on. Everywhere I go I find the demand which has been made by the Opposition since August, that at least a testing of the possibility of a negotiated return to work on proper conditions be undertaken, picked up and examined by this Government. The most recent exposition of that I heard from Dr Brian Scott who, at a dinner held earlier this week by the Australian Manufacturing Council after he had received an award for export performance from a Minister in this Government, the Hon. Michael Duffy, presented a paper in which he talked about the things which need to be done in Australia. He talked about the imperative of this country coming to grips with internal economic reform. Let me quote what he said in that context about the dispute that we are debating here yet again in the Senate this afternoon. He raised the domestic airlines issue and he said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is not a dispute. In today's economic conditions it is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> We as a country cannot afford to have it continue any longer. Why can't there be a conference of all the parties tomorrow afternoon? Why cannot a foremost jurist or independent conciliator be asked to work out a solution within seven days? I believe that if a deadline was set for next Monday to reach a solution in the interest of Australia and of all Australians, then it could be met. We simply cannot afford to have it drag on any longer. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Collins will speak in this debate. He has spoken in a number of other debates. He has made the point that we should not advocate a surrender to the original unreasonable demands of the pilots. I make the point yet again that the Opposition has never believed that a surrender to the original industrial blackmail of the pilots was appropriate. The simple point that I make in the debate this afternoon is that it is common ground in respect of every commentator on this dispute, except the Ministers and the supporters of this Government, that the pilots were defeated on that demand months ago and, in fact, there is a capacity to deal with the pilots on the basis of full negotiations on all issues. I note that in earlier debates Senator Collins has conceded that in my statements-I have issued dozens during this dispute-I made the point that we do not advocate a surrender to industrial blackmail. We say that this is a classic situation where the pilots can get increased pay for productivity gains. Indeed, the contracts which have been offered by the airlines show that, because there are increases of up to 40 per cent for some pilots on the basis of the new schedules which have been put forward. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically there are three ways that this dispute could be dealt with. It can be dealt with by some form of effective arbitration; it can be dealt with by some form of negotiation and agreement; or it can be dealt with by toughing it out. The Government has chosen to support the third option. If the only alternative were surrender to an unreasonable demand that was going to do long term economic damage to Australia, I would be foremost in my support of that resistance. The point that I make is that there has been no effective arbitration provision put in place by this Government and it has left the Australian Industrial Relations Commission without authority to enforce its decisions. The Government has ignored the second constructive way out. Indeed, we say that the foremost way out is to have voluntary open negotiations between willing parties who, as employers and employees, seek to gain economic efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> What we say should be done today is quite clear. We have repeated the point made previously by me since August and made by Mr Peacock on behalf of the Opposition. First, we say that the Government should direct Australian Airlines Ltd immediately to enter into discussions with the Australian Federation of Air Pilots or any other nominated agent of the pilots to test the claimed willingness to negotiate on pay, productivity, hours and conditions. We believe that such discussion should be held before an independent third party or parties to establish whether there is a basis for a prompt and orderly return to work which provides for the required productivity gains. Secondly, we believe that the Government should immediately end compensation payments to the airlines. Thirdly, we say that in the interests of increasing competition in the Australian airline system, the Government should also authorise permanent interlining with foreign airlines with them being permitted to sell seats through travel agents to provide them with greater access to domestic routes. </PARA>
<PARA> We say that there is absolutely nothing to lose and everything to be gained by that course being followed. The record makes it quite clear that at the same time as we have been urging a process of testing the capacity to obtain a return to work by negotiation-statements have been made from the beginning of this dispute in August through to Mr Peacock's nine-point plan put forward on behalf of the Opposition on 18 September and widely advertised in the national press a few days later-there were renewed demands through the months of September, October and November. Honourable senators will find on the public record plenty of evidence that it is not just the Opposition which believes that that is a course which is open to the Government and, indeed, open to the airlines. Michael Stutchbury, writing in the Australian Financial Review on 25 October, put it quite simply. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> To the contrary, there is now nothing standing in the way of a quick resolution of the 10-week-old dispute apart from the stubbornness and grandstanding of the main combatants;</PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The airlines, the Government, the commission and the ACTU clearly have achieved their primary and justifiable goal of defeating the pilots' original 29 per cent pay grab and preserving the wages Accord. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of pay and conditions, the dispute has now degenerated into a stalemate over the federation's right to represent airline pilots. </PARA>
<PARA>While this Government and its supporters, including Senator Collins, are sticking by the tough it out philosophy and ignoring the possibility of a negotiated solution, the truth is that its constituents are going broke. The truth is that this country is being taken even deeper into a pit of difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA> We are saying that the Government was duty bound to test the offers which were made by the pilots. On 19 September, Captain McCarthy said on behalf of the pilots that they would return to work-first on a limited basis, and then full time if airlines began negotiations either directly with the Federation or through an independent arbiter. We find a similar offer being made early in October. How is that reported? It is reported that the Prime Minister crushed the pilots' bid to end the dispute. We find the pilots issuing a White Paper saying that there was a case for speedy resolution of their dispute. We find that in an appearance before a Senate committee clear statements were made by Mr McCarthy on behalf of the Federation about their preparedness to have their agreement certified in the Commission and to have it tested against the guidelines. Let me quote from what has been said within the last few days before the Senate Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Airline Pilots' Dispute. I will quote Captain McCarthy:</PARA>
<PARA> When we were in the IRC on 12 September and had finally heard the day before-because we could not talk to the companies, they wouldn't talk to us-the companies' proposition that this 55 hours equals 25 per cent productivity, we withdrew our 29.47 per cent log of claims. We took our pay section out of our contract and reinstated the companies' 55 hours 25 per cent productivity. </PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> We were prepared to have other matters in our contracts or our awards argued or negotiated or conciliated. We were prepared to have the President of the Industrial Relations Commission chair that conciliation. We were also prepared to waive our right to have him as an arbitrator, bearing in mind he had conciliated. In other words, we were saying yes to that, so I believe our previous award and the 55 hours pay and productivity are all within the system. We did not have a problem. Our only problem was the companies would never explain what they wanted. They said there was no point talking to them and all we wanted to do was to sit down and discuss it. </PARA>
<PARA>If I have to, I will say again that we did not and do not support the original demand. But we ask: Why is it that this Government is totally unprepared to see any direct negotiations with the people who still appear to represent the bulk of those who could give safe and immediate air services to this country and relieve the great economic damage which is being done?</PARA>
<PARA> The problem with this whole dispute is that the Government has given the wrong lead and sent all of the wrong signals. We have talked about that over and over again in this place. The Prime Minister's destructive, incendiary role in this dispute is widely understood in the community. We have had him on Perth radio last Friday, mealy-mouthed, trying to get out of the fact that there was a damages claim against the pilots. We all know that on 20 August-the Sunday before the Industrial Relations Commission hearing-the Prime Minister gave his unequivocal support to the imposition of heavy penalties on the pilots. We all know that. I will not give the full quote again because we know that he gave unequivocal support to those penalties. We know that a day later he declared war. He said, `You go out, boys, and it is war. It is a different game'. This is the Prime Minister who said that the pilots were like bus drivers. I am not quite sure whether he was trying to criticise bus drivers or just to denigrate the pilots, but clearly his abusive approach was part of cementing this dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> A little later down the track we find the Prime Minister saying that his credibility is on the line and that he should give up his job; he would not deserve to be Prime Minister if he could not deal with this matter. Well, he has not dealt with this matter. The matter is totally unsatisfactory. The dispute is one which is standing to run through to next year to the great destruction of this country and its economy. I say that the Prime Minister should heed his own words and should get out of his office as Prime Minister. We have had nothing but intemperate outbursts from him. We have had nothing but the wrong direction being transmitted to all of the participants in this dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators opposite that we had one of their number debating us on the Thursday before the Sunday of the Prime Minister's pronouncement of his total support of legal proceedings against the pilots. We were being given the Labor line that that was the worst thing that would exacerbate this dispute. I just remind honourable senators opposite of how much forbearance was shown by the Mudginberri disputants and the Dollar Sweets disputants before there was a leap into the common law remedies which made those disputes so famous and provided some indication that there are limits to industrial action in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had the declaration of war. We have had the abuse. We have had the leap into war footing before peace negotiations had been explored. We have had the refusal to acknowledge any role for the Federation. We have had the refusal to move when the original claim was defeated. I say again that it was clear within weeks of this dispute commencing that the pilots would not succeed in their dispute. We find the putting of the presentation of the accord ahead of all other national objectives and interests. We find the Prime Minister promising selective compensation and paying taxpayers' money in selective compensation to the airlines-again a disincentive to a realistic approach being taken to the settlement of this dispute. We find gross misinformation. We do not know whether the Government has been careless or dishonest. Senator Collins will no doubt have his catalogue of what he sees as misinformation coming from the pilots. But the truth of the matter is that Ministers in this place have had to correct their statements and have given conflicting statements because there has been a war of misinformation and confusion in this dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> We saw the destruction of the Federation being given primacy as a Government objective. The Opposition says that the prime objective should be to get a settlement of this dispute on proper terms. We believe that the pilots, having said again and again that they will negotiate all conditions through the Federation, should be put to the test on that. We believe that an early return to work could be negotiated. We believe that this is a situation in which the suffering which is being imposed on so many people could be ameliorated, and we believe that the Government has the blood of the tourist industry on its hands through the mismanagement of this dispute. We say that it is time that the Government washed some of this blood off its hands and encouraged constructive negotiations in this dispute. I believe that the Government should analyse the contribution that it has made to this dispute and should ensure that it does something to minimise the enormous damage which it has already caused to so many individuals and to our nation. </PARA>

<PARA> The quite ridiculous impression has been created by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots and picked up and run by this Opposition that the AFAP, and all the parties involved in this horrendous dispute, have not had endless opportunities to do precisely what Senator Chaney wants people to do: to sit down and to negotiate. The lie to that was given again and again in evidence to the Senate Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Airline Pilots' Dispute, to which Senator Chaney has just referred. He has certainly been very selective in his reading of the transcript of evidence before that Committee. One other part of the transcript which I would like to refer Senator Chaney to sets out the very positive statements by the representatives of the peak bodies representing the tourism industry of Australia, which is suffering so badly, that the pilots' so-called offer to go back to work until Christmas, and then to put everything back on the boil after Christmas, is not an offer at all but a nonsense. It was the tourist industry and the representatives of the peak bodies of the organisations that are bleeding to death that asserted that to the Senate Committee. Senator Chaney, like Chamberlain coming back from Munich, waved around the piece of paper that the Federation waved around in front of our Committee. It is relevant to question the context in which they waved it around. Senator Chaney is perfectly correct when he says--</PARA>

<PARA>Of course, that is a stark comparison with what Mr Peacock said, but nevertheless there it is. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The Industrial Relations Commission would set wages for the majority of Australia's workers and-after being given new teeth to enforce compliance-would be stronger under a Coalition government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, Senator Lewis is not nodding now. Let us turn to the contribution that the Opposition might make to the industrial relations chaos that will so surely ensue if it takes government. In a document entitled A Federal Coalition Government-the First 12 Months-an interesting 12 months it would be-Senator Chaney delivered a speech to the Industrial Relations Research Centre symposium in Sydney and said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not surprising that the changes we will be pursuing next year are very close in shape to those that John Fahey has outlined for New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed they are. Let us have a look at what the reaction has been to this wonderful initiative in industrial relations-the John Fahey proposal in New South Wales that Senator Chaney says the Opposition's industrial relations policy is modelled on. Indeed it is. Another article with the headline, `Enterprise Tax Bill Won't Work Say Bosses and Unions' states:</PARA>
<PARA> Representatives of the Metal Trades Industry Association, the Australian Chamber of Manufacturers and the Employers Federation of New South Wales told Mr Fahey on Wednesday that the Bill would cause a wages explosion. </PARA>
<PARA>This is precisely what the Government has been saying about this idiot proposal of the Opposition. The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> They said that once workers moved outside the centralised wage fixing system and struck individual work agreements between an employer and a group of workers, only the militant unions would win. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is a fact and it points out the absurdity of the Opposition's approach to negotiating something like this in its industrial relations regime. What the Opposition has not identified and the question that has never been answered in this debate is: With this combination of a rigid teeth-infested centralised system of wage fixation in association with a collective bargaining system-and how we have the two together I do not know-how do we determine who opts in and who opts out?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have read the policy. Senator Chaney has just said that they decide who stays in and who opts out. Indeed, that then determines who will win under the system. It is the militant unions. There is no more militant union in this country, nor has there been for the last 30 years, than the AFAP.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This then gets down to the point I am making. I am glad that Senator Chaney is making my points for me. Senator Chaney has said that it is up to the parties to opt out of the system if the parties make that decision. At the same time we are debating a motion in this Parliament that asks the Government to direct, not encourage, persuade or plead with, only one of the parties-and there are numerous parties in this dispute-to vary its negotiating stance; to remove the condition that it has placed to operate within the central wage fixing system; and to cut off its legs so that the AFAP, this militant union, will be able to dictate the negotiations on its own terms. Do honourable senators opposite call those negotiations?</PARA>
<PARA> I have to say that one good thing about the motion which is before us today is that it makes transparent just what a hypocritical Opposition this is in terms of this pilots dispute. The timing of this motion is a disgrace. Senator Chaney talked about people being given an opportunity to meet together. They will have the opportunity, as Senator Chaney knows, at 4 o'clock tomorrow afternoon in the Industrial Relations Commission (IRC). The Industrial Relations Commission has bent over backwards, as the transcript shows. To the best of my knowledge it has offered at least four olive branches to the AFAP. Tomorrow it will offer the fifth. The Industrial Relations Commission bent over backwards again last week, having set a deadline and, at the request of the AFAP, it extended by another week to allow that union to organise itself. But to bring this debate on and to move this motion-and I hope it will not be carried-does not assist in the resolution of this dispute one iota. The Opposition has brought on this motion less than 24 hours before the IRC is to consider this dispute once again and offer the fifth olive branch to the AFAP tomorrow afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> The timing of this motion is transparent; it is hypocritical and opportunistic in the extreme. The suggestion that the Government should instruct one of the parties in this dispute to a given course of action, and none of the others, is at variance with the Opposition's general principles that government business enterprises should be free of political interference; and it contradicts the Opposition's own policy of keeping the Government out of individual industrial disputes. Senator Chaney has just said, `The parties opt out of the system'. Under this proposal, of course, the Government will then chase them. This is Stalinist stuff, not collective bargaining. It would unilaterally undermine the position of other employers in this dispute and it would cut across the proceedings that are currently under way in the most rational forum, I do not hesitate to say, for negotiating industrial agreements in this country, that is, the Industrial Relations Commission-I might add that the Opposition and Senator Chaney have supported that proposition-and it would also cut across all of the outstanding matters that are currently before the Victorian Supreme Court. In other words, it is an irresponsible and criminal suggestion to make to this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I advise honourable senators, as they may not know this, that it would also undermine the efforts of the non-AFAP pilots to set up their own enterprise bargaining units by letting the AFAP back into the system under its own terms. It is not entirely clear what would happen if such an ultimatum were issued by the Government, as the Opposition wants it to be; nor is it clear from the Opposition's motion what the parties would be negotiating about once they got together. For example, what would the Opposition propose for the non-AFAP pilots who have indicated that they have no intention of being covered by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots? Would the Opposition wash its hands of any agreement which got the planes straight back into the air but denied non-AFAP pilots the right to be represented by an association of their choice? I can assure the Senate that that is going on at this very moment and the AFAP has no-one to blame for that situation but itself. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to have a look briefly, because it deserves to be looked at, at the Supreme Court decision in this case. I am very familiar with the Mudginberri dispute. I was Leader of the Australian Labor Party in the Northern Territory when it occurred and I know what happened in that dispute. I think I could be forgiven for saying that it is my view that the one thing that the famous Mudginberri dispute, the Dollar Sweets dispute and this dispute have in common is that all the unions associated with each of these disputes have blundered badly in the industrial relations strategy and tactics that they have employed. </PARA>
<PARA> There are strong arguments for not getting too carried away, as the Opposition has been carried away, by this decision in the Supreme Court. I notice that certainly some people in the Australian Council of Trade Unions are not getting carried away with it. The facts are that this matter is still before the court and may be subject to appeal. The level of damages has not yet been set and we cannot assume that the full $10m claim will be awarded. I have noted that it has been generally agreed by all commentators, including Mr Michael Kroger on the PM program of 23 November, that the case breaks little new ground. It does not. By any standards, the action of the pilots is so extreme, and this dispute in terms of its duration so untypical, that it is hard to envisage any parallels arising out of this dispute that can be applied to other disputes. </PARA>

The cost to industrial parties and to the public at large of going outside the accepted rules-that is, outside the system-is the only lesson we can safely draw from the decision handed down by the court last Thursday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is clear that pilots currently employed by the existing operators-and there are large numbers of them-no longer wish to be represented by the AFAP. Mr McMahon, in response to a question from me the other day before the Senate Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Airline Pilots Dispute confirmed a story that I had heard-I have since had it confirmed by Australian airlines-that active negotiations and discussions are going on among the hundreds of pilots who are currently employed by both airlines to form their own industrial association. I am told that East-West Airlines Ltd has already done it, as has the Interstate Parcel Express Co. (IPEC). It has been done in those cases on an informal basis out of sheer convenience. The employers need someone to talk to; they do not want to talk to their entire pilot body. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is also my information-although I do not know whether it is correct-that 20 pilots employed by IPEC have written to Commissioner Paine. I stress that there are 20 of them. IPEC has now employed all the pilots it wants to employ. It used to employ 40; it now needs only 20. I understand-but I could be wrong-that the pilots have written to Commissioner Paine saying that they do not want a bar of the AFAP. That will be interesting in terms of a conference taking place before the Commission, perhaps on Monday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no constitutional or legal impediment to these associations of employees seeking to become parties to those draft awards-or seeking other enterprise agreements with the airlines-under the existing regime and not, I say to Senator Chaney, under the Opposition's policy. Under the new provisions contained in the Industrial Relations Act, sections 118 and 196, the IRC has a wide discretionary power to decide whether it wishes to register such associations. Given that the AFAP currently has no members employed under the relevant awards, it is not unlikely, in my view, that the Commission would register new enterprise unions, even those with fewer than 1,000 members, and give them coverage of employees to the full or partial exclusion of the AFAP. I say this with no great joy: the AFAP has done what the article in the Australian Aviation magazine said in November that it had done. I quote from both the opening and closing paragraphs of this excellently researched article. The first paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA> The latter half of calendar year 1989 will go down in Australian history as the period when the nation's single strongest and most successful union, the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, literally committed industrial suicide. </PARA>
<PARA>The final paragraph of the article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Like a fight to the death there has been no winners in this most mindless and ill conceived dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>So strongly supported by the Opposition, I might add. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The once proud Australian air transportation system and the booming tourism industry that lived beside it lies in ruins as do the future of many of its principal players. That the AFAP could misjudge a tactical situation in so gross a manner is something that will go down in industrial relations history as being as poorly thought out as Hitler's attack on Russia in 1941. Indeed, for all concerned the results will be the same. </PARA>
<PARA>I, as do, I am sure, other responsible members of this chamber, plead with the AFAP, rather than this Senate passing this idiot motion, which will only exacerbate the dispute by cutting the ground out from only one of the parties in the dispute, to take the last opportunity that is being offered to go before the IRC tomorrow afternoon at 4 o'clock and agree to the three reasonable conditions that have been laid upon it-that is, to remove, as Senator Chaney wants removed, the barrier and intimidation placed on recruiting pilots for the airlines and to indicate that it will operate within the system and will abide by the decisions of the Commission. They are hardly onerous requests. If the pilots do that they may salvage their union, but that is about all they will salvage at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth while having a look at what the AFAP has cost its members. It has so far cost its members their jobs, their seniority, their conditions of employment built up over the last 30 years, the redundancy payments they would have received under a restructured industry, an average salary loss of $30,000 and the respect of their fellow Australians and, I suggest, if they do not take this last chance, offered to them tomorrow afternoon, their union as well. It is almost impossible to conceive that, if the AFAP had gone into the IRC on day one and had not so drastically misjudged this dispute, its members would now have their jobs and existing conditions, all of the conditions built up over the last 30 years, their seniority, their bidding system, perhaps even the Ford LTDs they demanded as part of their so-called negotiations and, at the same time, a minimum in my view, of a 12 per cent increase in their salaries with a very good chance of 15 per cent. When we compare that position with the position I have just outlined, we can see that the actions of the AFAP are unbelievable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My contribution to this debate will be brief. It is the fifth occasion on which we have risen to discuss matters of public importance or urgency in relation to this issue, and I think the position of the Australian Democrats has been made perfectly clear to the Senate. We will not be supporting this urgency motion, for reasons which I will briefly state. I begin by giving the Senate an assurance that Senator Collins and I have not spoken about the positions and arguments we were going to advance in relation to this proposition. It happens to be a coincidence that I am about to make quite a number of the points that he has very forcefully presented in the last 15 minutes. Perhaps that is an indication that the points of rebuttal in relation to this urgency motion were so patently obvious that two independent people sitting separately came up with many of the same points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Obviously, this dispute is very confusing. It is one which has evoked very divergent reactions. Clearly, it has become one of the most divisive issues that have confronted the Australian community in recent decades. Even the informed opinion about the issue is patently divided. By sheer coincidence about 15 minutes before I came in here the latest issue of the IPA Review crossed my desk. Most know that the IPA Review is produced by the Institute of Public Affairs. It is clearly stated on the cover that it is Australia's journal of free enterprise opinion. Therefore, its position is fairly obviously stated. On page 17 of the current issue there is a very interesting table which is an attempt to rationalise, if you like, the informed opinion in the Australian community about the pilots dispute. It states the position of various leading metropolitan dailies and the leading commentators. It cites them as supporting the accord, which is the Government's position, as being neutral, or as opposing the accord, which is the Opposition's position. It shows a scattering of opinion-and we are talking about informed opinion-of people such as Padriac McGuinness, John Slee, Paul Kelly, Laurie Oakes, Peter Costigan, Mike Taylor, Kenneth Davidson, Geoff Kitney, Bruce Jones, Max Walsh and John Wright, the leading commentators of the leading metropolitan dailies. In fact, the score comes out that about a third take one position, a third take the other, and a third admit to being neutral. Those who are in both positions admit to being confused about the nature of the issue. It is not a clear-cut issue. Senator Chaney began his delivery as he has every time he has addressed this issue, by stating essentially the same proposition, that the position to be taken is clear-cut, when quite obviously it is not. The issue is one of the most confused, confusing and divisive and evokes the most divergent opinion we have seen recently. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to read the proposition before us because it suggests considerable bias. I do not suppose that that is surprising, invalid or unacceptable. We are debating as a matter of urgency the proposition:</PARA>
<PARA> In the interests of an early end to the devastating pilots' dispute-</PARA>
<PARA>there would certainly be no disagreement that we need an early end to it or that it is devastating-</PARA>
<PARA>the need for the Government to instruct-</PARA>
<PARA>and that is a key word-</PARA>
<PARA>Australian Airlines-</PARA>
<PARA>that is also significant because it is selective and exclusive to one of the two airlines-</PARA>
<PARA>to open discussions with the Australian Federation of Air Pilots to test the sincerity of the AFAP's claimed willingness to negotiate on pay, productivity, hours and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>The suggestion clearly is that only one party should be challenged about its willingness and sincerity and that only one airline should be instructed to pursue these questions of negotiation, sincerity and willingness. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe-and obviously every Australian would agree-that this dispute has been absolutely devastating. However, unlike the Opposition, which chooses to blame the Government totally for this devastating dispute, and unlike the Government, which chooses to blame, essentially, the pilots for this devastating dispute, the Australian Democrats believe that no party to the dispute is without blame. In that respect the dispute is clearly different from many of the disputes which Australians are asked to ponder. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no party to this dispute which is without blame. The Government declared war on the pilots at the beginning of the dispute. Quite clearly, in one respect it was unwise in taking such a strong position. Perhaps it was unwise in its choice of words but in choice of strategy I do not believe that the Government was unwise. There was an enormous amount at stake. Virtually the future of the Australian economy in the immediate short term was at stake. We will pay the price in the short term. The outcome will be and is the devastation in the short term of the Australian economy. The Government was right to recognise that. It was right to take a strong stand. Perhaps it was wrong in its choice of words. Perhaps the Prime Minister's attitude and manner were unfortunate in some respects, for example, in his declaration of war at the beginning of the dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> The airlines, especially Ansett, have used the dispute as an excuse to restructure their organisations at minimum cost and inconvenience to themselves in terms of public scrutiny and actions in anticipation of deregulation. Quite clearly Sir Peter Abeles and Ansett are going to be the winners in this dispute. The ultimate winner will be Sir Peter Abeles. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has handed much to Ansett on a plate. The pilots started by saying that they would negotiate, but not within the system, not before the Industrial Relations Commission and not concerning the size of their wage rise. That was not an offer to negotiate at all. So when Senator Chaney said that there were three possible approaches to resolving the dispute-arbitration, negotiation and toughing it out-and cited that the Government took the wrong strategy by attempting to tough it out, suggesting that negotiation was the only way to go, that way to go was cut off by the pilots literally on day one. So it is not legitimate to say that there are three options open. The only option that is acceptable and that was ever acceptable in the first place is the one that is now in place. It is taking its time and it has not delivered the goods, but let us at least give it until tomorrow. I refer to the process of arbitration which is currently in place. We should not judge it at least until the next 24 hours see whether it will to some degree deliver to us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No parties in this dispute are blameless. I would like to talk about the pilots' attitude. The attitude of the pilots at the beginning of this dispute was arrogant and high-handed. They assumed that they had the upper hand and were willing to throw the country into absolute chaos to achieve their demand of a 30 per cent wage rise. They were motivated by pure greed and they must have believed that they were so indispensable to the smooth running of the country that their demands would be met and that they would go back to work in a short period of time bearing the gifts and having reaped the harvest. Of course, the very opposite has occurred. Senator Collins, in the last minute of his speech, cited the extraordinarily devastating implications of the pilots having pursued that false strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> To a certain extent I suppose the pilots were right. The withdrawal of their services has thrown the country into economic chaos. Many small businesses have gone bankrupt. Many families have been massively disadvantaged. The lives of millions of Australians have been disrupted. The harm which this dispute has caused will continue to be felt by every one of us for a long time. So in some respects the pilots did have power, but they abused it to our disadvantage and to their own devastating disadvantage. However, we have now gone a long time without the services of these pilots. Surprisingly, we are even beginning to adapt to it. </PARA>
<PARA> In what extraordinary ways we have adapted to this imposition on us. We have called in our Royal Australian Air Force. We have devastated its morale, and tempted pilots out of the Air Force into civil pilot positions-many of them at the first available opportunity because they have had a taste of some of the rewards. But because they have not had all of them their morale has been dramatically affected. We have the ironic position of having had half the pilots exit from the existing system anyway. If one does a count now, one finds that half of them are overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Another extraordinary irony was that just a matter of about three or four months ago I was in Yugoslavia with the President of the Senate and the Yugoslavs put a plea to us. `For heaven's sake, let us have one more flight per week into Australia' they said. This was JAT. What an extraordinary irony it is that now, when I and other Australians go out to get a domestic flight from Sydney to Adelaide, we find that Yugoslav Airlines is virtually our domestic airline. One could go on and on about the outcomes of this dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> Many business people have discovered that they can conduct most of their affairs just as easily over the phone, with the use of information and communications technology, just as efficiently and far cheaper than by turning up in person. It will be a long time before businesses go back to their former levels of airline bookings. That might be seen as one of the few pluses which have come out of the process. The pilots have certainly discovered that they are not as indispensable as they had thought. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably the most significant point to be made here is that the timing of this motion is desperately bad. It can only be borne out of opportunism-three days before a State election and with two broadcast days left. The Opposition grabs at this dispute to gain a few cheap political points in the time that is available. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. We have lost count of the number of times the Opposition has brought this proposition forward in the form of an urgency motion. It is ironic and perhaps extremely unfortunate that the Industrial Relations Commission has given the Australian Federation of Air Pilots the opportunity to rejoin the industrial award system tomorrow. An irascible union that has proven itself to be temperamental now finds itself being prodded and abused by a debate, an unnecessary debate in our view, in the Senate less than 24 hours before the processes of arbitration, hopefully, come to fruition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Collins has already cited the irony of the fact that here we have the Opposition advancing a strategy to resolve this dispute which is in complete contradiction to the principles which underlie-the Opposition says-its industrial relations policy. In other words, Opposition members say they are not centralists, that they are decentralists, yet here they are advocating centralism in its most extreme form. In fact, Senator Collins referred to it as virtually neo-Stalinism. I have long since stopped expecting logic in debate on this particular issue. Yet I suppose it is not surprising that when we look into the proposition being advanced here today, three days before the State election, cheap opportunism being its motive, we should not look for logic because there is not any there. In fact, there are profound contradictions. Frankly, I intended to be much briefer in my contribution to this debate because the Australian Democrats simply refuse to identify with this opportunism and with the contradictions which are fundamental to the argument that Senator Chaney has advanced today. Therefore, the Australian Democrats will be opposing this urgency motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have much pleasure in speaking to this motion which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA> In the interests of an early end to the devastating pilots' dispute, the need for the Government to instruct Australian Airlines to open discussions with the Australian Federation of Air Pilots to test the sincerity of the AFAP's claimed willingness to negotiate on pay, productivity, hours and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>We are involved in what is now certainly the longest major dispute that this country has ever suffered. It is certainly the most expensive and the true cost of it will not be known for many years; indeed, the cost will not be borne for many years, but it runs into billions of dollars. It is a dispute as vicious as any in our turbulent history, and sadly there is no end in sight, given the Government's policies. This is a dispute that never should have happened. It should have been resolved months ago. Indeed, there have been many opportunities for it to be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason why it has not been resolved is the fault of the Federal Government. Initially the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) bought into the fight in a most inflammatory way when he had no business at all to be involved. We then had a generous compensation scheme, where the floodgates for taxpayers' funds were opened to the airlines, giving them an incentive to keep on with the dispute and not resolve it. Given those circumstances, there is no way that it is going to be resolved. The Government could have forced the parties to negotiate, because it is very clear that the national interest is involved. Instead, the Government has conspired to prevent any meetings taking place between the airline management and the Australian Federation of Airline Pilots. </PARA>
<PARA> I listened with great interest to the contribution made by the previous speaker, Senator McLean. I suggest to him that if this matter does go to arbitration there will not be any speedy resolution. This is a protracted matter. I say quite unequivocally that the Industrial Relations Commission (IRC) would welcome support from the Senate for this motion, because negotiations will certainly be involved in settling the dispute. It will not be settled just by a straight directive from the IRC. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has made the point that the dispute cannot be resolved without discussion. If one believes that discussion is not needed, one is implying that the airlines can rebuild with new recruits, but that is palpably untrue. They have involved themselves in a massive recruiting campaign overseas, spending millions of dollars, and it has been a total failure. They are struggling along with numbers that are far below what they require even to run the meagre services that are being offered to the Australian public at the present time. In fact, well over half the aircraft flying and probably 60 or 70 per cent of the crews available to fly in Australia today are from overseas. That is a measure, 14 weeks later, of how effective the airlines have been in the rebuilding process. So, one is driven inexorably to the proposition that there has got to be discussion with the Federation to reconstitute the airline system in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> When the history of this dispute is written, the Liberal Party and National Party will be seen to have followed the correct approach. Over 12 weeks ago the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) was suggesting the proposition that is embodied in this motion today. The honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), the shadow Minister for tourism, aviation and sport in the House of Representatives, Senator Chaney, and many other of us right from the outset have been calling for reason and negotiation to take place so that this crippling dispute can be resolved. What have we got from the Government? Not even a hearing-just criticism for the creative moves that we have tried to make in the national interests. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not propose to dwell very long on the origins of this strike. It is really not terribly important, except that we must look at the origins so that we can make sure that the dreadful mistake that has been made over this dispute does not occur again ever in our lives. As I have said on many occasions, I believe that the pilots were very badly advised at the outset. I think they were wrong to have gone about the matter in the way they did, and it is reasonable that they should suffer some censure for what they have done. But to propose that they be treated as non-persons, that the union not be recognised, and to have them face total annihilation as a professional body is absolutely unreasonable and it does not help anyone. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other side, clearly, the airlines were spoiling for a fight. There is a very long list of management grievances that they have against the pilots. If I may be so bold as to say so, many of the problems that we face today arise from poor management decisions in the past, weak management decisions, decisions that simply were not thought through. A number of senior people in the airlines have admitted that to me privately. Let us not lay the blame all on one side. We are in a position today where the airlines simply will not negotiate. We have the pilots who are ready to negotiate. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to take a few minutes in this debate to read what has been put on the public record through the current Senate Select Committee into Certain Aspects of the Airline Pilots' Dispute. The President of the Federation said on Tuesday, 21 November-and I read from the Hansard:</PARA>
<PARA> At the beginning of this dispute we said to the companies that we were quite prepared to have our agreement certified in the Commission and to have it tested against the guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA>That was right at the outset. They were quite prepared to have it tested against the wage guidelines. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> When we were in the IRC on 12 September and had finally heard the day before-because we could not talk to the companies, they would not talk to us-companies' proposition that this 55 hours equals 25 per cent productivity, we withdrew our 29.47 per cent log of claims. We took our pay section out of our contract and reinserted the companies' 55 hours, 25 per cent productivity. Because our old award was under the system, the 55 hours, 25 per cent productivity was covered by the guidelines, or so it was agreed by the companies and the Commission, and we said what we wanted to do was then have that as a new log of claims. We were prepared to have other matters in our contracts or our awards argued or negotiated or conciliated. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the pilots federation, by 12 September, was prepared to negotiate on any terms and it could find no-one to talk to it. It goes on and on. The Chairman of the Select Committee, Senator Cooney, said on two occasions:</PARA>
<PARA> You say at all times you have been willing to go to conciliation under the auspices of the Industrial Relations Commission. If that failed were you then willing to go to arbitration?</PARA>
<PARA>Captain McCarthy replied:</PARA>
<PARA> That is what we said on 12 September when we withdrew our log, put in our old award but took out the pay section and put in the companies' figures. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, the Chairman came back to him for confirmation, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> CHAIRMAN-When we come to writing the report we can say that at all times the Federation has been willing to go to conciliation under the Industrial Relations Act and, if that did not succeed, then to proceed to arbitration under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Captain McCarthy-Yes, but as a starting point we believed that we wanted to start with our previous award, not one that was a take it or leave it, non-negotiable private contract handed down. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the position of the pilots federation. We are not passing judgment on whether that is a true or false position. We are saying that, for goodness sake, let us have the commonsense to negotiate with the pilots and test it. The way to test it, as Senator Chaney has suggested, is by the Government directing its own company, the company that we all own, Australian Airlines Ltd, to enter into negotiations to see whether the dispute can be solved. Clearly, anyone with a modicum of commonsense can see the wisdom in that. The alternative that we are left with is that the Labor Party wants to continue with the dreadful economic morass that we are in. I have dealt with the matter of the wage guidelines. On Captain McCarthy's record, it was never an issue with him. </PARA>
<PARA> The central point I would make about the guidelines is that they are a creation of the Hawke Government. They have failed, Mr Deputy President. The proof that they have failed is the rampant inflation, the declining productivity, the intolerable interest rates and the huge and escalating overseas debt that we have today. One of the reasons the dispute has not been resolved is the central involvement of the Prime Minister. My own view-and I am happy to give this advice to the Prime Minister without charge-is that he should have held the high ground and been detached and objective about the matter. Instead, this man, whose reputation was built on his negotiating skills, has turned out to be a total failure. In fact, he even argues now that the dispute does not exist. </PARA>
<PARA> Like you, Mr Deputy President, I have a deep interest in defence. I spend a lot of time reading biographies of generals and military histories. It is a well recognised psychopathological state in failed generals that, when they are looking at unmitigated disasters that they have brought about themselves, they cannot recognise the dimension and magnitude of them. General Percival displayed in Singapore the syndrome peculiar to failed generals who are faced with an enormous disaster that their faulty planning has brought about. They refuse to recognise reality. Tragically, we are seeing today precisely the same psychopathology in the Prime Minister when he says that there is no dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment, the airline companies simply will not negotiate. Between the four of them they must be losing millions of dollars a day. I would estimate that the major airlines are losing more than $1m a day each. But this loss has been cushioned for them enormously by the subsidies they are getting. This Labor Government, with its strike breaking by allowing the use of overseas labour and the military forces, is paying a huge amount in subsidies to the airlines. So the airlines keep operating. They get compensation for not standing people down. They have received about $58m in subsidy from the Services in terms of the provision below cost of service aircraft. Also, Civil Aviation Authority and Federal Airports Corporation charges have been waived. This is not a matter of $10m or $20m, as Mr Keating says: they are the beneficiaries of hundreds of millions. We must cope with the absolutely enormous cost of this to the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, I return to the point of view of the airlines. The airlines are doing nothing to recognise this national loss. We hear a great deal about their losses. But there is not a word of compassion from them about the travelling public of Australia or about the tourist industry, which is being reduced to bankruptcy because the airlines will not negotiate. All we get from the airlines are false statements and lies about schedules and pilot recruitment. In addition, there are all the vicious things that have occurred endlessly, such as the cancellation of advance purchase excursion fares and the abrogation of contracts. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably I do not have time to go too far into those matters this afternoon but I will say something about the detailed effects of this dispute on my own State because it is there that it pinches. Queensland is suffering more as a consequence of the dispute than any other State. It has already lost over $100m. Of course, the Prime Minister is so sensitive to the issue that he simply will not come into Queensland and the Queensland Labor Party does not want to see him there. He sneaked into Mount Isa-his sole visit during the current campaign in Queensland-and even then there was a riot. The union movement in Mount Isa bailed him up because its members simply cannot move out of that very isolated town. The Opposition Leader, Mr Goss, was challenged by the Mount Isa Trades and Labor Council representative and forced to admit that he supported the divisive and costly actions of the Prime Minister during the dispute. Since then, we have not had a word on the matter from Mr Goss, Senator Burns, Senator Reynolds, Mr Gayler or Mr Lindsay-the very people in the northern part of Queensland who owe so much to the people whose welfare they are looking after. What do they do? They go into the Caucus and put up their hands in support of $38m or $60m-whatever it is-for Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd, a profitable American company. But there is not one red cent for the people in their own State in the tourist industry who are bleeding to death. </PARA>
<PARA> The time has long past for talking about this matter. The Government has the power, as it has always had, to show leadership, to show that it is concerned about the welfare of this great country. It must arrest this devastating strike. We will lose nothing at all by testing the bona fides of the pilots federation. This is not something that happened yesterday. We have on public record that, from 12 September-nearly three months ago-the Federation said that it was prepared to negotiate on all elements of the contract. For goodness sake, let us test that and work towards resolving this dispute instead of defending some archaic failed economic policies and defence of unions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will try to speak to the motion and not wander all over the place as some other senators have. Senator Chaney made a couple of points that I would like to answer. He spoke about the need to return to normal. I read an article in the press recently which said that the airlines collectively had 2,000 empty seats and would have to do a lot of work to fill them. It is clearly understood that, as the dispute has progressed, considerably fewer people are flying or may fly when the dispute is settled. Therefore, I do not think there is such a really drastic problem now for people in the community and in tourism although, admittedly, there was a problem earlier.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Chaney talked about the question of testing the negotiating capacity to reach a solution. As a step towards that, he said the Government should instruct Australian Airlines Ltd to enter into those sorts of negotiations. The fact is that the pilots have shown that they have no sincerity in terms of negotiating, and I will show that shortly by quoting some of what they have said. Senator MacGibbon quoted a statement that the airline pilots were quite prepared to negotiate a registered agreement and have it tested against the guidelines. Let us look at what has actually happened. Initially, I want to make three vital points. First, the campaign by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP) for a 30 per cent increase to their average salary of $78,000 was planned and coldly calculated for at least six months. Secondly, the AFAP remains a registered organisation under the Industrial Relations Act and is free to represent its members' views to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in the same way as any other union. I understand that this will be done tomorrow. Thirdly, the single goal for the Federal Government has been to ensure that air services are restored as quickly as possible. Those three points are clear for everyone to see. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at this matter, one finds that, right from the beginning, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) urged the pilots to work within the guidelines and accept responsibility for the interests of the community in general. He was at pains to point out the way in which the trade union movement had done that collectively. At that time, the Australian Council of Trade Unions indicated support and, from a point of view of experience and wisdom, said that there was provision for more than 6 per cent within the guidelines. Based on my knowledge of the way the Commission works and the economic arguments that could be advanced in terms of changes, I am thoroughly convinced that that is clear and unequivocal. </PARA>
<PARA> Next, I want to look at the Opposition and its attitude and test its sincerity to see whether it is being hypocritical. On 28 November a matter of public importance was raised in the House of Representatives by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith). He spoke about the importance of maintaining common law remedies to guard against unjustified industrial action, particularly in view of the Government's contradictory and confusing approach to industrial relations. The past 30 or 40 years of rule by the Liberal and National parties was an era of confrontation and penalties on unions. The coalition encouraged employers not to negotiate. When unions were called before the Commission, whether by way of a compulsory conference or some legal matter to be argued, at all times the question asked was: `Are you in dispute?'. It was not: `Why are you in dispute? Do you have a valid reason to be in dispute? Is it a safety issue? Are lives endangered?'. None of those questions were asked. The question was: `Are you in dispute?', and if the answer was, `Yes', then the penalties applied. It was #500 a day, which was a lot of money in those days. There was never any argument about whether one was right or wrong or how the dispute affected the community. It could be some tin-pot employer-I recall one instance, which is a typical example, of the Clyde Engineering Co. Pty Ltd which was forcing boilermakers to weld over red lead paint, which would be injurious to their health. There was no concern about whether the employees had a case; they were just ordered back to work to do it. </PARA>
<PARA> These are people who are telling us we should talk to people and negotiate. Although I am a very kindly person at heart, and look for the best in everyone, I am afraid I have to accuse honourable senators opposite of being absolute hypocrites. They have always accused the Leader of the Australian Labor Party, Prime Minister Hawke, of creating friction, encouraging the dispute to continue and being bloody minded. One should look at the record of Prime Minister Hawke as the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), and his record of negotiating and resolving disputes over many years-disputes that ran on for too long and which both parties wanted to settle. Admittedly, sometimes he might have got too much credit where it was not mentioned that the right time had arrived to settle these disputes, but that does not for one minute detract from his ability and skill, from that point on, in getting a solution as quickly as possible. That is his record. </PARA>
<PARA> What did the Prime Minister say in answer to a question in the Parliament on 28 November? He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Leader of the Opposition does not want to face up to the fact that we have in this country an industrial relations system which provides a process for the resolution of industrial disputes, including strike action. This is not a country where there is no right to strike. Strikes happen around the country reasonably frequently. Under us there have been 60 per cent fewer industrial disputes than under the previous government . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is the way to go-prevent disputes; do not settle them after they have happened. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> The overwhelming majority of employers and trade unions use the industrial relations system sensibly and intelligently. Where there is strike action, processes are provided for the sensible resolution of those disputes. </PARA>
<PARA>Having had some experience over 20 years in these matters, I agree that that is absolutely true, unlike some people who want to debate these issues who have no experience at all, have been spectators all their lives and want to take cheap political points. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister went on to talk about the pilots going outside the system. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> That was done against the warnings that were given, including those by the ACTU. When the Federation decided to go outside the system which provides protection for action, including strike action, it then incurred, as it had been warned about, the processes of civil action. I repeat: no one gets any comfort from that. </PARA>
<PARA>So much for the accusation that he has contributed to the dispute. As I have said, even earlier on he appealed time and again to the pilots to stay within the system-that there was an opportunity there for a resolution which would give them some joy. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose this is what happens when one talks to a group of people who I would not call trade unionists-not based on my experience with them. If somebody can show me one occasion when, in true trade union spirit, they defended the position of another union or the general trade union movement, then I will apologise. I cannot recall one. They certainly set out to destroy the system under which the unions collectively work. </PARA>
<PARA> During the period of office of this Government, under the accord, there has been a reduction in labour costs from a base measurement of 100 to 93. There was a 4 per cent wage increase which was cost neutral to employers. These things have been beneficial to the community and have cost the trade union movement reasonably dearly in the short term, but it is looking to the long term and the recovery and benefits that will accrue to its members in the community in general. The Government having got that agreement and those working arrangements whereby millions of people in the country realise that they have to accept some sacrifices, but sacrifices with equity-and that position must always be defended-a group like the pilots then says, `We will negotiate', but their dictionary says that `negotiate' means give the other people the opportunity to say yes and surrender. They do not realise, apparently-or are being dishonest-that `negotiation' means that either side has to give something and there should be some compromise. </PARA>
<PARA> At a press conference on 28 August the Prime Minister made these comments:</PARA>
<PARA> I go . . . further to say there's been no direction by Government in this matter in regard to Australian, an airline which we own. But the management of that airline has come independently to this position,</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition wants to sell Australian Airlines Ltd and then, of course, the Government would have no influence at all. Because the Government owns it, the Opposition wants us more or less to say to the airline pilots, `Be our guest'. The Government has said it wants to make the airline efficient and that has occurred. There has been a much larger profit than when the airline was operating under normal circumstances. Management has created a better environment and capacity to produce profits which come back to the Treasury and go out in the form of outlays to the people of this nation. The Prime Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>That restraint which has been exercised by the Australian workforce generally is a restraint which has paid off over the last six years in the creation of some one and a half million jobs in the community and a level of economic activity which has enabled the creation of those jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, the pilots dispute was going to create unemployment. We have been told that, and every union-if it has a conscience at all-is concerned about that. The unions do not want to see other people put out of work. What has really been the response of the airline pilots? The response has been, `Too bad. We have got our own self-interest to serve and we will take whatever action we feel fit'. They have done that and they have come unstuck in terms of moving outside the system and being penalised. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not accept-indeed, I strenuously oppose-the idea of using legal argument and fining people heavily or awarding costs in industrial disputes. When one goes into a dispute one loses one's income totally. Many people who are only on $250 or $300 a week cannot afford that. Then the system is used to belt them around the ears and take off them what is left. To me, that is pretty bad. One of the things that the Opposition had better understand is that when that happens, and people have nothing more to lose, they are in real trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Opposition always does, it speaks half truths and misquotes people. When Mr Reith spoke on the matter in the House of Representatives he quoted something that Prime Minister Hawke has said, but he left a bit out. The Prime Minister is the one who is under attack and I think he is the one who deserves to be recognised for the positive approach that he makes. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> I expressed the strong wish and hope to the air pilots and their Federation that they will, on consideration, decide to stay within the system like the rest of their fellow Australian workers. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, if against that wish and that hope they make the decision to go outside the system then they must do so in the recognition, as I have said in the Parliament of this country, that they will have left the system which carries not only obligations to which I have been referring, but which also carries rights. Once they go outside the system, if that is their decision, which I hope they do not take, . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is not somebody who wants to destroy the pilots. If I wanted to destroy them, I would encourage them and tell them to keep going-`Into the Valley of Death rode the 600'--</PARA>

<PARA> In conclusion, I point out the airline pilots are not very good at history. I am afraid they went through a long period of years when they were able to win all their disputes and get wage increases and enjoy conditions far above those of the average person in the community. I do not knock that. It was an agreement between them and the airlines. Other unions were doing that at the same time to the best of their ability. Sometimes they got $20 a week and thought that Christmas had arrived and that they had really waged a good struggle. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Mr. Hawke,</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They include a number of supporters of those opposite, and it would pay Senator Schacht to look at it. The Government has prolonged this dispute at great cost, particularly to the tourist industry. Immense economic damage and social disruption is being caused by this dispute. There has to be a commonsense settlement. It is possible for the benefits of higher productivity to be shared fairly between the airlines, the pilots and the consumers. Instead, we have a war of attrition. Today's sloppy comments by the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party spokesmen have been without any intellectual consistency. Let us look at the editorial in the Australian Financial Review of 24 October. It stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The losers, as usual, are ordinary Australians who cannot get flights when they want them, or whose air services have been cut or downgraded because of the high cost of the dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The airline industry has been battered: tourism and foreign confidence in Australia has been seriously dented. And the situation is still far from normal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister made this his dispute. As he was prepared to take credit for success, he must now accept his share of the blame for the present mess-and take the lead in a realistic reassessment of the most suitable way of concluding the dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting to note that the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP) has moved quite a considerable distance from when the dispute first started, I believe 105 days ago. Whilst it certainly made an unacceptable ambit claim of some 29 per cent, it was just that-an ambit claim as part of considerations. What we now have to consider is the offer that is currently on the deck. In my mailbag in the last few days I have received the pamphlet from the AFAP-the case for a speedy resolution of the pilots dispute. The offer sets out a number of points:</PARA>
<PARA>* All pilots return to fly on pre-dispute conditions immediately;</PARA>
<PARA>* Cooling-off period;</PARA>
<PARA>* Return to full services for Christmas after which any matter regarding pay, productivity, pilot's hours, etc. would be negotiated;</PARA>
<PARA>* To facilitate harmonious relationships in the future;</PARA>
<PARA>* The AFAP would also accept and, believes necessary, an independent mediator to assist in talks after the cooling-off period;</PARA>
<PARA>* The AFAP makes this conciliatory offer in an endeavour to commence a resolution of the current airline dispute and looks forward to its acceptance by the people of Australia, the Government and the Companies. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the offer that is currently before the Prime Minister and the Government for consideration. What have we had? Today we had a contribution by Senator Collins that can only be described as a bob-a-job performance. The only acknowledgment he gave of problems of travel were his own. How selfish; how egotistical; how smug! I assure Senator Collins that the people of the Northern Territory expect far more from him than hot air. He did not once allude to the frustration, the extreme inconvenience, and in particular the cost to his own constituency. In an article in the Northern Territory News of 14 October, talking about the pilots dispute but really just bashing the AFAP, Senator Collins concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> The bottom line of all of this is that the pilots should go back to work under an award which is a fair return for their highly skilled labour. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a pity that Senator Collins has a constant preoccupation with only the pilots. He made no mention of the flying public or businesses going broke. His arguments are so similar to the arguments of Hawke the great conspirator. We need to look at who the Prime Minister has colluded with since the strike commenced. Of course, he has colluded with the airlines and Sir Peter Abeles, constantly. He has colluded with the Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, in order to create the banana republic airline that we have had to operate with as a bandaid job over the past few months. He has attempted to gain access through the tourism leaders, so many of whom are in bodies and institutions that depend on Government largess. The Federal Airports Corporation has been required to do his bidding and undertake special considerations. Of course, the airlines have been propped up with subsidies that the Government seems to be chucking around. But the casualties and the tragedies are both personal and commercial. An excellent letter, which appeared in the Northern Territory News of 27 November, raises a new and very interesting point of view. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> How long is this farce of the fractured airlines going to be allowed to continue?</PARA>
<PARA> What a pathetic nation we have become when we have to look to other countries to settle our internal disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> Are aggression and arrogance permanently to take the place of common sense, leadership and negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> The present approach has meant the loss of the greater part of the tourist industry, further unfavourable balance of payments and the replacement of our own citizens, people with the best flying safety record in the world, with people of unknown capabilities from other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The bleak side of Christmas has always been the national road toll. How much higher will it be this year because many people will not have available to them the option of flying home?</PARA>
<PARA> How much extra traffic will our inadequate highways and byways have to cope?</PARA>
<PARA> Our pilots have always taken us home safely. </PARA>
<PARA> Our police force, ambulance and hospitals cannot prevent accidents. They can only pick up the pieces. </PARA>
<PARA> The pilots' offer to return to work over Christmas period and negotiate later was commendable, sensible and in both parties' interests. </PARA>
<PARA> In the interests of the people of Australia it should have been accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage it is not too late. </PARA>
<PARA> After Christmas for a lot of people it may be. </PARA>
<PARA> What is it to be, the probability of road carnage at Christmas or common sense and a happier new year right across the nation. </PARA>
<PARA>It was signed by Alice Hennessy, Ludmilla, which is a Darwin suburb. I cannot think of a better challenge to the Prime Minister for action to avoid his being dobbed the executioner. He has killed off the tourist industry and small business and is now putting at risk his very own constituents-Australians.

<PARA> Why will Prime Minister Hawke not test the sincerity of the AFAP and the pilots? His actions are cynical and fraudulent and show nothing but indifference and incompetence. He consults with everybody except the pilots. Why is that? It is because of the subtle and hidden agendas. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there is the agenda with regard to the unions. It has always been established that the Australian Council of Trade Unions does not like the pilots because they have done their own thing, stood on their own feet and not pretended to be part of that club. The Federal Government has thrown subsidy moneys at the airline companies so that the unions would not have to face stand-down provisions. Therefore, there is no pressure coming from other unions that would normally have arisen for a solution in such a situation. But what about the hidden agenda of Ansett Airlines of Australia for the resorts that will obviously go bankrupt and broke over the next few months? It will be very interesting to see who buys them up and what commercial advantages there are as these sorts of things happen. Let Sir Peter Abeles be on notice that we will be watching for all those purchases. </PARA>
<PARA> What about international rights for Ansett Airlines of Australia when the shotgun marriage between Australian Airlines Ltd and Qantas Airways Ltd has to take place? Will Sir Peter put his hand up straightaway and say, `Hey, that is unfair. Ansett demands the same, and wants it.'? Therefore are the consequences of delay likely to provide another very subtle and hidden agenda? When we face the election campaign early next year and the Prime Minister has to account for his lousy economy, will he turn around and point the bone at the pilots and say, `They did it; it is their fault', rather than accept the responsibility of his rotten administration for the last seven years? Is he, therefore, using this dispute as a very subtle and hidden agenda?</PARA>
<PARA> It is incumbent on the Prime Minister to test the pilots' bona fides because the consequences of the Prime Minister's inaction are just so awful to contemplate. The regular scheduled services just do not exist. The false capacity figures that are thrown about so regularly need to be tested against the fact that in some instances, such as in the Northern Territory-from Alice Springs to Yulara to Ayers Rock-there are no services back on the records. What about the cancellation of the programs and the charter flights? The claims about the scheduled services versus the actual services need to be tested and proven. We will get those figures in due course but, unfortunately, too late to help the people in the street. What about the alterations, the changes, the block bookings that are made by the airlines that we can never get past? Block bookings are made which mean that nobody can get a seat on a plane. We end up with this great capacity, which is a waste. </PARA>
<PARA> The inconvenience and the cost to business of doing the bookings and scheduling has been just phenomenal. The positions of the major tourist resorts of Cairns and the Gold Coast stand alone. The principal holiday destinations have been deserted. I have seen figures on the occupancy rates at Yulara that horrify me. Internationally-in Japan, North America and West Germany where all our forward selling goes on-Australia is now a joke. The financial consequences will be disastrous. I know that there was a 90 per cent drop in the number of domestic passengers flying in and out of Darwin in September. It is interesting to compare the flight details for many of those areas against the schedules for the previous financial year. There were 71 Australian Airlines flights into Darwin in October 1988; in October 1989 there were 16. There were 136 flights into Alice Springs in October 1988; in October 1989 there were 18. Darwin had only 40 per cent of capacity and Alice Springs around 30 per cent. If the seat capacity in and out of Darwin is tested it is less than 70 per cent for Darwin and about 39 per cent for Alice Springs and, as I said, it is nil for Yulara. If we look at other bookings with regard to movements, we will notice phenomenal changes. Commercial visitor rates in all the hotels are down by about 40 per cent. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard an expenditure losses chart which shows the impact the dispute had on Northern Territory tourism. It also shows losses of over $58m in the period to 17 November this year and details the daily rates of loss that are now well in excess of $300,000. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Northern Confederation of Industry has highlighted to me its deep concern in a letter. Unfortunately, I do not have time to read the letter at this stage. It points out that the dispute is affecting the cash flow of all industries in the Northern Territory, not only those that can be classified as tourism. It is having a disastrous effect throughout Australia. It is very interesting to note that unless the Government addresses this matter urgently and properly we will have very serious problems. The Northern Territory Minister for Tourism has stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The most urgent need, however, is for Federal authorities to get the airlines back to full operation-and in all corners of the nation, not just the Golden Triangle. The pilots' dispute must be settled, and it must be settled now. It has taken many years of painstaking effort to build the Territory tourism industry into what it was before disaster struck . . . Many men and women who have committed their savings and a life-time of effort to the industry are facing ruin. We are all being affected. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the comment of Mr Vale recently. I am very well aware of the serious consequences of the loss of very skilled people and expertise in so many industries right across Australia-from Tasmania to Queensland and the Northern Territory. It is important that Prime Minister Hawke does not continue to hang his hat on the words of so many. As Peter Costello summarised in an excellent article in the Institute of Public Affairs Review, `It really has become-sue the workers, call in the military'. That is how the Labor Government handled the pilots dispute. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I saw this matter of urgency listed on the Senate business sheet today it certainly gave me a sense of deja vu. I do not know how many times we have had similar debates over the last three months. I can remember participating in a debate on 4 September. I read the Hansard to see what the Opposition members had said during that debate. After sitting here patiently for the last one and three-quarter hours I realised that they could have tabled their speeches from the debate on 4 September. They have not contributed one new idea about what is going on in this dispute. I suspect that before the Senate finishes in mid-December we will have Senator Chaney bringing on another urgency debate and making the same speech. He does not realise that the circumstances in this whole affair are quite different from what they were on 4 September.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Chaney made great play in his remarks appealing to the Government to get on with the job of solving the dispute. If we had taken any notice of what the major Opposition spokespeople have said, we would be in utter confusion, as they are. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to draw the attention of the Senate to what I said way back on 4 September as to the performance of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Peacock. We have not heard much from him over the last month or so about this matter. He made such a fool of himself at the end of August that I think he has been gagged by his Party. At a celebrated conference on 31 August, for which there are several pages of transcript, Mr Peacock contradicted himself absolutely. At page 11 of the transcript of the press conference of 31 August, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> No, I wouldn't be imposing sanctions. I give people the right to go before the Commission or a court and argue. This is a right, this is a wrong, if they can establish their locus standi. But the reality is the real constraint on them is the economy itself and at root the market. </PARA>
<PARA>By page 19, a somersault later, this is what he says:</PARA>
<PARA>To settle that dispute today operating in the system that belongs to the Government I have said to you there should be a sanctions power. </PARA>
<PARA>In the same press conference he did a somersault and went from saying that there should be no sanctions to saying that there should be sanctions. He was severely caned by the press all round Australia the next day, which said, `It is clear that the Leader of the Opposition does not know what he is talking about on industrial relations, and does not even understand the policy of his own Party'. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney has had a couple of spectacular contradictions in this whole affair. In a media release on 21 August, Senator Chaney stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition does not support the use of coercion in industrial relations. That is not what voluntary agreements are about. </PARA>
<PARA>Then in a media release on 23 August, just two days later, amnesia obviously took over because he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government should act immediately to use the power available to it under sections 80 and 45d (1a) of the Trade Practices Act to seek an interlocutory injunction from the Federal Court ordering the pilots to cease industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA>We have the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the Opposition in the Senate absolutely contradicting themselves in a period of a couple of days back in August. No wonder Senator Durack wants to get the question of the Senate leadership resolved pretty quickly when in two days we have the Leader in the Senate and Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party doing two somersaults. He even beat Mr Peacock's record. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we turn to the remarks of the Opposition, which have clearly and overwhelmingly been in support of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, no matter what, whenever the Federation has wanted to say something in the last month and a half. Honourable senators only had to be, like I was, sitting at the Senate inquiry with Senator MacGibbon to see that he could be almost a paid advocate of the Pilots Federation. Honourable senators can bet their bottom dollar that every dorothy dixer that the Federation wanted Senator MacGibbon to ask he came in and crunched. He usually got crunched back afterwards from people who gave him answers. In particular, I want to draw the attention of the Senate to the public evidence given by Miss Shayne Nealon, the President of the Australian Flight Attendants Association. She said that the flight attendants had stayed within the wage guidelines. They are affiliated to the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). They have made it quite clear that, if the pilots had been successful in their 30 per cent claim, the flight attendants would immediately have gone out and got 30 per cent for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> There is the real input of why the Government stood up to the pilots-we would have had the great wages breakout, which, of course, those opposite want. They want to wreck the economy because that is the only way they think they can get elected. I have not been able to attend every session of this inquiry because of conflicting commitments on other standing committees of the Parliament, but I have sat through most of it, as have Senator Collins, Senator MacGibbon, Senator Brownhill and others. It has been quite instructive. </PARA>

<PARA> I really want to refer to evidence given to the Senate inquiry. Most of the things that Opposition members have said have been covered before in endless debate. One of the things I found interesting in listening to the Pilots Federation contribution in the Senate inquiry was that it very much struck me, after hearing Captain McCarthy and other witnesses, how any group of people can delude themselves and lead themselves into disaster. While listening to Captain McCarthy I was reminded of a very relevant book published in the last couple of years by a very famous American historian, Barbara Tushman. The book is called the March of Folly. It is all about how, in history, on a number of occasions people have ignored reality and have suffered enormous consequences. She uses a range of analogies, from the Trojans allowing the horse to be pulled inside the battlements against all rational advice; to the American War of Independence, when the British Government ignored all rational advice; to the American involvement in the Vietnam war; to the collapse of the Reformation in the sixteenth century, and so on. Having listened to Captain McCarthy, I thought, `Here is a small example of the march of folly of the leadership of an organisation'. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel very sorry for the pilots. Why are they in this position of folly? Unfortunately for the pilots, they have had unlimited success as an industrial organisation since they got together after the Second World War. They used to pride themselves on the fact that they never lost an industrial dispute; they always won exactly what they wanted. They always said, `We can always last one day longer than the airline companies. We will never lose'. Those statements were in the espirit de corps of the union. So, unfortunately, the great mistake of Captain McCarthy and the leadership of the union is that they expected the same thing to happen again. That is why they could ignore the ACTU or their fellow trade unions in the industry. The Federation has never supported the Flight Attendants Association, the transport workers, or any of the other unions in the industry. Whenever those unions had a dispute, the pilots ignored them completely. The pilots never gave them one ounce of support. They said, `We do not need the support of anyone else. We can get what we want because of our industrial strength and because of the commitment of our union'. That led the pilots into this great march of folly. </PARA>
<PARA> If we talk to any experienced blue collar trade union leader who has been through victories and defeats in industrial disputation, he will say, `You never lead the troops out of the gate, up the hill unless you know there is a way back with a bit of honour-that you can negotiate your way back'. The problem is that the pilots said, `It is 30 per cent or nothing, boys; up the hill and the airlines will give in within two or three days'. Unfortunately for the pilots, when they got up the hill it was like General Custer at Little Big Horn. Who was waiting? Sitting Bull, and the massacre took place. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what has happened to the pilots, because they ignored all industrial experience of most other unions. They took that attitude because they had never had an industrial defeat in their history. Now that the pilots are faced with that defeat they are casting around to find who else is responsible. The pilots are blaming the Prime Minister. They are blaming Sir Peter Abeles. They are blaming the management of the companies. They are blaming the Labor Party. They are blaming the ACTU. They are calling everybody scabs. If honourable senators talk to a lot of other unions they would say that the Pilots Federation is one of the great scab unions in Australia. It never supported any of them when they had an industrial dispute. So the pilots cast around and the last thing they are left with, which we have paraded before us in the Senate inquiry, is that safety is at risk. The pilots' co-conspirator in this argument is certainly Senator MacGibbon. Again and again the accusation is made that safety is at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no doubt that, if there is by some extraordinary calamity an air accident some time in the next couple of months in Australia and some Australians are killed, we will have cheering people on the other side of the chamber saying, `I told you so. It is all your fault'. Opposition members will use that as a justification. That is what I find distasteful about the way in which the Opposition has performed in this debate, not only here but particularly in the Senate inquiry. They are almost praying for a calamity to take place so that they can prove the point. I think that is disgusting. Every accusation the Opposition has made about incidents occurring has been overwhelmingly rejected. It was a great embarrassment to the Opposition and to the Committee when the evidence came forward from the companies about what this great professional organisation, the Pilots Federation, had been doing: the harassment, the scab patrols, and so on, which do put at risk safety in the air. We have had not one word of criticism or damnation from the Opposition against these scab patrols, against the interference with and intimidation of those pilots who are flying. We have had not one word of criticism of the Pilots Federation going into a briefing room and intimidating pilots, making them feel frustrated and angry when they are about to take off in a plane-all putting safety at risk. We have heard not one word from the Opposition. It has been a disgraceful performance by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I look forward to the Senate inquiry concluding its report and to it coming to this place before the end of this year. I look forward to that debate because, when it takes place, Senator Chaney and his fellow Opposition members will get one of the great baths in this debate about what they have been doing over the last couple of months. I said early on that the Opposition has contradicted itself again and again over what sort of policy it should adopt to overcome this dispute. At one stage Opposition senators have said, `No sanctions', and at another stage they have said, `Yes, sanctions'. In the first week of the dispute Mr Peacock said that he supported the Government's action. The Opposition has done it all; it has somersaulted and triple somersaulted. It has done the lot. Yet it has the temerity, for the fifth or the sixth time, to come into this chamber and accuse us of not doing anything. The airlines are restoring services-not as much as any of us would like, but they are restoring them. Ansett Airlines of Australia has said that by March next year it will have its services restored. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-A fascinating feature of this debate is that not one Labor speaker has expressed any concern for the enormous damage which is being done to thousands of innocent Australians by this strike. It has been a debate of point scoring and misrepresentation. It is improper to accuse an honourable senator of lying, but, since Senator Schacht, who has just resumed his seat, cannot be a liar, he must be a fool. For example, his total misrepresentation of the press releases put out by me shows that he cannot understand plain English.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) has said that there has been no word from the Opposition on allegations of intimidation. Let me say that there has been no action by the Government in the face of repeated invitations from me. As the Opposition spokesperson on industrial relations I have repeatedly said that there are remedies in the Trade Practices Act and probably in the Industrial Relations Act, and that, if those remedies are not adequate, the Opposition will join with the Government in amending the law to ensure that any such behaviour is treated in the most disciplined and punitive way. We have never supported such conduct. I have made it absolutely clear that there are courses open to the Government and the Government has done nothing. We have had accusations like those that have come from Senator Schacht but nothing has been done by the Government to enforce the law, if the Government really believes that that is occurring. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say in the very limited time that I have to respond to this debate that the reality is that a great deal of damage is being done. We believe, as we have believed for months, that there is room for constructive negotiation which will terminate this dispute, which will bring it to an end on a proper basis. Mr Acting Deputy President, that is the course which has been ignored by the Government that you support, and it is a course which flies in the face of everything that you have ever said about trade unions in this place. I find the whole debate pathetically distant from the concerns of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point that I wish to deal with is Senator Collins's absurd suggestion that a direction to the Government-owned airline, which still enjoys duopoly privileges in this economy, to sit down and test the offer from the pilots could be described as Stalinist. I received an unsolicited letter from Mr E. R. Kelly, the former Chief Commissioner of the Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission, who wrote to me in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> The stand taken by the Government is fundamentally flawed because there is no legislative support for the proposition that all employees must comply with the centralised wage fixing guidelines, and there can be none because the Constitution does not authorise the making of such a law. That fact is recognised in the National Wage Decision in that the `decision' is simply an option which individual unions may accept (provided they give a `no extra claims' undertaking) . . . So when the Prime Minister insists that the pilots may not go outside the rules of the centralised system, it is not Commonwealth law but Hawke's Law (or perhaps Kelty's Law) that is being applied to the detriment of citizens who, whether or not we like what they are doing, are acting within the law. That seems to me to be dictatorship rather than constitutional government. </PARA>
<PARA>If we are going to get into the business of trying to classify what sort of dictatorial behaviour we are getting in this community, I think the fascist experiment of Mussolini is a far closer analogy than Stalinism, the description put forward by the senator from the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> As tens of thousands of Australians rot in businesses which are being destroyed, including at Yulara and in other parts of the Northern Territory, and as so many Australians find their jobs, their businesses and their life's work disappearing, I hope that they have noted the total ignoring of their plight by the Labor senators in this debate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not possible in the space of five minutes to deal with all the matters arising from the two-volume report of the Australian Bicentennial Authority for 1989. This is probably the last report that we will have from the Authority. It goes to a number of matters concluding the work of that Authority and the winding up of various matters arising from the celebration of Australia's bicentennial year. </PARA>
<PARA> Any Australian who was involved in aspects of the Bicentennial will have cause to remember it. Certainly it was a great pleasure for me to have responsibility as the shadow Minister for the Bicentennial during 1988. Indeed, any honourable senator who was involved in the great celebrations on Australia Day 1988 in the forecourts of the Sydney Opera House and on and around the harbour will never forget that event. There are too many people to thank in terms of the work done on the Bicentenary, and I do not propose to try to do that other than to say that those who contributed, from those who were originally involved in this matter 10 years ago to those who saw it to its completion, need to be particularly noted. However, I will note the work done by Mr Peter Sarah, who was in charge of the arts program which went hand in glove with Bicentennial Authority activities. I believe that he is to be congratulated for an outstanding performance over many years. </PARA>
<PARA> It is more important, however, to say something in terms of looking to the future. We now face the prospect of celebration in due course of the centenary of Federation in Australia. None of the problems and criticisms which may have been involved with the Bicentennial can possibly be levelled at the centenary of Federation. Federation is one of the great achievements of the Australian people. It is a great achievement to create a new nation and to do so without rancour, without difficulty and without bloodshed. Certainly there were minor problems along the way, but the creation of a new nation out of disparate States and colonies is a signal achievement in the history of our planet, and the bringing forth of a functioning parliamentary democracy which has stood the test of time over the century is something to be very greatly remarked upon. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a pity that we have already lost the opportunity to mark and to properly celebrate some of those events leading up to the Bicentenary. It is a great shame that the Australian Government did not see fit to give proper recognition, for example, to the centenary of Sir Henry Parkes's Tenterfield speech, which was one of the great steps along the way. I hope that in government we will be in a position to put down a comprehensive program moving towards the celebration of that centenary. We will not play it in a partisan fashion. Events such as the centenary of the founding of the Australian Labor Party are events which ought properly to be marked. They are part of our national history. The centenary of the various constitutional conventions which went into the making of the Australian Constitution, which, regardless of the attacks which have been mounted upon it by the Australian Labor Party, has stood the test of time well, and the centenary of the creation and emergence of the Senate as a vital part of our parliamentary democracy, which derives very much from the efforts made by the Founding Fathers-I certainly regret that there were, in an historical sense, no founding mothers of Australian Federation-are similarly things to be marked. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many lessons to be learnt and many things not to be done in the way in which the Bicentennial Authority did them. There are, however, many good things which it did upon which we should build. I believe that it will be a challenge to the Australian nation in the course of the 1990s to establish a proper way of marking the growth and development of our country as a Federation, and the eventual celebration of the centenary of that event. I look forward with my colleagues in the Liberal and National parties to having charge of that program, to developing that program, to bringing it to fruition and to marking with proper celebration a thing of which we should all be extraordinarily proud. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I go along with what my colleague Senator Puplick has just been saying. In order to contribute to this debate I picked up a copy of the first annual report of the Australian Bicentennial Authority, a report on its activities from 21 January 1980 to 30 June 1981. In its review of its operations it draws attention to the fact that on 5 April 1979 the then Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. Malcolm Fraser, CH, MP, announced the intention to establish the Australian Bicentennial Authority to plan and manage a national program of celebrations to commemorate the Bicentenary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The 1989 annual report of the Australian Bicentennial Authority is, although in two volumes of nearly 500 pages, a most ungracious report-pretty and all as it is with photographs. I point out that nowhere in the report is any mention made of Mr John Reid, who was the foundation Chairman of the Authority and who was sacrificed by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to save the Prime Minister's political neck. Of course, he is not alone in that sacrifice. The Prime Minister, after all, has publicly sacrificed members of his own family; so I suppose that it was no problem at all to sacrifice Mr John Reid. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no mention in this document of the founding chief executive officer, Dr David Armstrong, whose position was terminated or who resigned-I cannot remember which-in August 1985, having served from 1979 to 1985. Mr John Reid's term was terminated, although I think there was some sort of resignation proposal or something in September 1985. By then, August and September of 1985, practically every program referred to in this volume was in place. Practically every program had been prepared and set out regarding how it was going to be conducted and all the rest of it. All it needed then was for the incoming Chairman, Mr James Kirk, to take over and complete it. I congratulate him, the board, and the workers of this organisation for completing the program, but it was all set out. </PARA>
<PARA> There is not one gracious comment in the report about these people. Mr Robert Maher was the deputy chief executive to Dr David Armstrong and became the acting chief executive when Dr Armstrong left. He was then the chief executive right through until January 1988. Dr David Armstrong and Mr Robert Maher get listed in the roll call 1980 to 1989, an alphabetical listing of all the people who worked for the Authority through the years of its experience. So their names are there in alphabetical order but there is no reference to the work that they did. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no reference to many of the other directors who served so well. I will mention their names because they were there when I was a director of this Authority from its inception: Mrs Margaret Aitken, Alderman Joy Cummings, Mr Slade Drake-Brockman, the Hon. Justice Rae Else-Mitchell, Sir John Holland, Mr Peter Nolan, Mr John Utz, Mr Peter Sinclair, Mr Bruno Ventura and Mr Donald Watson, all of whom served for many years as directors of this Authority. I give my most sincere congratulations to the Hon. Justice Brian Martin, Mr Ian Russell, Mr Alan McGregor and Mrs Barbara Payne who served right from the inception of the Authority as directors. I congratulate them on their endurance, their patience and their long suffering doggedness on this board. Few would know what they have had to put up with, especially when Mr Kirk took over. He became a complete dictator who was not prepared to listen to the board or to any of the suggestions of the board because he was reporting directly to the Prime Minister. So he operated as a dictator to this Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> All in all, I say again that this is a most ungracious report. I hope that one day someone in this Authority gets around to complimenting and congratulating those people who put in the foundation work for the Australian Bicentennial Authority to enable it to be such a success. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the 1989 annual report of the Australian Bicentennial Authority, I congratulate the Bicentennial Authority and the Australian Tourist Commission for the tremendous work they have done in helping to promote Australia's Bicentenary. And what a wonderful year 1988 was. Events in 1988 included not only major activities such as the big birthday bash in Sydney, the bicentennial naval salute, the Military Tattoo, an Australian bicentennial exhibition and an Australian bicentennial air show but also thousands of activities organised by local councils, community groups and organisations in their own local areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I was looking through the report I saw a picture of a camel, beside which it says `The Trans-Australia Bicentennial Camel Expedition, from the westernmost to the easternmost points of Australia'. I was there with my husband the day these camels arrived at Nerang after they had crossed the continent. My word, what a mighty job that was! I cannot ride a horse; so I would not like to try to ride a camel. It was a pretty big effort and many people looked pretty exhausted and worn out after it, not only the people who were riding the camels but the camels as well. I congratulate Mr Arthur Earle of Nerang, who was responsible for organising the trek because it was certainly something very different for our bicentennial year. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no way one could comment on the events of the Australian Bicentennial without looking at what happened in our State of Queensland. World Expo 88 was the longest running international event of the bicentennial year, and a great success which exceeded all expectations in terms of quality, the number of international participants and visitors. Those senators who were lucky enough to go to Expo would have been able to see there high technology, international cuisine-I suppose they could have tasted the international cuisine as well as looked at it-free entertainment and hundreds of exhibits designed to inform and entertain. We can never thank or congratulate enough the hundreds of Queenslanders who organised Expo 88 and all those workers who daily welcomed the more than 18 million people who passed through its gates. </PARA>
<PARA> It was very good indeed that my husband, when he was Premier of Queensland, decided that Queensland would host Expo. It was offered by the then Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, to the governments of Victoria and New South Wales and both of those governments said no. Joh said, `Queensland will go ahead and do it' and we did it. That is something the whole of Australia should be very pleased about because it certainly brought Australia into the limelight. As described in volume 2 of the report, on page 181, Expo:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . was an important part of the Bicentennial celebrations and we cannot stress too much the contribution it made to Australian tourism. </PARA>
<PARA>I make a few observations about tourism at present. When we think of all the work people did last year to promote our country with events during the bicentennial celebrations-not only Expo, but all the other events as well-it looks like it will be destroyed because of what has happened with the current pilots dispute. I know that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) says that there is not a dispute, but it is quite evident that there is a dispute. We have heard all about it again this afternoon in the debate on the matter of urgency proposed by our Leader today. We have heard about it on a number of occasions. The dispute is a very real problem as far as tourism is concerned right throughout Australia. We heard about the tourist operators who are going broke. It is a very sad state of affairs. Tourism reached its peak last year. A tremendous number of tourists were coming to Australia. The tourist operators were predicting that 2.7 million people would be travelling to Australia for holidays in 1990. Now, because of the pilots dispute, it is down to 2.23 million people. Tourist operators are finding it very difficult to exist. When one realises that it is a Labor Government and a Labor Prime Minister that have been responsible, in the main, for this problem it is a sad state of affairs. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) issued a media release on 10 November concerning provisional bankruptcy figures for the September quarter. In that release he claimed that the figures showed a slight decline in total bankruptcies and insolvencies under the Act compared with the trend in the last corresponding quarter. The Minister also claimed that verified figures for the full 1988-89 year showed that the total number of bankruptcies was down on the previous year. It is a bit hard to believe that that could be the case in the present economic climate, with high interest rates. So I was particularly interested to see this report and to learn a little more about what the Minister regarded as the declining bankruptcies that he spoke of. </PARA>
<PARA> Page 18 of the report shows the figures for a number of bankruptcy proceedings during the past year. The number of proceedings in 1988-89 is 7,435, and is down compared with 8,504 proceedings for the previous year. However, I emphasise the fact that the Minister has referred to the number of proceedings. At page 20 of the report one finds the statements:</PARA>
<PARA> The number of bankruptcy notices issued during the year was 14,469 compared with 14,187 for 1987-88. </PARA>
<PARA>This represents an increase in bankruptcy notices, and does not accord with the declining trend that the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) referred to. With individuals and businesses clearly suffering from the present state of the economy, it would be logical to expect that that would be the case and that the number of bankruptcies would not be decreasing, as the Minister sought to claim. To further add to the confusion about the real trend in bankruptcies, we have the fact that the New South Wales Supreme Court recently released figures showing a 50 per cent increase in business bankruptcies. The figures were reported in the Sydney Morning Herald of 7 November, just three days before the Minister tried to tell us the good news as he saw it. The New South Wales Supreme Court advised that by September this year it had appointed official liquidators for 2,184 companies. For the same period last year the number was 1,413. This information, together with the report before the Senate today, exposes what I regard as the Minister's transparent attempt to run a line that bankruptcies are on the decline. </PARA>
<PARA> The tragic fact is that bankruptcies are increasing. This report tells us the number of proceedings. The number of proceedings being dealt with may in fact be down due to the weight of numbers. But the reality is quite the reverse. The Government might seek to kid itself that things are improving for businesses and home owners, but the rest of us know that the situation is quite the reverse. The homes of thousands of Australians are on the market right now. These people cannot meet interest rates of 18 per cent. Some people who have already sold their homes have found that they are still in debt. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend to the Minister an article written by Max Walsh in the Sydney Morning Herald of Monday of this week. It gives a very realistic account of what is happening to ordinary families in this country. I suggest that the Minister for Consumer Affairs and his colleagues would do well to read it. Max Walsh talks about a property in North Sydney and what has happened to the family that formerly owned that house. The article makes interesting reading and makes many more significant points. </PARA>
<PARA> Ideally, one would think that Government members would be sufficiently in touch with what is going on in our community to be aware of the fact that ordinary Australian families are going broke and are being bankrupted. They should not have to be reminded of this fact by others. That the Minister for Consumer Affairs could issue a media release claiming that bankruptcies are declining, when this is patently not the case, is a sign of how blinded he and his colleagues have become or how they really try to hoodwink Australian families and small business. Madam Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the press release of the Minister for Consumer Affairs dated 10 November and the article to which I referred in the Sydney Morning Herald of 7 November. </PARA>

<PARA>RELEASE OF QUARTERLY BANKRUPTCY STATISTICS</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Minister for Consumer Affairs, Senator Nick Bolkus, today released provisional and unverified statistics for the July to September quarter 1989 (Attachment A). </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bolkus said that the figures show a slight decline in total bankruptcies and insolvencies under the Bankruptcy Act 1966 compared with the corresponding quarter in 1988. The verified annual figures confirm a downward trend in bankruptcies. </PARA>
<PARA> ``The published figures for the full year 1988/89 are now verified and final. They show that the total number of bankruptcies for 1988/89 is 15.9 per cent down on the total for 1987/88 and 6.1 per cent down on the total for 1986/87'' Senator Bolkus said. </PARA>
<PARA> ``More comprehensive annual data will be available when the Annual Report on the Operation of the Bankruptcy Act for the year ended 30 June 1989 is tabled in Parliament shortly''. </PARA>

<PARA>Bankruptcies boom by 50pc</PARA>
<PARA>by DAVID McKNIGHT</PARA>
<PARA>Professions Writer</PARA>
<PARA> The number of companies going bust has jumped by nearly 50 per cent since last year, according to figures from the NSW Supreme Court. </PARA>
<PARA> By September this year, the Supreme Court had appointed official liquidators for 2,184 companies. For the same period last year, it was 1,413. </PARA>
<PARA> But while businesses bust, work for liquidators is booming. </PARA>
<PARA> Accountants at Peat Marwick Hungerfords's insolvency division are at their busiest in years, handling some of the better known failures such as Hookers, Equiticorp and Spedley. </PARA>
<PARA> One of its partners, Mr Chris Horn, said yesterday that staff were now working longer hours and recruitment of accounting graduates was aggressive. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Horn blamed poor management, high interest rates and downturns in industry sectors for the boom in busts. </PARA>
<PARA> Company crashes bring their own particular form of low life. </PARA>
<PARA> He pointed to asset-strippers who prey on the corporations by posing as helpful advisers for companies in trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> ``It's human nature to make a dollar out of someone else's misfortune,'' he said. </PARA>
<PARA> But company crashes also expose outright fraud by the directors themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> A partner in the accounting firm Bentleys, Mr Mark MacMahon, said it was difficult to tell if a business was going bad because of ``out-and-out incompetence or just devious criminal behaviour''. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr MacMahon described the present law on insolvencies as ``Dickensian'' because it does not protect all creditors. </PARA>
<PARA> Occasionally dogs are set on receivers and liquidators, though Mr MacMahon admits ``it's been a long while since someone took a swing at me with a wrench''. </PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile, the number of company directors barred from holding office remains steady. In 1988-89, 126 company directors were prohibited from holding office as directors for five years, compared to last year's 124, according to the NSW Corporate Affairs Commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support what Senator Reid has said about the massive increase in bankruptcies taking place, and I refer not only to the number of them but to the size of the losses involved to creditors of bankrupt companies and the impact that that is having on the confidence of the business community and overseas investors in Australia. I agree with Senator Reid that the attempt by the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) to hoodwink the people of Australia by claiming that there has been some great success and a massive decline in bankruptcies, when all he is talking about is the number of proceedings that have been completed is, of course, ridiculous.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept whatever word is deemed appropriate. As Senator Reid has said, not only has the number of bankruptcy notices during the year increased considerably, from 14,187 to 14,469, but the number of creditor petitions presented increased from 2.954 to 3,202. So, we have evidence of the increase in the volume of bankruptcies, while at the same time we have clear indications that the size of corporations going broke due to this Government's high interest rates is such that massive losses are taking place, because of business and personal bankruptcies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is clear that as this Government continues with its deliberate policy of massively high interest rates the number of people who will go broke, let alone those who are going to feel enormous financial pressure, will continue to mount. Already we have seen evidence of falling house prices as the real estate market is beginning to suffer severely from the huge interest rates imposed in the mortgage area-despite the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has repeatedly said that interest rates will not rise. Of course, they have consistently continued to rise, despite the $200m-odd deal with taxpayers' money that the Government has done with the banks to try to hold down mortgage interest rates. This is inevitable as long as this Government relies so heavily and so entirely, in effect, on high interest rates as its only method of running the economy-its only method of dampening down economic activity, as it prefers to describe it. While the Government does this, it is inevitable that there will be further and horrendous increases in the number of people going bankrupt. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate that this report is grossly inadequate. Nowhere does it reveal the amount of total losses involved in these bankruptcies to make an appropriate comparison with the previous year. Obviously that would give a much more effective indicator to us about the consequences of the Government's present economic policies. This annual report would certainly give the Government no cause for any genuine satisfaction. Certainly some phoney satisfaction can be grasped by dragging out some individual figures that might appear to suit the government's book, but the fact remains that anyone who reads the finance pages of the newspapers can tell that there are massive business bankruptcies and huge levels of loss, which damages Australia's status. There is mounting unemployment as a result of the closure of many businesses. To some extent it could be argued that this might bring rationalised industry and greater efficiency. The fact is that what this Government is doing through its high interest rate policy is sending Australian companies to the wall, sending Australian families broke and forcing Australian families out of their homes. This report clearly dramatises what is happening. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the second document in two days from the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. Indeed, in the House of Representatives today another couple of documents from the Board were tabled. We will be dealing with those tomorrow. I wish to raise a couple of points on this quite brief and slim paper. I refer to the requirement in the Employment, Education and Training Act, which was passed last year, which required the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), with regard to advice and formal references, to ensure that any such advice received be tabled in both Houses of Parliament as soon as practicable. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at this particular operation, one sees that what the Minister's office may see as practicable is when it suits that office rather than when it suits the convenience of the Parliament. The original statement seeking advice was a letter to Professor Smith, who was the chair of the National Board, on 26 July 1989. The Board considered that letter and finalised its advice on 25 August. The Board conveyed its recommendation and advice to the Minister on 27 September. I am not sure why it took over a month for the Board to get its advice, which covers no more than four pages, in a form suitable to be conveyed to the Minister. Be that as it may, there is no obligation under the Act to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> That advice having been received by the Minister on 27 September-it is now 29 November, and this advice was received by the Senate yesterday, on 28 November-it took two months for that advice to come into the Parliament. Quite frankly, I do not think that can be said to be as soon as practicable, even bearing in mind that the Minister might have wished to review the matter before it came into the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I wish to raise, again briefly, is that the advice is reasonable in as much as it is seeking to give at least some range of what are called fellowships to a number of people in the area of skilled researchers. However, until some reasonable attitude is taken to the remuneration for academics across the board, this particular exercise will fall flat. It is merely a drop in the bucket of what is actually needed. To suggest that in some way this may assist the career prospects of outstanding Australian researchers is in fact to talk down the number of outstanding Australian researchers available. </PARA>
<PARA> We have already caused serious damage to research across the board by the attitudes that have been taken by this and the previous government to the funding of research and to the funding of research in the research institutions in this country. Of course, the vast bulk of those have been and will continue to be, at least in the foreseeable future, universities and in some cases colleges of advanced education (CAEs). Of course, CAEs have now been incorporated into universities. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BJ4">Senator SHEIL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report I have just tabled relates to the preparation of sites for further developments at Brisbane airport. These include sites for an international terminal and aviation industry infrastructure. This report is the sixth report presented by the Committee regarding developments at Brisbane airport since 1979. I should also add that the Committee has spent more time examining this project than any other this year. What appeared on the surface to be a reasonably straightforward project, developed into a re-examination of the planning philosophy of the Brisbane airport and the master plan on which it is based.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee is well aware that airports are an extremely sensitive issue in the community and Brisbane is no exception. The Committee recognises that any decision it reaches on this matter is likely to be controversial and arouse strong feelings in the community. Indeed, reflecting this, two members of the Committee have dissented from the final recommendation that the project proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recognises that in many respects future developments at Brisbane airport have been locked in by past developments. The Committee is also conscious that its referral related to a specific project. However, the Committee recognised that the sandfilling project had the possible effect of closing off alternative avenues of development. The Committee therefore took the view that it has a wider responsibility to the Parliament and examined in some detail the basic philosophy of the master plan and issues such as runway directions, length of cross wind runway and noise effects. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of its examination, the Committee undertook detailed inspections of the airport and environs on 25 July and 10 August. These included the proposed site, the existing international terminal, and an aerial inspection which included the airport, the site for the sand dredging at Middle Banks and a simulated instrument approach to the airport. The Committee also travelled to suburbs south of the city to observe aircraft on landing approach and to experience noise levels. </PARA>
<PARA> On balance the Committee, with the exception of Senator Burns and Senator Devereux, has somewhat reluctantly accepted that the sandfilling project should proceed as proposed by the Federal Airports Corporation. In the report the Committee has recommended that the Federal Airports Corporation should undertake a thorough re-examination of the Brisbane airport master plan before further runway developments are undertaken. In making this recommendation, the Committee has rejected the proposition that extension of the 14/32 cross wind runway to accept heavier aircraft is not feasible. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has also drawn attention to the measures being taken to minimise the noise impact of aircraft operations at Brisbane airport. The Committee is aware of the considerable concern expressed to it by resident groups and by local Federal and State members on the issue of aircraft noise. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The 34th Conference held special significance for Australia, being held in our bicentennial year and in our new and permanent Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA> Delegations from 104 Parliaments and legislatures attended the conference along with 106 observers from international organisations and CPA member branches. There was a total of 520 participants including spouses and unofficial observers. Visitors came from every part of the world-Asia (from Singapore to India), the Caribbean, Europe and the Mediterranean, Africa and North America and the Australasian/Pacific area. As well as diverse geographic locations the delegations came from the broad spectrum of parliamentary systems, including republics, monarchies under Queen Elizabeth II and national monarchies. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Ninian Stephen drew on the theme of the geographic diversity of the countries attending the conference in his opening address. He told delegates that their presence was abundant testimony to the enduring vitality of parliamentary institutions throughout the Commonwealth of Nations. He encouraged those present to draw hope, from the gathering and the agenda that it had set itself, that the evils of the world could be eradicated. </PARA>
<PARA> The conference deliberations consisted of four plenary sessions and six panel sessions, the first plenary session, that on international peace and security was presented by His Excellency, Mr Shridath Ramphal, who presented an historical perspective on the world's troublespots before addressing the theme of the plenary session. He commented on the need for circumspection in talking of peace, especially in regard to the approximately 20 million people who have died as a result of armed conflicts in the post-war era, mainly in developing countries. He called on the Commonwealth to be a standard bearer for peace and to each parliament to reaffirm the Goa Declaration. </PARA>
<PARA> Among the key topics covered in the other sessions were drugs and what the Commonwealth can do to curb drug abuse and drug trafficking, the spread of AIDS, the current GATT discussions, the negative effects of the declining world economy on women and young people, and the establishment of a parliamentary branch of Amnesty International. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth of Australia branch delegation participated fully in the plenary and panel sessions. As members of the delegation of one of the host branches, we felt we had a special responsibility as well as the usual obligation to participate fully. We felt an additional obligation to our guests to assist and encourage them in their participation. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as the main proceedings there were other activities associated with the conference. The eighth Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference of members from small countries and the meetings of the society of clerks-at-the-table are of particular note. </PARA>
<PARA> The conference, in all its facets, was an outstanding success. The delegation wishes to record its appreciation of the efforts of the State branches and their executive committees and staff, the conference co-ordinating committee headed by Mr Browning, you Mr President and Mr Kieran Schneemann and the staff of the Parliamentary Relations Office. I also thank Mr Mark McRae, the Secretary to the delegation, for his efforts prior to, and during, the conference. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would be remiss to allow the report of the Commonwealth of Australia branch delegation to the thirty-fourth Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference to pass without mentioning that the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference that was held here was certainly seen not only by our own delegation but also by many others-and I have had confirmation of that since-as being one of the most successful of recent Commonwealth parliamentary conferences. One of the reasons for this is the fact that it was held within this Parliament House. This is not a usual practice considering that most parliament houses are not built to take a conference of that size.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many people interested in the progress and developments of parliaments around the world-and certainly those with a British Commonwealth tradition-were interested to come to Australia to see this Parliament House, discuss how it worked and assess its benefits to parliamentary democracy. I think they were all duly staggered by the size of this Parliament House and the fittings in it. I talked to delegates from the British delegation who, after many years of seniority, had managed to graduate to a small desk in a corridor somewhere. They were very much taken with the fact that Australia had made very deliberate decisions with regard to the provision of services for the Parliament. Unfortunately, all too often we neglect to appreciate services that have been provided to the Parliament by various governments of all political persuasions. Those provisions, in many areas, exceed those which have been made in comparable parliaments anywhere else in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, when listening to the debate today on the parliamentary appropriations, one may have been led to believe that such provisions had not been made. While there are many things that we might like to improve on, I think we have to acknowledge that it has been the tradition in Australia to provide adequate services for Parliament. The services that were provided in this building during that parliamentary conference were very much appreciated by all delegates. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose one criticism that can be made of Commonwealth parliamentary conferences-and certainly it is made from time to time, as it is of the larger Inter-Parliamentary Union conferences which are attended by representatives from parliaments throughout the world-is that they are nothing other than talkfests. Having attended quite a number of conferences, not only during my parliamentary career but also before it, I know that these types of criticisms are raised from time to time. Undoubtedly, there is an element of a talkfest in every conference. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect of conferences which is sometimes missed even by delegates who go to them-it is almost always missed by those people who are not at them-is the chance to meet and discuss informally with one's colleagues, not only from one's own parliament but from other parliaments. One has the opportunity to see how they handle the matters of the day, the new procedures they are putting in place in their parliaments, the problems they are running into in terms of constituency advocacy and the ways in which some parliaments are able to facilitate the flow of information from the Executive to the parliament. All of those matters lead one to reconsider one's own practice and think of better ways in which one can do the job that one has to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray), who is in the chamber, commented earlier today during the appropriation debate that it might be nice for us, on occasions, to look at productivity. That is a reasonable suggestion for the Minister to make and it is a reasonable suggestion for all of us to take on board. These parliamentary conferences, in many ways, enable us to look at that. Indeed, at the recent South Pacific regional conference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association I gave a paper on some changes that have taken place in the Senate and the House of Representatives with regard to our Standing Orders and our practice on these matters. I was able to point to quite a number of changes that had taken place that had improved the efficiency and effectiveness of parliamentary operations. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of those changes have been brought about in this chamber as a result of motions moved by me and adopted by the Senate. Some of those ideas, indeed, came from my attending Commonwealth parliamentary conferences. I was able to test out on delegations from other parliaments some ideas that I had. I was able to establish whether they had adopted, in part or in whole, some variation of what I had been thinking about and wanted to propose to this chamber. In terms of that exercise, this is one of the methods by which this operation might be made more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA> The last comment I want to make relates to the costs of such ventures. These conferences are extremely costly undertakings. The Commonwealth, all the States and Territories, including Norfolk Island in a very small way, contribute to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. In the final wash-up, there is a considerable surplus of funds. It is probably a little bit like World Expo in Queensland-these types of things can either lose a lot of money or, sometimes, make money. The Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference last year ended up with a substantial surplus. It is unfortunate that it has not yet been determined how that surplus will be used. An extremely reasonable and, I think, important suggestion has been put to government in this respect. Oddly enough, given that Australia is a federation, that proposition has been agreed to, not only by the Commonwealth but also by all the States. It is a very odd occurrence, as I think any honourable senator would agree, to manage to get all the States and the Commonwealth to agree about something. They agreed about what should be done with this money, which after all was the money that they had contributed, and a very reasonable proposition has been put to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that that reasonable proposition, which I know has had the support of a number of senior Ministers, will enhance the operation of democracy, and parliamentary democracy in particular, in our region. I urge the Government to move more swiftly than it has done until now to bring the matter to a final resolution. Hopefully, it will accept the proposals that have been put forward by the executive of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and by the executives of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in every one of the States. It is a very reasonable, constructive and far-sighted proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> Technical difficulties are always put in the way of this, in a true Yes, Minister tradition, and we must obviously never neglect them. We are told that there are questions left unanswered, constitutional problems, technical difficulties and all the rest. We have heard all of those. We know what they are; they are not insurmountable. Every one of them can be solved if there is the political will to do so. I urge the Government to move, hopefully before the end of the session, to announce to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association executive and to this chamber and the other chamber a final resolution of what is now a twelve-month old debate about what use that surplus will be put to. I hope it will be put to the recommendations from the Government which, as I have said, are directed to the enhancement of parliamentary democracy within our region. </PARA>

Wherever we turned, there was somebody, mainly in an akubra hat or with a badge which identified him, able to assist. There were delegates from the home Parliament as well as the visitors. Some of us-perhaps most of us-from the Australian delegation stayed at the same hotel as the delegates from the South Pacific countries, which gave us a particularly good opportunity to get to know them-something which I appreciated when I went with our delegation to the South Pacific in August this year and had the opportunity to meet again many of those people. </PARA>
<PARA> One other perhaps insignificant matter, but for which we should thank Australia Post, is the stamp that was issued to commemorate the event. That did not occur without a great deal of effort. My friend Senator Puplick fought hard to make sure that that tradition of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conferences was maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> The report is worth reading. I believe that it is worth while to meet as we did and have the opportunity to talk to people. Undoubtedly, talking is one of the best ways of getting to know people and it is very worth while. I hope that the conferences will continue in a way that is beneficial to all of us. I certainly appreciated being one of the delegates from this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a delegate from this Parliament to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) conference, I would like to add my comments to those of honourable senators who have preceded me this evening. I would like to mention, as did Senator Reid, that it is unfortunate that these reports come at the end of the session and are not given the attention that they deserve. Whether one likes it or not, they ought to be debated. By all standards, the conference was a very sizable one, with 265 delegates and secretaries from 104 parliaments and legislatures. In total, there were 520 participants, including spouses and unofficial observers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want to canvass this because, as Senator Macklin said, when the President presented his report earlier this year-or late last year; it was certainly a fair while ago-we expressed our views and our congratulations on the efforts of the people who made the conference such a success. It would not be appropriate for me to repeat those remarks here, except to single out one person, and that was our Secretary, Mr Mark McRae. I do so because he is no longer working within this Parliament. He has been appointed to the new position of Clerk of the Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory. I am sure all delegates will join with me in acknowledging that Mark McRae was most efficient, courteous, knowledgeable and effective as a secretary. I would like to wish him well in his new job. </PARA>
<PARA> I also mention the aspect of the small nations conference which was held in Hobart, Tasmania, in September. That, too, was quite an effort and those people associated with the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in the State Parliament are to be congratulated for the effort they put into that. The President of the conference expressed an appreciation for the warmth of the hospitality that the delegates received in Tasmania. It was not all beer and skittles. There was quite a good deal of work done. There was an opportunity for discussion with delegates and, as honourable senators will see from the report, if they study it, quite a range of subjects was debated. I was involved in two aspects of the conference; in particular, the panel on acquired immune deficiency syndrome and the panel on environmental protection in relation to population growth, industrialisation and urbanisation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am rather concerned that at those international conferences some unthinking delegates appear to place the blame for the lack of food, poverty and a whole range of things on the fertility of the women. That is totally unjust, unfair and degrading for those women. It has to be challenged. The suggestion that the fertility of women in poorer countries is the cause of food shortages and problems is a nonsense; there is more food in the world than one can poke a stick at. The problem is not the amount of food that is produced; the problem is the distribution of the food. As an example of this, one can take Zaire in Africa where there are food shortages. The Food and Agriculture Organisation says that Zaire alone has the capacity to feed seven times the current population of Africa. But there are food shortages in Zaire at the present time. One of the reasons for that is that the urban elites are kicking the guts out of farmers. Another major cause of poverty and hunger is the lack of internal security in various countries, and outright war. What farmer will grow crops when one group will charge through his crop one month, and six months later the other group will chase back after them? We have to look at the facts and not just be carried away with the unfounded assertions of the population control elites in various international agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> The conference was not only a success in the friendships that it made and the opportunities it gave to individual delegates to discuss particular problems of parliamentary democracies in various Commonwealth countries but was also of use to expose the views of various delegates on particular topics. It was the first CPA general conference that I had attended. I was very pleased to do so in this Parliament. It might be thought that one would have desired to go to a CPA conference in some other part of the world, but--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer to the section of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce that deals with the Australian Customs Service. I raise this matter because of the continuing concern I have had about security at Sydney Airport. This matter, which I raised in Senate Estimates Committee A and have raised repeatedly in this chamber, has still not been satisfactorily addressed by the Government. I refer the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) to the Estimates Committee A report to the Senate, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Auditor-General, in report number 17 of 1989-90, expressed concern about the level of security at Sydney International Airport. The Committee heard evidence that airport security was still inadequate and that claims by the Federal Airports Commission in September 1989 that upgraded security measures were in place were inaccurate. A number of questions were taken on notice by the Customs Service which when answered will give the Committee a clearer idea of the extent of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not a member of that Committee but I was the person who asked the questions. I certainly received no answers. Before I proceed, will the Minister indicate to the Committee whether and when we are to get these answers and explain to us why we have not got them yet, when we are debating the matter now?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not able to advert to the particular questions which were asked, but quite recently there have been discussions between the Federal Airports Corporation, the Australian Customs Service and other agencies involved in security at airports, particularly Sydney Airport. New arrangements have been set in train which I think are regarded by most parties as satisfactory. A little time will be taken to reach a conclusion on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the Customs Service was instrumental in raising some of these issues, and the honourable senator was familiar with that at the Senate Estimates Committee. I think the position of Customs is that it is now satisfied with the new arrangements that have been made, but it will require a trial period to see that they work satisfactorily. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. The reason that I express real concern about this matter is that, either intentionally or unintentionally, the appearance of some sort of cover-up about inadequate security seems to loom. We had a situation in which the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) put out a statement falsely claiming that everything was great at Sydney Airport, according to both the Auditor-General and the Australian Customs Service. Let us be certain that there is no confusion about that. The Auditor-General's report into the Australian Customs Service noted on page 5, paragraph 5.6, that Customs had advised that the overall level of airport security was of concern and that Customs' concerns had already been drawn to the attention of the Federal Airports Corporation and the Department of Transport and Communications. At Estimates Committee A, Mr Kelly, the Comptroller-General of Customs, replied:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The concerns generally relate to physical security. There are areas of fencing which are falling into a state of disrepair and gates that are incapable of being locked properly. In our view, the issue and control of security passes leaves a lot to be desired. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kelly goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> There has been a series of discussions since then and I am due to meet with the executive of the Department of Transport and Communications, on 23 October, I think, for further discussions. . . . We conducted a survey of security within the airport precincts. It was of major concern to us. In July we made a presentation to FAC representatives of our findings, using slides, pictures, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to see those slides, pictures, et cetera, but I guess I will not. Mr Kelly went on:</PARA>
<PARA> We have a strong presence at airports and security is one of the areas in which we are interested, even though we are not fundamentally responsible for it. It was merely an initiative of officers at the airports who determined that they should look at security per se. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Customs Service for the sense of responsibility which prompted it to take on a bit of concern about something that was not adequately being addressed by the Federal Airports Corporation and other government instrumentalities such as the Department of Transport and Communications which have this responsibility. At least we can say about the Customs Service that it has a sufficient sense of responsibility to pick up that ball dropped by other governmental agencies. Mr Kelly said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is an airport security committee and the issue has certainly been raised with that committee. </PARA>
<PARA>By inference, it was raised by Customs. Mr Kelly indicated further that it was correct that officers from the Attorney-General's Department had been able to gain access to the tarmac at Sydney Airport without any identification or authorisation and that they had been shown how to do so by Customs officers who had raised the matter with the Auditor-General in the first place. Many of the questions I asked relate to a number of authorities that issue ID cards. It may well be that the Customs Service believes that perhaps the Federal Airports Corporation should be the authority answering these questions. If that is so, it should say so. Among the questions are these:</PARA>
<PARA> Are vehicles searched on leaving and entering airports? Is it true that in some cases FAC and Customs staff do not have access to the gates that Qantas ID cardholders have? How do cleaners get access to the airport? Are several gates at Sydney airport left open and unsupervised?</PARA>
<PARA>I recognise that Customs does not have a direct responsibility for this but, as it had raised the issue and demonstrated the lack of security, I asked its representatives:</PARA>
<PARA> Will you provide this Committee with all documents relating to Customs' study of security at Sydney airport and in particular, any report prepared by the Customs staff at Sydney airport and copies of all correspondence between Customs and the FAC and the Department of Transport and Communications relating to that report? Can I also have all documents relating to the comments by the Auditor-General in his report?</PARA>
<PARA>Those reports related to the Customs situation. They are very important questions. The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) will recognise-although I am grateful for his assurances that the replies will be provided speedily-that it is particularly galling that we do not have such responses at a time when we debating the Customs Service's appropriations. Surely one of the points of Senate Estimates committees is to allow honourable senators to be informed about matters that concern them so that there can be, if required, an informed debate in this forum at this time when we are dealing with appropriations about the conduct of departments. </PARA>
<PARA> It is sufficiently important for the bipartisan report of Senate Estimates Committee A to stress the importance of those questions and how those answers will give a clear idea of the extent of the problem. The reason that I am being perhaps a little obsessive about it-the Minister has chided me about raising this matter over and over again, but I am certain the Minister will acknowledge this-is that, if this sort of thing is not dealt with properly, if our concerns are not resolved because information is not presented by the Government when it is asked for over and over again, there can be the reasonable suspicion that maybe there is a cover-up. I repeat: there was from the Federal Airports Corporation a press release which falsely asserted that all these matters had been corrected when the Customs Service said with great vigour that they had not been and when the Auditor-General said with great assurance that they had not been fixed up. </PARA>
<PARA> In that context there is a special requirement on the Government to solve this matter. If, as the Minister said, these matters were resolved at the subsequent meeting in October between these parties-the Australian Customs Service, the Department of Transport and Communications, the Auditor-General, I presume, and the Federal Airports Corporation-let us see the extent to which there is resolution and agreement. I understand how there are natural constraints on the resources available to the Government to provide advisers at a time like this but I would have thought that any department, recognising that a list of 28 questions had been put on notice and referred to in the report of the Committee as being outstanding, would have been prompted at least to have been aware of the fact that a question would be asked about where the answers were. I find it incredible that that sort of preparation has not been done by the Department and that we are left hanging in the air. It is a grossly unsatisfactory situation, almost as grossly unsatisfactory as the level of security at Sydney Airport, as demonstrated by both the Customs Service and the Auditor-General. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Around the time of Estimates Committee A hearing, a public statement was made to which I wish to refer and there was a response by Senator Button. This statement related to the Australian export development grants scheme and I raise it here under program 3 which was considered by the Estimates Committee. The statement was made in the course of an article, I think in the Australian Financial Review, by Mr John Lark who is the head of a major hard-core pornography distributor in Australia-a distributor of mainly United States produced videos. Because of that statement Mr Lark indicated that his organisations would be producing hard-core X-rated video material for export markets. He had previously indicated that the company was interested in buying the Asia-Pacific rights for many United States produced hard-core pornography videos. Mr Lark, in his statement, indicated that he would be seeking a grant from the Government for the export of the material that was being produced in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Broadly, that is the picture. I am anxious and interested to hear from the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) whether any of the money which is currently being considered by this Committee would be finding its way, through that scheme, to the producers of hard-core video pornography for export. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In so far as the Budget appropriates money for the export development grants scheme it is possible that, if Mr Lark, or whatever his name is, made an application for assistance in exports, he would receive money allocated on the basis of the export development grants scheme, as would any other exporter seeking to develop an export market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The export development grants scheme is administered by Austrade. It is subject to legislation which does not allow the Minister any right of interference in its allocation. It is a scheme which is open for exporters generally and the Minister has no discretion or right to interfere in respect of any appropriate application which is covered by the legislation. I think that is a splendid restraint on Ministers because if Ministers were to be placed in a position where they could interfere with these things they would properly be open to a charge of interference and perhaps discriminatory conduct if people were aggrieved by the refusal of any application. So that is the position. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it-and this is largely hearsay-there has been no application or money appropriated in this Budget which would find its way to Mr Lark, if that is his name, unless it was a matter which he approached with great expedition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This raises a question of government policy. The Government, which is now faced with this situation, cannot run away from the issue of hard-core video pornography in Australia because it will be put right back on its plate again. Of course, the Government has tried to give the flick pass to the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly in respect of the sale and hire of this type of video in the ACT and it has attempted to wipe its hands of that issue. I would suggest that that is really an attempt to disguise the support that the Government is giving to this industry. This issue is now coming right back onto the Government's plate. Surely it raises a question as to whether the Government considers the effect that the material which largely depicts acquired immune deficiency syndrome high-risk behaviour-we have seen this from the report of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material-is likely to have on viewers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It raises the question of Government policy as far as exports are concerned, particularly to the Asia-Pacific region. Leaders from the Pacific area have expressed to me their concern about this material being exported from Australia to their countries. One has to ask whether the Government is insensitive to these views. The Government might say that it is up to those countries, if they wish, to ban at barrier controls the material coming in. The Government cannot argue that way because it has already argued that barrier control in this country is inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has to consider whether it wants Australia and particularly Canberra to be regarded as a hard-core pornography centre not only of Australia but also of the South Pacific and the Asian regions. The Government also has to consider whether it is prepared to pay taxpayers' money to a pornographer to produce videos which are to be sent overseas and which degrade Australian women. That is the issue that the Government has to face. The sooner it faces that issue the better. It is no good the Minister saying that he has no power to intervene in applications for export development grants. The Government must have a policy on this issue. It has been brought to the Government's attention that, if in the next few months it fails to take certain action about this and to have a policy on it, then the Government will have to live with the failure to make that decision. The Government does have power over this matter. It has the constitutional export power. It is no good saying that it has not got the power; it has got the power. </PARA>
<PARA> Now that this matter has been raised, I hope that the Government will take it on board. I can understand what the Minister is saying in respect of export development grants. He said that in normal cases it would not be appropriate for the Minister to intervene, but these are very major policy questions. I suppose one could say the same thing about the export of arms, which is another example. The Government has a policy on that matter and makes determinations as to whether it will issue export licences for certain commodities. So the Government does have the power. The question is whether the Government has the will to stand up against this pornography merchant who is making millions and who will seek to make more millions by degrading Australian women in the eyes of the rest of the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer again to the Estimates Committee report and to the item on page 17 entitled `The Australian Bicentennial Authority (ABA)'. In the final paragraph concerning that topic the Committee said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Any future authorities that may be established to co-ordinate any major events such as the centenary of Federation, should draw on the experience of the ABA and avoid many of the problems encountered by the ABA during its period of operation. </PARA>
<PARA>The words `avoiding many of the problems encountered by the ABA' is a nice, polite way of saying, `errors that were encountered'. We also said in the report that officers from the ABA were not subject to the same level of scrutiny. A great number of questions were put on notice. Many of those questions were put on notice by Senator Michael Baume on my behalf on 18 October. There were some 32 questions relating to a project entitled `Unsung Heroes'. They related very much to a claim by one, Mr Leticq, who said that the ABA had used his intellectual property-that is, his ideas-and had given out those ideas to be dealt with under the auspices of the ABA itself with the assistance of somebody else who has been the attention of this chamber today, one Mr John Singleton. </PARA>
<PARA> On Monday this week I asked Senator Richardson whether he would detail for me the amounts of money that had been paid to Mr Singleton out of public moneys since the 1987 election. Senator Richardson came back in the afternoon after Question Time and reported that no money had been paid to Mr Singleton. The following day he amended that answer and indicated that two amounts of money in excess of $50,000 had been paid to Mr Singleton concerning the True Blue campaign, the first payment, if my recollection serves me correctly, having been due and owing from the pre-1987 campaign. A subsequent amount of $3,000 was paid in the period 1987 to 1989 for the submission that Mr Singleton made for the Buy Australian-Made campaign. Senator Richardson told us today that there were two submissions. I am wondering whether Mr Singleton was paid twice. </PARA>
<PARA> In April this year when dealing with the question of the ABA and its use of intellectual property, which other people say belonged to them, we were told that a fee of some $9,300 was paid to Mr Singleton. That was with regard to the project which I think began on 7 May 1986. Mr Singleton wrote to the ABA mentioning 200 `Greatest Stories Ever Told' and `Unsung Heroes'. The proposal was outlined by Mr Singleton on 7 May and was very similar to the one that was first given by Mr Leticq. The question of how Mr Singleton was selected to take over this project was dealt with on page 105 of Hansard and the date is 11 April. I asked Mr Kirk whether the particular project was tendered for. I asked him whether there was a request for tender as there was a fee of $9,300 involved. The transcript reads:</PARA>

<PARA>He then went on to find out who made the recommendation. It was one Wendy McCarthy, he thought, but he was not sure. The way work is handed out by the ABA seems to be rather similar to the way that the committee chaired by Senator Richardson overturned a recommendation by a committee as to who was to get the Buy Australian-Made campaign and simply decided that Mr Singleton ought to have the $2.4m contract. </PARA>
<PARA> The ABA was very controversial on many aspects. Not least was the First Fleet and the appalling way in which the Bicentennial Authority treated Mr King and the people who endeavoured to have a First Fleet re-enactment. Those of us who, on Australia Day, sat on the forecourt of the Opera House and watched as the First Fleet sailed into Farm Cove, with a surge of pride and emotion, will never forget it. Hundreds of thousands of Australians lined the shores of Sydney's magnificent harbour and watched with a certainty of pride and a swelling within the breast of the feeling that we had truly marked Australia Day in a memorable way. Yet the record of the ABA in dealing with the people who attempted that endeavour was truly disgraceful. The record is there for people to see, both in evidence that was elicited through Estimates committees and through the book that Mr King has now published. The Committee has said in its report that lessons must be learned from the ABA so that mistakes are not repeated-and difficulties, I think the report says, are not encountered-with such an event as the celebration of the centennial of Federation. That bias against individuals, that roughshod treatment by the Authority of individuals, should not be allowed to occur again. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the Bicentennial as an event celebrated by Australians, and the effort that was put in to bring tourists here to share it with us, was a momentous and important occurrence in Australia's history. Nobody would want to take away from that. It is an interesting report that we have received today. There are two wonderful, glossy volumes with a glossy cover. If one looks at the colour reproductions one could be tempted to say that there could be eight colour separations, a very expensive process. There are many coloured photographs inside the report. Yet, look as I can, I cannot find a list of consultants who were used in the past year by the ABA. Had none been used, I would have expected there to be a statement within the annual report to say so because it is a strict requirement that the names of consultants used by government departments must be published in the annual report. Perhaps the Minister will be able to enlighten me as to whether consultants were taken on by the ABA in the 12-month period or whether the fact has simply been omitted. If it has been omitted, why has it been omitted in breach of the requirement of the law to so publish?</PARA>
<PARA> To go back to the Estimates hearing on 18 October, try as I will to look at the additional information that has been supplied to the Committee subsequent to the hearings-I dealt with some of that earlier in the day-I can find no record of answers to the questions that were placed on notice on that date. They relate very specifically to the question of Mr Leticq's claim against the ABA. I recall asking the ABA whether it had made any provision in its accounts for possible damages which may be awarded against it in any action which may be subsequently brought and be successful. I also placed questions on notice concerning School Mates and Schools Across Australia and the way in which that was developed. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that remains outstanding with regard to the ABA and has not been satisfactorily dealt with is that in the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts concerning the Auditor-General we recommended that an alteration be made to the Audit Act to remedy the situation whereby it was possible, as happened with the ABA, for a prospective auditee to refuse permission for an efficiency audit to be carried out by the Auditor-General. This has been an ongoing matter which first came to light in questioning in the Estimates Committee in 1987 when Mr Kirk told the Committee that, indeed, there had been an efficiency audit carried out on the ABA. In January the following year the Australian Audit Office wrote to the Committee and advised that this was not so and that the Committee had been given incorrect evidence. Subsequently, it was found and decided that, as the bicentennial was upon us, it was not practical to carry out an efficiency audit. Yet I believe it would have been quite worth while to do that in order to make a proper judgment of various projects that were carried out by the ABA to see whether we truly got value for money. </PARA>
<PARA> In the report that we have received today, at page 191 of volume 2, we see that the ABA spent during the period from 1980 to the present the sum of $240m, and of that $240m, $165.3m was spent on programs and $74.3m was spent on administration. One could be pardoned for asking: Was that money efficiently spent? That is exactly what efficiency audits are designed to find out. Therefore, it is essential that a body such as the ABA should be able to be subject to an efficiency audit by the decision of the Auditor-General and not by the decision of the body which is to be the subject of the audit. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument that was used to support the ABA not being subject to an efficiency audit was the same argument that was used to try to say that the ABA was not subject to freedom of information (FOI) legislation. In this Parliament at the end of last year an attempt was made by the Government to put a regulation through which in fact stated that the ABA, being included in the schedule as being subject to FOI applications, should no longer be so subject. The Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances felt that this was totally unreasonable and that, if there was a doubt as to whether the ABA was subject to FOI, then that should be subject to a fresh piece of legislation and that simply to pass a regulation to put it beyond doubt that it was not so subject was unacceptable. After a protective notice of motion was given, it was formally resolved in the Senate that that regulation be disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that we have not subsequently seen any legislation, that the same legal argument was used to support that FOI regulation, and that it was also used to stop efficiency audits of the ABA during the course of its activity. Those are very significant lessons to be learned. I sincerely trust that when we do come to celebrate the centenary of the Federation there will be no such hanky-panky, as it were, that everything will not only be done correctly but be seen to be done correctly and that we will have a more obviously efficient expenditure of public moneys to achieve the desired result. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that another senator is on his way to ask questions about the Department of Industrial Relations. First, I refer to the decision of the Victorian Supreme Court and its obvious ramifications for all registered industrial organisations, whether they be employer organisations or employee organisations, and indeed the ramifications of that decision for the whole of the industrial relations system in Australia, at both Federal and State levels. I ask whether the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce has considered this Victorian Supreme Court decision and whether the Government will seek leave to intervene in any appeal which may be made against that decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, for many years now I have been quite conscious of the need for industrial organisations to operate within the guidelines that were established for the conduct and control of industrial disputes. Those guidelines were established almost 20 years ago, after much consideration and argument. I can well remember participating in the discussions on the development of those guidelines. However, unfortunately the guidelines have not been observed in many instances of industrial action. Innocent parties have been affected and certain actions have been taken by employers at common law. </PARA>
<PARA> The inevitable result of the failure to observe the rules for the conduct and control of industrial disputes is the reduction in the protection that is available to wages and working conditions. I know in the old rules of various trade unions and central trade union organisations there used to be printed a number of guidelines for the exercise of the right to strike. The Government has recently made statements after it was criticised for not seeking leave to intervene in the Victorian case. I think it was justly criticised for standing aside when common law actions were initiated which could have had an effect on a number of innocent parties and industrial organisations and which would set precedents. When the Government was criticised about that it said, `Well, the right to strike is not absolute'. I do not know too many people who would say that the right to strike is absolute, but it is necessary for the Government to focus on the principles to which consideration should be given by unions and their members when they exercise the right to strike. The Government should enact legislation or take other action to protect that right; otherwise, trade unions and employees will suffer grave consequences, I believe, in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak briefly on the matter of quarantine, which I raise for four reasons. One is the quite extraordinarily impassioned defence of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) by the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) on Friday last and this Tuesday, and by his senior Minister, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), on Monday. Secondly, the Chairman invited me to speak in the Committee of the Whole. Thirdly, there seems to have been a very significant change of attitude on the part of Government towards quarantine. Fourthly, I think that, by any judgment, we would have to say that there was a less than forthright response from some of the officers at the Estimates hearings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I go any further, I want to dispel any of this silly talk about a tax on AQIS and such things which have been raised in the last few days. I do not want to attack AQIS, and I will not have it said that that is my policy, as I believe the relationship we have had over a period of years would clearly demonstrate the contrary. However, I simply want to ensure that the job is done, that the standards are maintained and that protection is provided. For those reasons, I certainly support the quarantine service. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had discussions about quarantine in various places-New Zealand, the United States of America, Canada and the United Kingdom, amongst others. We expect our exports to be of the highest quality. We inspect them before they go overseas, and retain very high standards. Products such as fish, honey, meat, flowers and fruit are all inspected in Australia before they are exported. I realise that this is done both for our own benefit and for the benefit of our customers. I have no problem with AQIS; my problem is with the Government. Three dorothy dixers were asked, producing incredible statements from the two Ministers concerned. It is extraordinary. The Government makes the decisions. AQIS only carries them out. It is certainly not for the Government to hide under the AQIS skirts. AQIS needs no defence at all; the Government does. </PARA>
<PARA> This current doctrine that we have is built on four separate areas. I find these difficult to understand. The first is that we have to accept a level of acceptable risk. There are no published or predetermined levels of contamination in products. There is no agreement with exporters as to what these are, and there are no plans in place for when it all goes wrong. The second area is this rubbish about quarantine being seen as a non-tariff barrier. Any quarantine issue that is properly handled will never be seen as a non-tariff barrier by any respectable country of the world. There are no examples of its happening here. There is no excuse for sloppiness, and there is no credit at home or overseas for our taking stupid risks. </PARA>
<PARA> The third area is the legality question. Over a period I have had this put to me repeatedly; that is, if it is not allowed to come in legally, it will come in illegally. Again, I do not accept that. That, too, is totally unacceptable and there is no excuse for sloppiness. If there is a problem or even a doubt, the answer, as ever, is `keep it out'. Nothing less than that has ever worked. Ever since I can remember that has been the basis on which this has been determined in regard to quarantine and it should still be the case. The Australian producers are the Government's prime responsibility. They must come first. In the case of imports, it is the customer, too. </PARA>
<PARA> The last area, and the latest-this one sprang on me recently at the Estimates-is that we are waiting on an international forum. What happens in the meantime? How will we clean up the mess if we have an outbreak of some major problem-in this case as a result of the dumping of ballast water and what comes in with the ballast?</PARA>
<PARA> The next question is: for how many of these cases do we have a disaster plan? I know what the arrangements are if we have an outbreak of foot and mouth, but do we have a disaster plan if there is an outbreak of fire blight? Do we destroy the orchards? Do we destroy the host trees that also carry the virus? Do we just apply another spray? What do we do? I cannot find anybody out there who is privy to the sort of information that would cover that. What about transmissible gastroenteritis? I asked questions but got non-answers as to whether we destroy the whole herd, and whether we compensate. Can anybody tell me? I do not know. What is more worrying than my not knowing is that it seems that the Government does not know either. </PARA>
<PARA> I said that there were four reasons why I wanted to speak and I have dealt with one of them only-the defence question. I see no reason for the full defensive that we have had. There are slips as well. I drew attention to the fact that a herd of buffaloes got through the Australian quarantine system. We also had 248 cases of nashi pears that came through quarantine. Both the buffaloes and the nashi pears came through without notification or inspection. Also, what about transmissible gastroenteritis? AQIS's preferred risk factor figure is one in 3.3 million. All that the veterinarians' associations suggest is that it be one in 15,000. There is a difference of 200 times. Has there been any other check? I cannot find that out either. If there have been other checks, by whom were they conducted, and when were they done? If not, why not?</PARA>
<PARA> I do not blame the pig farmers, with hundreds of millions of dollars invested, for getting a bit jumpy. What would happen in the event of an outbreak? Who knows? Who decides? Who even makes recommendations? It is not covered by saying, `Let's wait for the next Agricultural Council meeting and we will discuss it'. While we are on the subject of pigs, Senator Brownhill, a day or two ago, raised the question of mecadox. Is there a potential problem in using this feed additive? If there is, we should ban it and the product, otherwise we should allow it to be used. It must be one or the other. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to cheese. What about nitrates? For years and years, through the opportunity that Estimates committee hearings have offered me, I have raised the question of the use of nitrates in cheese. It is not permitted to be added to cheese made in Australia on health grounds. Yet cheese made with the use of nitrates is still allowed to be imported. Is it a health risk, or is it not? Is it, in fact, a means of putting some handicap on Australian cheese production that other countries are not stuck with? Why do we allow cheese to be imported which is manufactured in a form that is unacceptable in Australia? Who makes this decision? Why can we not get it carried through? It places our producers at a disadvantage. It costs them more because extra cleanliness and handling in manufacturing is required. It clearly puts our consumers of imported cheese at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> I was not given much help at the hearings about listeria. Thirteen batches of imported cheese have been declared to have been contaminated by listeria-a deadly complaint-this year. Three per cent of the batches that have come in have been contaminated. It was half suggested to me that the reason for this is that we propose to have open boundaries for trade and if we put any sort of stopper on this it may be seen to be a non-tariff barrier. We should stop listeria at the starting point. We should not allow any company in any country to sell cheese to Australia unless it has been cleared, in exactly the same way that we clear our cheese before it leaves Australia. Why is this not done? If people want to sell us cheese-and they do-let them sell it to us on our terms, not theirs. I have no argument with the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. AQIS does as the Government says. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point concerns the presentation itself. I draw attention to the fact that at pages F68, 69 and 70 of the Estimates Committee Hansard the answers to the questions are couched in these terms: `I think'; `I do not know'; `Again, I do not have that information'; `I am not aware of any circumstances'; `I do not believe'; `I think'; `I regret that I cannot tell you'; `I should think that if we got'; `I have no information'; `I think'; `I think'; and `We believe'. I would have thought that, in a relatively small operation like quarantine, the officers in charge would have known more than they admitted. Whether they were told by the Minister not to answer questions, as happened with other departments, I do not know, but I do not accept in Estimates committees that every question asked should be prefixed by, `I think'. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to know the answers to the questions that we asked because, if we do not get the answers through the Estimates committees, we cannot expect the Minister to give them to us in this place. In future, I would like to see the questions answered in that forum. Even when we came to one of these patches, the Chairman came to their aid, I think at page 64, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Archer, we have probably gone as far as we can on this issue. . . Perhaps this is an issue which you can bring up in the Committee of the Whole.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee of the Whole is not the forum in which we should obtain this fundamental basic operational information. We have 60 million tonnes of toxic ballast water, containing exotic seaweeds, dino flagellates, et cetera, so how bad will we let things get before we do something about the problem? Will we wait until some international meeting or conference is held or until we submit a paper to some meeting? How much do we depend on having the proceedings carried out in a satisfactory manner? As far as I am concerned, the procedure is quite inadequate and the presentation at the Estimates Committee was less than satisfactory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quite prepared to answer any of the criticisms raised by Senator Archer. The most fundamental criticism he raises is that he has not been able to obtain answers to a series of questions and that he does not know the answers. It may well be that he has not inquired or properly sought the information, because the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) is, indeed, a very transparent organisation which maintains a heavy publishing regime of reports and discussion papers about its activities. AQIS is in constant consultation with industry groups as to what it does, so that its operations can be understood and seen for what they are-nothing more or less than quarantine and inspection operations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the allegation that AQIS is somehow lowering the standards, I do not think it is good enough to say it is simply not a criticism of AQIS. It is a criticism of AQIS. By extension it is a criticism of the Government but directly it is a criticism of AQIS's professional standards and one that needs to be refuted.

Let me take the example he used in relation to the contamination of a shipment of nashi fruit. This is an example that the honourable senator and Mr Lloyd have both used as an indication of failure on the part of AQIS. What the honourable senator said about that shipment is not true. That shipment came in as a trial shipment. AQIS detected some contamination of part of that shipment, which is proof that the detection standards of AQIS work, it is effective and does discover problems. As a consequence of that, that element of the shipment was quarantined and was not allowed admission to Australia. Rather than citing that as an indication of AQIS's inability to do its job, it would be honest and objectively true to say that it is an example of AQIS succeeding. Yet just last week, in a press release by Bruce Lloyd, we had the citation of that and a series of other events as blunders. They are not blunders; they are successes. Its purpose is to detect problems. When it detects problems, for the finger to be then waved at it as therefore having failed because the goods have got that far shows that the world is on its head; that is a topsy-turvy view of reality.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am informed that the Royal Australian Air Force had already asked for $12,000 per hour for the charter of the 707 aircraft and that such request had been rejected by the airlines. I am also informed that at the Canberra meeting the Government suggested a rate of $5,100 per hour for the charter of this aircraft but that this was refused by both airlines. I am further informed that a representative from Australian Airlines Ltd accepted a rate of $4,000 per hour but that this was not accepted by the representative from Ansett Airlines of Australia, who said that he would have to refer the matter to his Melbourne bosses. I am further informed that the Prime Minister then received a communication from Sir Peter Abeles in which he was advised that Ansett would meet a charter rate for this aircraft of $1,500 plus the fuel costs of approximately $2,000 per hour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 24 August Mr Hugh White, to whom I referred previously, advised the Department of Defence by telephone that the charter rate would be $1,500 per hour for the 707, $800 per hour for the HS748 and $970 per hour for the C130. On 28 August he confirmed that telephone conversation in writing to the Department, saying that the Prime Minister had agreed to a schedule of maintenance charges as I have just set out above. It appears that at no time has the Minister for Defence given a direction to his Department to overrule his own direction of 23 August or to overrule the application of the departmental Defence Instruction (General), both of which required full cost recovery. The Defence Force is thus in the situation of unlawfully chartering its aircraft at less than full cost recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> A departmental schedule of Determination No. 18 of 1989 sets out the direct costs and the full costs of all aircraft types as at September 1989. The full costs per hour of the 707 are shown as $12,031; the HS748 as $3,256; and the C130 as $4,983. Even the list of direct costs shows that the 707 is $8,866; the HS748 is $2,095; and the C130 is $3,061. On 31 August, the Minister for Defence told my colleague, Mr Carlton, in Question Time in the other place that this operation is being conducted on a non-subsidised basis. He also told Mr Carlton that if there was a gap between what was being paid and the actual cost he would apply for additional funding in the Additional Estimates. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . however that is not anticipated as the likely outcome. </PARA>
<PARA>But the Minister already knew that this was not the case. Only five days later, on 5 September, he wrote to the Prime Minister referring to the fact that the Prime Minister had agreed to the schedule of hourly charges to be levied by the Department of Defence on the airlines, and further pointed out that `the adequacy of these charges to cover the RAAF's actual maintenance expenses could not be determined'. He also pointed out the following:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the RAAF has had to cancel a number of its own scheduled services because its aircraft are under charter to the airlines, consequently Defence has been required to pay fares to airlines for Defence personnel to travel on RAAF aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister then asked for confirmation of an agreement to supplementation being made available to Defence in the context of the 1989-90 Additional Estimates review. </PARA>
<PARA> In a letter to Mr Beazley dated 18 September the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> I confirm our earlier discussions about being prepared, at an appropriate time after the conclusion of the dispute to consider a level of supplementation for the Defence Portfolio in the context of the 1989/90 Additional Estimates Review. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly that lukewarm statement is no commitment to supplement the Defence budget, but if it is to be supplemented it will be with taxpayers' funds. Why should it be supplemented by the taxpayers?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson said last night in answer to my question that the taxpayer should provide the supplementation because it was in the public benefit. But I ask: Why is it in the public benefit? The public benefit is served by the provision of the Defence Force aircraft. The airlines should pay full cost recovery of such aircraft. They already have the benefit of the waiver of charges by the Federal Airports Corporation and the Civil Aviation Authority. Neither do they have to pay any navigation or landing charges on the chartered Defence Force aircraft. They are receiving full economy fares for every seat sold on a Defence Force aircraft. Why should they also be massively subsidised by the taxpayers in their charters of Defence Force aircraft? The amount of the subsidy must be at least $25m and is probably considerably greater. It is a national disgrace and as a result of this I referred the matter to the Auditor-General last Friday for investigation. I understand that the inquiry is now being commenced. The Prime Minister in answer to a question today in the House of Representatives failed to answer the essential points raised in the question. Any right-thinking Australian would have to be concerned at a misuse of taxpayers' funds and an abuse of Government process in order to again provide financial largess to the Prime Minister's friends. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few remarks tonight in the adjournment debate regarding the South Australian election result. What has prompted me to speak tonight is that last Sunday and Monday Liberal Party officials in South Australia made a number of statements to the press in a background briefing that it did not look likely that the South Australian Labor Party (ALP) Government would be re-elected. The two-party preferred vote was, in fact, quite different. They claimed that the two-party preferred vote in South Australia would be Liberal, 52 per cent, Labor, 48 per cent and, therefore, that the Australian Labor Party win was unfair and that the electoral boundaries in South Australia were biased in favour of the Labor Party. I believe that the Liberal Party claim is absolutely wrong. The more likely two-party preferred result will be: Labor, 50.4 per cent; Liberal, 49.6 per cent. This is calculated on the following basis: at the close of counting on Sunday night and as reported in the Australian on Monday morning, 27 November, the first preference votes were cast as follows in South Australia-ALP, 41.8 per cent; Liberal, 42.9 per cent; Democrats, 10.2 per cent; others, 5.1 per cent. The others included two successful Independent Labor candidates, the Call to Australia Party candidates, the successful National Party candidate, plus some other National Party candidates, as well as a range of Independent candidates and very minor party candidates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> According to the scrutineers-I think that this is scrutineers from both major parties-the Labor Party is getting just less than 60 per cent of Australian Democrat preferences, and the Liberal Party just over 40 per cent. Amongst the others, the Labor Party received the preferences of the Independent Labor candidates and some other minor candidates. The Liberal Party received the preferences overwhelmingly of the Call to Australia, something around 85 per cent on average, and about 80 per cent of the National Party preferences. </PARA>
<PARA> Using these calculations, the Labor Party, after distribution of preferences, will receive a two-party preferred vote of 50.4 per cent, and the Liberals, 49.6 per cent of the two-party preferred vote. Until the actual count is conducted on a two-party preferred basis in all electorates in South Australia, as will occur in accordance with the State Electoral Act, nobody can be absolutely certain of the two-party preferred vote to the final decimal point, but one thing is certain: there is no way the Liberal Party can claim 52 per cent of the two-party preferred vote, even allowing for an error in the above calculations. It will still be about 50 : 50 between the two major parties. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept the fact that my calculations could be in error, but I do not believe that they would be that much in error. I wanted to speak tonight to lay to rest the misinformation, as I would call it, put round by Liberal Party officials in South Australia that they have been somehow cheated by the electoral system in South Australia. I can understand their chagrin at losing the election, but if my calculations are correct-and I believe they are-the party with the majority two-party preferred vote narrowly won the election. Last night counting of absentee votes in key marginal seats in South Australia confirmed that the almost certain result will be 24 seats for the labor Party, including two Independents; and 23 seats for the Liberal Party, including one National Party member. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out to the Senate that as a result of this election victory, by the time the four-year term is completed at the end of 1993, it will mean that for the last 29 years there will have been 24 years of a Labor Government in South Australia. The two years that the Liberals were in office were as a result of the gerrymander. I think that shows pretty conclusively that the Labor Party does have the continuing support of the people of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other matter I want to conclude on in respect of the election in South Australia. It concerns opinion polls. I know that we, as politicians, are becoming more and more obsessed by the predictions of opinion polls leading up to an election. I note that both sides obviously employ private opinion pollsters to advise them what the results will be, what the issues are, the tactics, and so on. I think that is all fair enough in the political process. What has been happening in Australia over the last 10 years is that, more and more, media outlets are using public opinion polls to make news stories. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the election campaign in South Australia, they were used by the media to become major news stories in themselves. Senator Alston has interjected about Rod Cameron. Rod Cameron is on the record as saying that he believes that far too much emphasis is given publicly to public opinion polls to try to affect election results.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to draw the attention of the Senate in particular to the Morgan gallup polls that were published in the Bulletin leading up to the South Australian election. I must say that I have always held the view that the Morgan gallup polls conducted between elections and during election campaigns have little credibility. Certainly in South Australia the poll taken about 10 days before the election and published in the Bulletin magazine on the Wednesday before the election showed that a close finish was likely. In fact, the headline in the Bulletin was `Close finish likely in SA'. It showed that from October-November to 18 and 19 November the first preference Labor vote had dropped from 49 per cent to 45 per cent, support for the Liberal-National Party had gone up by 7 per cent, and support for the Australian Democrats had dropped by 4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> A Morgan gallup poll taken only on the Thursday before polling day and published in the Adelaide Advertiser last Saturday, election day, claimed that the Liberal-National Party State-wide vote was at 48 per cent, the Labor vote at 40 per cent and the Australian Democrats at 10 per cent. There seems to be no mention of `other'. One thing is for certain: the final result of the election bore no relationship to what Gary Morgan's poll predicted. Certainly the Liberal-National Party vote was overstated by something like 5 per cent, and in South Australia 5 per cent would be around 50,000 voters. The Labor vote was understated by nearly 2 per cent, which is about 18,000, and the projected Australian Democrats vote was almost dead accurate. As I say, there was no mention of `other'. </PARA>
<PARA> If that poll had indicated the true result of the election, the Liberal Party would have clearly won. In the final result, as I said earlier, the Liberal Party did not get 48 per cent; it got 42 per cent. With a 48 per cent first preference vote and getting nearly half the Australian Democrats' votes alone, the Liberal Party would have got 52 or 53 per cent, which would have won it the extra two or three seats it needed to win the election with a comfortable majority. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to mention another point about the Morgan gallup poll, the spokesperson for which is Garry Morgan. For the last month or so the Bulletin has published the Morgan gallup poll every fortnight. It gets considerable publicity and becomes a news story in itself, which other news media pick up. Every fortnight it shows that there can be quite considerable changes in the political support for various parties in Australia. I must say that in my view some of the swings in political support defy description and credibility. There are about 10.3 million people on the electoral roll in Australia, so every one percentage point change in an opinion poll indicates that approximately 100,000 people have changed their preference on how they vote. The recent Morgan gallup polls published in the Bulletin showed that, for example, between 14 to 21 October and 28 October to 4 November the likely Labor vote went up by 2 per cent. That means that 200,000 people changed their support to the Labor Party. In the same period the Liberal Party support dropped from 46 per cent to 42 per cent, a change of intention by 400,000 people. Support for the Australian Democrats went up by one per cent, indicating an increase of 100,000 votes. Others went up from 4 per cent to 5 per cent-again another 100,000. In that poll in a two-week period we have approaching 800,000 people shifting from one party to the other. That means that nearly 10 per cent of the voters in one fortnight have changed their opinion as to how they will vote. </PARA>
<PARA> That particular poll showed quite a substantial drop in the Liberal Party vote. Honourable senators may well remember that when it came out there was quite wide speculation about the story. It became a major news story in itself. Then, lo and behold, we get another poll taken two weeks later which shows that there has again been a significant change. From that date until 11-18 November Labor stayed the same at 43 per cent but the Liberal-National Party coalition jumped 3 per cent. Again, that is basically 300,000 people changing their vote. The Democrats dropped 200,000, or from 10 per cent to 8 per cent, and others dropped from 5 per cent to 4 per cent. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to come to that. I know that a margin of error is allowed. But it seems to me that, when Mr Morgan is interviewed about these polls, he often gives such definitive accounts as, `This particular poll means so and so'; `the Government is in trouble'; `the Opposition is in trouble'; or `there has been a dramatic slide in the popularity of the Leader of the Opposition or of the Prime Minister'. The next week a change occurs of several percentage points and Mr Morgan makes an absolutely opposite statement. All I say is that it defies credibility that someone can say that in a two-week period hundreds of thousands of people in Australia change their vote and in the next fortnight change it again. Even allowing for the statistical error, I think that Mr Morgan does not give enough emphasis to the fact that there are margins of error and does not give enough emphasis to the fact that, in the longer term, polling between elections ought to be done with a little more caution before extrapolating the result. I also think that the media generally should make every effort to keep in context that these polls are indicating every fortnight massive changes in public opinion. I do not mind whether it is coming to the Labor Party or away from it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All I want to say is that, in my eight years as a party secretary in South Australia, I never believed that opinion was changing so dramatically backwards and forwards. If I had taken notice of that I would have been schizophrenic in trying to assess and to run an election campaign and to anticipate political issues. I just wanted to bring that to the attention of the Senate. I hope there will be a bit more of an informed debate in the community about opinion polls as we lead up to the next Federal election. I hope that they do not publicly play the role they have played in previous campaigns. Sometimes those polls have been used as news stories to successfully help the Labor Party and, sometimes, the Liberal Party. I do not think that it adds to the political debate over issues in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I started by talking about the South Australian election, I hope that the Senate will forgive me for offering my congratulations to the Labor Premier of South Australia, John Bannon, on being re-elected for this third term, albeit, I accept, only narrowly. As people say about football premierships: if a team wins a premiership by a point it still receives the trophy and it is still written up as a win. We in South Australia are delighted that John Bannon and the Labor Government have been re-elected. We in South Australia look forward to another great four years of Labor rule. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just start by responding to what Senator Schacht had to say because I found his remarks very interesting. In many ways his assessment is probably more accurate than that of some of the pollsters. One thing that struck a discordant note with me was the suggestion that somehow the media was almost making these stories up in a vacuum. As I understand it, the reality is that what Morgan tends to do is to do his best to explain why there appears to be a trend in one direction or another. I suppose that, were we to be put in the same position, short of saying `We do not know', we would try to identify some of the recent factors which would tend to explain such a movement, although I concede quite readily that more allowance should be made for those necessary statistical fluctuations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over time I have also had the distinct impression that Rod Cameron is a past master at providing the news media with a whole set of stories designed to indicate to leading political journalists, particularly from the Australian Financial Review, and the more formative opinion-makers that Labor research is indicating the following, or that what might otherwise have appeared to be a clever move on the part of the Opposition leader was shown up in Labor polling to be quite counterproductive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course he is not, and I am not necessarily saying that his public statements are the ones that I would be most suspicious about. I strongly suspect that not only Cameron but also Bob Hogg are in the business of regularly providing disinformation of sorts to the media, designed to indicate that somehow there is a real agenda that others are not aware of, or that somehow trends are being picked up by Labor polling that are simply not obvious to anyone else in the community. That is designed to destabilise and put off people who might be pursuing another political strategy. I will not say any more than that, but it seems to me that there is a grain of truth in what the honourable senator had to say about not taking polls at face value. I am a little jaundiced about how a lot of those political stories find their way into the media.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to deal with another matter entirely, and this relates to the ongoing conduct of Mrs Kelly, `the Minister for Getting her Face in the Paper'. I must say, having received some answers to questions on notice, that my concerns are in no way allayed about the way in which she consistently abuses her rights of office. Indeed, she has been quite shameless in her self-promotional activities in the electorate. The Senate might recall when this matter first arose, and those members of the Senate who are occasional residents of Canberra have perhaps received in the mail an important message to telephone customers from Ros Kelly. That was the way in which the letter was addressed. It had a Telecom stamp on the outside, and subsequently we learned that Mrs Kelly bribed Telecom by having half the cost of that mail-out done in her office. </PARA>

That seems to me to be an abuse of a facility that is not generally available. If it is necessary for those purposes, it ought to be generally available. After all, there are three Labor members for Canberra and only one non-Labor member.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The unfortunate aspect of all this is that Mrs Kelly brought such pressure to bear on people in the Telecom office that they were forced to co-sign this notice which went out to all people in the 062 area. Of course, the letter was signed by Mrs Kelly, as Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, and a Mr Ken Williamson, Telecom Customer Services Manager. One of the questions I asked was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Did the Minister advise the Board of Telecom Australia of the nature and extent of her proposed involvement in the recent mail-out to residents . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The answer was:</PARA>
<PARA> My participation in the project was at the request of the Canberra District Telecom Customer Services Manager, Ken Williamson. </PARA>
<PARA>It is clear from an interview that Mr Williamson gave to Margot Kingston in the Sydney Morning Herald, which appeared on 6 October, that Mr Williamson was a very reluctant participant. He said, for example, that he had dealings with Mrs Kelly at least once a week. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> My file regarding Ros Kelly is about five inches thick. </PARA>
<PARA> Ros Kelly is doing something every three or four weeks regarding Telecom in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, Mr Williamson said:</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom had made the digit decision two years before Mrs Kelly became minister, and that it was a purely operational decision. </PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Kelly had subsidised-</PARA>
<PARA>if that is a more felicitous expression for the benefit of Senator Cook-</PARA>
<PARA>the letter drop. </PARA>
<PARA>To quote Mr Williamson again, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom didn't pay 100 per cent. We used their folding machine and their staff volunteered to assist . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I regard that as a disgraceful misuse of facilities. To put the sort of pressure on Telecom, which was obviously brought to bear by the reluctance that is evident in Mr Williamson's remarks, I think is further evidence of the shamelessness of Mrs Kelly's self-promotional stunts. I also note the appalling contradiction in terms of modesty because I asked Mrs Kelly:</PARA>
<PARA> Since April 1989 on any and what occasion has the Minister written to any and what Government business enterprise offering to: (a) launch new service offerings; (b) open new premises; or (c) generally publicise this or any other activity; if so, what responses have been received to date. </PARA>
<PARA>The very modest answer is:</PARA>
<PARA> None; participation in such activities is by invitation. </PARA>
<PARA>That coyness might be understandable, but it is in marked contrast to a statement that Senator Button made in the Senate on 6 October when he talked about Mrs Kelly having launched a Telecom public awareness campaign. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that Telecom expects the public awareness campaign to be the most effective due to the high public profile . . . of Mrs Kelly. The Minister has made herself available to all government business enterprises in her portfolio to launch new service offerings, to open new premises and to generally publicise the good work they are doing. This is a most appropriate activity for a Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is an outrage! Mrs Kelly is sitting back hoping for an invitation and Senator Button is standing up and telling the Senate, with a straight face, that she has made herself available to do all these sorts of obvious electoral activities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course; it has nothing to do with the welfare of Telecom. There are a myriad of issues in this portfolio-it is a very difficult, complex and technical area. The structural adjustment committee of Cabinet will be considering tomorrow a very important Bureau of Transport and Communications report on the nature, the extent and the cost of Telecom's community service obligations and the cross-subsidies that are in place to support them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Telecom has been mounting a very determined rearguard campaign to suppress that. Mr Willis, in his usual form, has been sitting on it for about three months. Mrs Kelly ought to be in the forefront of this debate; she ought to be explaining to the public why that report has not been made public. If the figure is as low as the industry believes-and the published figures have not been denied-she should be explaining why Telecom could not be exposed to substantially greater levels of competition than it experiences at the moment. But no. Instead of Mrs Kelly concentrating on the real issues we have this disgraceful campaign of wandering around the electorate self-promoting, wherever possible, and using Telecom as a mere vehicle for her own publicity-seeking activities. </PARA>
<PARA> I regard these answers simply as confirmation of the highly political nature of Mrs Kelly's activities. I think it is contemptuous of the Parliament that she should have such a folding machine installed and that she should be using it to subsidise these blatantly political activities in pathetic attempts at self-promotion. </PARA>
<PARA> All that Mrs Kelly seems to have contributed to the portfolio are such gems as `presentation of cordless telephone to Woden Valley Hospital; national launch of Telecom Plus at the Hyatt Hotel; launch of public awareness campaign on Canberra's telephone number change; launch of Telecom's electronic white pages service at Tuggeranong Hyperdome' and a number of other activities outside the electorate. She has spent an inordinate amount of time on these things. As Mr Williamson said, she is doing something every three or four weeks regarding Telecom in Canberra. She is using Telecom for her own political purposes. It is not surprising that there are those in the electorate who are increasingly regarding her more as a plastic piranha than a genuine representative of the people. The sooner that Mrs Kelly can get back to the real game and concentrate on some of the very serious policy issues that are crying out to be resolved and which have been shamefully neglected by Mr Willis, who seems to be overwhelmed on about 10 fronts at the same time, and the sooner that Mrs Kelly ceases to use that folding machine for political purposes and assisting her colleagues, the better off the residents of Canberra will be. </PARA>

<PARA> I made a brief visit to the Australian International Defence Export Exhibition (AIDEX) today where I saw many clever and sophisticated devices for killing people and a number of other devices for preventing the first lot from effectively killing oneself. It reminded me of the intense competition between shell and armour manufacturers at the turn of the century-a futile competition that is still going on with ever more sophisticated and expensive materials. Although I was not able to visit every stall, I was impressed by the number of foreign companies and Australian subsidiaries of multinational companies that were represented. Senator Jenkins referred to this subject in a notice of motion this morning and, objectively considered, it is absurd to believe that Australia will wrest meaningful profits out of the hands of these fully qualified merchants of death. </PARA>
<PARA> The large international arms trading companies probably see Australia as the gateway to the South Pacific arms marketplace, but I predict that the profits to Australia from their dealings in our region will only be crumbs and that we will pay a high moral price for these benefits. If Australia were to obstruct lucrative deals by multinational companies, those companies would easily be able to complete the deals through their other branches, possibly while still using components made in Australia. We may already be compromised in this respect by our offsets programs. Components produced in Australia for foreign weapons systems as part of an offsets program, grommets for instance, may end up in use for fighting in wars of which our Government may disapprove. The products of Australian manufacturers may end up helping to kill people on the other side of the world without our Government having any control over the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Another troubling aspect of some of these companies was raised by Senator Vallentine at Question Time today. She pointed out that several of these companies had been involved in corrupt and criminal activities in other countries. In reply, Senator Richardson said they had not yet been caught doing anything illegal in this country. However, we do not allow people with serious criminal records to freely enter our country and I do not see why companies that behave in the same way should be treated any differently. </PARA>
<PARA> When speaking in April this year to the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1988, I referred to several strong statements made by a former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Hayden. Mr Hayden strongly opposed an indiscriminate expansion in Australia's arms trade but, for all practical purposes, Mr Hayden has gone and he now signs the documents that Mr Beazley puts before him. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it seemed that Mr Hayden's was not the only voice advocating a principled approach. Our former Ambassador for Disarmament, Richard Butler, was active in promoting United Nations (UN) scrutiny of conventional arms transfers and the conventional arms trade generally. At the defence conference held in Canberra last December he commented that this stance was not popular. In looking at the UN resolution 43/75S entitled `Conventional Disarmament on a Regional Scale' I notice that, while Australia voted for this resolution and no nation voted against it, the United States abstained. Was Richard Butler's concern about the growth in the conventional arms trade and its effects on the poverty and debt of Third World countries the action of a maverick peacenik? It appears not. Mr Hayden spoke in favour of this position before the General Assembly and so did our current Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans. I referred to this in a question I asked today, but let me quote the words of Senator Evans at more length:</PARA>
<PARA> The quest for greater security through higher and higher levels of conventional arms is only too well known to us all. The International Conference on Disarmament and Development provided ample evidence. It is a simple proposition that more arms do not equal greater security. They feed the appetite of instability and the coffers of those who choose to supply arms at levels that are well beyond those needed for self-defence. </PARA>
<PARA>I was, therefore, rather disappointed in the answer that Senator Evans gave to my question today on what measures Australia had taken in support of the United Nations resolutions on the conventional arms trade. While I support the Government's initiatives on chemical weapons and its other disarmament activities, as far as they go, I regard the absence of any specific follow-up on the conventional arms resolutions to be a grave deficiency. In the past there was a tendency to disregard the United Nations, but recent events have put it back in the forefront of international peacemaking activity and, just as we are supporting United Nations peacemaking efforts in Namibia, it is clearly Australia's duty to support its other initiatives, especially in this case where we were instrumental--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3K4">Senator DUNN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I will do that. I am very concerned that Australia's independence and integrity will be seriously compromised by such arms exhibitions as the Australian International Defence Export Exhibition that we have in Canberra at the moment. Our military alliances, particularly our support of the nuclear war fighting strategy of the United States, is one particular case in point. We have a very good reputation in international forums in some areas. I notice that Senator Gareth Evans seemed to imply just as much today when he answered my question in Question Time. However, he omitted to mention the support Australia still gives to the United States nuclear war fighting systems, which I will not go into today, but which I have raised many times in this forum. Our reputation is now further at risk because of our increase in arms exports which have been made possible by the relaxation of regulations under the Customs and Excise Amendment Bill which was passed this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is very regrettable because the profits that Mr Beazley seems to be hoping for will never eventuate. I wonder whether the cumbersome bureaucracy referred to in the report of the Cooksey Review of Australia's Defence Cooperation Programs and Policy on Export of Defence Equipment has actually limited Australia's military exports as much as the Minister would like us to believe. I doubt it. Skilful commercial operators have learnt how to get around these official obstacles. I will give the Senate a couple of examples in a moment. We probably have most of the market share we are ever going to get without using the black market tactics. It is very difficult to sell arms and military components to our friends and allies, unless we have already purchased their arms at crippling prices when we get some offset business. In Cooksey's report there is an advice from Comsteel about that company's difficulties in penetrating the United States market. Despite its moral sacrifices in the name of deterrence and the alliance, Australia enjoys no favoured status in this area of trade. </PARA>
<PARA> There is considerable growth in indigenous arms industries in countries that might be seen as potential customers; the market for many weapons is already grossly oversupplied. Other companies are well established and will resist Australian intrusion into their territory. For example, Carrington Slipways has already had experience of the underhand methods of arms traders when it tried to market its catamaran minehunter in the Persian Gulf. Honourable senators will remember that all sorts of sneaky tricks were used by French, British and Italian traders to try to keep it out. </PARA>
<PARA> The technology of military systems is essentially the same technology used to manufacture other goods. That was very evident at AIDEX today. The effort and money being expended on trying to export arms would be just as effectively spent building toasters or some other piece of equipment for export. There is no reason to expect Australian arms exports to be any more successful than exports of other manufactured products unless we are going to sell arms to desperate purchasers through the black market. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, have been appalled by the Australian International Defence Export Exhibition (AIDEX) 89 currently being held in Canberra. I think that it is a blight on our national capital and a shame that the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) wants to engage Australian industry in becoming a merchant of death. Obviously, the opposition to AIDEX was not expected, but it has been sustained. There is a constant witness for disarmament and peace at the gates of the exhibition, and I commend the people who are there making their protest non-violently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today a very interesting turn of events occurred. This afternoon, the media were banned from the exhibition. Obviously, the exhibitors are feeling under pressure, perhaps because they did not get quite the free ride that they had expected from the media-that is, with some notable exceptions: a reporter from the Pacific Defence Reporter and one from the Australian newspaper are still there, so any print journalist considered to be sufficiently on side is allowed to be at the exhibition. However, the electronic media have been banned as of this afternoon. That is a very interesting turn of events. I hope that arms bazaars such as AIDEX 89 will soon be a thing of the past. </PARA>
<PARA> What I want to talk about this evening is the future. It is time that the people of Australia, particularly those in the Senate-I am afraid that politicians are often the last to pick up on new ideas-understood that what the world is witnessing is an enormous paradigm shift which is of such momentous proportions that it could be likened to the move after the printing press was invented prior to which time the monks in the monasteries, the only ones, generally speaking, who could read and write, had access to information and therefore access to power. An enormous shift took place with the invention of the printing press when education became more generally available to more people. </PARA>
<PARA> Then the agrarian revolution occurred when enclosures meant that many people who had farmed their own plots of land were engaged in cooperative processes. Another huge paradigm shift was the industrial age. Then came the information age that we are in now. That was another huge paradigm shift. We are actually seeing the end of the industrial era occurring before our very eyes in the latter part of the twentieth century. </PARA>
<PARA> Something that we need to take account of and prepare for-yet another change which is emerging right now-has been called by various names. I will refer to it as the ecological age. It has occurred only in the last decade, or perhaps the last two decades. There has been an increasing awareness of planet earth as one living organism-all life forms being interdependent on each other. I guess it was first manifested once satellite photographs were taken of planet earth from outer space. The astronauts out there had a very different picture of the planet earth than human beings had seen before. There are no boundaries and no lines on maps; there was just a swirling mass. They saw it as a complete living organism and an entity-their home. The astronauts who have been privileged to be in outer space and to see those amazing pictures of planet earth have been very different people since that experience. It has transformed their understanding of what it is to be part of planet earth and to be a human being living in cooperation with other living forms. </PARA>
<PARA> Somebody who has articulated this notion very clearly is James Lovelock. I quote from the preface of his book Gaia, where he introduces this hypothesis:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the concept of mother earth, or, as the Greeks called her long ago, Gaia, has been widely held throughout history and has been the basis of a belief which still co-exists with the great religions. As a result of the accumulation of evidence about the natural environment and the growth of the science of ecology, there have recently been speculations that the biosphere may be more than just the complete range of all living things within their natural habitat of soil, sea and air. Journeys into space did more than present the Earth in a new perspective. They also sent back information about its atmosphere and its surface which provided a new insight into the interactions about the living and the inorganic parts of the planet. From this has arisen the hypothesis, the model, in which the Earth's living matter, air, oceans and land surface, form a complex system which can be seen as a single organism and which has the capacity to keep our planet a fit place for life. </PARA>
<PARA>What has also become clear in the last decade or so is that human beings are on the endangered species list. This is a very uncomfortable place for us to be. It is the first time in human history that we actually have found ourselves collectively on the endangered species list. We need to remove ourselves from that endangered species list, and it is possible if we follow the warnings that have very clearly been given to us by eminent scientists from all around the globe and from different scientific persuasions-someone like David Suzuki, who says that we have about 10 years in which to change the direction of the way we live on planet earth, otherwise we are harming our home to such an extent that it will not be habitable. So it is very real to say that we are on the endangered species list. </PARA>
<PARA> To remove ourselves from that list there are many things we must do. First of all, we must recognise that interdependence of all life forms which James Lovelock talks about in this book Gaia. Secondly, we must recognise basic human rights, not only in physical terms but in political terms as well-the right to self-determination, in particular. It is very interesting that what we are seeing sweeping through eastern Europe is a great democratisation. But we must not be smug about this and consider that what is happening in eastern Europe is the demolition of one ideology to be replaced by another ideology which has been current, that is, the Western or the capitalist ideology. We have to get beyond both communism and capitalism in order to sustain life on planet earth. So self-determination for the people of eastern Europe is most important. It is most important that we respect their right to find the appropriate systems for them, just a we respect the rights of people in our own region for self-determination, particularly those on our very doorstep, such as the East Timorese people, whose rights to self-determination are so often ignored by both government and opposition in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, we need to move beyond the constraints of present ideology, to move away from the need we have created for ourselves, particularly in the capitalist world, that is, rampant consumerism and exploitation. We have mindlessly exploited people and planet earth, which is our home. We have to learn to be more careful consumers. It is very evident that people want to be more careful consumers once they understand the risks that are involved in continuing with the rampant consumerism we have been accustomed to. Capitalism has taught us that we must consume more and more. We only have to look at the pressure that is applied to our children by advertisements on television to realise how powerful a force that is. That kind of rampant consumerism has to stop. There is a limit to the earth's resources which we must understand. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of being careful consumers, which I think a lot of people now want to be, I recommend to honourable senators the Green Consumer Guide which has recently been published by the Australian Conservation Foundation and Choice magazine. It is a very worthwhile document because it gives people lots of practical suggestions about the goods they can buy and the services they can use which will not exploit the capital of planet earth. It suggests that we live off the interest. There is a great difference between the two. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a challenge for the world community. We are not suggesting, as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, would have us believe, that environmentalists are wanting us to return to the age of the cave dwellers; not at all. There is a confusion between standard of living and quality of life. I think that we can have a much better quality of life if we reduce our consumerism. This is also a time when spiritual values are coming to the fore, to replace the materialistic values which we have tried and found wanting. It is very true to say that wealthy people are often not happy or fulfilled people. Again, I am not suggesting that we all have to live in dire poverty, far from it, but I think that if we understand that there is more to life than material values and recognise the intrinsic spiritual values which we all possess but which a lot of people do not yet want to recognise, we will come a lot closer to respecting each other and all life forms on planet earth and we will have a much better chance of sustaining ourselves in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> We also need to recognise that the old economic order is changing, that the growth economy which is still so sought after, particularly in the capitalist world, means a continuation of the exploitation which could be our undoing. We have got to move away from that. We need to look at the concept of a sustainable economy which involves, of course, the concept of sustainable development. There are a lot of different definitions of that, and we must be careful to understand that when we are talking about sustainability we are talking about living off the interest of the earth's resources and not squandering the capital, so that we do not take, take, take from the finite resources of planet earth to the extent that we have nothing left. It is a very important concept. </PARA>
<PARA> I recommend Hazel Henderson's very creative work written in 1978. It is interesting that a lot of the thinking that is now becoming mainstream goes back about 10 years. That is about how long it takes for new ideas to filter through to the international community to become general currency. Her book is called Creating Alternative Futures. She is an economist who has a lot of very important things to say about the new approach to the economy which we must take if we are to survive. Hazel Henderson insists that the concept of wealth:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . must shed some of its present connotations of capital and material accumulation and give way to a redefinition as human enrichment. </PARA>
<PARA>She also says that profit must be redefined to mean only the creation of real wealth, rather than private or public gain won at the expense of social or environmental exploitation. She also says that economics:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . has enthroned some of our most unattractive predispositions: material acquisitiveness, competition, gluttony, pride, selfishness, short-sightedness and just plain greed. </PARA>
<PARA>They are not very attractive qualities. I think that even the economic rationalists among us would have to admit, when one calls a spade a spade, that they are not very attractive qualities. She goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> A fundamental economic problem that has resulted from the imbalance of our values . . . is our obsession with unlimited growth. Continuing economic growth is accepted as dogma by virtually all economists and politicians, who assume that it is the only way to ensure that material wealth will trickle down to the poor. </PARA>
<PARA>However, it has been proven over and over again that the trickle-down theory does not work. The massive social injustices which are still evident on a huge scale globally are as a result of that attempt to trickle down the wealth from the top. In fact, we have to have a bubble-up theory-exactly the opposite. High rates of growth not only do little to ease urgent social and human problems but in many countries have been accompanied by increasing unemployment and a general deterioration of social conditions. Hazel Henderson also points out that the global obsession with growth has resulted in a remarkable similarity between the capitalist and communist economies. She says:</PARA>
<PARA> The fruitless dialectic between capitalism and communism will be exposed as irrelevant since both systems are based on materialism . . . both are dedicated to industrial growth and technologies with increasing centralism and bureaucratic control. </PARA>
<PARA>So, as I said earlier, we have got to get beyond those two ideological divines and the constraints that they place upon us. They are really becoming increasingly irrelevant, and I think that present events in eastern Europe are showing that. </PARA>
<PARA> As a global community we must also recognise that the huge growth in population, which could be an enormous strain on the earth's resources in the future, is largely created by social inequities. Social justice must be improved, especially where women's rights are concerned. That is generally accompanied by a fall in population growth. These issues are all interconnected, and that is the important essence of what I am saying tonight.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of women's rights, which have not been acknowledged by the international community, I refer to Marilyn Waring's book, which is called Counting for nothing: what men value and what women are worth. Marilyn Waring was a National Party representative in the New Zealand Parliament for 10 years before she resigned in protest over her country's attitude to nuclear warship visits. In fact, she caused the downfall of the Government there in 1984. She is a very brave woman indeed. She is also an international economist of high repute. What she says about the international system of general accounting exemplifies what I have been saying about the value of women's work, which is generally not recognised, not counted in the system of national accounting, according to the systems which the United Nations uses. It is a gross oversight that must be corrected. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment women do 80 per cent of the work that is done in the world on a daily basis, but they get very little recognition for that. When that is recognised in the systems of general accounting there will be a huge change in the whole economic structure. It is also important when we are looking at the economy and employment situations that we take on board the notion of a basic general income level. This is not akin to an unemployment benefit. This would be a income that everybody would get, or a general living allowance that everybody would be entitled to, and then people who earned money over and above that would be taxed on that extra money which they earned. Every human being should be entitled to a basic living income. </PARA>
<PARA> That notion is part of a new economic theory which we really need to research a lot more and to take on board, because the present economic systems are obviously being proven to be totally inadequate for the present crises in which governments around the world find themselves, with huge debts, particularly in Third World countries, which have little chance of keeping up with the interest payments on the huge debts that they are suffering at the moment, let alone of paying them back. It is not only Third World countries that are experiencing that problem. At the moment the United States is the greatest debtor nation in the world. So, whatever system is operating at the moment is obviously not working. </PARA>
<PARA> Another realisation that we must make if we are going to look seriously to the future in a creative way is to move away from militarisation, which is a gross waste of human resources. At times it has been said that nearly 50 per cent of the world's scientists have been engaged in weapons research of one kind or another. That is an enormous waste of resources. Imagine if those scientists turned their activities to finding solutions to some of the global crises which are now facing us as a global community-environmental problems in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> The corollary of disarmament, of course, is non-violence and that is the way of the future. We must learn to solve our problems non-violently, from the personal level, to the community level, to the international level. That is the way of the future-not as we are seeing our Government do at the moment, spending more on militarisation when, in fact, we are not threatened at all by anybody, and encouraging a defence industry which we will have to get out of at some time in the future because it is not going to be successful and because it is morally bankrupt as well. That is the major reason why I oppose the growing arms industry and the Government's push for a growing arms industry in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> We must also understand that full employment is a thing of the past. Under the present economic system, whether one looks at the communist system or the capitalist system, we will never again create a situation in which everybody has employment, in the traditional sense of the word-that is, a paid job. This is where this notion of a guaranteed basic income is very important. </PARA>
<PARA> James Robertson has written a useful book called Future Work. In that he details a lot of very creative ideas about a new concept which he calls `own work' in which people will find many creative things to do with their time and skills in their own communities which are not necessarily jobs in the traditional sense. People would not go away from their own home or community to work for somebody else but would create a lot of own work in their own living space. The local employment trading system (LETS) program that I was talking about a few days ago is an example of that kind of creativity where people in a local community actually share their skills and resources-the products of their gardens, for example. They do not exchange money but there is a bartering system. </PARA>
<PARA> That kind of concept needs to be looked at very creatively and needs to be taken seriously by our economic planners. We will not ever regain full employment; so we need to make sure that our education and training for young people do not produce in them a great sense of guilt when they do not find the jobs that are not there in the job market. People can feel quite fulfilled without having to go out to work in a full time earning capacity. There will be a lot more job sharing or own work where people are more creative in the use of their own time and there is not the negative imaging attached to being unemployed in the way that we use the term at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically I have been talking about the four tenets of green politics-not in order of importance but as part of a holistic picture. The first is participatory democracy. This is a very important concept. We in Australia have a relative democracy, I would say. I am very grateful that we do but it falls short of a fully participating democracy, partly perhaps because we have compulsory voting. People go and vote at election time and then in between elections sit back and complain about the government no matter what kind of government it is. People do not take enough personal responsibility to make their elected representatives accountable. There is not a great desire in the community generally to get involved-not only in Federal and State politics but even at the local level, which should be the most important and powerful level of politics as it applies to people's everyday lives. Encouraging participatory democracy is a very important tenet of green politics. </PARA>
<PARA> The concept of social justice-sharing the resources better in our community-is also fundamentally important. We can do away with a lot of the divisions that exist and we can do away with a lot of the conflict that continually arises because of a lack of social justice. In this case I must make particular reference to minority groups and, in the Australian context, especially to Aboriginal people, the indigenous people of this country, who have had a very raw deal for 200 years. It is time they were able to determine for themselves how they fit into the community which we have imposed on them. </PARA>
<PARA> The third area-as I said, not in order of importance-is environmental custodianship. This means taking care of the resources of our planet for the use of future generations so that we are not exploiting them all now and leaving nothing for the people who will follow after us. The idea of custodianship is very important in green politics. We do not own the earth or the resources of the planet earth. We are looking after them. They are in our care to be passed on to future generations. The fourth tenet is disarmament and non-violence, about which I have said plenty in this chamber over the 4 1/2 years that I have been here. </PARA>
<PARA> I think all of these issues are inextricably linked. They all add up to a whole. We are now seeing a revolution in this latter part of the twentieth century which will see humanity move beyond the industrial age. There is a massive paradigm shift which seems to have escaped many politicians, bureaucrats and business people. But they will not be able to ignore the change for long. The green age has begun. It is increasingly apparent that we must use carefully our precious resources if we are to ensure the viability of the world economy. And the economy and the environment are inextricably linked; they are one. It is encouraging occasionally to hear politicians even in this place talk about the very close nexus between the two. </PARA>
<PARA> Other major green concerns like participatory democracy, social justice and disarmament are also firmly on the international political agenda. This is indeed encouraging. Green issues are surfacing everywhere and at all levels of society. Politicians who are blinkered in their vision risk being left behind. Sometimes I feel quite worried about the kind of dialogue that goes on in this place and in the House of Representatives. Green thinking does not preclude development and certainly is not a call for a return to the cave, but it is about responsible development. Emerging green values represent a turning point in human history as significant as the earlier changes that transformed people's lives. This is another transformation that we are privileged to witness. We had better realise that it is an enormous challenge and an enormous opportunity at the same time. It is a difficult transitional phase right now but it does present great opportunities for creativity in solving some of the problems it presents. It is understandable that the current establishment will find these changes disturbing. It is understandable that those heralding the change will be criticised. My plea is for each group to listen to the other. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1980s will go down in history as a remarkable decade. Who would have thought at the beginning of the 1980s, when President Reagan was still talking about the evil empire in referring to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, that such a change would take place between the two superpowers. Of course, the advent of Mikhail Gorbachev had a lot to do with that. It is indeed encouraging that the disarmament process is under way-not that we should rest on our laurels about that. If we are resting on our laurels, we are wearing them in the wrong place. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also very interesting that, while we are seeing the disarmament process begin, we have to understand that weapons of mass destruction were deliberately created. Scientists actually sat at drawing boards and planned those weapons of mass destruction-nuclear, chemical and biological. They tested them, and they have been used. That was deliberate action by scientists at the behest of their governments. On the other hand, the problems that are now drawing the peoples of the world to work together, such as the greenhouse effect and ozone depletion, were not planned by any human beings. They are problems that have snuck up on an unsuspecting globe bent on industrial development and as a result of great industrialisation, but they are being dealt with and treated as urgent. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I point out that there is a great difference between the two sets of problems-one planned, deliberate and a great waste of human resources; the other unplanned but requiring urgent attention. Urgent attention to the first problem-the disarmament question-could provide many of the resources we need to solve the environmental problem. There is a great connection between the two. The planned problems need to be dispensed with and could be dispensed with. In dispensing with the planned problem of militarisation, we could provide the funding necessary to deal with the unplanned environmental problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, we are being forced-some people very reluctantly-to think globally and act locally. The one world or none campaign, run by the Australian Council for Overseas Aid in the latter part of this year, is spot on; it is absolutely right for the end of this decade because it draws together and connects these various issues of development, disarmament, foreign aid, and Australia's possible role and international responsibilities. We are indeed a very privileged nation. When we consider all the nations on the face of the earth, we are amongst the most privileged. We could be a model in so many ways, with greater democracy and greater participation, moving away from the strangle hold of the two-party system. The election of the five independent greens in Tasmania is perhaps a model for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> We could move towards greater social justice. With only about 17 million people and abundant resources in this country we have the opportunity to provide for the needs of everyone, if we are prepared to share the resources. However, it requires a generosity of spirit. Moreover, we need leadership and vision in this country so that the generosity of spirit will be forthcoming from Australians. I believe it is there, but perhaps untapped. </PARA>
<PARA> We can also lead or provide a model for the world in environmental management. We can be wise custodians of our resources and also responsible in terms of our international trading obligation. We do not have to make the same mistakes as other countries have made before us; we can learn from their mistakes. We can learn in the areas of science, technology, industry, employment and education. We need to look to future prospects and engage in positive production for the future. There is so much to engage in that has positive relevance to the future, unlike what we are seeing the Government promoting at the moment-defence industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Amory Lovins was in this Parliament building today talking about energy conservation and the great industrial opportunities there are in conserving energy. This is the message which our Government really needs to hear. We could also be a model for the world in terms of disarmament and non-violence. We have a great opportunity there if only we would break clear of the debilitating nuclear alliance in which we are engaged. My plea is for visionary planning and the Commission for the Future is a step in the right direction. Working together we could create a society which is relevant to the changes which will be thrust upon us. It would be a shame if we were dragged unwillingly into the twenty-first century without being prepared. We need to act now to ensure that our children are not casualties of our short-sightedness. Let us give our young people the hope for the future which they deserve. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think they were about the Prime Minister, not Mr Beazley. Senator COOK-I thank Senator Tambling for the intervention. In that case I doubly reject them. I simply commend the second speech made by Senator Chris Schacht. It was a perceptive analysis of the role of opinion polls in politics and the weight we should place on their findings and how we should view them. It is Senator Alston's speech that I wish to deal with for a few minutes. Senator Alston made a remarkable speech, remarkable in the sense that it was strange, odd and peculiar-a speech attacking in envious but nonetheless scurrilous ways the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, Mrs Ros Kelly. Senator Alston attacked Mrs Kelly and made a series of charges or allegations against her. I sat, rapt as I was in Senator Alston's rhetoric, listening to this extraordinary flurry of condemnation unwind and I made assiduous notes about what he was saying in relation to Mrs Kelly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems that her list of offences is: one, she is successful at achieving a high recognition rate in Canberra. Her second offence, according to Senator Alston, is that she is popular and is sought after for press commentary. According to Senator Alston her third offence is that her photograph often appears in the newspaper. One could make a subsidiary offence; that is, that she is indeed photogenic. A fourth offence is that she has a folding machine in her office, which allows her to efficiently circulate material to her electorate. Her fifth offence is that she is assiduous is taking up Telecom Australia matters on behalf of her constituents. Her sixth offence is that her Telecom file is over large. In fact, it can be measured at between five and six inches thick. Her seventh offence is that she is alleged to have sent material out under her constituency office that Telecom should have sent out under its own name. Her eighth offence is that her popularity offends Senator Alston. Her ninth offence is that she does something every three or four weeks in Canberra about Telecom. Her tenth offence is that her folding machine's existence is particularly offensive because, according to Senator Alston, other members of parliament probably have access to it. </PARA>
<PARA> They are the charges. This is the shocking indictment of the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support. One is astounded by this retinue of allegations. All I can say is: big deal! They amount to so much sound and fury signifying sour grapes. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 5 October 1989 (Hansard, page 1755), Senator Coulter asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Will the Minister confirm that as an alkalising agent one would expect the agents, CN and CS, to be mutagens and carcinogens and that because they have been used principally as riot control agents they have escaped proper toxicological tests? Will he undertake the necessary investigations so that we can be more properly informed? Is he aware that in the literature one can find at least six cases of death resulting from exposure to tear gas?</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Community Services and Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Further to Senator Cook's response in the Senate on 5 October 1989, I am informed that:</PARA>
<PARA> The data concerning the mutagenicity of CS are equivocal. There have been some literature reports of mutagenicity in bacterial assays, although other reports have failed to confirm this. The majority of literature reports suggest that CS is negative in mutagenicity assays.</PARA>
<PARA> A search of the medical science literature from 1977-1989 revealed no studies on the mutagenicity of CN.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that there are reports in the literature of six deaths resulting from excessive exposure to tear gas in confined spaces. In these instances, the agent involved appears to have been CN. I have not been advised of any confirmed reports of death resulting from exposure to CS.</PARA>
