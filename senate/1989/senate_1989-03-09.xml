<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth, that:</PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned about the increase in violent television programmes for children and particularly those programmes promoting violent toys that are available for sale in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray:</PARA>
<PARA> That you support the Broadcasting (Prohibition of Violent Programmes for Children) Act 1988 which has been presented by WA Independent Senator for Nuclear Disarmament, Jo Vallentine. This act aims to prohibit the broadcasting of children's TV programmes that are violent and that promote toys modelled on characters, weapons or other war accessories which are also available for sale in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth, that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Video Material has concluded that ``adverse effects upon people, and especially upon children, of exposure to material containing various degrees of violence, pornography or obscenity have been demonstrated''.</PARA>
<PARA> The majority of the Select Committee strongly opposed the proposition for a new NVE (non-violent erotica) category, which would have entrenched X-rated video pornography.</PARA>
<PARA> All six State Governments have, through their Attorneys-General, expressed unanimous opposition to the circulation of X-rated videos.</PARA>
<PARA> We consider the continuing distribution of X-rated videos from the A.C.T. to be reprehensible and to be contrary to the wellbeing of the Australian community in general.</PARA>
<PARA> We strongly request urgent Government action to prohibit the distribution of X-rated and excessively violent video material.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In accordance with the procedures laid down by the Senate on 25 February 1988, Senator Peter Baume has raised with me a matter of privilege. I am required by those procedures to determine whether a motion relating to the matter should have precedence, having regard to criteria also laid down by a resolution of the Senate. In earlier statements I have indicated to the Senate the way in which I apply the criteria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter raised by Senator Peter Baume gives rise to a question of whether a witness who gave evidence before a Senate committee has been penalised as a result of giving that evidence. This is the same question as is raised by other matters which have been referred to the Committee of Privileges. The matter clearly meets the criteria laid down by the Senate. I have therefore determined that a motion relating to the matter should have precedence. I present to the Senate the letter from Senator Peter Baume and the attached documents to which he has referred. The relevant resolution of the Senate provides that, where the Senate is not expected to meet within a week after my determination, a motion may be moved on the same day. Senator Peter Baume may therefore move a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) That the following matter be referred to the Committee of Privileges: whether there was any adverse treatment of Mr Michael Pope by the Aboriginal Development Commission or its officers in consequence of evidence given by him to the Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, and whether any contempt of the Senate was involved. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) That the provisions of the resolution of 3 November 1988 relating to the powers of the Committee of Privileges apply in relation to the Committee's inquiry into this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>The matter which is the subject of this motion relates to evidence which was given last year to the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs by Mr Michael Pope. Mr Pope was formerly Assistant General Manager of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). He gave some of his evidence publicly and some in camera. His evidence was generally supportive of Mrs Shirley McPherson and the old ADC and was, therefore, generally critical of the reconstituted ADC. </PARA>
<PARA> I now move to the substance of the matters which I wish to bring before the Senate and which support the motion which I have moved. Mr President, those matters are set out in the letter I wrote to you yesterday as soon as possible after I had become aware of the ADC documents. The relevant parts of that letter read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> I have become aware this afternoon of the attached letters. The first was sent to Mr Michael Pope by Mr Peter McMahon, Assistant General Manager, Aboriginal Development Commission on 4 January 1989. This letter was sent to inform him that, in the light of the allegations he had made to the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs the acting General Manager had indicated that Mr Pope would not be permitted to visit Bonner House in the future without making a formal request in writing to the acting General Manager. </PARA>
<PARA> The second letter is in the form of a circular to ADC staff that confirms that the instruction was issued, but in the process extends it to all ADC offices throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> On the face of the first letter, the punitive action taken against Mr Pope arises directly from the fact that he gave evidence to the Senate Select Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter which was attached, which was the letter sent to Mr Pope, is actually a copy. It is dated 4 January 1988 and I take it that that is meant to be 4 January 1989. That letter states quite specifically that the action has been taken `in the light of the allegations you have made to the Senate Select Committee' and it asserts that the Acting General Manager-I believe that that is Mr Cedric Wyatt-has authorised the action. In handwriting below the letter is appended an officer's note. The note reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Above letter was returned unopened from the Macquarie Hostel. I gather Mr Pope has moved on by that time. </PARA>
<PARA>It is signed C. Kay-that is, Colin Kay-and it is dated 20 February 1989. The letter was sent by Mr McMahon, the Assistant General Manager of the ADC, on 4 January 1989 to Mr Michael Pope. It did restrict his right to visit the headquarters of the ADC, as set out in the letter, and it did identify as the reason for that action allegations he had made in his evidence to the Senate Select Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The second document is a memo sent out on 20 February 1989 by Mr Michael Stewart, Assistant General Manager, Corporate Services, to divisional heads, branch managers at Head Office and regional managers. That document reads:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The A/g General Manager has decided that should Mr Michael Pope wish to attend an office of the Aboriginal Development Commission then he should formally seek and obtain prior approval for any such visit. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Should you directly receive a request from Mr Pope to visit an ADC office then you should refer the matter to the A/g General Manager. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Please inform Branch Managers within your region of this minute. </PARA>
<PARA>It is signed M. A. Stewart-that is, Michael Stewart, Assistant General Manager, Corporate Services. I am led to believe that there are other pieces of correspondence within the ADC between officers which might assist the Privileges Committee. I suggest that the Privileges Committee might well seek to obtain those. </PARA>
<PARA> The second letter which I have read out went further than the first. It actually extended the requirement for Mr Pope to obtain approval to visit any ADC office anywhere in Australia. I remind honourable senators again of the clear statement in the letter by Mr McMahon that the decision was taken `in the light of the allegations he had made to the Senate Select Committee'. In the same letter it is made clear that the decision was one made by the Acting General Manager who, I believe, is Mr Cedric Wyatt. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators of the relevant provisions of the Parliamentary Privileges Act. Section 12 (2) states:</PARA>
<PARA> A person shall not inflict any penalty or injury upon, or deprive of any benefit, another person on account of-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the giving or proposed giving of any evidence; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) any evidence given or to be given, before a House or a Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Penalty:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) in the case of a natural person, $5,000 or imprisonment for 6 months, or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) in the case of a corporation, $25,000. </PARA>
<PARA>I observe that that section has been written to cover the most serious kinds of offences which might be committed. There are, however, other grounds which may be called upon. There is a common law offence of contempt of parliament to which we should also address ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> On the face of it, this seems to be an instance of the kind covered by section 12 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act. It appears to have been done by an officer of the Commission acting for that Commission. Of course, at this time we do not know whether or not the commissioners of the ADC ordered the action or whether it was taken solely by and on behalf of Mr Wyatt himself. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the third occasion in just a few months that the Senate has referred to the Committee of Privileges matters relating to the appearance of witnesses before the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. One matter-that relating to the appearance of certain witnesses; who paid for them; whether the estimates committee was properly informed on the matter-has already been determined. The second matter, relating to certain actions taken against Mrs McPherson and Mr O'Brien, awaits determination by the Privileges Committee and I do not intend to canvass that matter here. However, on a separate matter, I observe in passing that Mr O'Brien has still not received the reasons which he sought in October--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Mr President. I was making only a one-sentence statement that the witness still had not received certain reasons which he had sought under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act in October. I was making the point that it was one man having a difficult time against a bureaucracy. He has now taken retirement and is seeking new employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There have been so many revelations and allegations about the treatment of witnesses. It is common knowledge that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) does not like Senate committees and that he has appointed special investigations to look into a number of allegations. But none of those inquiries which have been appointed gives to potential witnesses protection in any way equivalent to that offered to witnesses who appear before a parliamentary committee. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be clear by now that all witnesses, or potential witnesses, in these Aboriginal affairs matters need the protection provided by the Parliamentary Privileges Act. We can now understand why witnesses will not come forward to the various inquiries and why some witnesses before the Senate Select Committee will not now allow their revelations to go to Mr Andrew Menzies for further attention. He cannot offer them adequate protection from the kind of harassment of which we have seen too much. We have even had the spectacle of one organisation sending a Queen's Counsel to represent it before the Auditor-General and then having that QC accuse the Auditor-General of being racist and professionally incom- petent. </PARA>
<PARA> Within the Westminster system, for centuries, the high court of Parliament has offered protection to witnesses. We do so here because we believe in the right of the Senate, and of Senate committees, to hear witnesses, to receive evidence and not to have those witnesses scared off or punished for appearing. Equally, witnesses have a right to be protected if they assist Senate committees in the performance of their task. I draw to the attention of honourable senators a quotation from page 566 of the fifth edition of Odgers' Australian Senate Practice:</PARA>
<PARA> The power to protect witnesses is also one of the powers preserved to the Senate and the House of Representatives under section 49 of the Constitution. Any act by any person which operates to the disadvantage of a witness on account of evidence given by him before the Senate, or any committee thereof, would be treated by the Senate as a breach of privilege. </PARA>
<PARA>I have presented documents which make a prima facie case that an offence might have been committed against section 12 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act or otherwise constitute an infringement of privilege. I believe that the correct course now is to refer the matter to the Committee of Privileges for examination and report. My motion will permit that to occur. </PARA>
<PARA> It gives me no pleasure to rise on this matter, but it seems that neither the Minister nor those whom he has appointed to high statutory office have learned the lessons from quite recent similar episodes. I commend the motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, the fact that you regard this matter as important would automatically almost govern the attitude of those on this side of the chamber in saying that there must be some case. Senator Peter Baume has made out an adequate case today that this matter should be referred to the Committee of Privileges. I make it quite clear that that reference does not prejudge the issue. It says only that we must protect witnesses. If there were some doubt about that, then we would refer the matter to the Privileges Committee. So it is not a matter of prejudging the issue. Therefore, we believe that the matter should be referred to the Privileges Committee and we hope for a prompt report.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will enable Australia to accede to the International Convention Against the Taking of Hostages, unanimously adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 17 December 1979 which came into force on 3 June 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill represents further evidence of Australia's participation in the international fight against terrorism. Other legislation implementing international treaties to which Australia has become a party in this area include the Crimes (Hijacking of Aircraft) Act 1972, the Crimes (Protection of Aircraft) Act 1973 and the Crimes (Internationally Protected Persons) Act 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent initiatives of the Government in the very important area of international co-operation to combat terrorism include participation in the negotiating of international instruments aimed at suppressing terrorist acts at airports serving international aviation and terrorist attacks on international shipping and off-shore drilling platforms. The Government intends to introduce legislation to implement these instruments in the Autumn Sittings of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of the accession by Australia to the Convention has been the subject of consultation with the States and the Northern Territory and general agreement on it has been reached. </PARA>
<PARA> Although some States have legislation which would most likely cover the offences of the kind envisaged by the Convention, this is not uniformly the case. Furthermore, State legislation does not have the extensive extra-territorial application required to fully implement the Convention. It is therefore more appropriate for the Commonwealth to enact legislation to allow Australia to fulfil its obligations under the Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> The Convention requires a State Party to make punishable by appropriate penalties any person who seizes or detains, and threatens to kill, injure or further detain, a hostage in order to compel a third party to do or abstain from any act as a condition for release of the hostage. Attempts and participation as an accomplice are also to be made punishable by State Parties. A State Party is required to establish jurisdiction over these offences if committed in its territory and also to establish extra-territorial jurisdiction in some circumstances, eg. where the offences are committed by its nationals or where the act is committed to compel that State to do or abstain from any act or where the alleged offender is present in the territory of the State and it does not extradite the person. </PARA>
<PARA> Obligations under the Convention in relation to extradition are fulfilled by our extradition laws, treaties and practice. Provisions in the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 ensure that a defendant does not face double jeopardy by reason that a particular act may be an offence under the Bill and under other Commonwealth laws or State and Territory laws. Similarly, under the Extradition Act 1988, a person would not be extradited to another country to face prosecution for an act of hostage-taking where the person had been dealt with by a court in that country or in Australia in relation to that act. Subclause 6 (2) prevents a person being convicted under the Bill for an act in relation to which the person has already been convicted under the law of another country. Prosecutions will be dealt with in State and Territory courts by virtue of section 68 of the Judiciary Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 8 of the Bill creates the offence of hostage-taking and fixes the maximum penalty at imprisonment for life. It also establishes the limits of the jurisdiction claimed by Australia over the offences. In addition, by reason of the operation of clause 9 a person cannot be charged under the Bill where the act of hostage-taking occurred in one country, the hostage and the alleged hostage-taker are citizens of that country and the alleged hostage-taker is found in that country. Clause 10 requires the consent of the Attorney-General to be obtained before a prosecution for an offence can be heard. This ensures that Australia can comply with its obligations under Article 7 of the Convention to communicate the final outcome of a prosecution under the Bill to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> Clauses 11 and 12 deal with questions of venue for proceedings because of the requirement in section 80 of the Constitution that every trial on indictment shall be held in the State where the offence was committed. Clause 15 recognises the obligation under Article 6 of the Convention to allow an alleged offender who is not an Australian citizen access to his or her country's diplomatic or consular representatives. The remaining provisions of the Bill ensure that the operation of other Commonwealth laws and State and Territory laws are not displaced (subclause 6 (1)) and protect the jurisdiction of State and Territory courts (clause 14). </PARA>
<PARA> With the passage of this Bill Australia will remain in the forefront of international endeavours to suppress terrorism. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 1989</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is concerned with amendments to insurance industry supervisory legislation. In terms of its substance, it is virtually identical to the one passed by the House of Representatives in November last year save the provisions concerning introduction of supervisory levies to be paid by general insurers, Lloyd's and life insurers. These provisions are now the subject of separate Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated earlier when I introduced the three Bills concerned with imposition and collection of the insurance supervisory levies, the Government withdrew the Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 1988 prior to it being debated in the Senate, to enable its provisions to be reassessed in the light of the High Court's decision in the Air Caledonie case concerning the immigration fee matter. </PARA>
<PARA> In the intervening period the Government has identified some minor additional matters requiring amendment which have been included in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 incorporates measures to provide for the registration under the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984 of insurance intermediaries dealing with unauthorised foreign insurers. It will also effect a number of amendments to the Life Insurance Act 1945 to strengthen and improve the effectiveness of the existing supervisory arrangements, all of which will increase the level of protection available to the insuring public. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is structured into six parts. </PARA>
<PARA> Part I includes the commencement provisions and provides for specified provisions to come into operation on the 28th day after the day on which the Bill receives the Royal Assent, and for all other provisions to come into operation on a day or days to be fixed by Proclamation, save that all provisions must commence within 6 months. </PARA>
<PARA> Part II amends the Insurance Act 1973 by replacing the definition of the term `debenture' with a new one which accords more closely with the definition in the Companies Code. It also repeals section 113, which deals with unauthorised foreign insurers, in order to remove legislative overlaps with section 34 of the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> Part III amends the Insurance Amendment Act 1983 by omitting the now redundant and unproclaimed paragraph (c) of section 3. </PARA>
<PARA> Part IV amends the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984 to include new provisions requiring the registration of all insurance intermediaries dealing with unauthorised foreign insurers, and the collection of statistics regarding premiums remitted overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Part V amends the Life Insurance Amendment Act 1977 by repealing five redundant and unproclaimed sections. </PARA>
<PARA> Part VI amends the Life Insurance Act 1945 in four ways:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) to introduce the concept of `appointed actuary' for the purpose of performing certain functions required under the Act;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) to repeal certain redundant provisions;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) to change the period for furnishing to Parliament the Annual Report on the workings of the Act. The proposed period is to be within 3 months of the year ending on 30 June which corresponds to the reporting period provided in the other Acts administered by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner; and</PARA>
<PARA> (4) to effect a number of other changes intended to clarify and enhance the existing supervisory arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to address the more significant provisions of the Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments to the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984 and the Life Insurance Act 1945-that is, the proposed changes covered by Parts IV and VI of the Bill-have been the subject of consultations with representatives of industry bodies including, where relevant, the Life Insurance Federation of Australia, the Insurance Council of Australia, the Institute of Actuaries of Australia and the National Insurance Brokers Association of Australia. In addition, some of the other amendments provided for in the Bill have emerged as a result of suggestions put forward by the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Presently, the Insurance Act 1973 and the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984 do not provide as much protection to consumers dealing with agents of unauthorised foreign insurers as to those dealing with either agents of authorised insurers or brokers. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of agents of authorised insurers there is more scope to enforce the statutory requirement that an insurer must accept liability for the conduct of his agent. Brokers must in general hold professional indemnity insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is of the view that those insured should be allowed access to overseas insurance markets where they wish to seek it. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time the Government believes that insurance consumers should be reminded of the importance of considering the possible implications of entering into insurance contracts with offshore insurers who are not supervised under Australian insurance law. </PARA>
<PARA> Against this background the Bill will provide increased protection for those insured by including certain additional provisions in the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> A key additional requirement will be that all insurance intermediaries who arrange insurance contracts with unauthorised foreign insurers will be required to be registered under the Act, unless they are already registered as an insurance broker. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, these intermediaries, as well as registered insurance brokers who arrange insurance contracts with unauthorised foreign insurers, will be required to:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) provide to the Insurance and Superannuation Commission a copy of any agency agreements they have with an unauthorised foreign insurer (the agreements to be available for public inspection);</PARA>
<PARA> (2) obtain written acknowledgment from the insured that cover may be provided in whole or in part by an unauthorised foreign insurer; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) provide an Annual Return to the Commission on their activities in this area. This Annual Return will enable the Commission to monitor the volume of business placed with unauthorised foreign insurers through insurance intermediaries. </PARA>
<PARA> There will also be scope to make regulations to impose a requirement on intermediaries operating under these provisions to take out professional indemnity insurance cover in respect of their operations in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government proposes to seek the making of a regulation to impose a registration fee on insurance intermediaries dealing with unauthorised foreign insurers, consistent with that applicable to registered insurance brokers, to recover the additional supervisory costs for the Insurance and Superannuation Commission that would be involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the proposed amendments concerning the Life Insurance Act 1945. These amendments are considered necessary to enhance the effectiveness of the Act, particularly in relation to the functions required to be performed by actuaries, and to clarify a number of the existing supervisory arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important of these amendments will introduce a new provision to require each life insurance company to identify an actuary as the `appointed actuary' to the company. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last decade or so, there has been a substantial increase in the variety of life insurance products marketed by life insurance companies. Consequently, life insurance business has become much more complicated than ever before. </PARA>
<PARA> Against this background, it has become increasingly important that actuaries of companies performing certain statutory functions under the Life Insurance Act carry out those functions in an objective and professional manner notwithstanding the fact that they may be receiving remuneration from the companies concerned. Creating the position of an `appointed actuary' will assist in achieving this objective. </PARA>
<PARA> Provisions in the Bill will require each life insurance company to appoint an actuary as the `appointed actuary', within a certain period of time, for the purpose of performing the actuarial functions specified under a number of provisions of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Small life insurance companies will not be precluded from appointing a consulting actuary as `appointed actuary'. </PARA>
<PARA> The position of `appointed actuary' will assist the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner in identifying the particular actuary for each company who is responsible for discharging the key actuarial functions laid down by the Life Insurance Act. </PARA>
<PARA> As a minimum level of experience, an appointed actuary must be a Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries of Australia of not less than 5 years' standing. This qualification is regarded as necessary in view of the importance of the functions to be performed by the appointed actuary. </PARA>
<PARA> The requirement for an appointed actuary is supported by the Institute of Actuaries of Australia and the Life Insurance Federation of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also includes provisions to increase the threshold for publication in the Gazette of life insurance unclaimed moneys from $20 to $200. Publication annually of all unclaimed moneys of not less than $20 is a time-consuming and costly procedure. </PARA>
<PARA> This proposed change will apply to statements of unclaimed moneys as at 31 December 1988 and later, and should result in significant administrative savings as it has been estimated that in excess of 50 per cent of all amounts of unclaimed moneys are below $200. The application of this change to statements of unclaimed moneys as at 31 December 1988 should not cause any problems to life insurance companies as the Insurance and Superannuation Commission has been in touch with them concerning the proposed changes in this area since November 1988 when the Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 1988 was introduced into the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal will not affect a person's right to make a claim in respect of unclaimed moneys, including amounts less than $200, where satisfactory proof of claim can be made. </PARA>
<PARA> To increase public awareness of unclaimed moneys, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission will be making available the statements of all new unclaimed moneys from 31 December 1988. These lists will be available for public inspection in the Commission's Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra offices. </PARA>
<PARA> The unclaimed moneys provision in the Life Insurance Act is also being amended to give to the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner power to authorise payment of unclaimed moneys. This is appropriate given the arrangements put in place following passage of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner Act 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> Among other changes proposed in this Bill is an amendment to alter the timing for the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to submit a report to the Treasurer on the workings of the Act. This time will be changed from five months after 31 December to three months after 30 June each year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Office of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner has overall responsibility for preparation of annual reports not only in respect of the Life Insurance Act 1945, but also the Insurance Act 1973, the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 and the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984. This proposal will allow the Commissioner to more effectively carry out his responsibilities under those Acts by producing a single consolidated annual report within 3 months of 30 June each year. </PARA>
<PARA> A further proposed amendment involves repeal of section 13 which permits the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to arbitrate in a dispute between a life insurance company and a policy owner in relation to a policy. </PARA>
<PARA> This provision has been used only once in more than 40 years of operation of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> It is considered that the Office of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner is not equipped to provide arbitration services and it is therefore more appropriate that such disputes be settled by recourse to commercial, legal or other channels. At the same time, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission is examining in conjunction with other Government agencies and industry bodies possible additional arrangements for resolving disputes between insurers and policy owners. </PARA>
<PARA> Other proposed amendments include:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) repeal of five redundant and unproclaimed sections of the Life Insurance Amendment Act 1977. These sections relate to the conduct of non-insurance business by registered life insurers without the approval in writing of the Commissioner, the registration of companies, investment of statutory funds, accounts and balance sheets, and inspection of documents;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) improvements to certain definitions within the Life Insurance Act 1945;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) enhanced requirements for the provision of information in applications for registration under the Act;</PARA>
<PARA> (4) clarification of a number of existing provisions to remedy uncertainties in their administration;</PARA>
<PARA> (5) a reduction in the period of notice required to be given by life insurers before issuing a special policy to replace a policy that has been lost or destroyed; and</PARA>
<PARA> (6) enhancements to the review provisions in the Act to take account of the introduction of the appointed actuary. </PARA>
<PARA> The various measures which I have outlined will provide worthwhile increased protection for the insuring public and, consistent with the Government' s broad approach to regulation, will not impose undue burdens on the industries involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 to honourable senators and present the related Explanatory Memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>General Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill 1989</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Treasurer announced in the 1988-89 Budget that the Government has decided that an annual supervisory fee be levied, commencing in 1988-89, on general insurers, Lloyd' s and life insurers. This measure is intended to recover the ongoing costs of supervision of such bodies under the Insurance Act 1973 and the Life Insurance Act 1945 by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill and the associated Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill 1989 and Insurance Supervisory Levies Collection Bill 1989 will give effect to this announcement by imposing and authorising collection of a levy on authorised general insurers, Lloyd's and registered life insurers. This Bill should be read as one with the Insurance Supervisory Levies Collection Bill 1989, and is to come into operation on the same day the collection Bill commences. </PARA>
<PARA> Provisions for imposing supervisory charges were contained in the Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 1988 which was passed by the House of Representatives in November last year. However, the Bill was withdrawn prior to being debated in the Senate, to enable its provisions to be reassessed in the light of the High Court's decision in the Air Caledonie case concerning the immigration fee matter. The reason for this course of action was to ensure that the provisions imposing these charges were sound constitutionally. </PARA>
<PARA> The General Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill 1989 and its two associated Bills re-introduce the proposal to impose supervisory levies and deal exclusively with the imposition of the levies and the collection of those levies. The remaining matters from the now defunct 1988 amendment Bill are included in a fourth piece of companion legislation, namely the Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Under present arrangements the cost of supervising the general and life insurance industries is borne by taxpayers in general. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed annual supervisory levies on general and life insurance companies is based on the application of the ``user pays'' principle. </PARA>
<PARA> This principle is not a new one; it already applies in a number of areas of Government activity. For instance, registration fees are imposed by the Commonwealth in respect of insurance brokers. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a supervisory fee applicable to occupational superannuation funds and approved deposit funds that wish to take advantage of relevant concessions available under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed levies reflect the Government's view that, generally, where a service is designed to benefit a particular group, the cost should be borne by that immediate group of beneficiaries of the service rather than by taxpayers in general. </PARA>
<PARA> The supervisory levies will be payable into Consolidated Revenue. Their imposition will not affect the existing arrangements under which the financial resources made available to the Insurance and Superannuation Commission are subject to the same scrutiny processes as are applicable to Commonwealth departments generally. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the Bills,</PARA>
<PARA> (1) the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill 1989 imposes a levy on authorised general insurers and Lloyd's that are required to lodge accounts under the Insurance Act 1973;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) the Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill 1989 imposes a levy on registered life insurers that are required to lodge accounts under the Life Insurance Act 1945; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) the Insurance Supervisory Levies Collection Bill 1989 provides the machinery for collection of the levies. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to address the provisions of the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill 1989 in detail. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill imposes a levy on authorised general insurers and Lloyd's in accordance with the provisions of the Insurance Supervisory Levies Collection Bill 1989, and sets out the mechanism for calculating the amount of levy that is payable. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the 1988-89 Budget announcement, the initial annual rate of the levy for general insurers and Lloyd's has been set at $11,000, producing savings of $1.9m in a full year. The amount of the annual rate of levy will be capable of variation by regulation, but not before 1 July 1990, and any variation must be within the provisions relating to the statutory upper limit. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill and its associated Bills also contain provisions which allow for exemptions from the levy or for remissions of the levy, as appropriate, to be made by regulations. In pursuance of these provisions the Government proposes, following passage of the Bills, to seek the making of a regulation to remit part of the annual levy for the small number of general insurers which are authorised to carry on insurance business under section 37 of the Insurance Act 1973. It is proposed that these insurers pay an annual rate of levy of $2,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 37 of the Insurance Act provides that insurers whose activities are confined to conducting insurance business with limited classes of persons (generally only members or employees of the company or the particular trade, industry or profession) and whose premium income does not exceed $500,000 per annum may be exempted from certain provisions of the Act. Such exemptions are principally concerned with a reduced statutory reporting requirement and consequently there is a significantly reduced supervisory responsibility in respect of these companies on the part of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, as against insurers with unrestricted authorisations. In these circumstances it is considered appropriate that the relevant insurers pay a reduced amount of levy. </PARA>
<PARA> The amount of the annual rate of the levy in respect of authorised general insurers and Lloyd's may not exceed the specified statutory upper limit which for 1988-89 and 1989-90 has been set at $11,000. The amount of the statutory upper limit is indexed annually, from 1 July 1990, to changes in the All Groups Consumer Price Index number for the previous March-on-March year. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence this means that the annual rate of levy may only be increased within the limits of any indexation increase in the statutory upper limit. The Government does not expect to automatically seek annual adjustments to the annual rate of the levy within the statutory upper limit, but where the costs of supervision of general insurers and Lloyd's by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission increase in a financial year, there is scope for an increase in the levy to be sought to recover those increased costs. Of course, if the indexation factor results in a reduction in the statutory upper limit, the actual annual rate of levy will have to remain within the reduced statutory upper limit. </PARA>
<PARA> Where the annual rate of levy is varied during an insurer's financial year the amount of levy payable will be applied on a pro-rata basis according to the annual rate of levy applicable to that part of the insurer's financial year occurring before the variation, and the new annual rate of levy applying after the variation. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I wish to emphasise that this Bill and its associated Bills seek to do no more than recover the costs of supervision of the insurance industries by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill 1989 to honourable senators and present the related Explanatory Memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill 1989 is identical to the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill 1989 in all respects save that it applies to registered life insurers for which the initial amount of the annual rate of the levy, as announced in the 1988-89 Budget, and the statutory upper limit, will be $19,000, producing savings of $1.0m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill 1989 to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>Insurance Supervisory Levies Collection Bill 1989</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides the machinery necessary for collecting the levies imposed by the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill 1989 and the Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill 1989. This Bill should be read as one with those two Bills, and is to come into operation on the day on which it receives Royal Assent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill specifies the liability of authorised general insurers, Lloyd's and registered life insurers to pay the levy, sets out the time period within which the levy is payable, provides penalties for non-payment of the levy, and provides appropriate powers of enforcement and for review of decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> As announced in the 1988-89 Budget, the proposed annual levy will be $11,000 for general insurers and Lloyd's and $19,000 for life insurers, producing savings of $2.9m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed levies will be payable on and from 24 August 1988 that is, from the day after announcement in the 1988-89 Budget-and will involve no retrospective element. The initial amount of levy payable will accordingly be a pro-rata amount calculated on the basis of a daily component of the annual levy for the period from 24 August 1988 to and including the last day of the insurer`s then current financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently, the levy will be payable in respect of each period for which general insurers, Lloyd's and life insurers are required to lodge accounts under the relevant Act. Where the period concerned is other than 12 months, or the annual rate of the levy has been altered during the period, the levy which is payable will be adjusted on a pro-rata basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The levy payable for a particular period is due and payable by the day on which general insurers, Lloyd's and life insurers are respectively required to lodge accounts under the relevant Act for that period. </PARA>
<PARA> Transitional arrangements have been provided for insurers whose financial year ends after 23 August 1988 and whose date for lodgment of accounts in respect of that financial year will have occurred prior to or within 28 days of the Bill becoming operative. In these cases insurers will have a minimum of 28 days from the commencement of this Bill to pay the initial amount of the levy. </PARA>
<PARA> Where the liability of a person to pay the levy is not discharged at or before the time the levy is due and payable, the person is liable to pay a penalty of 20 per cent per annum of the levy. The Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner may remit the whole or part of an amount imposed as a penalty. </PARA>
<PARA> Other provisions of the Insurance Supervisory Levies Collection Bill 1989 provide:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) for the recovery by the Commonwealth of outstanding levies and amounts of any penalties;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) for the delegation by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner of the Commissioner' s powers under the Bill;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) scope for appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal regarding decisions made by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner concerning any penalties for failure to pay the levy by the due date; and</PARA>
<PARA> (4) for the making of regulations by the Governor-General under the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Insurance Supervisory Levies Collection Bill 1989 to honourable senators and present the related explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Export Inspection (Quantity Charge) Act 1985 to revise the maximum rates of charge for certain commodities and to remove commodities for which quantity charge is no longer necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The Export Inspection (Quantity Charge) Act 1985 is one of three Acts introduced by the Government to give as much flexibility as possible in determining appropriate export inspection charging arrangements for different sectors of the agricultural commodity export industry. The other Acts are the Export Inspection (Service Charge) Act 1985 and the Export Inspection (Establishment Registration Charge) Act 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time the Export Inspection (Quantity Charge) Act was introduced, it specified, for a number of commodities in respect of which it was thought convenient and efficient to charge by reference to quantity, the maximum allowable rates of charge. Those rates are set by regulation. Notwithstanding the introduction of more cost efficient arrangements in a number of areas, due to movements in the CPI and the Government's decision of last year to raise contribution by industry from 50% to 60%, some of the rates of charge under the regulations have reached or are approaching the maximum rate of charge specified in the Act. Consequently to enable cost recovery at the correct level for inspection services for these commodities to continue, it has become necessary to increase the maximum allowable rates of charge. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with the Government's objective to provide the most efficient inspection service while at the same time ensuring that industry plays its part by self-regulation to the maximum extent possible, the Government, in consultation with industry, has been actively pursuing introduction of the user pays fee for service concept. As a result of this certain commodity items (eight in number) will be removed from the Export Inspection (Quantity Charge) Act, as for some time there has been no charge in the regulations under that Act for those commodity items. Inspection service costs for the majority of those items are being collected by way of fee for service under the Export Control (Fees) Orders or under the Export Inspection (Service Charge) Act 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> In determining the revised maximum rates for quantity charge specified in the Act, it has been necessary to set rates of charge at a level which will allow scope for any future response to inflation or appropriate changes in policy, without resort to frequent amendment of the Act over the next few years, while being at a level which is reasonable and not excessive. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will have some impact, when the necessary regulations are made, on the inspection costs of containerised grain shipments. The immediate overall cost impact on industry and on recovery of costs to the Commonwealth will be minimal. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to Honourable Senators and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When beginning my speech two days ago on the Foreign Takeovers Amendment Bill 1988, I commented on the quite extraordinary nature of the legislation and said that it was designed to give the appearance of being racially biased, particularly against Japanese, and that that was the way the Japanese saw it. I remind honourable senators that an article in the 13 November 1987 edition of the Australian headed `Home ownership move inflames racism claims' states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Japanese investors are annoyed by a perceived anti-Japan bias in Australia's new foreign home ownership rules and apparent racism. </PARA>
<PARA>I need not repeat today the comments I then made with respect to the Government and its comments on racism. </PARA>
<PARA> I also discussed Japan's pre-eminent position in Australia's trade and the fact that we were fortunate to be running a $4.56 billion trade surplus with Japan, particularly in view of the diabolical state of our trade elsewhere in the world. I also mentioned that the Government needed to decide on Australia's attitude to Japan and other trading partners and to at least demonstrate some consistency in dealings with them. </PARA>
<PARA> I will cite some figures from the 1987-88 annual report of the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) because they are very important. They show that both the United States and the United Kingdom have approximately twice the investment in Australia than does Japan; that the rate of increase of their investments has exceeded that of Japan; and that Japan still has 12 1/2 per cent of the investment market in Australia, as it did in 1983-84. It is important that we bear that fact in mind when discussing this matter. If we object to Japanese investment, why do we not object just as vehemently to the investments of the United Kingdom and the United States? We have reached the stage where our profligacy can be funded only by selling off Australia or by borrowing huge amounts from the bankers of the world. There are no other choices. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, we are going broke at the rate of $1,500m a month; that debt must be funded. At present it is being funded by borrowing overseas or selling off Australia. Currently we owe overseas countries the staggering sum of $125,000m. Presumably, by the end of June, the amount will have grown to more than $130,000m. The bulk of that debt has arisen since 1983, when this Government came into office and when our overseas debt was approximately $30 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> A contrast to our position is provided by Taiwan. It was reported in the news on 8 March that Taiwan held non-gold monetary reserves of about $91.4 billion. In contrast, Australia owes $125 billion. Taiwan is a country two-thirds of the size of Tasmania, with very little in the way of natural resources. Will we continue to sell off Australia brick by brick and acre by acre until we pay that amount? If we do, will we all then work for the overseas owners? Can we gamble indefinitely on low prices of oil or high prices of our agricultural commodities? Will this Bill do anything to get us back on the track, or will it make it easier for us to go further down our present track?</PARA>
<PARA> Much has been made of the matter of houses. I want to know why so much has been made of them. Why has the Government made such a show about houses? Let us remember that this Government created the housing problem, fed it and fattened it, not the Japanese. Let me return to the housing statistics. In 1986-87 there were 85 applications for FIRB approval for the purchase of urban properties. By 1987-88 this had reached 1,219-up 15 times in one year. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us bear in mind two things. On 29 September 1987 the rules were changed. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) made the following statement in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA> I should emphasise that while the Bill provides for notification and examination of foreign purchases of all forms of urban real estate-both commercial and residential-the relatively liberal approach to approvals in cases other than developed residential real estate is to be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA>That virtually says that the tight regulation on residential real estate will be continued. But has it been continued? By 1988 there were a total of 3,754 applications of which only 100 were not approved. Where is this tightening that has been talked about? The total number of applications for 1986-87 was 1,412 and by 1988 there were 3,754, with 100 rejections. What did the change of rules set out to achieve? We should all be told what this Bill was supposed to do. </PARA>
<PARA> On 23 May 1988 I gave notice of two questions, Nos 352 and 353. In both cases the questions I asked were directed to Senator Walsh as the Minister representing the Treasurer. The first was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) How many rural holdings in Australia are owned or partially owned (40 per cent or more) by foreign nationals or foreign companies. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) What is the value of agricultural production of these holdings; (a) as an absolute amount; and (b) as a percentage of total agricultural production. </PARA>
<PARA>The second question was:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) How many companies operating in Australia are wholly owned by foreign interests. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) How many companies operating in Australia are partially owned (20 per cent or more) by foreign interests. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) What is the annual turnover of these companies. </PARA>
<PARA>On 27 February this year I managed to get a reply to one of my questions relating to rural land holdings. The answer was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) and (2) Since the changes to the Government's foreign investment policy in April 1987, proposed acquisitions by foreign investors of rural properties have only been examinable where the properties are valued at $3 million or more. The policy provides that such proposals are approved unless they are judged contrary to the national interest. Many foreign acquisitions would involve properties valued at less than $3 million and would not be recorded in the Foreign Investment Review Board's statistics . . . </PARA>
<PARA>And so the answer continued. At the end of the answer I was provided with table 11.3 headed `Foreign investment in rural land, 1976-77 to 1986-87'. The table sets out the total numbers of proposals, the total areas involved and the total considerations. Although I have not shown the table to the Minister at the table, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray), I seek leave to incorporate this one small chart. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IE4">Senator ARCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The table is important because the second question about businesses, asked on 23 May last year, still awaits a reply. If the Government at this time can give me no indication, or even an interim answer, as to what is involved in rural ownership or in business ownership, I really despair. If the Government is unable to give me that sort of information, I ask: How was the Government able to produce legislation such as this Bill with no information to hand as to what was likely to be achieved? I think that is important. I would like the Minister, when summing up, to give us some basis on which this legislation was produced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia, of course, is in a very happy position as far as speculators are concerned. I have previously mentioned the security of investment that exists in Australia. I have mentioned the high inflation rates of 7 and 8 per cent, which are more than double that of our trading partners. I have also mentioned the fact that we have high interest rates. Overseas speculators are able to get 15 to 18 per cent on their money in Australia and also take advantage of inflation. When we add to that the high commodity values that exist at present, we can see that the trend has become an absolute torrent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer reminds me very much of the sorcerer's apprentice: he sees himself as knowing it all; he shows off to all and sundry about his great talents; he basks in the adulation; and all the time the situation is hopelessly out of control and he has not the faintest idea of either what he has done or how to stop it. Perhaps the Minister will tell us how the Government plans to stop this mess. After six years, we need to know what the Government's plans are. So that we are not sold out altogether, perhaps the Minister can tell Australians what the Government's `fix-it' plan is to repay the huge debt that the Government has built up since 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this Government, most Australians with capital have had all incentive absolutely destroyed. Any Australian with income has had the very socks taxed off him. Non-Australians own more and more of Australia's wealth and property and we have to pay more and more of our bills in kind because we no longer have the cash to use. </PARA>
<PARA> We are dealing with a totally cosmetic Bill which seeks to satisfy those Australian Labor Party members who want to believe that there are gross constraints on the Japanese and particularly on Japanese home purchases. From the numbers, it can be clearly demonstrated that this is absolutely not the case and that the totally opposite situation applies. As I have said, there were 100 rejections from 3,754 applications. This is an absolute farce. The status and functions of the FIRB have been reduced and the commercial world now wonders whether the FIRB itself is purely cosmetic. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is so busy trying to prevent Tasmania from developing its resources-resources which would add to employment, independence and export income-that it does not really have any time to do anything other than speed the whole nation into a headlong downhill rush. This is a crazy piece of legislation as it particularly draws the public's attention to the very considerable and obvious shortcomings that the Government has in this area. I support the amendment moved by Senator Messner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Foreign Takeovers Amendment Bill 1988 seeks to regulate extensively the ownership or urban real estate by foreigners in Australia. I would like to take the opportunity afforded by this debate to make some remarks about the increasingly public debate over foreign ownership in Australia, not only in real estate but also in industry at large.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important, in debates such as this, to keep the real issues clear because regrettably some groups use genuine and understandable concern about foreign land ownership to further their racist and divisive beliefs. Australian land or real estate historically has been owned by British and North American interests. However, of late, Japanese interests are becoming more noticeable in the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the Foreign Investment Review Board report for 1987-88, expected investments by Japan totalled $5.4 billion, compared with $3.2 billion in the previous period. In the same period United Kingdom and United States nationals also nearly doubled their investments. Japanese investments accounted for a quarter of the total expected investments for the year, which was $24.8 billion. Japan therefore now accounts for 21.3 per cent of such foreign investments, compared with 37.1 per cent from Great Britain and 40 per cent from the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> The Cattlemen's Union of Australia wants the Foreign Investment Review Board to examine all investments of $1 million or more, not just those above $3 million as now set down in the FIRB guidelines. There is growing concern among groups such as the Cattlemen's Union that, as a result of increasing dominance by the Japanese in the meat markets, farmers will increasingly find that the slaughtering and processing of farm meat products are falling into foreign hands. If this happens, those foreign interests, especially the Japanese, will be equipped to dictate the prices of cattle because of their market hold. The Cattlemen's Union voices the concern that the purchase of properties worth less than $3m does not need to be submitted for examination by the Foreign Investment Review Board and the purchase is automatically approved. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of the assurances given of the benefits and desirability of Japanese investment in the Australian beef industry, doubts remain about whether in the long term it will be in this country's national interest. It has been argued that such investment will ensure that Japan gets its beef from Australia rather than from other countries. However, what is of concern is the spectre of what is called vertically integrated ownership, with foreign owners feeding their cattle on their own feedlots, then slaughtering them at their own abattoirs for shipment to foreign markets in ships carrying that country's flag. There is already an example of vertical integration in Queensland and elsewhere with Japanese interests owning a feedlot near the town of Texas and an abattoir near Oakey. Although it is a Japanese- Australian joint venture, which we welcome, such a joint venture is not a condition for Japanese investment in Australia. A lot of people feel that it should be. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point the Opposition supports the setting up of more joint ventures in which Australia has a fair equity involvement. This is only right because it is Australian land that is being utilised and exploited. At the moment the guidelines for rural land seem ill-defined. It is essential that firm guidelines be laid down for the Foreign Investment Review Board to allow it to determine the extent to which the nation's beef industry should be controlled by foreign companies. I repeat: there is a need for reviewed guidelines for rural land because at the moment the guidelines are ill-defined, and we need stronger guidelines for the Foreign Investment Review Board. </PARA>
<PARA> Vertical integration has the unfortunate effect of decreasing opportunities for Australian operators to compete effectively and to gain a share of the profits. While current Japanese rural investment in Australia is small compared with our two traditional investment countries, it would be naive of us to think that this state of affairs will remain static, especially given the rising Japanese domestic price for imported beef and the relative exchange rate values. </PARA>
<PARA> Japan is in the process of liberalising its quota on imported beef. This market is presently worth about $500m a year to Australia and could easily double in the space of a few years. There is also the danger that once overseas interests establish large feedlots and slaughterhouse facilities they will be in a position to freeze local producers out of the lucrative foreign market. There is no doubt as to the potential of this market, but it would be of little benefit to Australia if it were owned and serviced entirely by Japanese companies. In a number of areas the Japanese have contributed quite a lot, not necessarily in the field of direct investment but as a result of participation in purchasing the produce from Australian companies. I refer particularly to the Fujii-Keori company of Japan. Almost every single export meat processing company in my home State of Tasmania is now controlled by Japanese interests. Concerned primary producers are coming to my office in increasing numbers demanding that something be done about this. It is not only that the Japanese are gaining such a hold, but also that Australian equity in such companies is continually decreasing. </PARA>
<PARA> Land prices are naturally an area of concern to the Opposition but, as was pointed out by my colleague Senator Messner, the proposition that residential land prices are being pushed up by foreign, particularly Japanese, house buyers cannot be sustained. What is of concern is some limited foreign speculation in rural land subdivision with those profits going overseas and the resulting transactions adding no productive wealth to Australia. Those Japanese who are interested in buying Australian homes are generally interested in the very expensive waterfront-type mansions, not the average brick and tile, three-bedroom home in the suburbs. Therefore, this Bill is nothing more than a political ploy. I would like something more substantial. This is a ploy of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and demonstrates his economic mismanagement, because this legislation was just a wedge to support the former decaying State Government in New South Wales. It is surprising that it has taken so long to bring the Bill before the Senate. In fact, New South Wales electors clearly gave their verdict on the Unsworth Government and I believe that they will give another clear verdict at the next Federal election. At that election the people will elect a Federal Liberal-National government. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been noted by previous speakers, it is ironic that the Treasurer has sponsored a Bill such as this, yet at the same time presides over a declining economy as this country lurches into a massive foreign debt crisis. Statistics show that in the recent months of Mr Keating's Treasury stewardship Australia was borrowing $1,500m a month to keep the economy going. Australia is no longer the lucky country under the Hawke Government. I support the second reading amendment moved by the shadow Minister, Senator Messner, and note that the Opposition will move specific amendments to the Bill in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> We should and must be masters of our own destiny. We should not let any foreigners dictate the development of this great and beautiful country. This Hawke Government must realise that because of its policies the foreign moneylenders and bankers have obtained too much control over our mendicant economy and foreign landowners and developers are only one symptom of a greater and more critical economic problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I will get on with it, and if Senator McKiernan bothers to listen he may learn something. As I said, a few points need to be strengthened and that is what I intend to do. This legislation gives effect to the announcement made by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on 28 September 1987. The Bill removes the $600,000 limit, below which there is an exemption from applying to the Foreign Investment Review Board for permission to buy real estate. With most of the Bills we pass in this place we do not have the advantage of hindsight. The beauty of this Bill is that we do have hindsight. Fortunately, we have seen this Bill's provisions in action for 18 months and we can see how they have been working. The report of the Foreign Investment Review Board shows that applications to the Board for real estate purchases have increased tenfold. Big deal! It is getting applications for established real estate that has been bought before anyhow. In the last nine months of the last financial year in which the Board was operating it received 2,476 applications for real estate purchases and nothing else. Of those applications the Board approved 2,461. There is a discrepancy of 15.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, with all the hierarchy in this system can you tell me why this Board was set up at all except to keep a register? A register could have been kept without bothering to set up this bureaucracy. Only 15 applications have not received approval; so I consider that this Board has been a total waste of time. At best, I would describe it as a toothless tiger. The funny thing is that one would expect that, as a result of people having to apply to the Foreign Investment Review Board for real estate costing under $600,000, that would dampen the increase in housing prices. But it has not. We have had a record price jump in real estate right across the board, not only for the $600,000 mansions in Dalkeith or anywhere else, but also right down to the average brick and tile houses that have been built for about 30 years that are being bought by first home owners. On average, the price of those houses has increased by 30 to 40 per cent since this time last year. </PARA>
<PARA> So what has the Foreign Investment Review Board done? Incidentally, I do not propound the theory that the increase in prices at the higher end of the scale, caused by a demand from either foreign or internal buyers, does not affect the bottom end of the market. To a certain extent, if the top end of the market goes up, it tends to suck up the other end. Even though real estate agents say something else, I do not subscribe to other theories. We have to look at why this is happening and I will come to that a little later. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this new system, foreign investment was able to flow into undeveloped land provided a foreign investor did not have more than a 50 per cent equity in a project. This has not encouraged investment in undeveloped tracts of land. The figures in this report show that it has encouraged people to invest money in existing off the plan developments. An Australian syndicate buys a tract of land; it goes to the local shire to get zoning changes where necessary and then puts up conceptual plans with the idea of getting a building permit. That is what is called buying off the plan. That is exactly what has been happening. People are doing this rather than bothering to apply to the Foreign Investment Review Board for permission to spend up to $600,000 on an existing project. I have given figures in respect of what those people are already doing. The purchases have been rubber stamped. This has pushed these people to invest in these areas rather than developing those tracts of land that need developing to supply the housing that Australia is so short of. It takes no time for foreign investors to buy off the plan but they are limited by a 50 per cent investment in a project. If there are 100 units in a block, foreign investors are not allowed to own more than 50. This is contrary to what Senator Coulter told us in this Senate the other evening. He said that, by taking money away from established properties, this has forced up the price of undeveloped land. That is untrue. People are simply investing in off-the-plan developments which they pick up a lot more easily and this is not creating further employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of Australia is blaming this increase in the price of real estate-whether at the top end or the bottom end-on the foreign buyers. I believe that they have certainly had some effect. We do not have to look too far. Those people engaged in the game of real estate development or speculation, or whatever, could come to that conclusion. Every time more players are brought into the market there must be some increase in prices. </PARA>
<PARA> We, in Australia, are finding it more difficult to buy houses or to invest in real estate as we have had rising prices and, at the same time, declining disposable income. That is what it is all about. When we do not have the buying strength at land auctions, or wherever it is, it allows foreign investors to buy more easily into projects. If I have the time available on Saturday mornings I try to attend at least two property auctions in Perth to see what is going on. It keeps me in contact with prices and mostly with whoever is buying. I have been a property developer for the last 25 years so I think I have a bit of first-hand experience. I know from my own experience that sometimes we are outbid by Asian money. It is obvious when it is Asian money. Sometimes it is American money. Unless one picks up the accent one does not know. It can even be European money and then one would not know--</PARA>

It gets very annoying but how can we fix it? We can only get annoyed, go home and do our figures on some other project that, hopefully, foreign investors are not interested in. The point is that we, in Australia, cannot compete because our disposable income is not what it used to be. That has to be turned around in the future. Why can we not compete with foreign investors? We cannot compete because of this Government's mismanagement of the economy since 1983. We have had record taxes, record this and record that. In the final analysis, our economy is nowhere near that of our trading partners. That is where we are at this point. Let us consider why we cannot compete with foreign money.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Stone. I always take heed of Senator Stone on economics. That 49c in the dollar becomes 50.25 when Medicare is included. Our top tax threshold is $35,000, which is only 1 1/2 times average weekly earnings. Let us look at the source of this foreign money that is buying a lot of the good real estate in Australia. We must bear in mind that in Australia a reliable borrower has to pay at least 17 1/2 per cent interest on an overdraft. If a borrower happens to be anywhere near unreliable the rate increases to around 21 or 22 per cent. I suppose if one is at all unreliable, one cannot borrow. The other day I had some figures taken out on our competitors. I could not believe them so I sent my staff back to check them. Singapore's interest rate on borrowings is 5.25 per cent and the top tax rate is 33 per cent. The beauty of it is that the personal tax threshold to go on to the top rate-I ask honourable senators to listen to this, but I am sure they will not believe it-is $A258,488. In Malaysia, the interest rate is 5.70 per cent, the top tax rate 40 per cent and the threshold $A45,442. In Japan one borrows at 4.6875 per cent, the top tax rate is 50 per cent and the threshold is $A484,731. In Hong Kong the interest rate is 9.625 per cent, the top tax rate 25 per cent and the threshold is $A9,569. At a later stage, after the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), who is in the chamber, has had an opportunity to view the schedule, I will seek leave to incorporate it in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These figures show why we cannot compete with foreign money. But that will change when the Government is replaced at the next election, whenever it decides to call one. An election is imminent and the Government knows that it will lose it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. I noted that yesterday the President referred to Senator Button as the Leader of the Opposition. So it is in his mind that the Government will lose the election. When the Opposition comes to government we will put the economy right. However, I can assure honourable senators that things will get worse before they get better. We are all aware that America has just elected a new President for a fixed four-year term. Another election will not be held for four years. President Bush, having got the election out of the road, has to tighten up his economy and, of course, that will affect the rest of the world. So our economy will get worse before it gets better.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that by 1991 we will be starting to improve our economy. We will then be able to start competing with foreign money. This is the only way we will remove the spectre of being taken over by foreign money. I have mentioned real estate but I have not mentioned an area with which I am familiar, namely, farming land. By 1991, not only will we be able to compete with those countries but also we will be able to buy back what we have sold. Anyone who thinks that that will not happen is wrong. In 1956 a great deal of development took place at Esperance on the south coast of Western Australia. Most, if not all, of the land finished up in the hands of American interests. The same happened in the early 1960s with the cattle stations in the high rainfall areas of the Kimberleys. Most of those finished up in American hands. However, as a result of the strong economy under the Liberal-National Party governments that were in office for most of the time between 1950 and 1983, we were able to buy back those foreign interests. There are now no American interests left in Esperance and very few cattle stations are owned by American interests in the Kimberleys. So there is hope around the corner. </PARA>
<PARA> When we on this side manage the economy in Australia, things will improve. We will buy back, when they become available, those properties that have been bought by overseas interests. They will be returned to their rightful owners. I support the very important amendment moved by my colleague Senator Messner.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I propose to confine the bulk of my comments on the Foreign Takeovers Amendment Bill 1988 to the committee stage. As you are aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, the Opposition has set down a number of amendments-I understand that the Australian Democrats have set down an even greater number-and we will have plenty of time at that stage to deal with those detailed aspects of the Bill. At this stage I want to make some general remarks about the Bill. I start from the point that, as the explanatory memorandum accompanying the Bill acknowledges, the amendment which the Bill will make to the Foreign Takeovers Act 1975 incorporates announcements as long ago as 29 October 1985; that is, it is over three years since the first announcements, which now form the subject of this Bill, were made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have to say in passing that I regard that as a disgraceful performance on the part of the Government. The Foreign Investment Review Board and the foreign investment division of the Treasury, which has been advising the Foreign Investment Review Board, have been operating during the whole of that time on the basis of a policy constituted simply by a press release by the then Acting Treasurer on 29 October 1985. For over three years we have had no legislative endorsement of that press release or policy on the basis of which decisions have been made. That is not good enough. I understand that any government, particularly the present Government, runs into legislative log jams, but there is no excuse whatsoever for a delay of over three years between the time that a legislative change is announced and a Bill is put to the Parliament to give proper, lawful effect to that change or, importantly, to be subjected to amendments which might be made to that legislation by the Parliament when it is finally given a chance to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important set of amendments to be enacted by this legislation was first announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on 29 September 1987. That was almost 18 months ago and that in itself I regard as an inordinate delay. Those amendments related to policy in respect of the acquisition by foreign interests of developed residential urban real estate. I repeat that those amendments were announced in September 1987. At that time we were beginning to see the first major signs of the explosion in real estate prices in Sydney. The then New South Wales Government-the totally unlamented Government, headed by Mr Unsworth, of the Australian Labor Party-was beginning to react with some sensitivity to the explosion in housing and land prices in Sydney which was then manifesting itself. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to those expressions of electoral alarm, the Government began to contemplate having at last to face the electorate and answer for its misdeeds of the previous 3 1/2 years. In answer to those pleas from his faction-not merely his Party, but his Party factional colleagues in the Australian Labor Party-the Treasurer made his announcement on 29 September 1987 on the acquisition by foreign interests of developed residential urban real estate. It is only now that that announcement has found its way into legislation being placed before the Parliament by the Treasurer. Again, while obviously that is not in quite the same category as the earlier instance that I mentioned concerning amendments announced over three years ago, I regard the delay of almost 18 months as being equally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth while noting two points about the announcement to which I have just been referring. First, notwithstanding the Treasurer's intervention on behalf of the then New South Wales Government, that Government did not survive the wrath of the electors at the following election in March 1988; nor did it deserve to. Nor, indeed, did the Treasurer's nakedly political intervention on that Government's behalf deserve to be in any way successful-and nor was it. That is the first point. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the intervention appears to have had not the slightest impact upon the explosion in residential dwelling prices in Sydney since it was announced. Of course, we cannot be sure of that because one cannot distinguish all the elements which entered into the experience of the residential real estate market in Sydney during the past 18 months when, as we all know, housing and other dwelling construction prices in Sydney have roughly doubled. They rose by about 80 per cent in the calendar year 1988 alone. One can only ask: If this intervention by the Treasurer-thereby denying all of his claims to deregulatory fame-did have the effect of slowing down or diminishing the rise in housing and land prices during that time, what would the rise have been without it? Anybody looking at the evidence with a degree of commonsense and political detachment could only take the view that the overwhelmingly greatest reason for this kind of explosion in residential real estate prices in Sydney and in other major capital cities appears to have been the policies of the present Government, in particular, the policy of pumping up the money supply, pumping up the supply of credit, together with, we should never forget, the decision by the Government to introduce a capital gains tax from which the principal private residence would be the only significant exemption. We have seen a flight of the capital of individuals into building bigger and better principal private residences, or adding to existing ones, in order that at least one of their assets might be free from the depredations of the capital gains tax which otherwise would be imposed upon them by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> When we are thinking about this explosion in residential real estate prices, we should never forget that one of the most significant legislative changes leading to its emergence in the past year or two has been the Government's decision to introduce a capital gains tax while at the same time exempting from that tax the principal private residence. I am not arguing that the principal private residence should not be exempted from that tax; I am saying that the tax as such is a bad and an extraordinarily ill-judged tax at a time when Australia, as its balance of payments position shows, is desperately in need of encouraging savings rather than discouraging them by the imposition of a capital gains tax on any gains which people might make by the investment of their savings. </PARA>
<PARA> But it is not the purpose of this Bill to address the capital gains tax, and I do not propose to do so any further other than to underline the point that the chief element of the Bill before us emerges from a purely political decision at the time by the Treasurer in support of his then party factional colleagues in New South Wales to restrict the acquisition by foreigners of developed urban residential real estate. Apart from the extraordinary splurge of credit which has been provided by the present Government, the single most important factor operating to produce that explosion in dwelling prices has been this Government's actions in respect of the capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me go on to some other aspects of the Bill and develop in particular one or two of the points that have been put before the Senate by my colleague Senator Messner, who has moved that the motion that the Bill be read a second time be amended by adding the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>``, but the Senate condemns the Government for its failed economic policies which have resulted in:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Australia's increasing dependence on foreign investment;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a continuing balance of payments crisis and associated foreign debt problems;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) high domestic interest rates adversely affecting all Australians; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) record levels of taxation which are heavily biased against the ability of Australians to save''. </PARA>
<PARA>There is not the slightest doubt about the accuracy of all the paragraphs in Senator Messner's amendment. Undoubtedly, in this country today we have an increasing dependence on foreign investment. Two of the earlier speakers, my colleagues on this side of this chamber Senator Archer and Senator Watson, both remarked on one particularly unfortunate aspect or result of this increasing dependence on foreign investment today and that is the increasingly unpleasant and ugly-to use a word for which I have no longer very much respect-racist terms in which some of the comments that are emerging in the press about foreign investment in this country are now being couched. I refer particularly, of course, to some of the uglier remarks about investment in Australia from Japanese sources and, indeed, from other sources such as Hong Kong, Malaysia, et cetera. It is principally the comments that one sees, from time to time, on Japanese investments in Australia that give rise to some concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to suggest for one moment that there are not any aspects of Japanese investment in Australia today which should give rise to some concern but not, I repeat not, because they are Japanese. I will come back to one or two aspects of some Japanese investments in Australia in recent times which do give rise to concern. From our own national point of view, I would be more concerned about the quality of the comments in some of these cases where all we are actually seeing is investment from Japanese sources which does not differ in any way from investment from other sources such as the United States of America, Britain and other parts of Europe. I regard as totally undesirable comments which seem to suggest that somehow investment which emanates from a Japanese source is, therefore, innately less worthy or more objectionable, if you like, than if it emanates from America. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, let me add that there are certain aspects of Japanese investment in Australia today which are beginning to give rise to some justifiable concerns in the minds of a number of people who are perhaps closer to those investments than the general population. I am referring particularly, of course, to investments such as those on what I think the economists call a vertically integrated basis in the beef industry-that is to say, the purchase of cattle feedlots in, let us say, Queensland; the purchase of an abattoir such as the Oakey meatworks outside Toowoomba in Queensland; the chain of vertically integrated investments which lead to the slaughter of cattle fed on these feedlots, and the beef being transported to the ports by probably Japanese owned transport companies, and being passed through the ports. I suppose we have not as yet got a Japanese owned waterfront company but even that may not be that far away if the Government were ever to get off its tail and deregulate our ports. Finally, of course, we see the shipment of beef to Japan in Japanese vessels. </PARA>
<PARA> What is wrong with all that? There is nothing necessarily wrong with all that. The reason it gives rise to disquiet is that, particularly given the extremely restrictive wholesale and retail distribution arrangements that operate in Japan, what we are actually seeing here is Japanese beef exporters from Australia being placed in a preferred position to Australian beef exporters. The mark-ups at the Japanese end are so high that it is possible for Japanese purchasers of these Australian assets to pay prices for them well above what might otherwise be afforded by Australian investors and still return a handsome profit because of their preferred access-if I can put it in a low key way-to the mark-ups of the Japanese wholesale and retail distribution system. </PARA>
<PARA> Until those distribution systems in Japan are broken down to operate in a much more truly competitive manner, according to what one would describe as a properly competitive marketing situation, we will have these concerns on the part of their competitors, not only in Australia but elsewhere in the world, as to whether the playing field is level and as to whether the competitive situation being faced, on the one hand, by the major Japanese trading companies and, on the other hand, by some Australian meat exporters who are having to compete with them is really the same. The answer, for the moment at least, on any objective examination, is that it is not the same. </PARA>
<PARA> That factor is giving rise to these feelings of resentment; not so much that land, feedlots or abattoirs, et cetera, are being owned by Japanese as such but the process of non-competitive trading, or at least not properly competitive trading, which lies behind those acquisitions. That is a big topic. It is a topic which this Government will have to address, as will the Opposition in the period ahead because we will see more of it. It is clearly not a satisfactory situation, any more than it is clearly not a satisfactory situation to have these recurring outbursts of xenophobia, particularly when it is slightly racially coloured xenophobia, occurring from time to time, whenever a Japanese investor buys anything in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In the annual report of the Foreign Investment Review Board 1987-88, released a few days ago, we have the report of a very responsible body headed by Sir Bede Callaghan, who has been a personal acquaintance of mine for many years and for whom I have the highest regard and respect. This body basically is saying to the Government, and through it to this Parliament, that foreign investment policy today is a kind of process whereby examinations are undertaken but approved with very few exceptions. There is no effective application of any restriction upon the ability of foreigners to invest in Australia, and nor perhaps there should be. What the Foreign Investment Review Board is really saying, when I peer between the lines of its report, is that we have a policy, an apparatus, a division of the Treasury-much smaller than it used to be-which is going through the motions of appearing to control, restrict or in some other way supervise foreign investment in this country but actually it is not doing that or it is doing very little. It is in keeping with the whole stance of the Federal Government in so many other regards; what one is getting all the time is words. The words, of course, are differing very considerably from the action. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, so I am not misunderstood, I am not suggesting that there ought to be a stronger or more restrictive foreign investment policy than the Government is presently operating. On the contrary, I am saying that we have a very clear distinction between the Government maintaining this fairly significant apparatus to do very little. It is a typical example of the dissimulation in which the Government and the Treasurer, in particular, have become very experienced in the past six years. In recent times, however, we have seen one particular example of the Treasurer intervening to restrict foreign investment. I refer to the proposal to develop a segment of Woolloomooloo in a manner which has apparently caused some distress to the Treasurer's town planning sensibilities. In a remarkable intervention, he has refused to give approval to the investment proposal concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> His refusal need not make any difference to the proposal going ahead, because the Japanese joint venturers who, from memory, proposed to provide 50 per cent of the capital, will no doubt be replaced by Australian partners. The Treasurer will then no longer have any say in what will happen to the development. It will then become solely a matter for the New South Wales Government, which will no doubt take the view of the development it would otherwise have taken. It is an interesting example, however, and that is the chief reason why I cite it. The decision taken by the Treasurer in this case is so extraordinarily different from almost every other decision that he has ever taken in this field. One can only assume that in some way or other the proposal has offended his personal sensibilities. No other reason is apparent, certainly not in the stated reasons, for the rejection of the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the case because, according to press reports, that particular objection has created a great deal of unhappiness in Japan, not surprisingly, on the part of the company which, from memory, is called Nara, which was the joint venturer in this proposal. Not surprisingly, the company would have received advice, based on previous experience, from solicitors and others who specialise in facilitating foreign investment proposals that there probably would not be any problems with the proposal. Those advisers may have pointed to some potential problems from the State Government authorities, the City of Sydney or some other body with a legitimate reason for interfering in the proposal, but they would have advised that foreign investment approval would probably have been a routine matter because hundreds of such approvals are made each year. It is no wonder, therefore, that following rejection of the proposal the overseas company in question is now expressing some unhappiness and-this is the point-is beginning to raise publicly questions about whether the rejection betokens some change in the attitude of the Australian Government towards investment, specifically from Japan. I do not believe it does, so I think those fears are groundless. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again, I have had a little experience in listening to foreign investors appearing to threaten as to what they might or might not do as a consequence of a decision made by the Government or the Treasurer of the day, so perhaps I pay a little less attention to that than I might otherwise do. Nevertheless, in saying that, I do not want to diminish or entirely ignore the comment that Senator Coulter made. I simply draw out the point that, as long as Australia continues to run a balance of payments deficit-now at the rate of about $14 billion a year-it will have to borrow money or to sell bits of Australia. This Government has been doing both hand over fist ever since it came to office and it is still doing so. A deficit this year of $14 billion would be regarded in some quarters as optimistic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Notwithstanding a lot of very sensible words from the mouth of the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh), who I am glad to say is now in the chamber, in his address to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia on 30 January last-words which I could have written myself-his colleagues are continuing blithely to ignore the warning which I think he was addressing to them rather than to CEDA on that occasion and are pressing ahead with policies that have resulted in a balance of payments deficit of $14 billion a year, all of which has to be borrowed or otherwise obtained by selling bits of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In the end, as I often say to people who get up at meetings that I address and ask me about whether we should not be more concerned about foreign investment in this country and the activities, particularly often, of the Japanese investors, before we start blaming the foreigners for these developments we had better start looking at our own failings-particularly that we have a set of overall policies which have resulted in our continuing to need to borrow or sell off Australia to the tune of $14 billion a year. This Bill does nothing to mend that fundamentally shameful situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not propose to speak for very long. I did not hear very much of the second reading debate, so I point out the two principal components of the Bill in case they have not been made clear during the debate. One is to extend controls over foreign investment in real estate in urban areas. The other is to put into legislation what has been applied via policy for some time; that is, to have some exemptions for rural properties with a value of less than $3m and for companies with a value of less than $5m. The legislation also casts a wide net which subsequently will be narrowed by exemptions to be made by way of regulations, which, it is planned, will be introduced at the same time that the Bill is proclaimed. Those regulations will cover the sorts of transactions which are exempt under current policy and a number of others to which the Treasurer (Mr Keating) agreed on 7 March.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> According to my most recent information, there are two sets of amendments to be proposed in the committee stage, one by the Opposition and one by the Australian Democrats. The amendments reveal that the Opposition and the Democrats have views on this Bill that are approximately 180 degrees from each other. Essentially, the Democrats' amendments seek to tighten the net; the Opposition amendments seek to loosen it. I therefore presume that, if there is any intellectual consistency at all, the Opposition will not support the Democrats' amendments and the Democrats will not support the Opposition amendments, but I will not say any more about them at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> All I can say about the mickey mouse amendment to the motion for the second reading is that that is the sort of thing we get from the Opposition. Of course, the Government will not accept the amendment. I commend the Bill to the House. (Quorum formed)</PARA>

<PARA>The legislation is designed, effectively, to ban foreign investment in urban land in Australia. This matter was debated at considerable length during the second reading stage and I do not intend to track over the same ground. However, I want to make two or three points. This legislation is the result of an announcement made by the Government as far back as September 1987 which was designed to stop a perceived rush of Asian investment in the property market, particularly in Sydney. The Federal Government took this course of action for two reasons: first, it wanted to protect the political interests of the then Premier of New South Wales, Mr Unsworth, and to save him from the political gallows which he was due to face within six months. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Panizza" NAMEID="JI4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course it did not help him. Secondly, the Federal Government was aware of the argument being spread by some, and perpetuated by the State Labor Government of New South Wales at the time, that the rush of foreign investment into the Sydney property market was driving prices up and out of the reach of ordinary citizens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to take issue on that point, as I did during the second reading debate. It is significant to note that, even though that problem was perceived in the Sydney property market between September 1987-18 months ago-and prices were said to have risen significantly, the truth is that since September 1987 the market has gone through the roof. Whatever the Government perceived to be the position before September 1987-and, according to its analysis, there had been an increase in the value of property in Sydney due to foreign investment-the announcement in September 1987 that it would stop foreign investment has had exactly the reverse effect of what was intended. In fact, prices have gone up even further and faster than the Government perceived they would. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, therefore, has made another bungle. This typical Labor Party interventionist approach has destroyed the Government's credibility and, in fact, it has made the acquisition of housing even more impossible for the people of Australia. The Government is using economic and monetary policies to deliberately drive up interest rates and deny home ownership to people throughout Australia, and particularly in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> The first point which has to be noted-and this reinforces the argument that we put during the second reading debate-is that this legislation is wrong. It is simply a knee-jerk political reaction which was designed to save a mate-the former Premier of New South Wales. It failed dismally to do that. Senator Walsh is now grinning; perhaps he has some ulterior motive. However, this action has had a perverse effect and that is the reason why the Liberal and National parties will be opposing this clause. The other 10 related amendments which I will be moving later also directly oppose the legislation. I think it is clear that the Government acted off the top of its head, without proper consideration, and entirely the reverse result to what it sought has been achieved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly do not want to repeat the arguments that I raised during the second reading debate. No doubt the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray) does not want me to go over them again either. As I said at that time, we have the advantage of hindsight and one does not have that very often in this place. But we have had 18 months to observe what has happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has introduced a Bill which is designed to limit the amount of Australian real estate that can be purchased by foreign investors. It is seeking to remove the $600,000 threshold above which Foreign Investment Review Board approval is required. Can the Minister tell me why, in the real estate area, 2,461 applications out of 2,476 were approved? Can he tell me why this legislation should not be regarded as a rubber stamp? As Senator Messner has pointed out, action taken by the Government has certainly not held down prices. In fact, prices have taken off at a greater rate than they have at any other time. I know that there are other reasons for this, but the Government's action has not had the dampening effect that it was supposed to have had. Where has the dampening effect been? This is simply, as I say, a rubber stamp. Another bureaucracy has been put into place whereas a register of who bought what would have done exactly the same thing. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to raise another point. As I said in the second reading debate, I attend a lot of property auctions, whether I am interested in the property concerned or not, just to see what the values are, who is buying, and that sort of thing. People may come to the wrong conclusion that too much property is going to foreigners. At a property auction three lots of Asians may be bidding. Who is to say that they are not Australian citizens? They could very easily be naturalised Australians. They could have taken up residence in Australia through business migration or whatever. I have certainly learned to temper my remarks about foreign investors when a property is knocked down to an Asian. He could very well be an Australian citizen. I am sure that many of these people are. We have to discern between the two. I would like the Minister to comment on these matters at some stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, I will remark first on Senator Panizza's comments.

I know that there are some people who think that they can prove beyond any reasonable doubt that there are certain causal relationships, but more reasonable people, I suggest, in circumstances where there are a number of variables, would make a judgment but not claim that the judgment was infallible. The purpose of the amendment is effectively to gut the Bill; that is, remove effectively from the Bill the controls over foreign purchases of urban real estate. Therefore, on those grounds, the amendment is not acceptable to the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (2) Page 5, clause 11, proposed subsection 9a (2), line 31, leave out ``Where,'' insert ``Subject to subsection (3), where''. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Page 5, clause 11, after proposed subsection 9a (2), add the following new subsection:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(3) For the purposes of paragraphs 26a (1) (d) and (e), and subject to section 26b, a beneficiary under the terms of a trust who is either a natural person not ordinarily resident in Australia, or a foreign corporation, shall not be taken to hold a beneficial interest in the income of corpus of the trust estate except to the extent to which the beneficiary has an absolute entitlement to all or any of such income or corpus.''</PARA>
<PARA>Amendment No. 12 relates to amendment No. 3, but both amendments deal with separate clauses in the Bill. A number of points need to be brought out which are quite complicated, and I will try to deal with them as quickly as possible so as not to delay the Committee. Clause 11 of the Bill sets down the circumstances in which trusts and corporations will be required to report to the Treasurer transactions which involve foreigners. The first category, which is set down in proposed new section 9a (1), relates to what are commonly known as the general property and ordinary equity trusts available to people on the financial markets. They are the kinds of trusts which people are investing in every day and which people have some familiarity with. To all intents of the word, they are the kinds of trusts that deal extensively in property, in the share market and in other financial markets in Australia and have literally thousands of shareholders or beneficiaries, depending upon the form in which they have been established. The assets which they hold are identifiable and Australian located. </PARA>
<PARA> However, some of the beneficiaries and shareholders of such extensive companies and trusts may live overseas. As a result, clause 11 requires the trustees and corporate managers of those trusts and companies to report to the Treasurer in the event of those people being located. In the cases I have just outlined this clause sets down a description of a substantial interest-that is, when a foreigner holds more than 15 per cent of the corpus or the income of a trust estate or, in the case of two or more foreigners, they own more than 40 per cent of the corpus or income of a company or trust, the transaction is reportable. We are quite happy with that so far. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us turn to a discretionary trust, which is dealt with in subclause (2) of clause 11. A different set of circumstances apply. Generally speaking, it is not a large trust. It does not cover literally thousands of beneficiaries or shareholders; rather, it covers only a relatively small number. But that number in itself might be sufficiently large for there to be no direct personal contact between the trustee and the beneficiaries or shareholders. In other words, it could still be, quite clearly, an arm's length arrangement in such a discretionary trust without there being the normal family relationship-as we understand it in this country with domestic trusts-between shareholders and beneficiaries. So that degree of arm's length relationship in a discretionary trust is the reason I have moved amendment No. 3. This is really set down in amendment No. 12 but, as I have mentioned, the two are closely related and have to be read together. That amendment seeks to introduce into a discretionary type trust the same requirement that the Government has included in this Bill as applying to normal or general type trusts. </PARA>
<PARA> As we understand it, a discretionary trust is one where the trustees have a discretion to nominate the corpus or the income of the trust in favour of any of the beneficiaries, either to the exclusion of some or to be distributed equitably amongst all of them. That is a matter of pure discretion in the trust deed setting up the trust in the first place. The amendment, therefore, is designed to lift from the shoulders of the trustee in that situation the very onerous conditions, sanctions and penalties that are imposed by the legislation where that person may unwittingly distribute corpus or income to persons who are beneficiaries of the trust but who live overseas and the fact that they live overseas is not known to the trustee. This is designed as a means of ensuring that the law is not used in such a way as to penalise what might be regarded as purely innocent situations where the residence of those beneficiaries is not known. I think a moment's thought would lead us quite clearly to the conclusion that it is impossible to identify who those beneficiaries might be if they are overseas. For instance, we do not know whether the beneficiary--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Walsh" NAMEID="TJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is opening up a loophole to enable the legislation to be avoided.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am just coming to that point. The Minister has made the point that, unless the people who live overseas declare that they are overseas residents, quite clearly it will render his legislation impossible to administer. Unless that fact is known it will not be easy for a trustee to make a decision about whether the Treasurer should be notified in those circumstances. I imagine that it would be quite a simple exercise for any beneficiary living overseas who wished to avoid the effects of this legislation to keep his or her place of residence unknown to the Australian authorities and to set up a nominee situation on the mainland and, in that way, go without detection. I know that there are tracing provisions and what have you within the legislation. However, compliance can still be avoided if a person is of a mind to break the law in that sense and evade totally the effect of the legislation. The legislation is defective, notwithstanding the fact that we do not have much truck with the general principle of it. Because of the conditions which the legislation seeks to impose upon the trustees or managers of corporations managing these kinds of discretionary trusts it means they could be unfairly charged under the penalty sections of the law and in that way could find themselves in a most onerous situation. The purpose of the amendment is to remove that draconian condition imposed by the Government's Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we seek to do is to introduce into the conditions surrounding the discretionary trust arrangements the same conditions as apply to general trusts so that, in the event of a beneficiary having a 15 per cent interest at least, which is identified, or in the case of multiple beneficiaries 40 per cent of the corpus and income, it would be reported by the trustee. That is the term that we seek to incorporate in the Bill to remove what I regard as the most onerous conditions upon discretionary trustees-even the most minimal potential beneficiaries of a trust-who would simply be placed in a position in which they might unwittingly breach the law and suffer enormous penalties as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate my earlier point: this legislation is a bit of a nonsense. If a person living overseas wishes to keep his place of residence or nationality from the Australian authorities and not declare that, obviously he will avoid the impact of the legislation. No doubt there are many ways in which that could be undertaken. So the penalties which are imposed against trustees in either of the circumstances about which I have just spoken are quite silly because we would penalise a trustee for declaring, or not declaring, interest to the Treasurer, but unless it is made known to him by beneficiaries who live overseas that they do in fact live overseas, the trustee is in an impossible position to report to the Treasurer. That is the basic vice of the Bill. It is a huge loophole through which one could drive a horse and cart. We seek to make the Government's Bill rather fairer in regard to the actions and activities of trustees in a discretionary trust as distinct from the other better known type. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although Senator Messner did not mention it, the Opposition's amendments appear to be based on correspondence circulated to a number of members of parliament from Mr Liebler in Melbourne. Mr Liebler has conceded that the inclusion of provisions dealing with the acquisition of interests in Australian urban land by means of discretionary trusts is essential to prevent the easy circumvention of the Government's controls. Two approaches can be taken. The first, as Mr Liebler suggests and as the Opposition has picked up in its amendments, is to wait and see what happens; that is, wait until the discretion has been exercised in favour of a foreigner to a greater extent than the legislation permits. The trouble with that is that by that time it is too late. It is the old approach of locking the stable door after the horse has bolted. I do not think that I need say any more about it, other than what I said by way of interjection; that is, the Opposition's amendments, if carried, would open up a loophole so big that it would effectively gut the purpose of the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (b) took all reasonable action that a prudent trustee in the same circumstances would take to obtain honest and accurate responses to those notices before entering the agreement.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The legislation currently places new reporting responsibilities on property trust managers but it falls down in one fairly significant point. It does not provide them with the powers that will enable them to comply with these responsibilities. While we believe that it is appropriate to introduce sanctions against trust managers if they avoid their responsibilities, those sanctions cannot be applied fairly unless there are powers which would enable the managers to comply with the requirements of the legislation. Managers of property trusts simply are not in a position a lot of the time to know whether investors are foreign residents or investing on behalf of foreign residents unless they are able to obtain information as to the beneficial ownership of the shares or units. The other obvious way they can do it is if they are in possession of second sight. However, most are not and I think it is a bit unreasonable to expect the managers themselves to bear entirely the onus of that responsibility of reporting. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment is designed to provide trust managers with the ability to meet the notification requirements established in proposed section 26a of the legislation. The manner of getting the information which will facilitate compliance is modelled on section 261 of the Companies Act 1981. It is not something unique. It will provide companies with the ability to obtain information as to who ultimately has the beneficial ownership of the shares. That is important given the nature of the sanctions for non-compliance, which are a fine of up to $50,000 and/or imprisonment of up to two years for a person and a fine of up to a quarter of a million dollars in the case of a corporation. The Australian Democrats' amendment will impose these sanctions for non-compliance on the investor before imposing them on the managers of the trust. It seems to us that there is no point in asking investors to disclose whether they are acting on behalf of foreign investors if there is no penalty for their non-compliance. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the legislation before us there is a new responsibility on property trust managers with a sanction attached, but no power is given to the property trust managers to comply satisfactorily with the requirement of the legislation. There would be no point in amending the legislation to require information to be passed on from the investor to the manager unless there was a concomitant sanction. So, given that at the moment, as the Building Owners and Managers Association has indicated to us, there is a problem facing managers, I hope that either the Government or the Opposition would see fit to support an amendment which, in essence, and according to the managers themselves, who are concerned about this matter, would give managers the power to comply with the legislation. </PARA>

I suppose that it is a matter for judgment as to whether it is a good idea on policy grounds to have dropped, effectively, the present section 261 of the Companies Act. The Parliament has yet to make a judgment on that. But if this amendment were carried, it would to some extent bring back, through the back door, section 261 of the existing Companies Act. If there is a case for a provision equivalent to the present section 261, it ought to be done through inserting such a provision in the Companies Code and not through foreign takeovers legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendment, I am also advised, has implications for the Commonwealth's obligations under the formal agreement establishing the cooperative scheme. Such changes should be raised with the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the amendment is to provide a mechanism whereby trusts could ascertain the ultimate ownership of unit holders, presumably so that they can then determine whether the aggregate foreign ownership exceeds 40 per cent. The Government has received advice from the Unit Trust Association that foreign ownership of most public property trusts in Australia is quite low and that most managers have quite a good idea of the extent of foreign ownership. If a foreigner or an associate of a foreigner buys more than 15 per cent of the units in a trust, notification to the Government and approval by the Government will be necessary under the foreign takeovers legislation. I do not think I need to say any more, other than that I am pleased that the Opposition, having been superficially attracted to this amendment, has examined it further and decided that it was not worth supporting. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Michael Baume says, the Senate can bank on that process continuing each week until such time as the Parliament has adequately addressed the challenges inherent in these very serious allegations. I think the Senate is aware that to date I have done the following things: on 8 December I made a statement in which I passed on to the Senate from constituents a number of very serious allegations of malpractice in banks; I posed a number of questions to the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) and he responded. That process was repeated on 15 December and then again on 15 December I tabled the first of a series of affidavits in relation to this issue, namely, seven affidavits in relation to six allegations of corrupt practices within the Commonwealth Bank. On 2 March I built upon that process by making a further statement and tabling another 20 affidavits in relation to 27 cases which extended beyond the Commonwealth Bank to the banking system at large and those 27 cases, which extended the total number now before the Senate to 35, related to three aspects of alleged corrupt practices in banks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The dimensions therefore are threefold. There are allegations relating to targeting and asset stripping, allegations relating to matters of foreign exchange loans and questions of premature foreclosure on rural properties. These are extremely serious allegations and I gave notice on 2 March to refer the matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. It was my intention to bring that referral to debate yesterday. However, subsequent to giving notice on 2 March, I have had quite extensive discussions with the Minister for Justice and also with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow Treasurer, Mr Andrew Peacock, and I have been urged to defer that debate until 5 April. I advise the Senate that that debate will be brought on on 5 April, the proposition being that the whole question of allegations against banks of malpractice and corrupt practices be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. That will now be decided on 5 April. </PARA>
<PARA> There has, of course, been a great deal of media attention as a result of the allegations being placed before the Senate and my call for referral to the Senate Standing Committee. As one would have anticipated, the allegations have been denied, initially by the Managing Director of the Commonwealth Bank, Mr Don Sanders, and subsequently by the President of the Australian Association of Bankers, Mr Allan Cullen. I think it was totally predictable that those denials would be forthcoming. It has been stated by both Mr Sanders and Mr Cullen that the Australian Federal Police and the Commonwealth Bank have done a thorough investigation into those allegations and that they are unsubstantiated. I stand by my decision to table the allegations. I do not believe that the examination that occurred between 15 December and 2 March was in any way substantial. Indeed, on 2 March I contacted all six people who were associated with the original affidavits and asked them whether they had, in fact, in the interim period been contacted by either the Commonwealth Bank or the Federal Police and the answer in all cases was no. Whether Mr Sanders and Mr Cullen regard that as a thorough investigation warranting the rejection of the allegations, when the people who have tabled the allegations have not even been approached, I certainly do not. </PARA>
<PARA> For Mr Cullen to say publicly that there is no corruption in banking, and dismiss the matter as superficially as that, is about as credible as my saying that there is no corruption in politics, or Commissioner Lewis's saying that there is no corruption in police forces. It is simply not adequate for the Association of Bankers to believe that the allegations can be dispensed with and dismissed superficially at that level. Certainly, it does not satisfy me that he and Mr Sanders have responded in such a manner. These allegations are very serious indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that claims by the Government and the police that investigations have revealed no criminality do not mean that there was no deception or corruption. The royal commissions by Fitzgerald, Costigan, Moffitt, Woodward, Williams and Stewart all arose because of police inability to lay charges, but charges resulted from all those commissions and investigations. For example, 12 bank managers either lost their jobs or were charged as a result of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. Double dealing by banks and financial institutions was also exposed by the Woodward Royal Commission into Drug Trafficking and by the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking. So, to say initially that governments do not believe, or the police do not believe, that charges can be laid does not for one minute suggest that these are not matters that should be pursued. In fact, recent history of the process of public investigation would suggest that such initial statements carry little weight at all; and they certainly carry little weight with those of us in this chamber who are determined to pursue these allegations of corrupt practices among the nation's bankers. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, these allegations strike at the very heart of the most powerful institution in the country. We, of course, are not in the slightest bit surprised that the allegations have been initially denied by that institution. That was totally predictable, but it is no reason why we should be deflected from the process which we have begun. The major parties have undertaken to consider this matter. As I said, I have spoken to the Minister, and I have spoken to the shadow Treasurer, and I am convinced that they now regard these allegations as very serious-not something that, en passant, was introduced to the Senate as a game play between the Australian Democrats and the Government. It was not that at all. These are serious, profound allegations that have been brought to me, as an elected representative, by my constituents and I am honour bound to present them to this chamber and to the Minister. That I have done, and that I will continue to do. </PARA>
<PARA> In the interim, in the period between now and 5 April, I expect that the media will pay a great deal more attention to the question of allegations of corrupt practices among bankers. I am advised that one member of the Labor Caucus is intending to raise in Caucus other aspects of banking, which he believes are worthy of attention. I believe that the Minister will carry these allegations to the Caucus, so the Government will give serious deliberation to its position. I am also assured that the Opposition will give equally serious consideration to its position before my proposal to refer the matter, initially at least, to the Senate Standing Committee comes before the chamber on 5 April. I think it is appropriate that the media continues to give this matter very serious attention. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also told that there are likely to be a number of public meetings and strategy meetings in relation to these matters. I know that an association has been formed among those who were caught up in the foreign exchange dealing scam and there is now a foreign exchange borrowers association. Indeed, I spoke with the executive director of that association in my office this morning and certainly its members are deliberating further over what they should do. The Senate is probably aware that some 500 Australians were enticed into extraordinary situations by their banks, that more than 500 Australians are now pleading bankruptcy on the basis of advice from their banks which they believe was questionable, and that one lawyer alone in New South Wales, Paul Galli, has pursued 300 cases in that area in the past two years. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the 35 cases that I have now tabled in the Senate relating to these allegations, about 12 are before supreme courts in terms of the civil dimension. Even though we might be told by the Australian Federal Police that they have not found any grounds for criminal action, certainly a number of people have considered the matter seriously enough to pursue civil actions in supreme courts and one of them even in the High Court of Australia to clear up a technicality before he can return to the Federal Court of Australia to keep his business alive. The sad thing is that many of the people who allege to be victims of these scams not only have been broken financially, but also have been broken emotionally, maritally and domestically. In some cases their health has been broken as well. I have no choice but to pursue this matter as vigorously as possible. In an attempt to put the maximum amount of credible information before the major parties in their deliberations over the next three weeks, I seek leave, further to my previous tablings, to table today relevant documents relating to allegations by Mr John Salmon against the National Australia Bank Ltd and by Mr Michael Ryssenbeek against the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to deliver a statement to the Senate today on behalf of the people of Tibet to mark the thirtieth anniversary of their uprising. That anniversary will occur tomorrow, 10 March 1989. This is a plea to the Senate and fellow citizens of Australia for help. As we sit here, another part of the unique heritage, which is our collective planet, lies dying. After 40 years of Chinese occupation of an independent country, Tibet, it seems that its people must still resort to desperate and heroic protests against overwhelming and unbeatable odds in order to be heard by a largely uncaring world. Recent protests in the capital, Lhasa, and everywhere in Tibet say clearly, `Leave us to govern ourselves or let us die'. Since the uprising on 10 March 1959, 1.2 million Tibetans-more than one-sixth of the entire population-have perished and many thousands more followed the Dalai Lama, the former political and current spiritual leader of Tibet, into exile in India. The International Commission of Jurists has recognised that the Chinese practised genocide against the Tibetan nation and the United Nations General Assembly has passed three motions condemning China's human rights abuses in Tibet. A generation of people has grown up in exile speaking Tibetan, born of Tibetan parents and with a Tibetan cultural heritage, yet never having seen their own country. They have no country and no passport and our definition does not enable them to be classified `refugees'. Yet their life and welcome in India and Nepal are highly precarious.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today, after 30 years of savage repression, the remnants of the Tibetan people inside Tibet demonstrate popular and spontaneous opposition to their oppressors-the People's Republic of China. In 1949 Mao Tse Tung sent troops to liberate Tibet from feudal theocracy. His Holiness, the fourteenth Dalai Lama, was the first to thank them for waking the sleepy and reticent Tibetan people and their former government to the realities of the twentieth century. His predecessor had founded English medium schools, an army, introduced land reforms and attempted to abolish feudal anachronisms. He died urging his country to modernise or face the threat of invasion and domination. The present Dalai Lama has publicly renounced any theocratic right to govern Tibet and around 1960 promulgated a democratic constitution. Last year he ceded to China control of all foreign policy issues concerning Tibet. Many Tibetan people are very unhappy with his compromise suggestion. In return, he has urged the Chinese to remove their military presence and pass the internal running of the country back to the Tibetans. </PARA>
<PARA> For 2,000 years Tibet has been a nation, despite periods when its neighbours-Mongols, Manchurians, Chinese, British and Nepalese-sought to establish influence over the country. On other occasions, Tibetan rulers conquered vast areas of China and other states. They do not lay claim to these territories today. Tibetans, by virtue of their unique way of life and underlying spiritual philosophy, are and for centuries have been peaceful, fun loving, hard working, happy and friendly people. Therefore, it is only extreme and prolonged provocation which leads to such hopeless gestures as the present uprising. The young have never known a free Tibet. Their only hope can be that the rest of the world may hear their plea and urge China to negotiate genuinely for peace in a neutral country with the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government in exile. Their only hope is that we speak up against the continuing violation of personal liberty and freedom to hold different beliefs. </PARA>
<PARA> A week before his death the Panchen Lama-China's representative in Tibetan affairs; formerly for 12 years a political prisoner tortured in Beijing-spoke out against the excesses of the Chinese occupation of Tibet. Thousands of monastries, cultural objects, priceless ancient books and art work containing unique medical and religious records have been destroyed. He stated that the price Tibet had paid over the past 30 years was too great. We pay tribute to the man, who himself paid an awful price in his intermediary role between China and Tibet, and who, just before his sudden death, dared to voice his criticisms. </PARA>
<PARA> These abuses have not ended. Nazi Germany did not oppress its victims for so long-30 years. Documented ongoing human rights violations by the Chinese authorities in Tibet include enforced abortion and mass sterilisation, prolonged detention without trial and torture of political prisoners, continued vigilance by secret police and `listeners' which produces an undercurrent of daily fear and distrust and the introduction of huge numbers of Han Chinese into the country until they have almost outnumbered ethnic Tibetans in their own land. Continuing environmental abuses involve deforestation of the huge pine forests in Amdo. These take 20 years to regenerate because of soil and climate. There has also been mining of uranium and other minerals in locations of spiritual significance in the face of local protests. Also, there have been nuclear tests-the British Broadcasting Corporation's World Service on 8 October 1988 reported that China had conducted its second underground nuclear test since 1984 in north-east Tibet-and the dumping of nuclear waste. With all this provocation the moderation and goodwill of the Dalai Lama's recent five-point proposal for a zone of peace in Tibet is remarkable. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the urgency of the present situation I wish to read the Dalai Lama's message to the people of the world on the thirtieth anniversary of the Tibetan people's earlier uprising-incorrectly termed rebellion by the Chinese-on 10 March 1959. This is the statement of His Holiness, the Dalai Lama:</PARA>
<PARA> Today, we pay special tribute to the courage and determination of the Tibetan people, so many of whom have given their lives for our just and noble cause. The suffering our people have been subjected to during these decades mark the darkest period in our long history. </PARA>
<PARA> The struggle of the Tibetan people is a struggle for our inalienable right to determine our own destiny in freedom. It is a struggle for democracy, human rights and peace. Most of all, it is a struggle for survival as a people and a nation with a unique civilisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Lhasa uprising of 1987 has greatly stirred the people throughout Tibet. Despite the peaceful nature of this and other demonstrations that have taken place since then, many people have been confirmed killed, and many more arrested. The loss of innocent lives saddens us very much. We not only honour these brave men, women and children today, but also the over one million Tibetans who have died as a result of Chinese occupation. No amount of repression, however brutal and violent, can silence the voice of freedom and justice. The frequent peaceful demonstrations which have taken place spontaneously throughout Tibet over the past years are clear indications of a much larger problem. Unfortunately the Chinese leadership still fails to understand the real situation in Tibet and the extent of dissatisfaction among the Tibetan people. In his last public statement before his untimely and sad demise, Panchen Rinpoche expressed the people's feeling when he said that the price that the Tibetans have had to pay under Chinese rule has been far higher than any benefits they may have gained. </PARA>
<PARA> Ours is a non-violent struggle and it must remain so. The killing, imprisonment and torture of peaceful demonstrators or persons who express unsanctioned opinions is morally reprehensible and a violation of human rights as internationally recognised. It can never be justified no matter where in the world it occurs. The condemnation by the international community of these actions will, we hope, persuade the Chinese to abandon such methods. The United Nations General Assembly passed three resolutions condemning China's human rights abuses in Tibet. At this time, when the United Nations is increasingly effective in fulfilling its mission in various parts of the world, I call on the international community to urge the implementation of these three resolutions. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take this opportunity to express our deep sense of gratitude to the countless people who have voiced concern and expressed solidarity with our people at this critical time. We are also grateful for the conscientious reporting by visitors to Tibet of what they have seen and experienced there. </PARA>
<PARA> I am encouraged by the support we have received to our initiative to find a peaceful and just solution to the tragic situation of Tibet. In September of 1987, I presented a Five Point Peace Plan for the restoration of peace and human rights in Tibet. Then, in June of last year I formulated further thoughts that could service a framework for substantive negotiations with the Chinese on the future of Tibet. The Chinese Government has agreed to hold negotiations with us and left the venue and time for such negotiations to me to choose. Although I proposed that the negotiations should start in January in Geneva, the Chinese have, for one reason or another, delayed commencement of the talks. Nevertheless, as the Chinese have, unlike before, become more realistic these days I remain hopeful that the Chinese leaders will see the wisdom of resolving the issue peacefully, by negotiation. I firmly believe a resolution based on the framework proposed by us will not only benefit both the Tibetan and the Chinese peoples, but will also contribute to regional and global peace and stability. </PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of the deep-felt disappointment of many Tibetans on the stand we have taken in Strasbourg. As I have stated before, the final decision will be left to the Tibetan people themselves to take. </PARA>
<PARA> I have always believed that human determination and truth will ultimately prevail over violence and oppression. Today, important changes are taking place everywhere in the world which could profoundly affect our future and the future of all humanity and the planet we share. Courageous moves by world leaders have facilitated the peaceful resolution of conflicts. Hopes for peace, for the environment, and for a more humane approach to world problems seem greater than ever before. It is imperative that we Tibetans intensify our modest contributions to these changes through our endeavours, both inside Tibet and in exile, for the advancement of freedom, democracy and peace. </PARA>
<PARA> With my prayers for the well-being of all sentient beings. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the end of the Dalai Lama's statement to mark the thirtieth anniversary of the Tibetan national uprising. I endorse his statement and feel that it is very important that people outside Tibet take note of the violations of human rights which have been occurring there for so long and I think that we should give every support to the Tibetan people in their search for independence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women that, in a quite desperate attempt to defend the Hawke Government's failed housing policies yesterday, she resorted to playing politics and accused the Queensland State Government of not having a proper commitment to public housing. She said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I would be interested to look at waiting lists on a State by State basis and compare them accordingly to the politics and the commitment of the government concerned.</PARA>
<PARA>I thank the Minister for that suggestion, which I took up, and ask whether she is aware that between 1983 and 1987-according to the latest figures which are available from the Parliamentary Library, as supplied by the Department of Community Services and Health which, coincidentally, relate to the period of a Labor government in New South Wales-the numbers on State housing waiting lists for rental accommodation increased by 9,000 or 18 per cent in New South Wales; more than 15,500 or 54 per cent in South Australia; more than 5,000 or 63 per cent in Western Australia; and more than 12,000 or 70 per cent in Victoria. They are, of course, Labor States. There was an increase in Tasmania of 503, or 13 per cent. Is the Minister further aware that the waiting lists fell by more than 1,000 or 10 per cent in Queensland and by 142 or about 4 per cent in the Northern Territory? Does the Minister agree that the States with Labor governments have atrocious records in public housing and that in South Australia, Western Australia and Victoria waiting lists have increased by four or five times as much as in the only non-Labor State where waiting lists rose at all? Finally, will she now apologise for misleading the Senate yesterday by her totally false accusation about Queensland's record on public housing, where the figures show that waiting list numbers have actually fallen?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator REYNOLDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Chaney. He has obviously done his homework. I said I would be interested to know the figures. Senator Chaney has produced some figures which I obviously will check with my colleague in the other place, Mr Peter Staples. The Government has attached a high priority to the provision of funding for public housing and the elimination of housing-related poverty. The level of Federal funding for public housing, including concessional Loan Council funding, was doubled in real terms in the five years to 1987-88 compared to the previous five years to 1982-83. In 1988-89, despite severe Budget constraints, the same level of funding was made available for public housing as in 1987-88. Waiting lists have increased. However, this is not an accurate reflection of the Federal effort in the area of public housing since 1983. The rental stock increased by 70,000 in the five years to 1987-88 compared with 40,000 in the previous five years. Public rental allocations in 1987-88 were 47,000; that is 38 per cent higher than in 1982-83.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The States have not matched the quality of the Federal effort for public housing. In contrast to Federal grant funding provided through the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, State funding directed to public rental housing through the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement matching requirements has largely been a combination of borrowings and internal funds, with little grant funding. In 1987-88, for instance, the Federal Government provided $700m in direct grant funding through the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, while the States and the Northern Territory provided a total of around $250m in grants and other non-repayable funding.</PARA>
<PARA> I thank Senator Chaney for the figures he has given me which obviously I will check. Perhaps on occasions, as Senator Boswell has indicated, I have a tendency to be a little harsh on Queensland, but having lived in Queensland for 20 years I am well aware of its deficiencies in regard to social policy. If, when I check these figures, I find that I have misjudged the Queensland Government in regard to its commitment to housing I will certainly apologise. But I would want to check the figures and to take advice from my colleague Mr Peter Staples, who has primary responsibility for housing.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first thing I should say is that at the very front of the application form for a grant of Australian citizenship there is a boxed section that refers to the fee. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A fee is payable at the time of application. Please check your eligibility carefully particularly that you have been present in Australia for the required period of time. If in doubt check with the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. The fee is not refundable.</PARA>
<PARA>Notwithstanding that statement, I must say that, had I rolled up, paid my $35 and then found that I had missed by two days I would be somewhat aggrieved by the fact that the fee could not be refunded. One of the difficulties we face is that sometimes the fee is not collected by the person processing the application form at the front counter and therefore the application is not checked before the fee is paid.</PARA>
<PARA> We have very little scope for action in this area because the legislation on the grant of citizenship is very inflexible in this regard. The Australian Citizenship Act states that, to be eligible, a person must have lived in Australia as a permanent resident for 12 months in the preceding two years and two years in the five years immediately prior to making application. `Application' is defined as being `receipt of the prescribed form and fee'. My Department's staff are instructed to check applications carefully and advise those who will not qualify to lodge their forms and fees after they have qualified. Nevertheless, some unfortunately slip through and fees are collected for applications which are subsequently found to be ineligible. In addition, many forms and fees come through the post, making it impossible for us to check them in advance.</PARA>
<PARA> Finance regulations prevent the reimbursement of fees. The Citizenship Act does, however, permit me to exempt fees in certain circumstances. In recognition of the significance of the Year of Citizenship, I have decided that those people who have had applications rejected because of the length of residence requirement shall be exempted from the $35 fee for their subsequent application, provided that it is made within three months of their becoming eligible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. I refer the Minister to his statement yesterday on allegations that the member for Leichhardt, Mr Gayler, told the Chairman of the Queensland Aboriginal Coordinating Council that his press release against the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, requesting a meeting with the Prime Minister, would see his Hopevale community financially penalised and that Mr Gayler would tell Mr Hawke not to meet with representatives from the Aboriginal Coordinating Council. The Minister will remember that he referred yesterday to a press release issued by Mr Gayler which quotes him as saying, `Nor have I indicated to Mr Gibson, the Chairman of the Aboriginal Coordinating Council, that I would advise the Prime Minister not to speak with the Council'. How does that statement sit with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's radio report on 20 January 1989 to the effect that `the Prime Minister has been told by his own Party's Aboriginal Affairs Committee not to meet Queensland Aboriginals to discuss the proposed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. The Committee Chairman, Mr John Gayler, says calls for a meeting have been orchestrated', and Mr Gayler's comment on the same day in the Cairns Post that he would advise Mr Hawke to reject the Aboriginal Coordinating Council request for a meeting?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator McKiernan for his question as it enables me to welcome this move and to indicate that the Government is very pleased with Woodside's announcement yesterday that it is committed to the construction of a third process train on the North West Shelf. The contract for it is valued at $900m, which in anyone's language is a substantial commitment to a project. This train is the final phase needed to enable the project to meet contract commitments to supply nearly six million tonnes of liquefied natural gas a year to Japan. The contract is due to commence on 1 October this year through to the year 2009. The work on the North West Shelf has been going so well that it could be as early as 1 July that the first LNG shipment is made from Australia to Japan, several months ahead of the scheduled date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It should be remembered by Australians that the total capital costs of the North West Shelf amount to $12 billion. It is Australia's biggest ever single resource project and, by world standards, is arguably the biggest resource project in the world at present. Phase one of the project was to supply natural gas by pipeline to the State Energy Commission of Western Australia-for domestic and commercial consumption in and around Perth. Phase one is operational. Phase two is to supply LNG to Japan from 1989 to the year 2009, as I have said. That is ahead of schedule. The third train is an element in that process.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator McKiernan asked what the expected advantage may be from this contract to Australian industry. To date around 72 per cent of capital investment on this project has been expended in Australia. The participants in the North West Shelf joint venturers expect to maintain that in terms of the third train. I believe it demonstrates an ability by Australian contractors to compete on the international stage for a major world development of this sort in a way in which they are competitive and can on their own terms win major contracts.</PARA>
<PARA> My final comment is that at the end of January I had the privilege of attending the joint ministerial council meeting in Japan with Senators Richardson, Button and Gareth Evans. The Japanese themselves have expressed considerable interest and pleasure in the development of the North West Shelf project. Once the exports commence, we will be exporting about what is equal to a third of our total coal exports to Japan now or what amounts to 140,000 barrels of oil a day in terms of value. Japan as our major market has revised, or is in process of revising, its energy consumption needs upwards. In terms of the energy mix, because of concern in Japan about nuclear energy and the greenhouse effect, LNG has been identified in the energy mix as the major component which is to be the expanding fuel input for its future economic development.</PARA>
<PARA> I was recently in Indonesia which is the world's largest exporter of LNG at present. In my talks with the Indonesian oil Minister, Mr Ginandjar, we established between Australia and Indonesia a high level energy and minerals consultative group. This will enable us to become more familiar with major developments in the world LNG market. I repeat that I welcome this announcement by Woodside, and look forward to the as yet unmade decision about a second platform at Goodwyn being made shortly. I hope that it turns out in the same way as this one has turned out.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been asked whether I can explain why somebody would lose $4,000. The answer is no, I cannot explain it, because they will not lose the $4,000 anyway. The premises underlying Senator Haines's question are false. I will explain why they will not lose it. The figures that are used assume an effective earnings rate of 15 per cent within the approved deposit fund (ADF) into which the question suggests the lump sum would be paid. If rolled over into an ADF, there is no lump sum payable at that time. Approved deposit funds can reduce the effective tax rate, first, by gaining imputation credits from investment in shares and, secondly, through the concessional taxation of capital gains on property where only the real gain is subject to tax. The Government is monitoring the extent to which funds reorganised their asset portfolios to reduce the effective earnings tax rate below the 15 per cent nominal rate. The present industry average, I am told, implies an effective earnings tax rate of about 4 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to Senator Haines's hypothetical constituent, and I say `hypothetical' because I doubt whether any approved deposit fund would not have some reorganisation of its investment portfolio and therefore not be paying the effective maximum tax rate of 15 per cent and losing the $4,000 that Senator Haines asserts. After tax, on the basis of her hypothetical calculation, the reduction in benefit would be $1,484, assuming retirement on 31 December 1988, because at the end of the five-year period the lump sum tax rate will be lower. Using the implied industry average effective earnings tax rate of 4 per cent, the real constituent would be $1,425 better off. That is the calculation to that stage. People with fewer years of pre-1983 service would be proportionately better off. Even using Senator Haines's hypothetical 15 per cent earnings tax, a person with no pre-1983 service would be $10,716 better off. Using the present industry average of 4 per cent, that amount would grow to about $13,626.</PARA>
<PARA> I assume that the constituent to whom Senator Haines refers resides in the electorate of Kingston. If so, and if Senator Haines is going to oppose the proposed changes to superannuation taxation arrangements, I trust that she will make clear to that constituent the reason why she wants to make the constituent $13,600-odd worse off.</PARA>

It is not; it is rolled over into an approved deposit fund. No lump sum tax is levied at that time.

Is it a fact that the Cass report is one of a series of papers, published by the Social Security Review, to promote public discussion about the best way of developing a national retirement incomes policy?

Does it display gross ignorance on the part of this temporary member of the Queensland Parliament?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite apparent, from the reports that I have seen, that Mr Gately is ignorant of parliamentary processes and procedures in seeking openly and deliberately to mislead and confuse Queensland pensioners on a very basic and important issue. It is quite clear that the Issues Paper No. 6 referred to by Mr Gately, entitled `Towards a National Retirement Incomes Policy', is not a statement of government policy. While some may think that the title of the issues paper may give the game away, it is obvious that Mr Gately has not been deluded by such a title.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Everyone, both on this side of the House and on the other side, knows that the Social Security Review was set up in 1986 to review social security policy and to develop options for future reform. It is quite apparent, therefore, that Mr Gately has been quite befuddled for about three years about this basic fact. Given that there have been five issues papers issued before this one, he also feels that maybe some of his colleagues have been missing some wonderful opportunities for deliberate misleading and confusion.</PARA>
<PARA> I therefore welcome the opportunity which Senator Colston gives me to set Mr Gately straight. I ask that he pay attention to the report and to the contents of it. The unequivocal purpose and intent of the most recent issues paper would be even clearer to Mr Gately if he were to open the first few pages of it. The preface to the report is very clear, clear enough for even a member of the Queensland National Party to understand. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Issues Paper is to generate widespread debate and invite widespread responses from community organisations and interested individuals. Issues of concern for older people have been identified and various directions for reforms proposed.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, this paper, like the others, is geared towards developing options for government and for future reform. It is also apparent that, even if Mr Gately has been somewhat bamboozled by the purpose of the report, pensioners and older people in Australia have not been. There have already been thousands of pensioners across the country who have attended meetings and participated in discussions as part of the Prime Minister's task force into retirement policies. They have discussed with the task force the Cass paper and passed on their thoughts, options and responses to the Government. Senator Colston knows this fact extremely well, because he has hosted two quite successful and valuable meetings with pensioners in Queensland, both of which raised relevant and valuable points.</PARA>
<PARA> It is quite apparent that on this issue Senator Colston is spot-on and Mr Gately is wrong. Details of this Government's retirement incomes policy-which, unlike the Opposition's policy, will be equitable, fair, just and sustainable-will be released in the middle of this year. At that stage, I am sure Mr Gately will have an opportunity to find out what our policies really are.</PARA>

What action is the Government planning to take to address this criticism?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="751" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note the current and long term interest of Senator Zakharov on issues such as product safety. Her question implies, and the article and the television program that she referred to indicate, that there has been some criticism of sunglasses sold in Australia. I should say at the outset that that criticism is somewhat off target. The question of standards for sunglasses in Australia has been on the agenda of this Government for about four years now. In 1985 we introduced one of the most rigorous standards for sunglasses in the world. That standard is currently being revised and I hope some time later this year to be able to update it. The standard was introduced under the Trade Practices Act and applies to sunglasses and fashion spectacles, all of which are made or manufactured in Australia or were imported into Australia after 1 November 1985. The standard also had a number of variations which accommodated some of the existing glasses but did not at all go to the question of safety of sunglasses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Choice article makes two complaints: firstly, that there has been a failure to comply with the standard and, secondly, that there has been a failure to label adequately. In respect of the second point, there is no requirement at the moment for labelling in the way that the Choice article suggests that the standard has been breached. In respect of the first point, the failure to comply, it should be noted that in no case since 1985 has the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs found a breach of the most critical safety requirement of the sunglasses standard; that is, the requirement on ultraviolet transmission. It is fair to say that that is the most critical part of the standard; it is the part which would affect consumers if it were not conformed with. Some of the failures that I have mentioned go to the less critical requirements of the standard; some go to a misunderstanding of the variations and the totality of the standard that was introduced in 1985; and some, I suspect, go to the products that were imported into Australia or made here before November 1985.</PARA>
<PARA> The Investigators report also suffers from one basic deficiency. It argued that there was a need for protection from ultraviolet radiation and also called for labelling. In respect of the protection from ultraviolet radiation, ultraviolet transmission limits are imposed on all categories of sunglasses covered by the standard. As I said earlier on, in all cases investigated by the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs there has not been one instance of sunglasses identified as failing to meet the ultraviolet requirement; in fact, all have passed by very wide margins.</PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the outset, we have one of the most rigorous standards in the world. In view of national and international developments, we are looking at revising the standard. It is the intention of this Government to adopt the revised standard under the Trade Practices Act when that standard is developed. When reviewing the standard this year, we will be very closely investigating the whole question of a more comprehensive system of labelling sunglasses so that consumers can be directly aware of the sorts of glasses they buy at the time of purchase.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but we have made provision for 50. It depends on how many take it up. Obviously it is a voluntary matter. The fact is that there were other elements in the moneys sought in the Supplementary Estimates-for example, a new incentives package developed by the AFP to offset the cost of transfer of police to sensitive investigatory units based in Sydney. This will be a very important part of the use of those extra moneys and will help very considerably with the operations of the Australian Federal Police in that particularly sensitive post.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The investigation into the killing of Assistant Commissioner Col Winchester is a matter that is of profound interest and concern to the Government and to the community generally. When the resources that had to be devoted to that investigation were at full stretch, naturally the Commissioner sought, in the whole context of seeking considerably more funds for the Australian Federal Police, more moneys to cover that investigation. The fact is that we believe the Australian Federal Police has the capacity to absorb the cost of that operation within the moneys that are appropriated for their particular purposes. Indeed, I believe that it will be found at the end of the financial year that no major operational matters will be prejudiced by this particular budgetary decision and certainly the safety of members will not be prejudiced by these particular budgetary decisions.</PARA>
<PARA> There are tight budgetary controls being exercised within the Australian Federal Police, but I believe that the operational activities and members' safety, which are the key concerns, will not be prejudiced by this allocation of moneys. Indeed, the Government has shown its complete commitment to the Australian Federal Police in terms of the moneys sought in the Additional Estimates, which are very considerable and which will enable it to achieve its objectives not only in the Australian Capital Territory but throughout this nation as it becomes the major investigative agency of the Commonwealth in the law enforcement area.</PARA>

A new incentives package developed by the AFP to offset the cost of transfer of police to sensitive investigatory units based in Sydney has two components-salaries, $192,000; and administrative expenses, $408,000. As a result of the Federal Police Arbitral Tribunal broader salary structure, a number of positions were rationalised to streamline the force into a leaner, more efficient organisation. The additional estimate reflects the cost of redundancy offers resulting from the rationalisation. That amounts to $4,240,000. These are all parts of the restructuring of the Australian Federal Police which, of course, have a major impact on the operational activities of the Australian Federal Police.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the final year of the present triennium, which is 1991, expenditure on tertiary education will be almost $550m higher in real terms than it is now. Most of that increase will come from additional Budget outlays but a significant proportion will be raised by the higher education contribution scheme. Ultimately, students will be contributing around 20 per cent of the cost of their education through the HECS. In 1991 we expect that there will be about 400,000 students in the system. If we assume that 25 per cent of those students are exempt from HECS for reasons of scholarships, in order to get the $550m from the students, each of the remaining 300,000 students would have to pay an annual up-front fee of more than $1,800 a year; that is, if in that short period all the additional expenditure were to be raised from the 75 per cent of those students who would be liable to pay the HECS. All students, regardless of whether they were part time, full time, internal or external, receiving Austudy or not receiving Austudy, would have to pay more up front than is required through the higher education contribution scheme, the repayment of which is income contingent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has recently claimed that it can match the Government's commitment with a fee of $600. Mr Beale has guaranteed that the fee would not be increased, or even indexed, under a coalition government. Of course, that undertaking is incompatible with the Opposition's very vague undertakings that it will reduce government expenditure. There is a huge credibility gap. In current dollar terms the higher education contribution scheme will raise over $500m when it is fully operational. On the projected student numbers, the $600 fee proposed by the Opposition will raise about $170m. So it is easy to see that there is a credibility gap of the order of $300m or above-it is more like $350m-in this area alone of the Opposition's policy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose I have had a few inquiries of my office over the last couple of days as to whether Mr Stevenson is or is not an Australian citizen. I cannot give a definitive answer. I think that the queries were motivated by a report in the Canberra Times which suggested Mr Stevenson was born in Rhodesia. I believe Mr Stevenson has denied that. That was the reason, I think, that a great deal of media interest was sparked off. When we get such queries we do not answer them. Privacy has to be paramount. We do not answer them in a public sense. Certainly, they could be answered in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our search through our files would not indicate that Mr Stevenson is an Australian citizen, on the proviso that he came here from overseas. If he is Australian-born, nothing will show on my system. That system is never infallible when one checks for someone's citizenship. I suggest to the journalists and everyone else who has a great interest in this matter that they go to Mr Stevenson himself-not that he is the most forthcoming individual. He has not always declared all his associations in the past to allow the electorate to make a full and rational decision in their voting patterns.</PARA>
<PARA> Wearing my other hat, as Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, I should say that if Mr Stevenson were not an Australian citizen the whole Australian Capital Territory ballot would probably be invalid. It is quite different from the Wood case inasmuch as this is within the normal course of time for a Court of Disputed Returns. However, if anyone believes that any of the candidates were not eligible, the Court of Disputed Returns would be the best place in which to take up those matters at this stage. I would warn anyone against taking up a frivolous case. Sometimes it costs-as someone found the other day, unfortunately-$27,000. So it can be an expensive process.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of Senator Coulter's press release. No doubt honourable senators who were in the chamber the other day were aware of his contribution to the debate. The press release suggests that he did not learn much from the debate and obviously has some severe misunderstandings as to what the legislation contains. Given the reports that we have received in the last few days from a conference being held in London, Senator Coulter also has a greatly expanded view of what other countries will do with ozone legislation in the course of the rest of this year. He keeps saying that Australia has introduced very weak legislation that will be overtaken by the rest of the world. I said the other day that, bar Sweden, this is the strongest legislation in the world. I am confident that I will be able to maintain that assertion for the rest of this year and into the new one. In fact, a number of countries-and I express some dismay at this-are walking away from taking steps to properly ratify the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The protocol calls for a freeze on the quantity of the supply of chlorofluorocarbons at 1986 levels from 1989. It asks for a 20 per cent reduction in the supply from 1993 and a further 30 per cent cutback from 1998, giving a total reduction of 50 per cent over 10 years. When we considered the legislation in the chamber the other day it was explained to Senator Coulter many times-not just by me but by Opposition senators-that we are moving twice as fast as the protocol and will achieve that 50 per cent reduction by 1993. It is disturbing that anyone, particularly a senator, would continue to assert what is clearly not the case on the face of the legislation we looked at the other day. Obviously we must wear criticism all the time; I just wish some of the criticism was a little better based than this.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia is the only country in the world which has contemplated or put in practice any ban or restriction on exports. Indeed, we have a 5 per cent lessening each year. Australia is the only country in the world to have done that. If we were to implement what Senator Coulter asks for, in terms of an export ban of, I think, 20 per cent a year for five years, we would perhaps assert our moral authority over the developing world but, in fact, we would condemn many nations, particularly those in the Asian region, to a life without any refrigeration or air-conditioning of any kind. While we might rest more comfortably in our beds and suggest to ourselves that we have been holier than thou, the thou that we are holier than would be suffering. I for one would not seek, for some short term political gain here, to inflict any penalty on those less fortunate than people who live in Australia. I reject the many misstatements of fact in Senator Coulter's press release. I just wish people would look at the Bill which we put through on the face of it. When they do that they will see that it is very strong legislation and legislation of which we are justifiably proud.</PARA>

However, following from Senator Haines inquiry, I asked the Bureau of Industry Economics to examine Dr Norman's analysis. The Bureau of Industry Economics altered the main parameters to test the sensitivity of Dr Norman's results. The Bureau found that the key variable is the forecast growth in prices for craft pulp. Using growth rates for prices ranging from zero to 5 per cent, the Bureau found that the cumulative contribution to the current account to the year 2000 varies from $1.2 billion to $3.3 billion. That depends on the price range for pulp.

<PARA>I want to say quite clearly to the Senate that that is a scurrilous racist slur against the Aboriginal community. Not only is it untrue that I have ever tried to use the Aboriginals as political pawns, but also it is a racist scurrilous slur to suggest that Aboriginals have no minds of their own and can be led around by politicians. Let me make it very clear to the Senate that that is not the truth of the matter: Aboriginals are capable of making up their own minds in respect of coming down here to lobby against the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. The people that they called on while they were down here-Senator Haines was one-would back me up when I say that the way these people conducted themselves showed that they had the best interests of their community at heart. This statement put out by Mr Gayler absolutely patronises Aboriginal people in that it suggests that they cannot make up their own minds and they need someone like me to lead them around.

Let me come right to the crucial issue from the word go so that everyone understands our position. The Government proposes that Senate Estimates committees meet on Monday, 17 April. That is the first day of a non-sitting week. Non-sitting days are usually reserved for carry-overs of Estimates committees and that can be verified by looking at the record.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come back to that. The fact is that the Government is requiring honourable senators, at great expense to the Australian taxpayers, to fly back to Canberra from wherever they happen to be to attend Estimates committee meetings on the Monday of a non-sitting week. The Leader of the Government in the Senate referred to senators having to do some extra work. The Government must understand that many senators will probably have to come back here on the Friday night. These senators would be entitled to a travelling allowance. In addition senators will have to stay on the Monday night and again they would be entitled to a travelling allowance plus their air fares. This is what will happen if the Government forces the Estimates committees to sit on a non-sitting day at the beginning of a non-sitting week. I put it to the Government that that is being grossly unfair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw the Senate's attention to the history of Estimates committees. I think we are all in agreement that Estimates committees perform a vital function. In the past, Estimates committees, under both Liberal-National Party governments and Australian Labor Party governments have met mostly on sitting days. In 1985 Estimates committees first met on 15 April, which was a non-sitting day. Four more days were listed, all of which were sitting days-there were no more non-sitting days-and, in fact, the last two of those sitting days were not used. So in 1985, Estimates committees sat on one non-sitting day, and that was a Friday at the end of a sitting week. The Senate sat from Monday through to Thursday and then there was a full day on the Friday for Estimates committees. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986, the first three days listed were sitting days. The Estimates committees sat after the Senate had adjourned from relatively full days of sittings. The committees then sat on a non-sitting day. This was followed by two days of Estimates committee meetings after the Senate had adjourned-in other words, they were almost full days with Question Time in the mornings. In 1987 four days were listed for Estimates committee meetings followed by one non-sitting day, if required. By 1987 the Government was getting sick of Estimates committees-we were asking too many difficult questions-and it decided to make life very difficult. Estimates committee hearings were listed for two sitting days and two non-sitting days plus an additional non-sitting day if required. </PARA>
<PARA> Now we come to this proposal. What the Minister is proposing is that the Senate Estimates committees meet on four particular days, two of which are sitting days, two of which are non-sitting days, and the last one of which, as I say, is the Monday of a non-sitting week. We are suggesting that Friday, 7 April, be substituted for Monday, 17 April. I put that to the Minister as being not unreasonable. It would mean that we would lose a sitting day. No doubt, if the Government wished, the Committees could meet after a short sitting of the Senate on the Friday morning. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out to the Government that it set this particularly crazy sitting pattern which we have at the moment. It is the Government that decided that, because of the Governor-General's swearing in, the Senate would resume one week later than it normally would. We have had this crazy sitting pattern imposed upon us. The Government must have known, when it was setting that pattern, that there was a need for Estimates committees to meet. The Government should realise the terrible difficulties it will be imposing on all senators, not only Opposition senators but also Government senators, if it maintains this proposal. Accordingly, I suggest that in paragraph 4 (a) we substitute Friday, 7 April, for Tuesday, 11 April. </PARA>

The Opposition parties have always been of the view that the Estimates committees form part of the very vital activities of the Senate and, as such, sitting days should be utilised. If the Australian Democrats would indicate to me their attitude towards our suggestion and the alternative being put by the Minister, we may be able to come to some agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is counting the Ministers. So obviously Government members sit on a lot more than that, if one takes the Ministers out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We feel somewhat uncomfortable in the situation because we attend committees other than Estimates committees. On the other hand, we attend Estimates committees on an ad hoc basis. Some honourable senators may remember an ex-colleague of mine who attended on a more than ad hoc basis. I do not know whether honourable senators want to foster a great attendance on the part of the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> The suggestion of the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray) that the committees sit on 3 April seems to be a reasonable one. That date is certainly preferable, as Senator Lewis has already indicated, to 17 April. I wonder whether we could settle on 3 April. We are after all to be engaged in Supplementary Estimates. I take the point that Senator Lewis made that he wants the Estimates committees to meet on sitting days. I also point out to him that, for example, by Thursday of last week we had spent 18 minutes on legislation. I know that this week we spent two full days discussing matters and did not even get to legislation. We have a variety of other matters to consider. We should as far as possible try to provide more time for legislation. I have indicated that the Australian Democrats believe the Senate ought to be sitting longer but that does not seem to be something that is going to occur. On that basis and because of the need to address the legislation that is before us, we believe that the Minister's suggestion is a reasonable one. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know how Senator Macklin arrived at 2.3 as the number of committees on which Independents sit. I wish that were so in my case. I am not a member of the Estimates committees as such but, as members of the various Estimates committees will know, I actively participate in questioning at Estimates committees. So their sitting schedule is a matter of interest to me. Although I am not absolutely sure of it, according to our heavy timetable, the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters is probably meeting on 3 April.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am okay for 3 April, but I also think that what the Opposition has been putting to the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray) is quite valid. Let us see whether we can focus our minds on the Estimates committees during a sitting week and have the threat over our heads, as it were, that if we do not finish when the Parliament is sitting we will have to come back here when the Parliament is not sitting. Is it not Senator Lewis's proposal to continue with the tradition of holding these Estimates hearings when the Senate is sitting so that unless we hurry it up we have the threat hanging over our heads that we might have to come back on a non-sitting day? That is an eminently reasonable and desirable proposal. </PARA>

What we are doing is asking for two sitting days for Supplementary Estimates and four for Estimates, which I think is eminently reasonable. I am very conscious of the December syndrome that we went through last year. People do not want to be hanging around until the end of June and the start of July. Therefore, I urge that it be two rather than four days so we can expedite legislation. I deny that we are afraid of the Estimates committees. We may be afraid of boredom at times. As Senator Lewis knows, Estimates committees have had their ups and downs. I can remember Senator Lewis storming out of one such meeting in the Senate chamber, saying that he would never return. I have a long memory. Senator Peter Rae counselled him and he returned. Had I been in Senator Lewis's position at that stage, I would have stormed out two days earlier. However, I think this compromise is adequate, and we have plenty of other business to get on with.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> It was thus clear that a decision on the future use of the provisional House was an essential step not only in developing an overall plan for the Parliamentary Zone but also in determining which items of historical or artistic merit should be used in the new Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA> A major reason for the uncertainty about the future of the provisional House is the fact that there is no obvious procedure for determining the matter. Furthermore under the Parliament Act 1974 all buildings and works within the Parliamentary Zone must be approved by Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of this uncertainty the Joint Committee proposed to the Minister for Territories and Local Government (Hon. T. Uren, MP) on 6 May 1983, that the Committee's terms of reference be amended by inserting a new clause requiring that the Committee consider and report on the use of the Provisional Parliament House after it is vacated by Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> On 25 May 1983 the House of Representatives agreed to a resolution moved by the Minister that the Committee's resolution of appointment be amended by inserting after paragraph 3 the following new paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(3A) That the Committee consider and report on the use of the Provisional Parliament House after it is vacated by Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> On 26 May 1983 the Senate concurred in the resolution of the House. </PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) is in the chamber, because the future of that building which is so important in the history of this country is something in which I have no doubt he will be taking a great interest. It is worth noting the recommendations of the Committee presented to the Senate in May of 1984. The first was that the provisional Parliament House should not be demolished. The second reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Because of the historical and heritage merits of the provisional Parliament House it should remain basically as it is subject to the modifications required to the southern facade and the roofline to enhance the views of it from Capital Hill. </PARA>
<PARA>The third recommendation reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The most appropriate future use would be as a museum related to the Australian Constitution, Federation and the Commonwealth Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>The fourth recommendation goes on to deal with the parliamentary museum and the collections that it might have. The fifth recommendation was that the provisional House should remain under the control of the Presiding Officers, advised by a joint committee and with funds to be provided. The seventh recommendation was that the continued long term use of the provisional House by the parliamentary departments was not appropriate. It is clear from the report which was accepted by the Senate in 1984 that the Senate then regarded the building as being of historical and heritage merit. I know the Senate can change its mind, but I cannot believe that it would have changed its view about the historical and heritage merit of that building. The present situation is that the Government, notwithstanding the fact that this report was presented in May of 1984, has failed to deal with the matter of the future of that building. It has failed to tell us what it intends to do. The only rumour I have heard is that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is alleged to think that it ought to be demolished. That, of course, I cannot believe. The last I heard was that the Government would defer making a decision for 12 months or so, and goodness knows when that was. </PARA>
<PARA> I personally feel quite affronted that the Government regards the building so lightly. It is important as a tourist facility in the national capital; it is even more important as part of the history of this country. I expected that the Government, as is normally the case, would respond to a committee report within six months of its being presented, at the end of 1984 or perhaps into 1985, as it was quite a big decision. I have waited anxiously for a report on the future of that building. I thought it might be announced on 9 May last year when this building was opened. That would have been an appropriate day, given that it had not been announced before then. I thought the Government might have announced the decision as to the future use of the building when it closed, when we vacated it last year, but that has not been the case. As I said it is a matter of considerable regret. </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise that, since this decision of the Committee came before the Parliament, there has been discussion and there is perhaps a fairly widely held view that to restore it to its 1927 configuration would be a reasonable way of presenting it for the future. That could well be regarded as the most viable option. If that were to be the case, to put a child-care centre or any other building adjacent to the building as is now proposed is even more inappropriate. The original building was in the shape of an H, with the two chambers and King's Hall along the front, the dining rooms and other rooms along the back, and the spine across the middle was the Library. The gardens flowed from the sides of the Library out across to the lawns, the areas that are now being talked about. If the building were to be restored to its 1927 configuration, the restoration of the gardens and the surrounding areas would be very much a significant part. Even if that were not the case, those parts which were integral to the use of the building are still quite significant. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators may recall that a couple of years ago, because the Government wanted to expand the Parliament considerably, we agreed that it should place a temporary building in that area. A bridge was erected across the road from the provisional Parliament House to the temporary building. I am surprised that that bridge has not already been removed, because I am sure all senators will recall that the basis of its being put there was that it would be removed after the use of the building was concluded. I hope that that will be removed quite soon because it was envisaged that that area was so much a significant part of the building. The point I wish to make most strongly is that nothing should be built in that area until such time as the future use has been determined, and determined by the Parliament. I remind the Senate of the provisions of the Parliament Act 1974, section 5 (1) of which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>No building or other work is to be erected on land within the Parliamentary zone unless the Minister has caused a proposal for the erection of the building or work to be laid before each House of the Parliament and the proposal has been approved by resolution of each House of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>It is for the two Houses of the Parliament to determine what will happen within the whole of the parliamentary zone as defined in the Parliament Act 1974. It may well be that there is a place for a child-care centre outside the parliamentary zone. In fact, the amount of space I can think of near to it but outside the parliamentary zone would mean that that would be a feasible proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I am reminded also as we discuss this matter today that not long ago people wanted to put a child-care centre in the National Library. When renovations and alterations were being made to the Library, space in the Library was made available for a child-care centre. There were people who wanted to run it, to use it and to be involved, but for some reason best known to the Executive at the time, it would not tolerate or contemplate a child-care centre in the National Library. That, too, was in the parliamentary zone. I certainly approved of it. I knew of no-one but the Labor Government who was strongly opposed to its being there. It remains a mystery to me why that was the case. Now we are confronted with a proposal to put a custom-built child-care centre right next to the old building. I plead with the Senate to support our motion that on the basis of the heritage characteristics of that building, and its importance not just to my constituency, the people of Canberra, but to many others as well, it should not proceed until it has been looked at more closely. </PARA>
<PARA> When the matter came before the Committee there were a number of other questions that were not answered relating to costs of the building, use of the building and things of that nature. The thrust of the argument that we bring to the Senate today relates, as I have stressed, to the heritage aspects. I do not believe that those who have an interest in the heritage of this country have been adequately consulted. A letter I received from the Chairman of the Australian Council of National Trust indicates that the proposal is of great concern to the National Trust, particularly as it does not seem to have been referred to the Australian Heritage Commission. I wonder what consultation has taken place about building a structure in that area on the tennis courts on the House of Representatives side of the old Parliament House. It has been the home of the Parliament for 60 years and needs to be treated with more concern than has been shown to the present time. I could go into the question in more detail as to where a child-care centre might be sited and why it might be put there, but they are matters that are not the concern of the Senate. It is the areas specifically within the parliamentary zone which pursuant to the Parliament Act must be approved by this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot understand why or how the Cabinet last November, as I think the Minister told us when we asked questions about it last year, suddenly out of the air decided to put a child-care centre then and there in the grounds of the old Parliament House. Certainly the question of child-care facilities relating to this building has been of interest to a number of people for quite a long time. That is not in dispute. It could have been solved much sooner had the Government agreed to the child-care centre being based at the National Library, but somehow that was not to be. I invite honourable senators to read the minority report which has been presented. The Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House determined that it should write to the Government to ask for information about the old building and its future use, but on party lines the Government determined not to go along with being certain as to what would happen to that building before any structure be placed on either side of the building. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate of the report with which I started my remarks, that presented in May 1984, and would point to its terms of reference and to the conclusions that the Committee reached. I refer the Senate to the report, which does not give details as to the need for a child-care centre in the area and details of cost, which did come up, but those matters were insignificant compared to the heritage issue. The minority report makes it plain that it is the heritage issue and not child-care that we are talking about. I urge the Senate to support the motion I have moved, and require the Government to tell us what is happening before any structure, child-care centre or anything else, is put in that vicinity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate endorses the minority report of the New Parliament House Committee opposing any decision to construct a child-care centre adjacent to the old Parliament House until the Government advises the Senate of its plans for old Parliament House and exercises its right under section 5 (1) of the Parliament Act of 1974 to deny approval for such a building to be erected. </PARA>
<PARA>I strongly support Senator Reid's remarks. I endorse her view that this is not a matter of opposition to the concept of a child-care centre. I think that it is absolutely vital for the Senate to recognise that that is not the basis for opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I can understand why there is a feeling of frustration and anger among some people in this place, and not only senators and members but workers in this Parliament and in the parliamentary zone, at the fact that proposals for the establishment of a child-care centre have continually been either fobbed off or ignored or pushed aside-and particularly, as Senator Reid said, by the Government in not going ahead some time ago with a proposal that seemed rational, and I have found no coherent reason why it should not have gone ahead, to have a child-care centre in the National Library. This has been going on for a long time. The need for child care in the parliamentary zone was first identified, as the Committee was told, in 1981 and has been raised in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) community by the Status of Women Caucus Committee, the child-care subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House, and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The ACT Children's Services Program Planning Committee also identified the parliamentary zone as a high need area for child care. There is a universal and accepted view that there is a clear need for a child-care centre of some kind-whether it is community based or not is a question that can be discussed later. </PARA>
<PARA> In passing, it is worth reflecting on whether a community-based child-care centre is appropriate in an area where a great deal of the demand will be not from the community, but from tourists visiting the area on a temporary basis. In fact, the recommendation to the New Parliament House Committee included the strong suggestion that major users would be the children of tourists. Added to that factor is the clear problem of priorities which would have to be applied for people using that child-care centre, if it were a community-based centre with the funding coming out of the Australian Capital Territory's appropriation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us face it: the demand, as we understand it, and as we have understood all previous recommendations on the matter, relates to the special needs of people working in the parliamentary zone. At the Committee meeting we were told very clearly that there were no plans whatsoever for any priority to be given to people working in the parliamentary zone. We were told there were no arrangements at all to establish priorities. In fact, because it would be a community-based centre, it would have to be available to people passing through the parliamentary zone on their way to their workplaces or elsewhere. In other words, the child-care centre would bear no specific, detailed or necessary relationship to the parliamentary zone except that it would be available to some extent, we know not what, to tourists, and it would be available to some extent, we know not what, to workers in the parliamentary zone. </PARA>
<PARA> There was an estimate of $700,000 for the total cost of the project. We were told that construction would start in the first half of 1989-in effect almost immediately, if it were to start in the remnants of this financial year. For that to be done, it seems to me we should be seeing an argued request and a detailed proposal presented to this chamber under the terms of the Parliament Act 1974. We have not seen that proposal yet. It would seem to me that we are entitled to ask what fees would be charged or what priorities would be imposed, on users. These are matters which I think merit a debate. It seems to the Committee-as is mentioned in the minority report-that it is inappropriate for any construction to take place in the parliamentary zone if it does not have a strict and direct relevance to that zone. From what we were told at the New Parliament House Committee, the proposed child-care centre to some extent may have a relationship, but would not necessarily, or strictly, have a relationship, to the parliamentary zone itself. This was because people within the parliamentary zone may not even have a priority of use for that child-care centre. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth pointing out exactly what the minority report says, because this resolution endorses the minority report. I quote from the report:</PARA>
<PARA>While recognising the need for a child care centre in or near the Parliamentary Zone . . . </PARA>
<PARA>One will notice that that does not necessarily say what kind of child-care centre. It does not say that it will be necessarily community-based, but just says `a child-care centre'. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we are concerned about the Heritage implications of any new building erected ``adjacent'' to the old Parliament House, particularly if the old House is to be restored to its 1927 state in an appropriately landscaped area.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result, a decision on a suitable location should not be taken before the Government advises the Committee of its proposals for the future of the old Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpose that I totally support Senator Reid's comments that the Government has taken an inordinately long time to make a decision about what will happen to the old Parliament House. I fear that the decision not to make a decision on this issue rests upon the expectation that if the matter is left unattended for long enough, and if the building deteriorates enough, then there will be no option but to demolish the old Parliament House. I am very suspicious of the delays introduced by this Government in the making of such a decision. I have no confidence in the Government's goodwill or good intentions in this matter. There is no excuse for failing to make a decision and I look to the motives and I am concerned about those motives. </PARA>
<PARA> When this New Parliament House Committee was forced into a decision to spend $50,000 for the construction of a new Speaker's chair for the new Parliament, it was on the assurance from the Government that the previous chamber would be maintained as a parliamentary museum. That was the justification for not bringing that historic and significant Speaker's chair to this building. As Senator Reid has pointed out, what has happened since then? Absolutely nothing, except that I imagine the Speaker's chair has now gathered a fair bit of dust. </PARA>
<PARA> Are people being taken to see the historic Speaker's chair? Are school children being given the opportunity of seeing the chamber in which so many historic and significant events in Australia's political history have taken place? No, they are not. This Government has done nothing. It is no wonder that members of the Opposition are suspicious of the motives of the Government in this matter, because we know there are some people who take the view that the building should be demolished. There is no doubt that the longer this Government takes to decide on this issue, the greater will be the weight behind the claims of those people who will say, `Look, it would cost too much to refurbish it; it will cost too much to restore it. Now we have allowed it to fall into disrepair, it will be simply too expensive to restore. Therefore it should be demolished'. If that were to occur, it would be an absolute disgrace. No doubt Senator Richardson would seek not to allow it to happen, because of his clear concern for the heritage of this country. Maybe he will get rolled again. He seems to have been rolled quite regularly recently. </PARA>

I continue to quote from the minority report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>We regret the majority decision not only to agree to the proposal immediately but also to reject our request for the Government to provide an urgent response to the Committee on the future of the old Parliament House before construction proceeds on the Child Care Centre. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also concerned that the proposal, which specifies a community based centre funded from the A.C.T.'s Federal Government allocation, contains no details of estimated demand for a publicly funded centre, of charges to be applied or priorities to be followed in accepting children, many of whom it appears will be from parents having no involvement in the Parliamentary Zone other than it being on, or near, their routes from their homes to their places of work. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat the last paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA>In our view it is inappropriate for any construction to take place in the Parliamentary Zone that does not have a strict and direct relevance to that Zone. </PARA>
<PARA>In light of the manner in which this matter was pursued at the New Parliament House Committee meeting, I strongly support Senator Reid's motion. I might say that at that Committee meeting the manner in which the Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees in the other place behaved was totally unacceptable to me and, I understand, totally unacceptable to my colleagues. I regret that a decision of this substance and significance was taken in an atmosphere of hostility. Totally unnecessary confrontation developed because of the behaviour of the Deputy Speaker in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very important matter. I stress that our position is not one of opposition to the existence of a child-care centre. On the contrary, I favour one-and Senator Reid clearly has indicated her support of one-but not at the expense of our heritage. I believe that many good causes have been damaged by people saying, `Look, the cause is so good we should do anything to support it'. I fear that there are many members of this Senate who, because it is a good cause, are now prepared unnecessarily to damage our heritage for the sake of immediate benefit and popularity. I say, as Senator Reid has said, that there are plenty of adjacent sites and plenty of nearby positions. There is even one within the parliamentary zone that has been found acceptable to the Opposition and to many other people. Why do we have to go ahead with this? It is not good enough for Government senators to get up and say, `This is the only place-it must go ahead here or it will not go ahead anywhere'. That is arrant nonsense. I hope that the Senate will support those of us who favour such a proposal-those of us who want a child-care centre, but not at the expense of our heritage. </PARA>

Apropos that comment, I also acknowledge that Mrs Kathy Sullivan, MP, a member of the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House, has shown a considerable interest in this issue over the years.

To simply say that because Mrs Sullivan was not present at a meeting and because she did not sign a report she either agrees or disagrees with the minority or the majority position is, in fact, to make a reflection in relation to Mrs Sullivan which is unsubstantiated by any evidence that Senator Giles can give. I suggest that, in the absence of any information which she can adduce to the Senate to support her proposition, it might be more appropriate for her to withdraw the implication that Mrs Sullivan has a particular view or that Mrs Sullivan disagrees with the view of her colleagues who have signed the minority report.</PARA></TALK.START>

I pointed out that I would have been more impressed by a minority report that carried her signature. That was all I intended to impute. I apologise if any other impression were given by what I said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I was saying, I am not going to go over the history of this matter. I do not think there is any point in doing that. But I think it should be made perfectly clear that, from what I can see of the plans that have been provided to us today, the proposed siting of the new child-care centre is well away from the provisional Parliament House. To the extent that that ground is considered sacred, I would have thought the child-care centre was far enough away not to intrude upon anybody's susceptibilities. I would also feel very confident that, before even one sod is turned for the foundations, there will be very extensive consultation to ensure that whatever is built does not intrude on the style of the area, that it is as unobtrusive as possible, and that it is no more prominent or visually disturbing than the existing buildings. I understand that East Block is very close. Nobody wants to see anything untoward happen within the Parliamentary Triangle. However, there is a considerable lack of enthusiasm for putting centres in buildings, such as the National Library of Australia building or even this building, that have been constructed for some entirely different purpose. For a start, it is always excessively expensive to modify existing buildings to include satisfactory child-care facilities. It costs much less to start from scratch with a custom-built building which, as Senator Reid has said, is totally appropriate not only to its surroundings but also for the purpose to which it is to be put. Ease of access is a very important consideration. It is not appropriate to site a child-care centre in enormous buildings which have substantial numbers of the public coming in and out daily with security problems and all the rest of it. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The policy in relation to use of the centre, who is to use it, what the priorities are to be, what the charges should be, et cetera, will be issues for the community group which will run the centre to determine. It will have to make the same decisions that are made by any other community-based child-care centre. Over the last few years we have included in that group-in fact, it has been playing a very prominent role-representatives of the workers in the area, not just from Parliament House but from other buildings in the Parliamentary Triangle. We presume that the principal users of the building will be members of a long list of organisations including the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association, the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees Union of Australia, the Miscellaneous Workers Union and the Australian Journalists Association, among others. </PARA>
<PARA> The community group attracts recurrent funding and this is a very important aspect of the way in which the exercise will be conducted. Its relevance-and I say this for the benefit of Senator Michael Baume, who seems to have left the chamber-is surely to meet the needs of the workers in the zone. I do not think there is anything more relevant. The zone itself has been identified as a very high need area. I am unable to throw any light upon the problems and doubts that people have about what will happen to the provisional Parliament House in the near or far future. But I have no reason whatsoever to believe that the Government has moved away from the undertakings that it has given previously in relation to the provisional Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA> Everybody involved in the process is concerned to ensure that it is of the utmost utility, the utmost attractiveness and the least possible intrusiveness in the area, providing a much needed facility which will add considerably to the ease with which people are able to work in this area. Of course the money comes from the Australian Capital Territory vote. I do not see anything wrong about that in view of the fact that, in the main, the people who will be using the 40 long day places will be living in the Australian Capital Territory. These people pay their taxes to the Territory; surely they have the right to these types of facilities. I imagine that casual users, people using the facility by the day, the hour, the evening or whatever-they may include some parliamentarians but I think that on the whole parliamentarians would be a very minor element-will be required to pay for that use and perhaps, in a sense, they will maintain the viability of the operation in a way that will be of value to the whole project. </PARA>
<PARA> I think those who are opposing the project simply have not taken into account the fact that it is very badly needed. We on this side of the Senate have a commitment to a community based child-care centre. I know that honourable senators on the other side do not. We understand that; it was made very clear by Senator Reid when she spoke about this matter late last year. But it seems to me that the best thing we can all do now is to support the majority report of the Committee and turn our efforts to ensuring that the project that ensues is of the greatest possible benefit to the people of the Australian Capital Territory and to those visitors who need to use it, making sure at the same time that we do not offend anybody's sensibilities about the parliamentary zone. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will not be supporting Senator Reid's motion. I wish to make some comments both on this issue and on the debate thus far. Senator Reid made reference to the temporary building which was added recently to the old Parliament House. She said that, when the Government wanted to expand the size of parliament, there was an agreement that that building would be built on a temporary basis. I remind the Senate that the Government expanded the size of the Parliament by doing a deal with the National Party of Australia. I wish to get that on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Certainly, the Australian Democrats have concerns about the heritage area, and my colleague Senator Jenkins will briefly address those concerns. Perhaps the major protest that we would like to make at this point is that, in the Democrats' view, the child-care centre being discussed in this debate should be based at this new Parliament House. This is where the majority of people who will be using it are working-they are working long and difficult hours-and I suggest that that includes parliamentarians. It ought in the future to be able to include more parliamentarians. If we were all genuine in some of the things we said yesterday about the advancement of women one would expect more and more parliamentarians to be of an age and perhaps of a gender when they might need something in the way of regular child-care in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not suggest that this facility would be only for women parliamentarians. When I first came into this Parliament I asked a question about this matter. I have not been here very long compared with Senator Giles, Mrs Kathy Sullivan and some of the other people who have been working on this issue, but it was a matter of major concern to me immediately on coming into this place. In that question and in debates since I have expressed the view strongly that we should recognise that many of our male parliamentarians have young families. A child-care centre in this place might have gone a long way towards addressing one of the major problems of parliamentary work; that is, the strain on family life. The child-care centre should be based here. We believe that it is a national disgrace that it is not. We have saunas, spas, squash courts, swimming pools, tennis courts, bowling greens and all those sorts of things, but we do not have a child-care centre. That shows the lingering troglodyte-type attitude that is still around in the decision-making in our country. We should all hang our heads in shame about that. </PARA>
<PARA> This issue has been around for a long time. In looking at the report of the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House, which I have had for only a short time, I was interested to see that it points out that the need for child-care in the parliamentary zone was first identified in 1981. I wonder why it took as long as that to have that need recognised. Again, this is an illustration of the fact that human issues such as this take a long time to percolate to the top of the agenda. They are here before us today and, for that reason, it is terribly important that we do not put any further barriers in the way. There has been a barrier to having a child-care centre in this complex on the hill-largely a financial barrier. I was not here at the time but I believe that, shortly before I came to this Senate, progress had been made. But costings came out at the same time as the blow-out in the costs of this building and this matter was dropped like a hot potato by the male majority Government making the decisions. One can understand electorally and politically why that happened. That was a barrier. A further proposal has now been put before us today. </PARA>
<PARA> In the interim I think we should acknowledge the commitment made by former Senator Grimes to the establishment of a community-based child-care centre. While there was no firm plan at that time about where it would be, I believe that the commitment of Senator Grimes and the Government to that proposal was a strong step in the right direction and a strong incentive for this Parliament to go ahead and, short of having a centre in this building, do whatever it could appropriately to provide child-care in the parliamentary zone. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Michael Baume asked whether a community-based centre was appropriate. As Senator Giles rather gently said, we know the Opposition's attitude to community-based child-care and specifically to a community-based centre in this area. Senator Baume later questioned the motives of the Government in putting down this report and this recommendation in the Parliament. One has to question the motives of the Opposition in moving this motion, given Senator Baume's own question about the appropriateness of a community-based centre. If one has a policy against something I suppose it is appropriate to do anything one can to stop contrary policies being implemented. That is a perfectly proper political exercise, but we should see it for what it is. We should stand against that, as the Democrats are doing. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Michael Baume complained quite strongly and at length that we have only a motion before us; that we do not have detailed plans; that we do not have detailed costings; and that we do not have details on numbers and priorities. I seem to recall him often wearing a very big Waste Watch hat in this place. I suggest that it would cost a lot of money for a government to get detailed plans to place before the Parliament. I remember getting some plans drawn up for a mere domestic house 2 1/2 years ago. That cost $3,500 and that was done on the cheap. I suggest that the Government would have to spend tens of thousands of dollars to satisfy the complaints that Senator Michael Baume made here today. I think he lost his Waste Watch hat on this issue. One could not expect the Government to address his complaints at least until a motion is moved to the effect that we will go ahead. Certainly that is the sort of motion that will be passed here today. </PARA>
<PARA> I echo Senator Giles's comments that the area proposed for a child-care centre is significantly distant from the structure of the old Parliament House. Senator Baume seemed to think that if we put anything there the whole place would eventually tumble down. I support Senator Baume's proposition and the proposition in the motion that we must have a decision about what will happen to the old Parliament House. That is a matter of great concern to all of us. Putting a child-care centre there might even help to activate that to some degree. It might remind people that there will be more people in that area. If nothing is happening, that might put some pressure on government to come up with decisions on what will happen in that area and draw it to people's attention. When it does operate, in whatever form it takes-and we all have our views about that-that will add to the need for a child-care centre in the area. There should be more workers in the area and the area should be more active. Therefore, there will be more need for a child-care centre. </PARA>
<PARA> Another reason for the Australian Democrats supporting the motion is that it is for a community-based centre. We are strongly in support of community-based child care. I do not see anything wrong with people using a centre anywhere simply because it is en route to their work. People make child-care decisions based on their lifestyle. For some people it is important to have a centre near their home, for some it is important to have it near their work, and for others it is important to have it en route to work. There is a whole range of reasons. No doubt this centre will suit some people for that purpose, as other community centres do. We support the motion. We are delighted to see that there has been some action on the question of child care in the parliamentary zone. We are very unhappy that it will not be in this building, where we have believed all along that it should be. We are determined that it should not be at the expense of our heritage. I will leave Senator Jenkins, our spokesperson on heritage matters, to put our point of view on heritage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must congratulate Kathy Sullivan for not putting her name on this document, for whatever reason. I am very disappointed that, while the Opposition seems to pay lip service to assisting women, particularly in the community, it has chosen to use what seems to be a spurious excuse for not supporting the majority report of the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House recommending a child-care centre in the grounds of the old Parliament House. It is quite clear that a child-care centre is desperately needed in this area. While I would primarily support Senator Powell's and the Australian Democrats' idea that there should be one in this place-and it is a great omission that there is not one here-there is a desperate need for one in the area. Such a centre would serve the needs of the staff of Parliament House, parliamentarians, the staff of the National Library and other workers in the Parkes-Barton area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1988 a survey was conducted by the Parliament House child-care committee. It surveyed workers in Parliament House, the National Library and the National Gallery and found that 83 parents would use a centre in this location in the next 12 months, thus filling the 40 full time permanent places twice over. The Parkes-Barton Childcare Association, which represents a wider cross-section of workers in other government departments, and the Young Women's Christian Association have also expressed a need for child-care places. I am amazed that tennis courts can be included as part of our national heritage; yet we cannot include a child-care centre. Where are our priorities in this matter? Where are the Opposition's priorities? I am left almost speechless except that I have a few more things to say. </PARA>
<PARA> We all agree that good quality, affordable child care is the basis of equal opportunity policy-at least, I hope we all agree on that. If that is the case, why are such silly reasons given for opposing a child-care centre that clearly will service the needs of the community in this area, including people in Parliament House? The provision of a child-care centre in this location will testify to the sincerity of political promises to enhance the status of women and guarantee that they will not be disadvantaged in their working lives by their commitment to have children. In fact, a child-care centre on the old squash courts site will not detract from the ample provision of parks and gardens in the area. If anything, the presence of new, young citizens occupying that child-care centre will give added meaning to the parliamentary site as a reminder not only of our past but of our future. </PARA>
<PARA> In my private discussions with Government members there was some concern about a means test or the centre being used only by the Volvo yuppie workers in Parliament House. Their comments show that they know very little about the way child-care centres are run. They are too concerned about foreign affairs. People who use government-funded child-care centres are means tested: people must pay fees according to their income. A variety of clients would be serviced by this centre. One of the clear messages of the tax convention on Saturday was that, in working towards achieving equality for women, women were very clear in their minds that they did not support the means tested programs that the Government supports and promotes and that they wanted programs which were aimed at all women right across the board, irrespective of their incomes. I do not support the minority report. It is a disgrace to members of the Opposition and shows what hypocrites they are in relation to their policies on women. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the report of the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House, which has just been tabled, and support the Australian Democrats' opposition to the motion put forward by Senator Reid. I have not been able to study this somewhat slim report in detail because I saw it only a very short while ago. I am well aware that people in the Parliament have been working on the issue for a number of years. We are looking at two important issues-child care and the maintenance of our heritage. There is a long history of need for a child-care centre to be placed within the Parliamentary Triangle. As Senator Reid said, when the new National Library was built there was a strong move to have a child-care centre included there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Everyone who works in Parliament House has very special needs. We work long hours but very often we do not know the hours that we will work. I would consider, for example, our Hansard reporters, who work so hard for us in this chamber. They do not know what time they will get home at night. Even if those people have home-based child-care arrangements for their young children, arrangements can go wrong and emergencies do arise, so there is no doubt in my mind that there is a need for child-care for people who work here both on a regular and a casual basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I gather that for security and other reasons there would be problems in locating a child-care centre in this building. I have also heard that the display area close to Parliament House was also considered as a location but was considered inappropriate because of the lead from car exhausts, as well as other reasons. Last year I was a speaker at a forum on child-care needs in the Australian Capital Territory. The forum was attended by a large number of people. They made it plain to us all that there was a need for more community-based child-care centres in the Territory. Those who work within the Parliamentary Triangle will be able to make good use of a child-care centre to be located as proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the second issue at stake-that is, heritage. As yet there appears to be no certain proposed use for the provisional Parliament House. As I stated in my valedictory speech, the provisional Parliament House is a very important part of our heritage and requires a use that will bring members of the Australian public and overseas tourists to the building. I believe that there is general agreement that the additions which were made to Parliament House after 1927 will be taken down so that at last we will see it in its original state-smaller, but with that original integrity. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a problem because of asbestos in the ceilings of the building. It will cost a great deal of money to settle that problem. I suppose that the reason people are not being shown the Speaker's chair at the moment is that the asbestos situation is being looked at. It is very dangerous for anybody to go inside a building where particles of asbestos might be floating around in the air. Mesothelioma is a deadly disease. We are now seeing its results in Western Australia. I would not wish that disease to be inflicted on anybody. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at the plan regarding the provisional Parliament House and the proposed child-care centre, we see that the provisional Parliament House is flanked by gardens. On the Senate side is the original rose garden and tennis courts. I am not sure what is going to happen to those tennis courts. On the House of Representatives side there are the additional buildings and tennis courts, which are situated further away from Parliament House, in the corner of the garden at the back of Parliament House. It is proposed to place the child-care centre at the back of those tennis courts. It appears to be approximately the same distance from Parliament House as the Lobby restaurant. The Lobby restaurant is located near the opposite corner towards the front of Parliament House. The restaurant was designed by a top architect and built in the early 1970s. It certainly has a sensitive architectural design and fits in with the landscape extremely well. I hope that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, who is responsible for both heritage matters and Australian Capital Territory matters, will assure us that any child-care centre to be built on this site will be equally architecturally sensitive and will fit into the landscape as well as the Lobby restaurant. The child-care centre will be screened by trees and will be in that back corner, so I do not believe that it will detract in any way from the aesthetic value of the area. </PARA>
<PARA> The heritage issue is always interesting. The problem is always how do we maintain the best of our heritage while at the same time providing for our contemporary needs? We do not approach the issue in a very clever way in my home city of Perth. We tend simply to tear down our heritage and replace it with what one might call a simple solution. In this case, however, we can meet both objectives. We can maintain our old Parliament House as part of our heritage and, at the same time, cater for the needs of present and future generations by providing child-care within the parliamentary triangle. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak about only two aspects of the report by the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House relating to a community based child-care centre in the parliamentary zone. Firstly, I want to address certain heritage questions and, secondly, I intend to say something about some of the outrageous remarks made by Senator Dunn on this matter. I start with her gratuitous attempt to impute a certain view to Mrs Sullivan, the honourable member for Moncrieff, by congratulating her on not signing the report. Mrs Sullivan, as I made clear previously, was not present at the meeting at which the majority and minority reports were settled. As to Mrs Sullivan's commitment to child-care in the Australian Capital Territory, and in the Parliamentary Triangle in particular, Senator Giles has already alluded to Mrs Sullivan's work in this area over many years. The attempt gratuitously to impute a view to Mrs Sullivan in regard to the minority report is typical of the way Senator Dunn conducts herself, both in this place and as a parliamentarian in general.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am unimpressed when Senator Dunn comes in here and starts waffling on about how child-care fees at the centre will be charged according to a person's income. For somebody who was prepared to exist on a senator's salary and expect the public of New South Wales to subsidise her housing costs, who was prepared to live in cheap, subsidised accommodation when there were genuinely needy people in the community who actually needed subsidised housing-until she was sprung in the public media; otherwise, presumably, she would have been perfectly prepared to continue with her rent subsidy, her public subsidy for her housing costs-to come in here and say that, of course, fees will be based on people's capacity to pay--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that it is only the question of relevance and not the question of accuracy that concerns Senator Dunn on this occasion. Her contribution needs to be seen in that light. Senator Powell's attempt to say that the Opposition seeks to disguise the nature of the minority report by drawing, as it were, the red herring of heritage questions because we are basically opposed to child-care centres can be adequately rebuked and refuted in exactly the same way as can some of the comments of Senator Jenkins-by actually looking at what the minority report says. The minority report opens with these words:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>While recognising the need for a child care centre in or near the Parliamentary Zone . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The signatories to the minority report-Senator Michael Baume, Senator MacGibbon, Senator Reid and the Hon. Don Dobie-have made it quite clear in the opening words of the minority report that they recognise the need for a child-care centre in or near the parliamentary zone. The minority report then goes on to make recommendations. It does not recommend against the construction of a child-care facility in the parliamentary zone at some stage in the future. All it says is that we ought to have from the Government a clear statement of what the Government intends to propose to the Parliament about the future of the provisional Parliament House before the final decision on the child-care facility is made. Because the minority report is only five paragraphs long, I propose to read it. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> While recognising the need for a child care centre in or near the Parliamentary Zone, we are concerned about the Heritage implications of any new building erected ``adjacent'' to the old Parliament House, particularly if the old House is to be restored to its 1927 state in an appropriately landscaped area. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result, a decision on a suitable location should not be taken before the Government advises the Committee of its proposals for the future of the old Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA> We regret the majority decision not only to agree to the proposal immediately but also to reject our request for the Government to provide an urgent response to the Committee on the future of the old Parliament House before construction proceeds on the Child Care Centre. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also concerned that the proposal, which specifies a community based centre funded from the A.C.T.'s Federal Government allocation, contains no details of estimated demand for a publicly funded centre, of charges to be applied or priorities to be followed in accepting children, many of whom it appears will be from parents having no involvement in the Parliamentary Zone other than it being on, or near, their routes from their homes to their places of work. </PARA>
<PARA> In our view it is inappropriate for any construction to take place in the Parliamentary Zone that does not have a strict and direct relevance to that Zone. </PARA>
<PARA>That concludes the minority report. Let me go over what it actually says. It says, firstly, that the minority is concerned about the heritage implications of any new building erected adjacent to the old Parliament House `particularly if the old House is to be restored to its 1927 state in an appropriately landscaped area'. The erection of a child-care centre will reduce the capacity of the Government to make certain determinations about the immediate vicinity of the old, provisional Parliament House: how it should be preserved, how it should be altered and what the restoration and landscaping arrangements might be. It will be circumscribed by the building of this facility prior to that determination. The minority report says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a decision . . . should not be taken before the Government advises the Committee of its proposals . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is not unreasonable, given the amount of time that this Government has had to advise the Parliament and the Committee of what its proposals are for the provisional Parliament House. The report then draws attention to the fact that not only would the majority-that is, the Government members of this Committee-not agree to this proposal; they would not even agree to ask the Government for an urgent response to the question of what was to be the future of the provisional Parliament House. The report then makes certain other comments which are not immediately relevant to the question of the heritage values which are at stake here. I want to make it quite clear that Senator Reid's motion proposes:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate endorses the minority report of the New Parliament House Committee opposing any decision to construct a child-care centre adjacent to the old Parliament House until the Government advises the Senate of its plans for the old Parliament House and exercises its right under section 5 (1) of the Parliament Act 1974 to deny approval for such building to be erected. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the motion does not say that the minority report should be endorsed because it recommends that there should not be a child-care centre; it says that the minority report should be endorsed because a decision should not be made until-`until' is the word actually used-the Government has told us what it proposes to do with one of the most important parts of Australia's national heritage. In terms of the urban landscape, the built environment, the provisional Parliament House is now the single most important building or structure in respect of which the Government has, without any complications about Federalism or whatever, a direct national responsibility to advise this Parliament as to what its proposals for the future are. I turn to the paragraph of the majority report which says:</PARA>
<PARA> In November 1988 Cabinet agreed to the establishment of a community based child care centre adjacent to the provisional Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA>I simply draw the attention of honourable senators to the fact that this is an executive government decision about a matter which properly, under the legislation, is one the Parliament should be taking. It is the Parliament's responsibility, as a result of the Parliament Act 1974, to determine what happens within the parliamentary zone. Here we see a Cabinet decision that something will occur. It is not a decision to ask the Parliament; it is not a decision to ask for debate in the Parliament; it is a decision of the Cabinet that something will occur, despite the fact that the legal responsibility for making decisions about the parliamentary zone rests not with the Executive but with the Parliament. It is of some significance to indicate that this is a clear example of the Cabinet-the executive Government-saying, `Regardless of the position of the Parliament at law, we will make this decision and, of course, having made it, we know that we will be able to enforce it because, through Caucus, we have the numbers to do so and to overturn the rights of the Parliament'. </PARA>
<PARA> I could go on at some length about this particular matter. I do not propose to because, in fact, it is just as important today to require the Government to indicate its view on Senator Walters's Bill, which will come before the Parliament, and to ensure that we know exactly where it stands. It will be interesting to see whether all of the great proponents of the value of child-care to women in this community will take the same view about the question of the right and responsibilities that the Parliament has towards women in terms of the issue of pornography. This afternoon we will be provided with a very good opportunity to test whether all of those who want to claim that they support the rights of women to have access to child-care will similarly stand up to defend the rights of pornographers to exploit women. It will be interesting to see whether they all come out on that matter within the course of the next couple of hours. </PARA>
<PARA> The heritage issue is an important one. Let me say to Senator Jenkins that I am surprised to see her rejecting the proposition that we should not make a decision about work within the parliamentary zone until such time as we know what the future of the provisional Parliament House is. I accept that she has a genuine concern about heritage values and heritage questions. All the minority report says is, `Do not make this decision until we know what will be the fate of the old building'. What would Senator Jenkins say if, following the construction of the child-care centre, a proposal to demolish the wings added to the provisional Parliament House so as to take the building back to the original design-and I agree with her in that respect-were rejected because the asbestos that would be loosed into the atmosphere as a result of that work would prejudice the health of people in the child-care centre? That will be an interesting question for Senator Jenkins to turn her mind to when it comes up.</PARA>
<PARA> All the minority report has sought to say is that this Government has been dilatory in indicating what the future of the provisional Parliament House is to be. Here we have a method of ensuring that it tells us the answer to that question. We have said, `We will not approve this particular public works proposal until that information is given to the Parliament'. I think that is eminently fair and reasonable, and I think Senator Reid's motion should be supported on that basis. </PARA>

<PARA> Today we have been debating the minority report on the provision of child-care facilities in the Parliamentary Triangle. I want to cover a number of points that have been raised during this debate. I am surprised at the continual references to heritage that we have heard in this debate-as if the construction of a child-care centre will in some way diminish or ruin the nation's heritage as contained in the provisional Parliament House building. I do not believe that it is beyond the wit of the combined resources of architects, the Joint Committee on the New Parliament House, the Heritage Commission and the Government to construct a child-care facility on the area formerly occupied by the gymnasium, near the bowling green-which is not in the provisional Parliament House building but near it-in such a way as to in no way interfere with the heritage value of the site. We will not build some seven-storey glass tower; I do not think anyone seriously suspects that we would. So, obviously, any architect drawing up plans will have to do so sensitively, and I am sure that will be done. When the plans for this have been made final by the architect they will be shown to the Joint Committee on the New Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no intention on the part of the Government to proceed in some way without having the Committee look at those plans. I give the Senate an assurance that the Heritage Commission will be giving advice to the Committee and the Government on those plans once they are ready. There is no intention to attempt to hide what might be done. Clearly that is not possible anyway. It is being debated in the Parliament. Everyone may be assured that the consultation will be wide. For what it is worth, my own undertaking is there. In no way would I be supporting a building that detracts in any way from the heritage value of the site. I have not seen a plan yet so I have nothing to approve or disapprove, but I will be anxiously awaiting that report. </PARA>
<PARA> The demand for this type of facility has been around for many years. It was first raised in 1981; so it did not happen yesterday. I do not intend to reveal all that happens in Cabinet but this was discussed on a number of occasions. While I cannot say that it was like the 14-hour discussion we had on the Lemonthyme last year, it was nonetheless a long discussion. The decision reached in the end was unquestionably the right one. Many sites were looked at. We did not just look at one or two sites. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All Cabinet decisions are unquestionably supported. I am suggesting that on this occasion the right decision was made and it is a pleasure to support it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There were many sites looked at. The Minister, in presenting his report to the Cabinet, looked at 15 sites; not one but 15. We were having a very close look at all the possibilities. The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has been urging the Government for some time to establish this facility. The Children's Services Planning Committee of the ACTU established it as a high priority years ago; not yesterday. Surely, with the growth that we are going to see and that we have already experienced in tourism in recent years, the need for the facility cannot possibly be disputed. </PARA>
<PARA> One wonders what the minority report is all about. I have heard many Opposition speakers contribute to the child care debate over the years. Clearly, there is a division on this question in the Opposition as, indeed, there is on many questions. Some Opposition senators, like Senator Reid, undoubtedly have a view that there is a place for child-care. I suspect that is Senator Puplick's view as well. But equally there is no doubt not only that a great many Opposition senators have no commitment to child-care, as evidenced in this proposal, but also that the Opposition parties have no commitment to the principle of child-care whatsoever. </PARA>

What we are really seeing is just another way of getting in the road of a child-care proposal which the Australian Capital Territory obviously needs. The need for it cannot be disputed. It is not the case that those using this facility will be part of some unnecessary middle class extravagance. Indeed, there are many workers in the Parliamentary Triangle on very low wages. That, if for no other reason, is a good enough reason to proceed with the decision that has been taken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government cannot support the motion to adopt the minority report in this case. The minority report is fatally flawed in too many ways. But most importantly, the ACT needs this facility, and after Saturday and the results we have seen, I do not think we should attempt to inflict any more misery on the ACT than it has already inflicted on itself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-It is interesting that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) should have concluded on that note about the election in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) last Saturday. That is the point I wish to make in concluding this debate. There was an election in the Australian Capital Territory last Saturday for an Australian Capital Territory Government. Three days later the Minister is sitting here telling the people of the Australian Capital Territory that, notwithstanding the fact that he claims to be committed to self-government for this Territory, he is prepared, even now, after that election, to spend $0.7m of the ACT's budget, as Senator Giles has just told us, for these 40 child-care places. It will come from the ACT's budget and the ACT Government will have absolutely no say in whether this is where the money should be spent or how it should be spent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister must also know there is a deficit in the ACT budget. But notwithstanding that, the Minister rushes on, even after an election. He keeps spending the Australian Capital Territory's money and does not leave it as a matter to be negotiated with the ACT Government. If the Minister was spending his own money it might be a different matter; but he is not. He is placing this facility in the parliamentary zone where, as the Minister has just stated, the ACTU has been urging for it to go. Perhaps at last we have actually got to the truth of the matter in that little snippet. It is going where the ACTU wants it at the ACT Government's expense. That perhaps is the whole story. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The ACTU has never argued for that site. It has argued for the need and that is all I have said it has argued for.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VI4">Senator REID</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How it would know about it, I would not know. The whole argument has been on the question of the heritage value of the old Parliament House. The Minister suggested that we were saying that a child-care centre would diminish the heritage value of the site. That has not been stated in this debate. What we have said is that that building and its environs are important and have been thought to be important by the Senate since the report of the Joint Committee on the New Parliament House in relation to the future of the old building was presented here in 1984. The Senate has just done a back-flip on that. The future of that building and how it is to be presented to the public should be determined before any other decision is made as to the environs, not the other way around. We have not said that there should never be anything built anywhere near it. We just say that the future of that building and its environs should be determined before any decision is made. There may be buildings put there; there may not. But that is not the point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been interesting to listen to the contributions today from those who pretend to be environmentalists and to be concerned about the heritage of this country. When one scratches them a little, one finds that their concern is not very deep. That has been another aspect of the debate that has been worth noting. But perhaps the most significant point that finally came out was from the Minister's own mouth, that, notwithstanding the Government's apparent commitment to self-government, it is not prepared to stop spending the ACT's money when it suits it. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>The special report of the Auditor-General on the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, which has been tabled today, is dynamite; it is devastating. All the discussions on Aboriginal affairs that have taken place since the Budget was brought down last year, in the whole of the Budget session last year, and all the controversy that surrounded the issue at that time have now been brought together in a most damaging and most dramatic report to this Parliament by the Auditor-General. Just about every one of the issues which were referred to the Auditor-General and which required special investigation has now been commented on by the Auditor-General in a way which demands the urgent attention of this Parliament. In fact, if the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) does not read this report tonight and demand the resignation of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand), he will be derelict in his duties. The calls last year for the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to resign were constantly shrouded in political controversy. Because the issues were raised by politicians, they were seen in that light, as being part of a political agenda. But the Senate now has before it a report to the Parliament by the independent Auditor- General that points out the dramatic seriousness of this whole issue. </PARA>
<PARA> We must at all times consider that the essential issue that must be addressed is to ensure that service delivery to Aboriginal people is the first priority. Nobody on this side of the Parliament has ever denied that that should be the first priority in the conduct of Aboriginal affairs-service delivery for people throughout Australia in special and often dire need. Of course, there are many fine staff in both the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal Development Commission. Probably the great majority of them are fine servants who are seeking to do their job. But obviously last year the whole administration of Aboriginal affairs under this Minister, Mr Hand, got totally off the tracks. We have not had much time to look at this report, which was tabled only an hour or so ago in the House of Representatives, but any senator who has had the time to peruse it will be horrified at the findings which have been brought down. Let me go through some of the comments contained in the Auditor-General's synopsis at the front of the report:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Audit has encountered difficulties in obtaining timely information from the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the Aboriginal Development Commission. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> At the exit interview . . . the Commission was represented by Mr Adams QC and relatively junior staff . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the findings related to deficiencies in meeting statutory requirements and it appeared that several projects funded were outside the legislated powers. The advice of the Attorney-General's Department in this area conflicted with that of Mr Adams QC. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . Audit considers that the Commission should improve accountability for the funds spent on the enterprise program by disclosing information about the people and organisations who receive the funds, and those who have been enabled to engage in self-sustaining business enterprises. It should also be more careful when providing funds to ensure that it meets the requirements of the business enterprise provisions of the ADC Act. There is also a need to differentiate more clearly between social and economic assistance, and improved training of participants and project monitoring. </PARA>
<PARA>What have we been saying and debating for about six months in this place? The synopsis looked at the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, and this shows some mal- administration:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Audit believes the standard of administration the review has revealed is lower than acceptable and that remedial measures are required. </PARA>
<PARA>Further down, dealing with grants and grant projects, the report says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Audit recommended that there be greater oversight of the financial operations of the Land Councils. </PARA>
<PARA>In talking about the review of the grant programs, the report says:</PARA>
<PARA>Working Parties were to be, or have been, set up to remedy deficiencies but-</PARA>
<PARA>and this is the important part-</PARA>
<PARA>the results were more in the way of expectations than achievements. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on the Auditor-General comments on the lack of liaison between Federal, State and local administrations and no coordination of funding:</PARA>
<PARA>Audit has found the same in its review of Aboriginal and Torres Strait organisations. Funding has been provided from various sources in isolation from each other and Audit recommends that some remedial mechanisms be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General talks about the staff of his own office, who since the Prime Minister instituted this inquiry back in October have had to work under very heavy pressure. I would again commend those staff. An important point made in the report is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>They-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the staff of the Auditor-General-</PARA>
<PARA>had to contend, in some cases, with a relative lack of co-operation not seen before from an official body and with the intervention of Queen's Counsel. </PARA>
<PARA>I raised a question on that matter 10 days ago in this place to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Tate, about the particular intervention where the QC and officers of the ADC had accused the Auditor-General's office of racism, unprofessional conduct and incompetence. No wonder we see those sorts of comments now coming through in this very important report. It turns to dozens of particular examples. I do not want to take the time of the Senate now to recanvass each of those issues, but there are whole issues that will have to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> One particular area on which the Auditor-General has commented is that in the time available to him he has not been able to complete and to finalise many of the references and issues raised. On page 5 he comments:</PARA>
<PARA>The report omits findings in respect of Baruwei Enterprises at Katherine, Northern Territory. These will be reported later, after the ADC's response is received. </PARA>
<PARA>The Baruwei Enterprises went into liquidation last week. If I had had time today in Question Time, I would have addressed this very important question to the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, on this issue: is it a fact that $2.6m in public moneys, through the ADC, have been invested in Baruwei and that additional funds in the order of $600,000 were allocated by the new ADC Board appointed by Mr Hand in June 1988 to cover working capital required following misappropriations by senior staff? What are the repercussions of this type of thing? Obviously the responses did not get to the Auditor-General, there was not time, and the company has failed. That sort of example points up that there will be repercussions from this failure in remote and small Aboriginal communities right around Australia. There will now be increased prices and lack of supplies in Aboriginal communities. No doubt it will adversely affect the nutrition of Aboriginal children in that area. Is it any wonder that we see continually the sorts of examples raised in this report?</PARA>
<PARA> Let me make another couple of quotations from the report. In a comment in one section of the report the Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA>Audit doubts whether the Parliament intended that Commonwealth funds be used to enable its officers to engage in business even on a part-time basis. </PARA>
<PARA>He is referring there to a number of the involvements of other people. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Conclusions regarding the business enterprise projects. This audit has shown that . . . there were serious defects in the particular enterprise projects queried by Senator Tambling and other members of Senate Estimates Committee E. There were also serious defects in many other projects examined in the Audit. The Audit disclosed that ADC's largest enterprise project, Yeperenye Shopping Centre, suffered from a fundamental flaw under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me draw attention to what is said on page 62 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA>In view of the findings of this audit, the Government and the Parliament may wish to review the business enterprise provisions in the ATSIC Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>I would remind the Senate that we saw tabled last week in this place the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs which looked into the whole administration of Aboriginal affairs. The minority report, tabled by Senators Peter Baume and Boswell, concentrated on, and highlighted, those particular inadequacies in legislation. Here we have the Auditor-General inviting the Parliament to review the provisions of legislation which has come before it. Under the heading `Compliance with Grant Conditions', the report states that in relation to complying with grant conditions:</PARA>
<PARA>Audit found that some grant funded organisations have consistently failed to comply with grant conditions . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Under the heading `Management of Aboriginal Organisations', the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Audit identified evidence of poor management and non-compliance with grant conditions by some of the grant funded organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>There are many specific examples and this report will obviously take time to digest. The challenge has to be on the Prime Minister, not on Mr Hand. Mr Hand no longer has any credibility in the Aboriginal community or constituency. He no longer has any credibility in the Australian community. This whole issue must be addressed by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Select Committee came in with similar recommendations last week-40 recommendations from the majority report and much more credible recommendations in the minority report from the Opposition members. It is interesting to note that, in all of the debate in the last six months on this entire issue, Mr Hand has portrayed himself continually as a champion of a cause and it has only been that cause that he has continually pushed. He is supposedly one of the leaders of the left faction of the Australian Labor Party. Not one member of the left faction of the Labor Party in this Senate-except Senator Bolkus on one occasion, who stuffed it up-has stood up and defended him or has stood behind anything that Mr Hand has said. That is important and indicative of where this issue is with regard to the Labor Party and the Labor Caucus. </PARA>
<PARA> Very obviously, the proposal for the new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission legislation, which was going to be a big umbrella to embrace this great cauldron of problems, was being pushed continually through the Caucus by Mr Hand and by Mr Hawke. They must accept the responsibility. Mr Hawke must accept the responsibility and immediately sack Mr Hand. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I addressed the Senate this morning on a matter of privilege, I mentioned that I was concerned that witnesses giving evidence to the Auditor-General did not have the same protection as witnesses appearing before the Parliament. I had wondered whether the Auditor-General would be able to obtain adequate information on which to base a proper report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Even on a cursory reading, the report which we have had in our hands for a short time-45 minutes or so-is an indictment of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC), of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) who runs the Department and of the Government of which he is a part. It is a very sad document for one to have to look at. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole concept of ministerial responsibility, as we practise it in a Westminster system, requires that a Minister of state, who has under his or her control the various portfolio agencies, is in the end responsible if those agencies fail to observe the law or fail to do their duty. Even on a cursory reading of a few pages, the report of the Auditor-General makes it clear that such a failure has taken place. </PARA>
<PARA> This report requires that Mr Hand resign. It requires that he resign if he, as Minister, cannot explain how agencies under his control have failed so consistently, and so lamentably, to obey the laws of this land, to obey the requirements of the Audit Act and why they have cooperated so little with the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer honourable senators to page 2 of the Auditor-General's report, where he discusses his investigations as they related to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. For the information of honourable senators, I will quote from the bottom of page 2 where, in thanking his own officers from the Audit Office, the Auditor-General goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>They had to contend, in some cases, with a relative lack of co-operation not seen before from an official body-</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise `a lack of cooperation not seen before from an official body'-</PARA>
<PARA>and with the intervention of Queen's Counsel. </PARA>
<PARA>It is quite apparent that the portfolio agencies resisted the attempts by the Auditor to get to the bottom of the mess. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators may not recall that the Auditor-General, Mr John Taylor, is a highly respected officer who was formerly the permanent head of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. Mr Taylor brought to his task not only his expert knowledge on which he was appointed Auditor-General but also the knowledge and experience which he gained as permanent head of the Department. He knows the Department, he knows the portfolio agencies. He understands them and he has reported that his officers had to contend `with a lack of cooperation not seen before from an official body'. If Mr Hand cannot explain that claim satisfactorily, that in itself is reason enough for him to be removed from the portfolio. That is unacceptable behaviour from a Minister of the Crown when faced with an inquiry of this kind ordered by his Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The report reveals that the Aboriginal Development Commission has failed in a number of areas. The failures have been due, and can be related almost entirely to, the new appointees-those appointed by Mr Hand after he sacked the old Commission in May of 1988. His new appointees are the ones who are criticised in this report. The Auditor says that the ADC acted outside its Act, outside its legal authorisation. He says that the ADC failed to provide information as required, and when required, to the Auditor-General to carry out this inquiry. He says that the ADC attempted to impede the Auditor-General in the performance of his duty. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to illustrate some of my concerns, only by reference to four of the matters which were raised. The first is the question of certain loans which were made to Mr Ray Robinson of Charleville. To put it mildly, Mr Robinson is a colourful figure in Aboriginal affairs in Australia. I will say no more than that. I see you nodding, Mr Acting Deputy President; you come from Queensland. The Auditor-General sets out in his report a chronology of the various loans and defaults in those loan repayments made by Mr Robinson. The Auditor concludes by saying, at paragraph 2.3.14:</PARA>
<PARA>ADC's comment were sought-</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate that they were sought on a number of matters which had been raised in relation to Mr Robinson-</PARA>
<PARA>on 16 January 1989 but had not been received at the date of preparation of this report. </PARA>
<PARA>On a matter relating to a series of highly questionable loans and highly questionable procedures, information simply was not provided when and as required by the Auditor. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I wish to raise concerns the funding of the Tranby College for negotiations on a proposed Aboriginal treaty. The Auditor sets out the Prime Minister's announcement on 12 June 1988 at the Barunga Sports and Cultural Festival in the Northern Territory. He sets out the subsequent decisions of the ADC, largely under its acting commissioners appointed by Mr Hand in May, to provide $500,000 to Tranby College. The Auditor sets out that $420,000 of this money was to go to Tranby College and $80,000 to the Island Co-ordinating Council (ICC) in the Torres Strait. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the acting commissioners, Mr Getano Lui Jr, is the Chairman of the Island Co-ordinating Council. He was also an acting commissioner of the ADC involved in the decision to provide funds to himself. I refer honourable senators to those sections of the Auditor's report where it is made clear that both the application for, and the acquittal of, funds was unsatisfactory for the ICC. In relation to the decision as a whole to provide $500,000 for treaty negotiations to Tranby College, the Auditor has this to say, and I will quote two paragraphs. On page 15, paragraph 2.3.35 states:</PARA>
<PARA> In Audit's view, the Board's decision was ill-considered. There was no application from Tranby to ADC and there was no formal submission from ADC staff to the Board on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate that $500,000 is involved. The Auditor continued:</PARA>
<PARA>ADC had not previously made grants to Tranby. The Board did not satisfy itself that Tranby and ICC were suitable for the purpose and that the amount of $500,000 was appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth offering his concern in the understated language of official documents. We can see the extent to which he was appalled by this decision to put $500,000 out without an application, without a proper submission, without proper staff assessment, to an organisation that had not received the funds before. It is an amount which the Auditor did not feel was appropriate. Paragraph 2.3.39 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Audit put it to ADC in January 1989 that the payments to Tranby and ICC were grants of financial assistance of a kind not clearly authorised by the ADC Act. Audit suggested that, to resolve the doubts, ADC should seek a formal notice in writing from the Minister under sub-section 8 (g) of the Act to give ADC the function of assisting in the treaty consultations. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate here that I was once Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator. I say to honourable senators that I am quite aware of the fact that there was doubt as to whether funding for treaty negotiations was a function which had been conferred upon the ADC. I was aware of it when I was Minister and Mr Hand should have been aware of it now. The Auditor was quite right to draw to the attention of the ADC that it was probably acting outside the powers which have been given to it. Paragraph 2.3.40 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In a detailed reply on 1 February the ADC argued that the payments were wholly justifiable and provided a further legal advice from Mr Adams who confirmed his earlier advice that the payments were within ADC's powers. Audit referred the legal advice to the Attorney-General's Department which disagreed with Mr Adams' advice and expressed the opinion that the payments could not be regarded as coming within ADC's powers under section 24 or the other provisions of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>So here we have prima facie evidence from the Auditor-General that the provision of $500,000 by an ADC stacked by Minister Hand was probably illegal. That should give concern to all honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to raise two other matters, the first of which concerns the Woden Town Club. Firstly, it is made quite clear at page 17 that the first application which was received, and for which provisional approval was given, involved funding of an enterprise which had Mr Phillip Hall in it. Everyone associated with Aboriginal affairs knows about Phillip Hall. I would say, to put it politely, that if I were selling something to Mr Phillip Hall I would want him to pay me in cash. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I delivered. Mr Phillip Hall has a colourful reputation. That funding was not proceeded with. The Auditor's report goes on to make quite clear that the Minister, Mr Hand, knew, because of a briefing document he received in May 1988, that a loan guarantee was going to be given for the purchase of poker machines and he would have known that there was a possibility of that loan guarantee being called on and, therefore, he knew that the Commonwealth may have had to put up money for the provision of poker machines for the club. I mention that because it was the issue of poker machines on which Mr Hand later based his decision to sack Mr Perkins.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note with some sadness that the Auditor reports on the next page that Mr Perkins failed to disclose certain relevant interests for some months, though he eventually did so. On page 18, in paragraph 2.3.57 and the subsequent paragraphs, the Auditor sets out with clarity and detail his understanding of the reasons why the funding of the Woden Town Club was inappropriate and why the ADC failed in its duty to adhere to its own requirements of acting with due care by funding this project. This is contained in the Auditor-General's report which we have only had 45 minutes to look at. </PARA>
<PARA> The last matter to which I wish to draw the Senate's attention at this stage is the question of the Oasis Hotel in Walgett. There are Aboriginal people around Australia in the direst need, without clean water and living in appalling housing conditions. If the ADC is going to choose to put money into hotels, into clubs such as the Woden Town Club or into the purchase of poker machines, that certainly indicates some perverse set of priorities. However, the ADC decided to fund the purchase of the Oasis Hotel. I draw the attention of honourable senators only to page 23 and to the conclusions which the Auditor draws on this sorry matter. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> As indicated above, Audit doubts whether ADC's considerable financial assistance to Gamilarai for the hotel was provided in the manner required by the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Can honourable senators believe that? This is another occasion on which the commissioners of the ADC have acted in a way not covered by the ADC Act. These are Mr Hand's specially picked acting commissioners, put in to give him the numbers. The next paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA> The outcome is that, to date, no Aboriginals have been enabled to engage in business to the point of self-management and self-sufficiency. ADC informed Audit that this was carping criticism which denied the value of the experience gained and disregarded the long-term benefits. Audit remains of the view that the amount of some one million dollars of public funds applied to the hotel could and should have been spent more carefully and productively. </PARA>
<PARA>In the short time in which we have had this report I have not had time to go through the many other matters it deals with, but it is quite clear that it is a fine and honest report. It is a tribute to John Taylor and to the officers of the Audit Office. It is a very honest and hard hitting document. It shows what Senator Tambling, Senator Short and many other people have been saying for months: the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio is in disarray and, at the end of the day, the person who has to take responsibility for that disarray is the Minister of state who has the constitutional responsibility for administering that Department. We have yet to see the outcomes of certain other inquiries but, on the basis of this document alone, there is no honourable course open to Mr Hand except to resign. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have had but moments in which to read this special audit report of the Auditor-General and therefore have read only limited samples of it. With that brief observation, I support the comments that have been made by Senator Peter Baume and Senator Tambling, who have expressed grave concern-in fact, outrage-at the disclosures contained in the report. For my part, I will restrict my remarks primarily to areas in Western Australia. It is clear that the management of funds in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in Western Australia is an absolute shambles. There has been poor management and total inefficiency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yesterday I moved a motion in respect of answers which had not been provided to me by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) or the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), who represents the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in this place, notwithstanding the fact that the questions had been asked of the Minister eight weeks ago. I can understand the reluctance of the Department to provide the Minister with answers, or the reluctance of the Minister to provide Senator Tate with the answers, because those answers cast a great indictment upon the Department. Worse than that, having looked at this report, I find that it contains the answers to many of the questions I asked eight weeks ago which I was told yesterday by Senator Tate were unavailable. I asked the Minister about the number of unacquitted grants in Western Australia over a number of years. Senator Tate told me yesterday that the Department was unable to advise him, but the Auditor-General knows. He is able to tell us that 354 grants were unacquitted to 31 December 1987 and that 164 grants were unacquitted to 31 December 1988, totalling $13,767,663. The figures are here and they are available, yet the Department is clearly covering them up and is not prepared to make them available to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Of more immediate concern is the fact that answers to questions asked of Senator Tate and given by him in the Senate on 6 December 1988 are clearly wrong. Either Senator Tate was lied to by departmental officers or they are so incompetent that they have not the slightest idea of the activities and functioning of their own Department. I asked Senator Tate:</PARA>
<PARA> Is the Department enforcing financial rules and guidelines for the administration of these grants?</PARA>
<PARA>His unqualified answer was yes. On page 102 of the report we find these comments by the Auditor-General:</PARA>
<PARA> Audit found that some grant funded organisations have consistently failed to comply with grant conditions and Departmental action to overcome deficiencies has, in some cases, been unsuccessful. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department acknowledged the problem and stated that the reduction or cessation of funding to these organisations would cause extreme hardship to the Aboriginal communities being served by them. However, in most cases action taken to resolve problems had protected Commonwealth funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Audit identified evidence of poor management and non-compliance with grant conditions by some of the grant funded organisations. The problems were also recognised by the Department and corrective action was taken. </PARA>
<PARA>We have the Auditor-General telling us that financial rules and guidelines for the administration of the grants were not complied with and that the Department recognised it and acknowledged it, yet Senator Tate told us on 6 December that the Department was enforcing financial rules and guidelines for the administration of these grants. I asked Senator Tate:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . are grants still being made to organisations who presently have unacquitted grants?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Tate said:</PARA>
<PARA>Yes, but only after careful consideration of all the circumstances . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, we have learnt that that is not the case. To quote the Auditor-General, one of the major problems is apparently this:</PARA>
<PARA>there may not be the skill amongst the grant recipient personnel to handle the situation to the required standard . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I have raised before in the Senate this matter of the responsibility of the Department to employees of communities in receipt of grants. To this point the Department has said that it is a responsibility exclusively for the recipients-for the communities-and not for the Department. In other words, the Department has been quite happy to have $13 1/2m of taxpayers' funds outstanding, unacquitted, and to leave the management of those funds exclusively in the hands of employees about whom it is not prepared to make any judgment. I also asked Senator Tate on 6 December:</PARA>
<PARA>What is the Government doing about these unacquitted grants?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Tate responded:</PARA>
<PARA>It has been normal departmental practice each year to focus on the acquittal of grants made in the previous financial year when audited financial statements became available from auditors. </PARA>
<PARA>It is as if there were some natural, ongoing process for the acquittal of grants each year. We find that absolutely nothing has been done. In respect of the acquittal of grants, the Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA>All grants are required to be acquitted by a duly delegated officer with authority also being delegated for the abandonment of follow-up action to obtain acquittance of a grant and/or to approve the use of surplus funds. Although high priority is currently being given to this task many grants made since 1983-84 remain unacquitted and Audit was advised that a number of such residual grants cannot currently be acquitted due to loans by organisations, severe audit qualifications, etc. </PARA>
<PARA> The acquittal of grants is further complicated where the grant monies cannot be clearly identified in the financial statements. </PARA>
<PARA>Two examples are given where the grants and the funding for the organisation from other sources are mixed. The truth of the matter is that, on the basis of the Auditor-General's report, the answers given by Senator Tate in the Senate on 6 December were untrue and had no relevance to fact. As one looks through this report one can only draw the conclusion that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs is totally out of control; that it is run by a Minister who is totally incompetent, unable to understand good management, unable to get on top of the portfolio, and unable to understand what proper accountability is. When referring to compliance with grant conditions the Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA>There were deficiencies noted in relation to both the general and specific conditions. The most common deficiencies concerned the timeliness of receipt of financial statements, the information content of the statements, and the timing and format of the performance indicators. There was a lack of evidence of follow-up by the field officer concerned, and there was no evidence that the release of funds had been delayed . . . </PARA>
<PARA>When I asked Senator Tate why 151 grants in Western Australia had not been acquitted, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> In the first place, the non-receipt of audited statements is particularly critical in remote areas where auditors are few in number and other matters are often given greater priority. </PARA>
<PARA>Other matters are often given greater priority than the accountability of $13.5m in Western Australia alone. As at 31 December 1988, $67.8m of taxpayers' funds was not accounted for, not explained and not acquitted because the Department judged, as did the communities, that there were higher priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told by the Auditor that there has been a lack of follow-up by field staff and a lack of action by the communities. We note that Senator Tate said:</PARA>
<PARA> These deficiencies are more frequently of a minor nature. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that deficiencies of a minor nature were responsible for the grants being unacquitted; yet the Auditor-General told us that they were matters of major moment, of significance and of consequence. When seeking to make assessments as to whether or not the grants were being applied for the purpose for which they were intended, the Auditor told us:</PARA>
<PARA> The performance indicators in a lot of cases did not provide the Department with information to enable it to assess whether the project was meeting its objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Department did not have in place a program, policy or system which allowed it to assess whether or not the funds were being used for the purpose for which they were intended. It is not without significance to note that in Western Australia, when we had this absolute imbroglio, confusion, chaos, incompetence and, in some cases, corruption, the departmental head was Cedric Wyatt, who for his sins was promoted by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Gerry Hand, to the position of General Manager of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). At a time of apparent crisis in the ADC, when new, competent and efficient management was needed, it got a personally hand-picked appointment who had reigned over the Department in Western Australia, which the Auditor-General referred to in the report in a most scathing way. I put it down as nothing higher than gross inefficiency and incompetence. It certainly reflects on the Minister's judgment in his choice of people. It indicates to me that he is concerned more about the politics of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs than he is about the Aboriginals involved and the assurance that they receive the funds which are allocated by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not without significance that when I-not once, twice or thrice, but on numerous occasions-raised problems of incompetence and mismanagement in Western Australian communities, referred to audit reports, read figures into the Hansard record and demonstrated to the Government that there were major problems in the Department of Aboriginal Affair in Western Australia, neither the Department nor the Minister wanted to know about it. I could not get a response. Eight weeks after asking fundamental questions-such as, `What grants are unacquitted?'-I have not received the answers. The Minister and the Department do not know. But 30 seconds after turning to the Auditor-General's special report I read the answers. I asked the Minister why the grants were not acquitted and after eight weeks he still does not know. Yet the Auditor-General, in his brief and efficient report, was able to tell me. When I asked Senator Tate whether or not the departmental officers were sufficiently skilled to deal with the matters-the matters being 151 unacquitted grants-Senator Tate answered yes; not with qualification or a suggestion that there was some doubt. He said without qualification that the departmental officers were sufficiently skilled to deal with the matters before them-the matters contained within the report which reflects badly on those same officers. </PARA>
<PARA> When I raised in this Parliament the fact that one employee of an Aboriginal community had clearly and grossly misappropriated funds for his own purpose and written cheques out for himself as unrepayable loans-a cute way of doing business, I might say-I was told by the Minister that it was not a matter for the Department; it was a matter for the community involved. When I asked the Minister whether he or the Department accepted any responsibility for the competence, efficiency or integrity of the employees of these communities, I was informed that that was a matter for the communities concerned. In other words, what we are being told by the Minister is that, in respect of the hundreds of millions of dollars which are provided through grants appropriated by this Parliament to Aboriginal communities, the management of those funds and the responsibility for their accountability rest exclusively in the hands of employees selected by the communities and are not matters which impinge upon the responsibilities or concerns of the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Almost without exception, the five pages of questions-25 questions and 92 subquestions-asked of Senator Tate on notice in December last year are answered, in either a general or a specific way, in the Auditor-General's report. Yet the Department does not have the answers. What an indictment of the Department when it cannot tell us what money is outstanding, to whom it is outstanding, why it is outstanding and under what circumstances it is outstanding. The Department does not know who owes it money. Yet one can go to the Auditor-General's report and find out precisely. In respect of the efficiency of the Department in Western Australia in its own internal audit, which I have questioned on a number of occasions, the Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA>Apart from a recent visit to the Derby and Geraldton Regional Offices by departmental officers seconded for the purpose, no internal check or internal audit has been conducted in Western Australia since 1986. </PARA>
<PARA>There has not been one single internal audit into the affairs or finances of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in Western Australia since 1986. The Auditor-General tells us:</PARA>
<PARA>Audit considers that the absence of satisfactory internal check-internal audit coverage has contributed to the deficiencies within the Region and recommends that appropriate remedial action be taken to institute a more effective coverage in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Auditor-General is telling us that the Department has failed in a primary responsibility; it has failed to have internal audits. The only internal audits that took place, took place in Derby and Geraldton as a result of crises there which even this Department ultimately was forced to deal with. Those reports were done by Mr Lyne and Mr Dunlevy between 15 and 25 August 1988. The reports were of the most indictable nature. They reflected in the most gross way upon the Department's efficiency and competence. What has been done about it? Absolutely nothing has been done about it. We cannot get answers from the Department or from the Minister. After eight weeks, the Department still has not provided the answers to fundamental questions. </PARA>
<PARA> The report states in respect of compliance with grant conditions:</PARA>
<PARA> Audit found that some grant funded organisations have consistently failed to comply with grant conditions and Departmental action to overcome deficiencies has, in some cases, been unsuccessful . . . Audit identified evidence of poor management and non-compliance with grant conditions by some of the grant funded organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there are very real problems in the Department in Western Australia and absolutely nothing has been done about them. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I note that today, Thursday, is the last day of this sitting and we shall not be sitting for another three weeks. It is not without significance that, every time there is a report pending which has an odour or stench of corruption or incompetence about it which will without doubt embarrass the Government and reflect upon the Minister, the report is introduced into the Parliament in its dying days so that it can escape proper scrutiny, examination, questioning and, most importantly, proper debating. The Government, wilfully no doubt, has introduced this report now so that it has three weeks to compose itself, to compose answers and to find excuses as to why Mr Gerry Hand has presided over an incompetent Department, a failed Department, and yet is determined to press on with restructuring, which can only plunge the Department into further chaos. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to commence my remarks on the report of the Auditor-General, the special audit report into the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, where Senator Crichton-Browne left off. This report, which was tabled in the Parliament today, was completed, I note, on 17 February. It has been tabled today in the Parliament an hour or so before the Parliament is to rise for three weeks. It is a report of the gravest magnitude. It is the most damning indictment one could ever read of the administration of a department and its agencies by a Minister. The fact that the Government has seen fit to table this report only in the last hour or so of a two-week sitting, with a three-week break to come, is an absolute disgrace. The reasons are patently obvious. It is a purely political ploy to try to divert the parliamentary heat away from this report in the hope that it will dissipate in the next three weeks in which the Parliament is not sitting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is obvious that will not occur. This report, the most damning and damaging indictment I have ever read of the administration of any department by any Minister, will not go away. I expect-indeed, I demand-that between now and the Parliament's resumption in three weeks time there will be a new Minister of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs because no Minister could remain a Minister of the Crown after having been indicted in the manner this report has done. </PARA>
<PARA> I come from Victoria. Over the last few months I have witnessed an example in Victoria of what has been occurring at the Federal level on the part of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) regarding his patronage and protection of an incompetent Minister. In Victoria over the last few months we have had the disgraceful debacle, until it was resolved by Mr Fordham's resignation, of a Premier trying to protect a Minister-in this case it was the Deputy Premier-in the face of the most obvious and damning indictment of his administration of a major area of funding in my State, namely, the Victorian Economic Development Corporation. It was only by the efforts of diligent people that in the end, and months too late, that final action was taken by the Deputy Premier, Mr Fordham himself, because he realised that the heat was so hot he could no longer stay in the kitchen. The same applied to the Premier, who felt the heat increasing day by day. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Prime Minister: Prime Minister, if you do not, on the basis of this report, demand the immediate resignation of your Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, and, if he does not give you that resignation, if you do not sack him immediately you will bring on your head and on your Government's head a smell and a smear that will stay with you until the next election, as quickly as that may occur. This report is a report of the gravest magnitude. I do not propose, nor are we on this side of the chamber in a position, to go into all the details of the report in this debate. The one thing that is certain is that this report will not go away; it will be debated fully in the Parliament and elsewhere over the period ahead. Given the very limited opportunity we have had to have a look at this report this afternoon, some things have become immediately obvious. As I have said, it is a very damning report. It is the most damning report I have ever read of any government administration. The critical point about it is that the problem has not suddenly emerged. There is no way that the Government, the Prime Minister or the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs can say that they were not forewarned. I turn to page 2 of the report. Right at the very start it says:</PARA>
<PARA>While no large and complex organisation is without fault, Audit believes the standard of administration the review has revealed is lower than acceptable and that remedial measures are required. The finding is consistent with past audit findings. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, this is not something new; this is not something that has just emerged in recent months. It was given a higher public profile late last year in a series of Estimates Committee E hearings, in particular, but it has also arisen in other ways. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, you are a member of a committee that has been looking at aspects of the administration of the Department. You know, as we all know, that this is a sore that has been festering for a long time. Not one thing has been done until very recently to attempt to correct the grave deficiencies that have been patently obvious to everyone, including the Aboriginal communities themselves. For years the deficiencies have been patently obvious for everyone to see. The real tragedy of this is that the losers are the Aboriginal people of Australia themselves. They are the sufferers. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been squandered each year without accountability and in ways which have benefited the supposed recipients, namely, the Aboriginal people of Australia, to only a minor degree. </PARA>
<PARA> This report goes to the heart of what is needed for the efficient utilisation of funds for the betterment of the Aboriginal communities. The report makes it absolutely clear that that has not happened and that those communities have been the sufferers as a result. I would like to raise a couple of specific subjects. Firstly, I refer to the provision of half a million dollars to Tranby College, supposedly for the conduct of negotiations for a treaty with Aborigines. The record of the decisions within the ADC to provide these funds is contained on pages 12 to 16 of the report. These paragraphs contain some extraordinary statements. They say that Mr Perkins, in his capacity at that time of, I think, Acting Chairman of the ADC, moved at the July 1988 meeting of the board of the Commission that $500,000 be provided for the conduct of negotiations in relation to the proposed treaty. Then, at the August meeting of the Commission board, the Acting Deputy Chairman, Mr Dobson, reported that he had attended meetings of the National Coalition of Aboriginal Organisations at Framlingham in Victoria which had been paid for from the $43,000 which had been provided to Tranby a few weeks earlier. Paragraph 2.3.22 of the report, on page 13, states:</PARA>
<PARA> After some discussion at the Board meeting of budgets and controls regarding the remainder of the $500 000, Mr Perkins remarked that funding must be . . . tightly bound, so that the accounting does not rest with individuals. He said that Tranby College was not known as the apex of an administrative body; all accounts must be audited so that it can be proved that funds were expended properly. </PARA>
<PARA> He also advised that Tranby College was negotiating with Cuba and Nicaragua to send students to those countries to study and it might not be wise for the ADC to be involved with that institution. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is page 13, paragraph 2.3.23. It says further that Mr Perkins:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . suggested that the secretariat office for treaty negotiations be based in ADC's Sydney office instead. </PARA>
<PARA>So at least Mr Perkins had an awareness of the extraordinarily sensitive political issues involved. Here was the Commission giving $500,000 to a college that was negotiating with Cuba and Nicaragua to send students to those countries to study. What did Mr Perkins say? He said, `Gee, that would be a pretty sensitive political issue. We will try to take it out of Tranby. We will hide it all. We will get around that by basing the secretariat for the treaty negotiations in the ADC's Sydney office instead'. But he did not get his way. Paragraph 2.3.24, states:</PARA>
<PARA> After further discussion, the Board, on the motion of Mr Perkins-</PARA>
<PARA>so he must have seen that he was on a loser-</PARA>
<PARA>approved that the remainder of the $500,000 be made available as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> $377 000 to Tranby to establish a secretariat ($100 000) and for the conduct of four meetings ($277 000) in different regions of Australia . .</PARA>
<PARA>Also, $80,000 was to be used for other purposes, and some money had already been expended. So, despite the awareness within the Commission that Tranby College was obviously a totally inappropriate place, on administrative and political grounds, for the location of the secretariat, it was located in Tranby College. I guess we can only speculate why it was located there. But, in my book, one pretty fair speculation is that pressure was brought to bear by Mr Dobson and others who are connected with Tranby College as well as the National Coalition of Aboriginal Organisations, which uses Tranby College as a base, to funnel the money that way. </PARA>
<PARA> The next damning statement in the report in relation to that aspect comes in paragraph 2.3.26, in which it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the proposed secretariat for which ADC approved a grant of $100 000, ADC asked Tranby to provide itemised budgets of proposed expenditure. In September 1988 Tranby provided a proposed budget totalling $100 000 and a document on the proposed secretariat. </PARA>
<PARA>I reiterate that the purpose of the secretariat was to be involved with the treaty negotiations. Despite that, paragraph 2.3.26 further states:</PARA>
<PARA>The document indicated that the secretariat would organise meetings for the National Coalition of Aboriginal Organisations to `enable consultation on important issues, i.e. ATSIC-</PARA>
<PARA>this is nothing to do with the treaty-</PARA>
<PARA>the ``proposed'' Treaty, Royal Commission etc.' The document made no further reference to the treaty. The Coalition would determine the agenda for meetings on policy or social and economic issues. </PARA>
<PARA>The next two paragraphs are very illuminating as well. Paragraph 2.3.27 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Tranby's formal Acceptance of Offer of the grant was signed on 27 September 1988 by Mr Kevin Cook (Member of Executive) and Mr Kevin Tory (Chairman) . . .</PARA>
<PARA>They signed in those capacities. The paragraph continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Audit inquiries disclosed that the Chairman is Mr John Short-</PARA>
<PARA>I hasten to add that he is no relation-</PARA>
<PARA>not Mr Tory. ADC's Principal Legal Officer pointed out in October 1988 that Tranby's formal objects would not satisfy the test of an Aboriginal body under the ADC Act. Arrangements were made to have Tranby change its formal objects before making further payments to it. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the initial payment was illegal. Tranby was not legally entitled or legally able to receive that funding. So, what was going to happen was that the formal objects of the organisation were to be changed so that, somehow or other, retrospectively, something that had been illegal was to be rendered legitimate. The next episode in the saga comes in the form of Mr Adams, QC, who indicated in subsequent advisings:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . Tranby would satisfy the definition of an Aboriginal body but that it was not necessary because the treaty negotiations fell within ADC's general power in sub-section 9 (1) of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>I raised with Senator Tate in the Senate early in December the question of inconsistencies between Mr Adams's advice and the advice of the Commission's own principal legal officer. I asked Senator Tate whether this matter had been referred to the Attorney-General's Department for subsequent advice and, if not, whether he would do so as a matter of urgency. He refused, quite obviously, to take any action on that aspect. Mr Hand also refused to take any action on that matter. According to the Auditor- General's report, as outlined at paragraph 2.3.40, the matter was referred to the Attorney-General's Department. That referral by Audit occurred in early February. The Attorney-General's Department disagreed with Mr Adams's advice and:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . expressed the opinion that the payments could not be regarded as coming within ADC's powers under section 24 or the other provisions of the Act. Audit accepts the Department's opinion and passed a copy of it to the ADC on 17 February . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We still have to hear the final response to that matter. But, on all the evidence to date, the payment of $377,000 to Tranby in August/September 1988 was an illegal transaction which was never properly processed within the Commission itself because it was all done without memorandum. When queries were raised by the Commission's own principal legal officer as to the legality of the payment, his questions were overridden by a QC whose advice was not even subsequently tested until the last two or three weeks. It was then found by the Attorney-General's Department to be incorrect advice. I will not pursue the Tranby matter any further at this stage other than to say that I believe that we will hear a great deal more of Tranby in the weeks ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> I move briefly now to another part of the report so as to have recorded in Hansard paragraph 3.4.9 which appears at page 70 of that report. This paragraph relates to policy guidelines. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>An examination of existing policy guidelines by the Working Party established that the guidelines were out of date, unrealistic, not relevant, not measureable, ambiguous and too narrow. The Department was budget rather than policy driven. </PARA>
<PARA>One could not have any more damning statement of the administrative incompetence of a government, a government department and a Minister of the Crown than that comment on the guidelines for the grants for so-called Aboriginal advancement. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I make concerns the conclusions of the report regarding enterprise projects. Those conclusions are to be found on page 59 of the report. I read into Hansard paragraph 2.10.1, which says:</PARA>
<PARA>This audit has shown that (except in Imparja Television) there were serious defects in the particular enterprise projects queried by Senator Tambling and other members of Senate Estimates Committee E. There were also serious defects in many other projects examined in the audit. The audit disclosed that ADC's largest enterprise project, Yeperenye Shopping Centre, suffered from a fundamental flaw under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The comments and contents of this report bear out very strongly all the points that the Opposition has been making for months on this issue. They are points that have been reinforced in this report. It is, in other words, a report which absolutely and totally justifies the demand that we, on this side of the chamber, made months ago-well before Christmas-following the hearings of Estimates Committee E, that there was only one proper course for the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to take, and that was to resign. If he did not resign, the Prime Minister was bound to dismiss him. The report confirms that demand. I again demand the resignation of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>

I do not know whether, in the period available to me, between now and the scheduled time for the adjournment motion to be put, I will have sufficient time to complete the remarks that I would wish to make on this matter. It may be, therefore, that as I am duty Minister for any adjournment debate I might make some further comments in replying to matters raised on the adjournment. I signal that now in case I am unable to complete my comments within the time span remaining.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was not in the chamber when the matter was brought on for debate by Senator Tambling. I must say, though, that the diatribe that I have heard has a familiar ring and the venting of spleen that has been going on across the chamber is not at all unusual on this issue. I say-and I note that this is the first opportunity that I have actually had to speak on this matter-that I am not the Minister who carries the responsibility for Aboriginal Affairs in this chamber. That is capably and ably done by the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate). </PARA>

<PARA> What we have heard is a smearing of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) and the Minister who represents the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in this chamber. The word `smear' is the appropriate word. I will not resile from the use of that word despite what has been said in this debate. Indeed, one of the sad aspects of this whole issue has been that, in my hearing at different times when this debate has been conducted, honourable senators have attempted to smear not only Ministers who obviously have access to the parliamentary forum and can defend themselves but also some citizens who I know by personal knowledge to be upright and decent people have had their names taken in vain. They do not have access to this forum to defend themselves. Numerous wild accusations have been made in this debate this afternoon. One of them I should identify; the rest are too great in number to refer to in detail. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne and Senator Short both said that the Government was involved in some sort of plot by bringing this report into the chamber on the last day of a fortnight's sitting and that this action was somehow devious, mischievous and deceitful. I reject all of those propositions. Those claims are ridiculous. Senator Short, at least, had the lack of logic of mind or the sincerity of purpose to say later in his remarks, `this matter will not go away; it will be debated in the period ahead'. The Government in no sense accepts any of the allegations made by Senator Short and Senator Crichton-Browne that there is any deceit involved in bringing this report forward at this time. There is patently not. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the media in Canberra recently and at Question Time today there has been substantial speculation about whether a potentially successful candidate in the recent Australian Capital Territory election, Mr Stevenson, is an Australian citizen. There has been a lot of other speculation about that gentleman as well, to which I do not wish to refer so much this evening. I do not know whether Mr Stevenson is an Australian citizen. At Question Time today, Senator Robert Ray said that, as far as he could ascertain, there was no record of Mr Stevenson's citizenship. In response to Senator Ray's remark, Mr Stevenson was reported in the news tonight as having said, `Let them continue with their vile slanders'. Firstly, I do not think it is a vile slander to say that someone is not an Australian citizen. Secondly, I am not actually alleging that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I am saying is that Mr Stevenson has an obligation to establish the facts. It is very hard to prove that someone is not an Australian citizen. It is extremely easy to prove that one is an Australian citizen. If someone alleged that I was not properly elected because I was not an Australian citizen, I would say, `I was born in Mount Lawley in Western Australia on 10 December 1947 and here is my birth certificate'. I suspect that any member of the Senate would say something similar, or, `Here is my passport', or, `Here is other evidence', or, `This is the date on which I was born and I will go to the Registrar and get the evidence'. But Mr Stevenson has declined to do so. He may be playing some clever game; I do not know. He may think this is a smart way of drawing a lot of attention to his otherwise unsavoury reputation. But 7,000 people voted for him last Saturday. They said that they wanted him to represent them in the Legislative Assembly. I suspect that if there were an election tomorrow he would be lucky to get seven votes. But that is not the point. Those people voted for him. It does not matter what Senator Ray, Senator Reid or I say about him. His obligation is to those people who voted for him. It is not to be a smart alec by saying, `Let them carry on with their vile slanders', but to establish his bona fides as a person entitled to stand for the Legislative Assembly. He has not done so. He has had ample opportunity to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the 265,000 people whom I represent here and on behalf of the 7,000 people who voted for him, of whom I certainly was not one, I now call on him to do so. He has an obligation to do the easy thing, just to prove that he is an Australian citizen or to say that he is not and get out of our hair, because he is giving the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly a bad name; he is giving democracy a bad name. In the interests of democracy, in the interests of the people who voted for him and in the interests of the good government of the Territory, I say to him, `Stand up. Prove you are an Australian citizen. It is very easy. Do not play any more smart games. You are an Australian citizen or you are not; prove it and have done with the matter and let us get on with the good government of the Capital Territory'. </PARA>
