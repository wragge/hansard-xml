<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This package of Bills provides funding in line with government policies for schools, technical and further education and higher education. Specifically, the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill 1989 amends the 1988 principal Act to provide an additional $36.6m in appropriations for schools in 1989, bringing total funding for 1989 to $1,982m. That amounts to almost $2 billion for schools this year. The Bill, in effect, increases Commonwealth funding to take account of price increases and for this year only makes adjustments in Australian Capital Territory (ACT) school funding to take account of the advent of self-government in the Territory. The second Bill, the States Grants (Technical and Further Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1989, also increases appropriations to reflect cost movements and will provide funding to the ACT from 1 July. Supplementation amounting to $9.5m is provided by the Bill. The third Bill, the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1989, also supplements funding for higher education, taking into account additional costs. The Bill also takes into account the new structure for the overseas student program and the new arrangements in the Australian Capital Territory for education following self-government in the Australian Capital Territory. The Bill provides an additional $24m this year, $20m in 1990 and $2m in 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These three Bills provide supplementary funds in the usual manner in which we consider this kind of supplementation at this time of the year. On behalf of the Opposition and in consonance with my colleagues in the House of Representatives, I shall move the following amendment in relation to these Bills:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion add: ``, but the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) condemns the Government for its policies on schools, TAFE and higher education; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) calls on the Government to adopt policies that will facilitate the true advancement of education in Australia''</PARA>
<PARA> The fourth Bill dealt with cognately in this debate is the Student Assistance Amendment Bill 1989. This measure will not be opposed by the Opposition. First, it provides that wording in legislation with regard to the new vocabulary for higher education be brought up to date. Secondly, it relaxes reliance on administrative procedures, in so far as they have up to this point required direct ministerial decision. This flexibility is sensible and is supported by the Opposition. Thirdly, it makes for more flexible appeal procedures under Austudy with regard to student assistance. Again, there are sensible reasons for this flexibility, and the Opposition supports this aspect of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> My caution about the Bill relates to the attempt to introduce a simplification of the Austudy Act to enable a proposed set of simplified regulations to be implemented. The student assistance legislation has been with us in this form since 1973. Over that 16-year period most interested bodies around Australia have come to understand the student assistance regulations. I do not believe that it is an urgent priority to try some rationalisation or simplification, because such innovation may, in fact, complicate the matter. In any event, within a year or so, the Opposition will be in government and we will undertake a comprehensive review of Austudy arrangements. The appropriate time for those changes to be made would be then. So I do not encourage the change that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) indicated in his second reading speech is to be undertaken at this time to simplify the regulations for student assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the Student Assistance Amendment Bill 1989, I shall move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add: ``, but the Senate condemns the Government for:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) its inability to appreciate the special needs for assistance of students from rural areas; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the turmoil caused by its policies on, and administration of, assistance of students in higher education institutions''. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will know that July marks the two-year anniversary of this lacklustre, fizzling-out Labor Government. It also marks the second year in the office of Minister for Employment, Education and Training of the present Minister, Mr John Dawkins. This package of Bills provides an opportunity for the Senate to review the impact that this Western Australian member of the House of Representatives has had on education during the last two years. It has been a dramatic two years in which the Minister has done great damage to education in this country, all in the name of reform. John Dawkins has identified some real problems in education, particularly higher education and, to a lesser extent, schools. Largely, he has left schools on the back burner. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister did not have to go far to find out what the problems were. The coalition spelt out the widely canvassed problems in black and white in our education policies in the run-up to the last election. I give credit to Mr Dawkins for reading our policies and discovering the need for change. He discovered the need for objectives such as a dramatic increase in the number of students studying in our universities and colleges. Under former Minister Susan Ryan, we had plateaued entirely in higher education and there was very little growth. There was the increasing problem of unmet demand. A second objective he has discovered from reading our policies is the need to abolish the restrictive binary funding system which denied research funding to colleges of advanced education and institutes of technology. Another objective he has picked up from us is the need to restructure the system of academic tenure along the lines of a Senate inquiry into tenure, to make it sounder, more flexible, more accountable, and generally more bona fide. </PARA>
<PARA> Another objective Mr Dawkins picked up was the need to have a better skilled and better educated work force. Do honourable senators remember the day I suggested that to relate education in schools to future employment was some sacrilege against the goals of the progressive educators? Increasingly we have gained public acceptance, even among educationalists themselves, for the idea that the principal outcome for any school leaver is the lifetime of work, and that his schoolings ought, not indirectly but directly, to relate to his being a skilled, educated participant in the work force. This is for his own fulfilment and for the betterment of Australia. Again, this is clearly underlined by the acceptance of this objective by Minister Dawkins. </PARA>
<PARA> A fifth objective that I believe is picked up from our policy statement is the need for improved standards in our school system. As I have said, these are all objectives which Mr Dawkins has borrowed heavily from the Liberal and National parties. However, that is only half the solution to gaining some of these objectives. The other half is to work out a practical way of achieving those objectives. That is the half that Mr Dawkins has got wrong. Unfortunately, the methods he has adopted will not provide solutions. He is heavy handed and centralist in the methods he has adopted. The only relief from these muddled methods will be the election of a Liberal-National Party government to get not only the objectives right but also the methods right to achieve those objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider higher education in a little more detail. Mr Dawkins has acknowledged the need for reform in higher education, but he has gone about revolutionising the system and bringing it under his own control through highly centralised, highly bureaucratic and highly authoritarian legislation. These reforms have been forced through Parliament without adequate scrutiny, without adequate debate and without adequate justification. Late last year, in December, as the whole nation will remember, the House of Representatives was recalled for one day, principally to deal with the education Bills which had been rushed through the House of Representatives weeks before after only two hours of debate. Anyone who reads that pathetic debate will see that the legislation did not come under any careful scrutiny whatever which was expressly the intent of Minister Dawkins. It was only here in the Senate-I see Senator Macklin sitting across the chamber-that the Opposition gave careful scrutiny to the legislation. Debate spread over three days which led to significant amendments being made which clearly flagged for this Parliament and for the Australian public the alternative approach that ought to be adopted and which ultimately can be adopted only with a change of government. </PARA>
<PARA> These very important education Bills, the outcome of Mr Dawkins's first year of decision making as Minister, were guillotined in the House of Representatives, pushed through-let no-one here deny it-in just 2 1/2 hours. The Government allowed 2 1/2 hours for scrutinising Bills introducing major educational reforms and providing some $18 billion-let me repeat that, $18 billion-for education in this country over the next three or four years. We also saw how much attention Mr Dawkins paid to the views and comments of those involved in education when he took his Green Paper around Australia inviting comment. The public will know that when a government is embarking upon some major areas of reform, it will publish a document called a Green Paper, an options paper. Mr Dawkins published a Green Paper, but there was no consultation before that publication. The idea was that there would be some response from all the interested bodies around Australia and then the Government's decisions would be published in a White Paper about nine months later. </PARA>
<PARA> It was hardly surprising to find that despite the barrage of protest and the genuinely constructive comment offered to Mr Dawkins from many quarters, his higher education Green Paper conveniently became the actual White Paper. Can anyone in this chamber point to any significant change between the White Paper and the Green Paper? This centralist, heavy-handed Minister just ploughed on thinking he had got it all right. He gave the Government's decisions in the middle of last year, without any major change from those that he had, with his own limited consultation, determined in the Green Paper some nine months earlier. There was hardly a change. The document was practically xeroxed and given a new cover-the Government just changed the paint. So much for consultation, so much for listening to those involved in the academic community, such as researchers, teachers, students and administrators. As a result we have a higher education reform program with major defects, particularly because of the Minister's obsession with forced amalgamation, centralised decision making and bureaucratic control. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to the unified national system. The Dawkins reform package is well under way, but the greatest damage is yet to be done. It will occur once all institutions have been brought into the so-called unified national system. It sounds pretty horrific, does it not? This system will take decision making in higher education out of the hands of the institutions and place it into the hands of the bureaucrats. P. P. McGuinness wrote in the Australian Financial Review in July last year that Mr Dawkins wanted to turn the higher education system into a gigantic bureaucratic shemozzle designed to suppress originality of research and initiative. Under the unified system universities and colleges have to submit a profile, a set of objectives, a plan. There is nothing wrong with having a plan or a set of objectives, but let it be one that is initiated by the institution-the university or the college of advanced education. Let those organisations be responsible for the objectives which are tailored to the needs of those whom they serve. Do not let this profile be thrust upon them by backdoor negotiations by a centralist Minister in Canberra. As long as their plans conform to the wishes of Canberra, the universities will receive full funding. But if they do not have a profile which has been negotiated in the backrooms and which is acceptable to this centralist Minister, let it be understood that they will not get the full funding-they will not get the money. The institutions have no bargaining power. The Opposition fears that it will be Canberra, not the institutions who know, which determines the face of higher education in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The traditional academic autonomy of our institutions is under serious threat. I make this very serious charge: it is the Opposition's firm view that after more than a century of enlightened development in higher education in this country, the present arrangements by the Minister place traditional academic authority under serious threat. Success in attracting research funds will be as much a product of selling an institutional profile in Canberra as of excellence in research. More than that, whilst I welcome and support the formation of the Australian Research Council, the ARC, I believe that it is too centralised and too interfering with the autonomy of peer groups of researchers around this country. The clawback of research moneys from institutions is a mistake which the Government still has not corrected. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition has placed much emphasis on the need for institutional autonomy. We believe in freeing up the system in order to let it expand. I have said on a number of occasions that the person I respect most, who has contributed most to education in this country over the last 20 years, is Professor Peter Karmel. He has had more impact on our higher education system and on our schools than any other Australian. The advice that he gave to successive governments was worthy, sensible and enlightened. The Karmel period, from 1973 to the mid-1980s, is over. That rationalisation, that achievement of standards, that injection of additional resources, even the degree of amalgamation that took place in that time, have been achieved. In order to get the best objectives for education in this country we need to see that the Karmel period is over. We need to give increased freedom and encourage a genuine sharing of objectives with the institutions, to give them an initiative, an opportunity for creativity. We have the standard, the foundation, the rationalised base. To go further in that direction is an error. That is why we condemn centralisation, rationalisation, amalgamation, bureaucratisation. There will be a clear change with the election of a Liberal-National Party government. We will stop those processes. We will gain the objectives which Dawkins has picked up from us through increasing the freedom of our higher education institutions and giving them the ability to initiate. </PARA>
<PARA> As my time is rapidly coming to a close I will need to consider amalgamation more briefly than I had intended. The amalgamation question is an area of enormous contrast between the Government and the Opposition. We will support amalgamation only where there is a clear educational advantage in doing so. Where there is not a clear educational advantage that is mutually agreed by the amalgamating institutions, or the institutions proposed for amalgamation, we will oppose the amalgamation. It has already been made clear that here, in this city, Dawkins wants three institutions-the Canberra Institute of the Arts, the Canberra College of Advanced Education and the Australian National University-to be the new ANU. This Opposition is opposed to that. Why is bigger better? What is the educational advantage in that proposed amalgamation? There is none. Invite any senator here in this chamber to show where there would be an educational advantage. The costs would be greater and there would be inherent difficulties caused by the different locations of the campuses. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now very clear that that amalgamation proposal is dead because this Opposition and the Australian Democrats have opposed that legislation. This is an indication of the Opposition's approach to any other amalgamation that is being discussed in any of the Territories or the States. If an institute can publicly give a reason to support its involvement in amalgamation and define in a credible way the educational advantages that would flow from that change, then by all means let the amalgamation proceed. If that does not happen then the coalition, both in opposition and in government, will oppose any such amalgamation. Let institutions be clearly warned that should they forsake, in some cases, a whole century of autonomy as well as objectives and profiles for the sake of some millions of dollars in the short term, the Opposition does not guarantee to continue that situation should it be elected to government in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> The graduate tax has stirred up more opposition to Government in educational circles than has any other measure. Madam Acting Deputy President, you understand this matter. Without wanting to embarrass you, I know that there are many in your Party who are not at all convinced that the Dawkins decision to go ahead with the graduate tax was a good one. The Liberal and National parties will abolish the graduate tax after the next election. We will ensure that the too onerous user-pays burden placed on the students of Australia by the Dawkins decision will be lifted. The contribution from students will be diminished to one-third of what it is now. Instead of a graduate tax of $1,800, we will have a direct student fee of $600. But, for one-quarter of all the higher education students in Australia, even that fee will be abolished. One-quarter of the students in higher education institutions will be admitted completely free. The awarding of those free places will be based partly on academic grounds and partly on financial grounds. Those students in greatest need can be assured that under a Liberal-National Party government there will be no contribution required of them under the user-pays principle. The onerous burden of $1,800 a year that has been laid on three-quarters of Australian students by this Labor Government will be reduced to one-third-$600. </PARA>
<PARA> Under a coalition government institutions will be free to chart their own futures, negotiate pay and conditions with academic staff, devise their own curricula and research programs, and compete with each other for students and funds. Universities and colleges will be freed from Labor's centralist reforms through the abolition of Labor's unified national system, forced amalgamations, compulsory contract funding and graduate tax. The National Board for Employment, Education and Training will be made independent of government. I will refer to schools and technical and further education (TAFE) institutions in the committee stage. I do not omit reference to those areas because they lack priority. Speeches and published policies of members of the Opposition make it very clear that we regard as important the urgent need for innovation in and betterment of schools and TAFEs. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the coalition's education policy provides for choice, excellence and individual responsibility. In contrast, Labor's education policy stands for standardisation, centralisation and mediocrity. We seek to reward initiative but Labor cuts everyone down to the same low standard. The coalition looks for sound foundations in all fields of education and a concentration on mastering basic educational skills. The coalition recognises that parents have priority in determining the education of their children. Families need to be asked what they want, rather than what the educators want, for their children. I seek leave to move the two amendments together. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have operated for a long time in the education area. I suppose one of the hazards of that occupation is that one has to listen to more florid speeches than in any other area. The education area is full of articles, books and speeches which all suggest that things should be improved. One would rarely want to disagree with such sentiments. However, I think the more important and pressing task is to delineate precisely how that will be achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today we are debating the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1989, the States Grants (Technical and Further Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1989, the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill 1989 and the Student Assistance Amendment Bill 1989. The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill seeks, amongst other things, that at least some funding will be provided through the Australian Capital Territory Government. This highlights sharply the Government's intent to bring about forced amalgamations of higher education institutions, not only in this Territory but also in the States. This legislation attempts to do a number of things. It is very similar to the Fraser Government's ill-fated attempts. I do not think it has its target clearly in view; nor does it provide a detailed analysis of its aims to enable those aims to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> Undoubtedly, one problem that exercises many people's minds is the so-called proliferation of courses in Australian institutions. The proliferation of courses has arisen not only because of a number of geographical factors but also because of economic factors. The geographical factors include the vast distances involved and the demands of the separate States to have within State borders educational offerings of a comprehensive kind. Another problem is that of economics. As is the case in so many other areas, the economic issue ought to be paid a lot more attention than it has been. I think it has led the Government into the rather silly and absurd operations that it is attempting around Australia at the moment. If the vast bulk of those types of amalgamations go ahead, nothing would have been gained. </PARA>
<PARA> That is probably no better illustrated than in my own State of Queensland, where the suggestion now is to break up the Brisbane College of Advanced Education (CAE), which was the result of amalgamations of previous colleges under the Fraser Government. The absurdity of the context does not seem to have struck anybody. We are now about to divide something that a few years ago was considered to be essential to be put together. At that stage, the various independent campuses and colleges around Brisbane were amalgamated into one. Additional funds were provided over the following years to assist that to come about. In other words, there were not any economic gains made. But now, after a passage of years, those various campuses are finally working together as a single institution, as happens with time in almost any circumstance. Now that everything has settled down, it is proposed to break it all up again. </PARA>
<PARA> For what reason? One of the reasons given is that the Mount Gravatt campus of the Brisbane CAE has a certain proximity to Griffith University, and it does. It is divided by a six-lane highway, but this does not seem to faze anybody. It is in the same general area and, therefore, must be seen to be somehow or other contiguous not only in geographical proximity but also in educational intent. That is absolutely absurd. Nobody has bothered arguing the second reason. No arguments in this whole amalgamation debate around Australia have been premised on educational grounds; they have all been arm-waving with regard to administrative efficiency which, in most cases, has never been demonstrated. </PARA>
<PARA> Another example from Queensland is the intent to amalgamate the Queensland Conservatorium of Music with the Queensland University, which currently has a very high quality music school but which tends more towards the theoretical. The Conservatorium is, of course, a practical based and performance based school. People say, `Look at the very small size of the Queensland Conservatorium of Music'. Indeed, it has just over 400 students. They say, `This could not possibly be administratively efficient'. The difficulty with that particular argument is that it takes no cognisance of the educational intent of that institution which, as I say, is a performance based music school. </PARA>
<PARA> The major music schools around the world-for example, the Juliard School of Music, the Berlin School and the Royal School of Music-all have about 400 students. The bell does not seem to have dropped on anybody in particular that the top performance music schools around the world all have about the same number of students, which is a little over 400. I wonder why that is. Has anybody bothered asking? Has anybody sought to find out? The answer is very plain when one investigates the structures of those schools. There is a range of music performances. The relationship between staff and students in almost all those colleges around the world is 2 to 1. The schools are performance based. One has to have a number of specialities in each area of music. The total number of staff required, plus an increment for administration comes to a little under 200. That means that such a school can have a little over 400 pupils. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a simple exercise to have done, but no-one seems to have done it. No-one seems at all interested in doing it. Yet the Queensland Conservatorium of Music invariably performs the best of any music school in this country in every competition that takes place. But, no, that is not good enough. Quality is not good enough. Achievement is not good enough. Administrative efficiency must come first. But again, no administrative efficiency has been demonstrated; it is merely posited. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks in general across the board at the difficulties that we are having in Australia with regard, as I say, to possibly a proliferation of courses, one might ask the question `How could we deal with this particular problem in a constructive, efficient and effective manner?'. I think there is a way to do it but unfortunately it does not recommend itself, obviously, to anybody within the Department of Employment, Education and Training-and certainly it does not seem to recommend itself to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins). That way is to look towards the notion of quality as the driving force rather than administration. I would suggest a simple way in which that could come about. Honourable senators in the chamber have probably heard it before but I am going to repeat it, nevertheless. That is that one looks at matters not from the point of view of the institution or the staff; one looks at the students. </PARA>
<PARA> I take Sydney as probably a prime example of the difficulty that we have in Australia. The Sydney institutions are basically locked up to students who live in Sydney. People who live in Adelaide or Townsville cannot afford to go there unless they happen to have a favourite aunt who is willing to give them a bedroom and who happens to live within striking distance of the university. The cost of accommodation in Sydney is absolutely prohibitive; the cost of transport in Sydney likewise. So Sydney institutions are taken out. Canberra institutions are taken out; and so we go on progressively around the country, so that, by and large, most of our institutions are locked up for those people who happen to live in the capital cities where they are placed. </PARA>
<PARA> How do we change that? Instead of this wild business of running around amalgamating the people who administer these organisations, we should be providing reasonably cheap, good standard student accommodation. We should come at the problem from the other end. That accommodation should be both on and off campus; it should include single, multiple and family accommodation. Any moneys spent there would be recouped because they would be an investment in that all of the students would be paying rent. When those institutional establishments are vacant for periods over the holidays and so on, they could provide the universities with a very good grounding for bringing in external students, for conferences or for other types of activities and people one wished to have on campus at the time. In other words, these forms of accommodation would be good money spinners. They would provide that if people were interested in studying, for example, criminal law and they decided that the best place to do that would be at Sydney University, they would apply to go to Sydney University and the university would then be able, if it accepted them into a place there, to provide them with access to reasonable accommodation. Likewise, if people wanted to do marine biology, they would apply to James Cook University and, if accepted, would be provided with reasonably priced accommodation suitable for their needs. </PARA>
<PARA> What would happen as a result of that little exercise-not immediately, but in time-is that pressure would start to build up on specialists. The pressure would be on the quality of the particular institution and we would find some departments in some faculties in institutions around Australia going to the wall because they could not attract students. That is the way that things ought to be done. That is the way that various departments-and faculties, even-should be taken out of the systems. It should be done not by bureaucrats who know absolutely nothing about the situation in Perth, Darwin or anywhere else waving their arms here in Canberra, but by the students voting with their feet to choose a quality of education somewhere else in the country. The pressure would be constantly towards quality. </PARA>
<PARA> Most people do not seem to actually understand the operation of institutions-that staff do not attract students terribly much; it is the other way around. Top quality students tend to attract staff. Staff are interested in working with good research students, good performers and people who are undertaking second and higher degrees. With those students available staff are able to push through their own research projects more expeditiously and to greater effect. In other words, various institutions around the country would start to be able to attract top quality staff as well. And so the thing would roll. But it would roll on the issue of quality; it would not roll on the issue of administrative fiat. </PARA>
<PARA> One would have thought that, when looking at what the previous Government did in this exercise, the Government would have actually learnt some lessons. But no lessons have been learnt; the exercise is being perpetrated all over again. At the end of the exercise we will have fewer institutions. Can anybody assert where we will get better quality teaching and research? Nobody has been able to assert that; not only that, but we will not even get extra places. </PARA>
<PARA> What are these illusory benefits? We have not even been able to demonstrate them in saving dollars on administration. As I indicated, under the previous Government those amalgamated institutions cost more, not less, to run. A multi-campus institution costs more to run than a single campus institution. The odd thing about all of this is that the people who are funding and fuelling this policy exercise do not seem to have actually looked at business recently. They do not seem to have any understanding that the major conglomerates around the world and the major multinationals that exist in Australia are breaking themselves up into smaller units. They have ceased to believe, as obviously someone in the Education Department still believes, that big is better and beautiful. Major organisations are now looking for pure levels of administration, more openness and accountability. One does not get that by massing people; one gets it by breaking the groups up. Hence, one finds that the major companies around the world have fewer people administering them now because they have been broken down into smaller groups than was previously the case. That does not seem to have dawned on anybody. However, that is being taught in the very institutions that are now being forced to amalgamate and become larger. Does anybody ever listen to what people know and have found out about administration and organisations? Where did this 8,000 figure come from? It is another figure that popped out of the air. </PARA>

The method is similar to that used by the previous Government when it found a shopping list floating around somewhere for a totally different purpose and actually used it for the amalgamation exercise. I have already illustrated where there is a connection between numbers and educational purpose. Perhaps the Minister when he replies at the second reading stage might like to posit some arguments about the 8,000 figure because I have not heard one argument on this yet. Why not 7,000? Why not 9,000? They are nice figures as well. They tip off the tongue as easily as 8,000. We need to have some reasons given when these types of things occur; none has been given. We need to look at the latest operational and administrative theories and the way that they have been implemented in business so that we can see where efficiencies are. That is not being done in this exercise either.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Queensland case is one of the sillier examples. There are also some rather silly ones operating around the country. There are reasons for amalgamation and rationalisation but those reasons are educational and quality reasons; they are not administrative. Administration will follow quality: it cannot lead it. It is always the belief, I suppose, of those who operate in this atmosphere in Canberra that by waving one's arms around here, somehow or other things will get better elsewhere. Unfortunately, it has not occurred in the past. It will not occur in the future. We are just in for another bout of wasting people's time, consuming vast quantities of resources, with people worrying about what is happening, with the productivity at the other end being zero, if it is not already negative. People's lives, research and institutional arrangements have been massively disrupted in the interim.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The situation in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), where there are two institutions, is particularly silly. The obvious way to go is to have the Canberra College of Advanced Education (CCAE) become a Canberra university under the control of the ACT Government. I am sorry that that matter did not turn up in the legislation. Signadou College was brought in under the ACT but the CCAE was not. It should be under the control of the Territory Government. The Australian National University (ANU) should remain a national university with national goals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is obvious. If we did not have two institutions in Canberra we probably would not establish two, because of the cost. But we have two fine institutions. The ACT Government, like every other State and Territory government in Australia, needs to involve itself in the tertiary sector. It is involved in the primary and technical and further education (TAFE) sectors. It needs to be involved in the tertiary sector as well. That would give a rounding of the educational policy, it would give direction to educational policy and it would give thrust to educational policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ACT Administration has set up a committee which is looking at this issue. Despite the fact that it has no administrative control over the CCAE at the moment, it has already seen the need to look at this issue in the interests of the citizens of Canberra. The CCAE most definitely should be a university: it should be the Canberra university, dedicated to the interests and the needs of the citizens of Canberra. The ANU should be funded as a national university and propelled towards its original intention, which has been missed, in large part at least, for some time: that is, to be concerned with national concerns, national objectives and national problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The other items that we are dealing with today are the further funding for student assistance, some changes to the Austudy proposals to make them simpler-they could not get more complex-and additional funding for TAFE. With regard to higher education funding, it is emerging from studies being conducted that significant damage is being done to certain sectors, particularly the mature age sector. It has been pointed to previously and has now appeared. I believe that the other sectors that I have already pointed to, part time students and women, will also be affected and will show up in the studies in due course. The Opposition's support for the Government in imposing fees has gone a long way towards setting the damage in train. I indicate that I will move an amendment to the Opposition's amendment in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of proposed amendment, add the following new paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> ``and (c) further condemns the Government and the Opposition for combining to pass these Bills, thereby disadvantaging women, part-time, migrant, mature age and low-income tertiary students''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fees legislation having been passed and the damage started, Senator Teague now says that the Opposition will abolish that legislation. It would have been better had the Opposition not started the damage, left things as they were and implemented its policy-whatever it might be-when in government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fascinating point about the funding of students is that, as revealed in the vice-chancellors' recent document with regard to chances lost, some 13,000 to 20,000 would-be students are still floating around without places. The number of students missing out in the community is still the same. Not only are students missing out, but the country is also missing out. I presume that it does not have to be argued and it is generally accepted that the country misses out every time a student who has the ability and would be accepted is not offered a place. We also find other disturbing figures with regard to our higher education students. Rather than the growth we were looking for, we have, in fact, a decline. The exercise in which the Government has engaged has not attracted very many people to move into that area. The Government has spent a lot of time wandering around the community saying how marvellous it is that it has been able to increase the numbers of students staying on at school. That in itself is a nice cynical little exercise. Having promoted the value of staying on at school and having held out the advantages that are undoubtedly there in further education, we then manage to dash the hopes of students who have worked on and worked hard by not providing them with a place in a tertiary institution. For a long time that sort of cynicism has been built into education policies. That may be fine for politicians and may provide a little bit of rhetoric on the campaign trail, but the real concern must be for families who have been unable to get their children into tertiary institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a pity that we have not been able to keep pace with the growth of population in terms of the numbers in our tertiary institutions. We have not been able to get spectacular growth, which is what we should be looking for, in our higher education area. That is obviously what is needed if the plans of Senator Button and the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) are to come to fruition in the tertiary industry sector-our computer areas, our brain industries and our sunrise industries. If they are supposed to be developed, upon whom are they supposed to be developed if it is not upon the citizens of this country who have been able to undertake primary, second and higher degrees? At the end of the day, that is where the failure lies. It is a failure to conceive the place that education should have in the priority listings and to provide sufficient funds for that. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Government introduced these fees, it said that this strategy would solve the sorts of problems we were facing. Of course, it will not and cannot solve those problems. They can be solved only in one way: not by a maintenance of one per cent, which the Government has been able to achieve, but by an increase in that amount. There should be a concerted, long term exercise of direct funding to the institutions for both educational research purposes and to enable them to build accommodation close to their campuses, if not on their campuses, in order to provide that type of facility to many students. At the end of the day, despite the fact that the fees are most unwelcome and are inhibiting educational opportunity, the real costs in higher education are simply in living, eating, accommodation and transport. We have not addressed those matters. These matters could be addressed not at a vast cost to the community, but at a vast gain. The provision of low cost, good quality student accommodation would not be a cost to the community, but an investment. It would also take the pressure off Austudy where significant increases are being demanded. If good quality, low cost student accommodation were available, then Austudy would not have constant pressure on it. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I remind the Government that my Party supported it on a whole range of taxing initiatives that it undertook particularly in the two very lucrative areas, as it turned out, of the fringe benefits tax and the capital gains tax. We did so because we believed that resources should be made available for items such as this. Unfortunately that has not occurred. The Government has taken the money and run, as it were. It has not seen that the top priority for Australia at the moment is in providing access to our educational institutions at each level and in a way which is commensurate with the other types of economic goals that Australia has set itself. This is the odd area out, the one which is lagging behind and going nowhere. All we are getting is vast amounts of energy, vast amounts of time and very little information dedicated to a task of amalgamations that, at the end of the day, will produce absolutely nothing for the furtherance of true education for Australia's citizens. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of proposed amendment, add the following new paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> ``and (c) further condemns the Government and the Opposition for combining to pass these bills, thereby disadvantaging women, part-time, migrant, mature age and low-income tertiary students''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the major point that has been made about the impact of Government policy on higher education in the last few years, I wish briefly to re-state, as has been stated on a number of occasions, that the Government's objective has been-and we have been successful in it-to facilitate a higher growth rate in higher education. In the Budget last year funding was provided to support a major expansion of higher education in the system over the 1989-91 triennium. We are talking about an increase in real terms in the vicinity of $870m. The facilitation of growth in this area is something which not only the Government believes in, but was also consistent with the objectives of Senator Teague's report in this particular area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to respond briefly to the point about the effect of government policy on a range of areas encompassing women-part time, migrant, mature age and low income tertiary students. It should be recognised that over the period of this Government there have been major advances in making positions available for those groups of people within the education sector. For instance, in the area of higher education generally we are now looking at about a 50 per cent participation rate by women in the area of technical and further education as opposed to one-third, or 33 per cent when this Government took office. </PARA>
<PARA> Generally, I do not think the Government needs to enter a major debate in defence of these Bills as that has already been done on a number of occasions. The basic principle has been to facilitate and to improve the participation rate and to facilitate higher growth in the tertiary sector. As a final point, it should be recognised that in the Government's November 1988 funding report we said that about 49,000 additional places would be provided by 1991 in the higher education area. Having said that, I think that we can now proceed either to a vote or to the next stage of the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I foreshadowed in my speech during the second reading debate, during the committee stage I wish to refer to schools and to one particular matter which is encompassed in the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill 1989. To date the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) has made much of his proposal to standardise school education across Australia. He rightly points to the differences in practices, qualifications and standards between the States and Territories. In June last year, the Minister announced a national strategy for schools which attempts to strengthen the capacity of schools to meet Australia's social and economic needs. It involves moves towards establishing a common curriculum and an emphasis on literacy, numeracy and analytical skills. It involves coordination of assessment methods so that secondary school leaving qualifications are adequately recognised in all States and Territories.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This initiative of Mr Dawkins is long overdue and-surprise, surprise-mirrors the policies already announced by the coalition at the last election. However, schools and parents must be cautious that the Minister does not force non-government schools into the kind of `cooperation' he is now forcing on our universities and colleges. The contrast between the Opposition's approach to schools policy and the Government's approach is the same contrast that I earlier outlined with regard to higher education policy. Australians must ensure that educational choice is preserved and that the proposed reforms do not bring schools into a single low level standard dictated by Canberra. Whatever other developments are foreshadowed in the schools area, we want more than consult- ation-we want local initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> The alarm bells have already begun to ring. For example, non-government schools have had to fight hard to gain any input into Government policy, despite the fact that almost 30 per cent of Australian children attend non-government schools. Let me make it clear that the coalition supports moves to coordinate assessment methods and places a much stronger emphasis on the matter of basic skills in a core curriculum. When in government the coalition will establish a national schools monitoring program to promote sound educational practices and reward excellence. An independent investigation will also be launched into the quality of teacher training. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen evidence of the Minister's concern for standards and standardisation but we have seen nothing of his commitment. There is nothing in this Bill to show any kind of commitment at all by this Labor Government to the dual system of education that operates in our schools. He has no interest whatsoever other than to impede Australia's non-government schools. Thirty per cent of Australian children attend non-government schools. At least another 20 per cent of Australian parents wish that they could send their children to non-government schools. But this Government has done nothing but impede that opportunity for Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's most significant failure in school education concerns not what he has done or plans to do but his failure to correct the damaging policies of his predecessor, Senator Susan Ryan, who was the Minister for five years. The Minister has failed to abolish the intrusive `accountability' provisions for non-government schools and the restrictive `new schools' policy which deliberately sets out to restrict the development of new non-government schools. In contrast with Labor's continuing attempts to stifle non-government schools, the Liberal and National parties' policies will increase recurrent grants to all non-government schools. I repeat: in a matter of months, when in government, the Liberal and National parties will increase recurrent grants to all non-government schools. There will be no decrease with respect to government schools. Mr Chairman, perhaps I need to explain again very briefly how that is a responsible policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! Before you develop the policy too far, Senator Teague, I remind you that we are now at the committee stage. Your remarks would be more appropriate in a second reading debate. You should not develop too far your remarks in regard to the policy area.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for your advice, Mr Chairman. I will stick to that. I conclude my committee stage remarks on this point: what I have just outlined on behalf of the Opposition is responsible. When any student moves from enrolment in a government school to enrolment in a non-government school, the taxpayers' average contribution to the recurrent cost of that enrolment goes from 100 per cent to 50 per cent. Every time a family decides to move a child from a government school to a non-government school the taxpayer saves money. It is one of those happy situations where the Government and the taxpayers win. That is why there is a very sharp difference between the present Labor Government, that is failing in the area of schools, and the Liberal and National parties in respect of the policy I have touched upon. With regard to the Bills that are before us, I wanted to make it entirely clear to the Committee that we will take a quite different approach in the schools area. I am sure that the Committee would have wanted to have known all of those things.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some questions to ask the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus). Firstly, I refer to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1989. The Signadou College of Education has now been placed under the responsibility of the Australian Capital Territory. Can the Minister indicate what discussions the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) has had with his counterpart in the Australian Capital Territory for that move to occur or was it a matter of fiat on behalf of the Commonwealth? Secondly, if discussions did take place, was anything said at that time or at other times with regard to the position of the Canberra College of Advanced Education?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. Clause 4 (b) of the Student Assistance Amendment Bill 1989 proposes new definitions, amongst which is a definition for `full-time student'. I do not know whether the advisers were present the last time we had a discussion about what a full time student was. Perhaps they might be able to enlighten us this time. It seems that a full time student now means a student who, under the regulations, is to be treated as a full time student. That is almost as illuminating as the last definition. Can the Minister tell us precisely how a full time student is defined under the regulations?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, we have the same problem with that definition as we had last time. Basically the story then went like this: a full time student is one who takes a full time course. To find out what a full time course is, one has to ask the institutions. We rang around the institutions and we were told that we had to ask the Department of Education. We rang the Department of Education which said that we needed to speak to the institutions. I gave up at that point. Subsequently, I was told that a full time student is one who is defined as a full time student. I happen to be interested in this because the ability of a student to get Austudy hinges on this definition. By and large, it is very important to determine who is a full time student. It is not quite as easy to do this as a lot of people seem to imagine. The complexities of who ends up being a full time student are sometimes quite horrific. I know that Senator Patterson would be only too well aware of this as she was involved for a long time in trying to determine these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Given the history of this matter, fairly obviously the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), on the advice of his Department, has now felt the need to change this piece of legislation. Can the Minister indicate what that advice was and why the definition which he clung to like death the last time we went down this track is now to be changed? There has to be a reason why we are changing the legislation. Perhaps somebody might know. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We found out last Friday that there does not have to be a reason. Perhaps this might be another one of those matters. While the Minister is finding out that answer, I have another question with regard to clause 4 (f) which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A person who, although employed by the Commonwealth, performs services for the Commonwealth shall be taken, for the purposes of this Act, to be included within the definition of `employee' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I am not quite sure what `performs services for the Commonwealth' actually means. It could mean anything. It could mean a lot of things; it generally does. Presumably some problems have arisen with regard to the proposed omission of subsection (3) and the proposed substitution of the new subsection. Could the Minister give us an example of a particular person who, although not employed, is performing services and who now comes under the definition of `employee'?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In regard to Senator Macklin's first question, I ask him to compare the definition of `full time student' in clause 4 (b) to the existing definition. The substantive change has been to delete from the definition reference to `class of students'. Essentially when assessing whether someone is a full time student, the Department makes the assessment on the basis of whether that person is doing three- quarters of a full time workload which in turn is based on the workload needed to complete a course in the minimum time. The assessment is also made on the basis of the individual institution's handbook of courses that applies to a particular student. The only difference between what is in the Bill and what is in the Act is the omission of the expression `class of student'; so we are looking at an individualisation of that assessment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of Senator Macklin's second point about who is in the service of the Commonwealth, the change essentially clarifies the word `employee'. The example one would be looking for under the Bill is a consultant who acts for the department. Such a consultant would come under the proposed definition whereas that person probably would not have come under the definition in the existing law. </PARA>

In relation to the health aspects of this legislation, the Senate has before it a Bill which constitutes the next step to patch up this ramshackle, shambling and discredited health system of Medicare, predicated as it is not on the need to deliver quality health care at affordable costs but rather on this Government's ideological prejudices to sustain Medicare and to sustain it at all costs, in the face of all evidence that what it in fact requires is radical surgery. Above all, this legislation is a desperate, bankrupt attempt to provide a bandaid solution to the health care and cost crisis, and to take Medicare off the political agenda until after the next election. Let me tell this Government that that stratagem will not work. Only radical surgery will work. Only a complete overhaul of the service and costing elements of our health care system will work. In fact, only a change of government will work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are six key elements in relation to health matters to be dealt with in this legislation. The first is to amend the Australian Institute of Health Act 1987 to strengthen the confidentiality provisions of that Act. The second is to establish a new vocational register for general practitioners and to provide a system of differential rebates to be paid for their medical services. The third is to fix up the Government's own errors in the provision of Medicare rebates for pathology services. The fourth, under section 17 of this Bill, is to prohibit certain medical insurance contracts being established. The fifth is to provide a new system for paying fees for day care services. Finally, the sixth is to increase payments in the health insurance system as far as the provision of assistance to the health reinsurance pool is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me indicate at this stage the Opposition's general approach to each of those questions. We support the amendments dealing with the Australian Institute of Health. We oppose the amendments relating to the establishment of a vocational register and we have moved for the establishment of a Senate select committee to investigate this matter further. At the committee stage we will move an amendment to clause 10 to prevent that system from coming into operation until such time as the Senate has considered this matter again after the committee has reported. We support that section of the legislation which relates to pathology services. We do not oppose that part of the legislation which relates to the prohibition on the writing of certain insurance contracts. We simply draw attention to this Government's continued interference with insurance arrangements made by individuals to provide for coverage of their own personal health care requirements. We oppose that part of the legislation which relates to the provision of day care services. We oppose that section of the legislation which relates to the reinsurance arrangements. We will not, however, vote against it; we will allow it to be passed by the Senate but will move to refer it to the proposed Senate Select Committee for its consideration of matters relating to the wider question of health care in general and health insurance in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation that deals with the Australian Institute of Health provides for an increase in the confidentiality provisions as far as they govern the Australian Institute of Health. We support that. This Government has a most pathetic and lamentable record as far as the protection of the confidentiality of medical information in the hands of the government is concerned. We have seen repeatedly, deliberate leaks from the Health Insurance Commission designed to embarrass doctors, and even designed to put on the public record details of the individual incomes of doctors. We have seen instances in which information in the hands of Medicare, of the Health Insurance Commission, has been made public. Enrolment files with lists of personal identification information have been made public; claimants' history files have been made public; and providers' files have been made public. At no stage has the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) been prepared to undertake the necessary prosecutions which should have followed those particular breaches. </PARA>
<PARA> Those of us who served on the Joint Select Committee on an Australia Card will remember the Australian Institute of Health coming before that Committee in order to secure for itself access to the information on the proposed Australia Card. The Government's submission, the Green Paper, dated 6 February 1986, lists the details of the proposed uses regarding the Australia Card that the Australian Institute of Health wanted to have in terms of access to information on the record. For example, if one looks at the submission made to the Joint Select Committee in evidence on 25 February 1986 one sees that the officers came before the Committee to tell it that they needed access to this information to compile and keep up to date something which was quaintly called the `national death index'. We believe that the Australian Institute of Health has a significant role to play in the provision of statistical information about Australia's health. When the first biennial report of the Australian Institute of Health was tabled I spoke in the Senate and drew attention to the fact that the report was, in my view, somewhat politicised and partisan. I was critical of that. For those reasons, we are particularly pleased to see attempts now being made to strengthen that Institute's confidentiality provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The second issue to which I wish to refer briefly is the Government's attempt to correct its own errors in relation to the provision of Medicare rebates for pathology services. The Minister, in his second reading speech, goes through a detailed recitation of the way in which pathology fees have been established, the work of the Pathology Services Advisory Committee and now to be replaced and the promulgation of new tables for the payment of rebates. When we debated this matter late last year the Opposition moved for certain pathology rebate tables to be disallowed. We thought the basis upon which the Government was proceeding was faulty. The Australian Democrats originally supported us in that particular endeavour. They then changed their minds and the Senate did not disallow the necessary regulations. As a result the matter was taken to court and a hearing was commenced and indeed concluded before His Honour Mr Justice Gummow in the Federal Court of Australia in December 1988. His Honour, in his judgment on that particular occasion, was quite scathing both of the immediate operations of the Pathology Services Advisory Committee and of its advisers. For example, he said-as we had claimed in the debate-that the claim which was being made by the Government that there would only be an overall reduction of 5 to 8 per cent in incomes for pathology practices was, in His Honour's words `markedly to overstate what had taken place' in terms of the calculations that had allegedly been made to establish that figure. We said that at the time. The Government of course abused us roundly. It said that we did not know what we were talking about. It said that it had expert advice and that 5 to 8 per cent was of course correct. But as soon as the Government got into court, a judge of the Federal Court nailed it to the wall for the deceptive way in which it dealt with the Senate on that occasion. His Honour, later on in his judgment, made this point about the operation of the Committee, saying:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . it failed to perform its functions in accordance with the principles determined by the Minister . . . </PARA>
<PARA>As a result of that failure the pathology table was struck down. We reverted to an earlier, somewhat unsatisfactory, pathology table. These amendments from the Government to correct an error that it made, which we told it it had made, which it denied having made and which it was exposed as having made by the Federal Court of Australia, are now welcome. </PARA>
<PARA> We then come to day care services. The Opposition has no in-principle objection to the provision for arrangements to be entered into to take account of new surgical and treatment techniques which facilitate day only hospital treatment and encourage greater use of these techniques. Nevertheless, we do not believe that the Minister for Community Services and Health has consulted adequately with the relevant people in the medical community in order to be secure in the introduction of this system, which is dealt with in clauses 20 to 22 of the legislation. Indeed, speaking in the House of Representatives on 30 May, the Minister for Community Services and Health, while indicating that the proposal had been taken to the Australian Health Ministers Conference, said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is true that we have not consulted with the National Day Surgery Advisory Committee . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That Committee, which is a committee of the Royal Australian College of Surgeons, should have been consulted. Its agreement should have been sought before proceeding with this particular part of the legislation. There is a report in the Medical Letter No. 690 of 6 April 1989 stating that the Royal Australian College of Surgeons has objected, in principle, to a proposal by the Department of Community Services and Health to change the eligibility requirements for benefits for day surgery endoscopy procedures. If one looks at the November 1987, fairly thin four-page report on discretionary surgery by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs-we are told it could not actually get any information from the Department on these very matters-one sees once again that some significant issues are raised there about consultation and cooperation. We do not believe that this part of the legislation should be enacted without that proper consultation, particularly with the surgeons who, after all, will be the ones primarily interested in questions of rebates dealing with day care surgery and procedures. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My learned colleague behind me draws attention to that particular matter which also effects the interests of physicians. He, a well known expert with a device I think called a sigmoidoscope, will undoubtedly have something to say about that in due course. As I said earlier, this legislation interferes in the contracts between individuals and the providers of health insurance arrangements. In fact, clause 17 of the legislation provides for the prohibition of certain insurance contracts which individuals might want to take out which, in the view of the Opposition, constitutes an improper interference in the way in which people are entitled to determine exactly what they want provided in their own health care services. As I said in my earlier remarks, we do not oppose that section of the legislation; we simply draw attention to our in-principle objection to this whole attitude.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now turn to reinsurance. I propose to deal with reinsurance, differential fees for general practitioner services and the establishment of the vocational register in far greater detail when we come to the committee stages of this legislation. Therefore, I shall touch only briefly on the issues at this stage of the second reading debate. The reinsurance arrangements proposed in this legislation are in fact simply bandaid arrangements to prop up the discredited and disreputable Medicare system. The Government's proposal will do nothing to achieve long term improvements in the private health insurance system. It will do nothing to protect the insured aged from further increases in their contribution rates. In fact, it is more likely to worsen the system by driving good risks out of the private insurance system. Indeed, one knows that for approximately every one per cent drop in those privately insured there is an additional cost to Medicare-that is to the Government or rather to the taxpayer-of between $80m and $90m. That stands in sharp contrast to the fact that this legislation is proposing a one-off, totally inadequate subsidy to the reinsurance pool of some $20m. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has behaved in the most shameful fashion as far as this part of the legislation is concerned. It, together with its allies in a certain section of the health insurance industry, has attempted to frighten, to scare and to worry the aged in our community by claiming that failure to pass this legislation in precisely the form in which the Government wants it passed would result in higher costs to the elderly. No government has so pathetic a record as the Hawke Labor Government of attempting to use the fears and concerns of elderly Australians for its own cheap, grubby and disreputable political purposes. Nowhere has this been more evident, nowhere has this been more stark, than in its attempts to frighten the elderly on the one issue about which they are most properly concerned; namely, the provision of long term health care arrangements for themselves. It is for that reason that we propose to ensure that there is a proper examination of these health insurance issues by the reference to the Senate Select Committee for which I have already moved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has attempted to band- aid this problem by providing for a subsidy to the reinsurance pool of some $20m. Nothing could be more pathetic than this Government's record in terms of the Commonwealth contribution to the Health Benefits Reinsurance Trust Fund. The amounts contributed to that pool from 1976-77 to 1988-89 were as follows: in 1978, 1979 and 1980 a sum of $50m each year; in 1981, $125m; in 1982 and 1983, $100m each year; in 1984 and 1985, $20m each year; in 1986, $5m; and in 1987, 1988 and 1989, it was a meagre $1m each year. That is the record of this discredited and disreputable Government as far as reinsurance arrangements are concerned. Now, all of a sudden, for no legitimate purpose other than to bandaid the rotten Medicare system beyond the time of the next Federal election, $20m has been found to go into the reinsurance pool. The Hawke Government's record in each of the last three years of only $1m a year and $5m in the year before that, when at the peak in 1981 under the last Liberal Government the reinsurance pool was being assisted to the sum of $125m, indicates the degree to which this Labor Government has no real concern about the long term viability and stability of private health insurance arrangements in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I come finally to the question of general practitioners, the vocational register and the establishment of a system of differential rebates. Despite the enormous amount of mail that has been coming in on this subject, there has also been a very clear expression within the wider community of general practitioners of what this actually amounts to-a cosy, closed shop deal done between the Government and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, which has written to all of its members asking them to write to senators demanding that they support this legislation. Yet from general practitioners we receive correspondence that says, for example:</PARA>
<PARA>I have been asked by letter from The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners to write to N.S.W. Senators seeking their support for early passage of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989. I wish, however, to voice my opposition to the cosy relationship that the college and the government have formed. I hope the legislation fails. </PARA>
<PARA>Another one writes:</PARA>
<PARA>Although the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners was involved in negotiations for the package, the members of the College-of which I am one-were not consulted before its acceptance by the leadership. I believe most working doctors will find the new system confusing, contributing to problems with patients and Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA>Another writes:</PARA>
<PARA>I am absolutely disgusted that, despite a clear majority vote by College members to the contrary about 3 months ago, the College Council has entered into an `Agreement' with Dr Blewett without further consulting members at an Extra Ordinary General Meeting, or by plebiscite. </PARA>
<PARA>I have a great number of such letters. A report in the Sydney Morning Herald of 27 May states:</PARA>
<PARA> Last Monday 1,500 medical registrars, medical students and women doctors in Melbourne backed the AMA's opposition to the accord and declared themselves `absolutely disgusted' by the college's actions. </PARA>
<PARA>What has this Government done about any of these matters? The Opposition has for some time been pressing the Government on the necessity to ensure that there is a proper level of support for continuing medical education. My colleague Senator Peter Baume will undoubtedly be touching on this matter. I well remember speaking supportively in this chamber some time ago on the Doherty report-Australian Medical Education and Workforce into the 21st Century-all 700-odd pages of it. It was brought down in April 1988, but has not yet been responded to by this Government with any degree of adequacy. For a whole 12 months it had before it a report on continuing medical education, and absolutely nothing has been done or said about it and no commitment made. Yet the Government comes in here making noises about its preferred scheme for continuing medical education, the thimble and pea trick of increased rebates around the place. Of course, it does not tell the general practitioners or this Parliament about some of the hooks that go into all of this. When have we heard the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health in this place, the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), come clean on the question of what is to be done by a body called the Independent Peer Review Organisation (IPRO)? Here we are to have yet another statutory body set up by this Government, being secretly negotiated at the moment. It is going to have the oversight of this particular part of the legislation. It will be able to conduct selective professional audits. General practitioners who enrol on the vocational register will have to put themselves under the control of the Independent Peer Review Organisation. According to the operating principles:</PARA>
<PARA>The IPRO will have access to data necessary for the efficient implementation of its processes. </PARA>
<PARA>I am aware of no organisation in this country which has a better track record than the Department of Community Services and Health in gestapo-like operations, using every possible intrusive procedure, linked with every attempt to leak when politically necessary. The Minister's advisers can smile and giggle all they like, but people in the medical profession and people in the wider community know full well about the intrusive nature, the interference, the lack of security and the total politicisation of personal data to the advantage of the Government and the Health Insurance Commission whenever and wherever they see the political mileage in so doing. Here we have yet another body, this Independent Peer Review Organisation, with 25 or so operating principles, but nobody has been telling the Senate what they are. The Minister has not been telling the Parliament or the public what they are. </PARA>

<PARA>Practitioners and auditors may exchange billing and clinical information. The audit report will remain confidential to the practitioner and the IPRO. </PARA>
<PARA>Well, I will be a Dutchman if that actually occurs, given the track record of the Community Services and Health Department and the Health Insurance Commission in maintaining confidentiality. Another principle states:</PARA>
<PARA>Information received by auditors at audit will not be available for civil action. </PARA>
<PARA>What civil action? This is not spelt out. Presumably, for people who are rorting the health insurance system there will be penalties attached. Another principle states:</PARA>
<PARA>The IPRO will be required to notify the relevant authority in instances of suspected fraud or suspected professional negligence or incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA>So it will not just monitor the financial standards, the differential rebates; the body will deal with professional negligence or incompetence. Since when was there an agreement accepted by the bulk of general practitioners for yet another organisation to monitor things such as professional standards and levels of competence? I hope that when we reach the committee stage the Minister will have some pretty good answers about the Independent Peer Review Organisation. He will need some pretty good answers if he expects to get the legislation through this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation has been criticised, quite properly, for the extent to which it will disadvantage particular groups. It will disadvantage women doctors, women and children who particularly seek to be the patients of women doctors, people resident in country areas, university students and those seeking to enter the medical profession in the years ahead, and the terminally ill. I propose to turn to each of those in due course. Madam Acting Deputy President, undoubtedly you would be interested in the extent to which this scheme flies in the very face of the Government's own policies which it announced at the national women's health policy release in March 1989, because it discriminates against women practising medicine as general practitioners in a way to which I will come in some considerable detail during the committee stage of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of matters are involved in this very complicated piece of legislation. We have moved that clause 10 of the Bill, which deals with general practitioners, be referred to the proposed select committee and we have moved a more extensive reference which would allow the same committee to examine the general nature of private health insurance and reinsurance arrangements. My colleague Senator Boswell will take steps to seek a reference to a standing committee of the disability service provisions of this complex piece of legislation. As we indicated the other day, we will be seeking to bring about a situation in which the Department of Community Services and Health will be required to provide a 008 number service for people who are located some distance from the nearest regional offices of the Depart- ment. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said when I began my speech, there will be a very complicated debate at the committee stage. However, a fundamental principle is involved here and it is this: this piece of legislation represents a feeble attempt to take Medicare and the question of health insurance off the political agenda until after the next general election. That will not work because the system is so manifestly in need of radical surgery-something that is exposed daily. It will not work, quite simply, because the system is incapable of being reformed by the piecemeal tinkering which this Bill represents and which the Minister is attempting to achieve. During this debate and in the course of the committee's inquiry, we intend to make that point abundantly clear so that the people of Australia will have it drawn to their attention that this Government is interested not in their health but simply in the politics of survival. That strategy simply will not work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in support of my colleague Senator Puplick, who has addressed the health aspects of the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Amendment Bill and the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill. I wish to direct my comments first to the community services part of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill. The Bill is part of a staged development of altered care for our frail aged. Basically, it sets out to proceed to needs-based planning with regard to applications for additional hostel care. It proposes to turn away from the submission model of previous years. This concept has been in vogue for the last 18 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposals in the Bill are part of a 10-year plan that the Government implemented in 1986. The 10-year plan has eight stages. Basically, we are looking at the fifth stage of that plan. The Opposition approved the direction taken by the Government in the amendments to the original legislation. In the 1986-87 Budget, the Government made a commitment to begin the process of redistributing resources for the care of aged people from nursing homes to alternative, less institutional forms of residential care, and community care services. </PARA>
<PARA> Cemented in the Bill is a Government proposal to provide 60 hostel places for every 1,000 frail aged persons. At the same time, nursing home bed availability will be reduced. Forty nursing home beds will be available for every 1,000 frail aged persons. Under the Government's new funding arrangements for hostels and nursing homes, and categorisation of patients, this is bound to lead to a reduction in the quality of care that is able to be provided. Under the new fee arrangements, known as CAM-care aggregated module-covering the cost of employing specified standard levels of nursing and personal care staff, there will be a cutback in funding and an inevitable reduction in the quality of care for the elderly. All sectors of the industry-private, public and voluntary-are concerned about the effect on patients as well as nursing staff. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry is also concerned about the report I'm Still an Individual, which, far from seeking to maintain the rights of our aged, threatens their quality of life by attacking the voluntary and private sectors which are charged with the delivery of providing the service and that quality. The report recommended sweeping reforms to protect the rights of older people in nursing homes and hostels. It found that abuses `were commonly entrenched in the daily routines of almost all homes and hostels'. The Opposition refutes that report. At seminars held around the country, that was proved to be the exception rather than the rule. I understand that the final report has been submitted to the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) and will be distributed to nursing homes and hostels shortly. The industry has demanded that there be time for consultation before any of the recommendations in the report are implemented. I hope that the Minister will not act as hastily as he did last time in making the report public before the industry has had a chance to consider it. </PARA>
<PARA> During the committee stage of the Bill in the House of Representatives my colleague Mr Braithwaite proposed an amendment relating to the quota of financially disadvantaged residents that hostels have to take under the legislation, under threat of losing their recurrent subsidies. That is something that has caused great concern to church groups throughout Australia. The precedent for the Minister to be able to set conditions relating to recurrent subsidies goes back to earlier community services legislation of 1987-the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act. Certain amendments were made to the Act which gave the Minister fairly wide discretion in administering general provisions within the Act. One of the aspects of the 1987 amendments was the introduction under section 10f of general conditions of recurrent grants. Following subsections allow the Minister to introduce these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time the Opposition agreed with those general provisions because they seemed to be in keeping with what the Opposition had in mind by way of reforms for the aged and frail aged. The amendment gave the Minister wide powers-but with very little accountability at the end. The Government has said that in order for a hostel to continue to receive recurrent subsidies, it must have a 20 per cent quota of financially disadvantaged residents. Hostel owners had to sign an agreement to that effect by 10 January 1989, under threat of losing their subsidies. I can see no reason why people who have saved for their old age must have those savings amortised across people who have made no such provisions. That is totally wrong, and we will move an amendment to that effect at the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the hostels involved, particularly those built by the churches-the Uniting Church has many such hostels-were funded by residents, by people borrowing money and committing themselves to repaying the capital. This very often involved their own churches, thus relieving the Government of the responsibility of paying the capital moneys to build the facility. Members of these organisations went out and raised money through residents-through people borrowing to get into these places-on the understanding that recurrent funding would be available for the operation of that facility. This was supposed to be a good deal for the Commonwealth, whereby the Commonwealth was relieved of the responsibility of finding the capital funds which it did not have. The facilities were being built and people were being provided with accommodation off their own bat. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is now introducing arrangements which retrospectively alter the existing arrangements between individuals, who have put up their own capital and who have borrowed money to go into these places, and the Commonwealth. There was a not unreasonable expectation that recurrent funding would continue to be available where people had met the capital cost from their own resources. These arrangements were not for wealthy people. Hostels that were built under this resident funded arrangement were essentially for middle income, or near poor people who were perhaps selling their own houses, or liquidating whatever capital they could, to get themselves into places in which they would be able to provide for themselves in the frailty of their old age. The ones who were comfortably off, who could sell their houses and have money left over, were not interested in these types of hostel arrangements. It is wrong for the Government to seek to rewrite an agreement retrospectively. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the hostels concerned, because of their group situation, have been able to aggregate their financially disadvantaged places and spread them around, but this was not something that was offered by the Minister. The industry sought aggregation on certain terms. The Minister responded with a letter in which he laid down three conditions under which aggregation could take place but these conditions could not, in all fairness, be fulfilled. One of the conditions of the financially disadvantaged placement is that residents would have to come from the immediate region. Under aggregation, people might have to move from one region to another. For example, if the Uniting Church hostel at Ryde has a 40 per cent figure, it wants to be able to offset the extra 20 per cent at another hostel, to make up the 20 per cent financially disadvantaged component there. This would mean that people would not have to be moved to a strange area, possibly away from their families, friends and local surroundings. This aspect needs to be clarified and the Opposition will move an amendment to clarify it. We see no financial disadvantage in aggregation to the Government. It will not mean more financing, it will just mean that the philosophy of a 20 per cent quota for the disadvantaged cannot, in some areas, be fulfilled. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that following the debate on this Bill in the House of Representatives the Uniting Church was given an assurance from the Department of Community Services and Health that the quota of 20 per cent of financially disadvantaged persons could be achieved across all its hostels. This will give relief to the resident funded hostels where it is impossible to achieve the 20 per cent figure in the short term. We feel that the matter should be clarified once and for all, and that the principle should be established within the law. Therefore, we will pursue these amendments during the committee stage of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill. There are two areas of the Bill that I will cover in this debate, the first relating to nursing homes. Clauses 24 to 26 of the Bill propose amendments to the National Health Act 1953 to introduce provisions to prevent abuse of the resident classification system. Under current arrangements, nursing home proprietors are able to abuse the resident classification system by providing information leading to the classification of residents at unjustifiable levels, thereby obtaining excess benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> In connection with nursing homes and hostels, I have already mentioned funding and quality care. The message that we are receiving from those who direct assessments in the homes is that the assessment system is being changed. Whereas patients were assessed according to their need for quality of care, they are now assessed according to a ratio of funding which means that, in most cases, quality of care is no longer available. This is because nursing homes which must provide that care can no longer afford to do so. In general, these amendments to the National Health Act are acceptable to the Opposition, but we question some aspects of them. A situation of overclassification will be the result of one of two things: either ignorance of how it should be done properly, which means that people should be educated; or, persistent upgrading to obtain a benefit, which is what this part of the Bill seeks to correct. On the question of appeals, we do not believe that a decision of the secretary can be appealed fairly to the Minister. Therefore, we suggest as an option after the Minister's decision, referral to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. We shall also move an amendment in the third reading stage of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 5 of the Bill is very important; it covers clauses 54 to 61. It proposes amendments to facilitate the phased transfer of all nursing homes for disabled persons from the Nursing Homes Assistance Act 1974 to the Disability Services Act 1986 by June 1992. These changes were foreshadowed by the Minister in the Department's special bulletin entitled Transfer of Nursing Homes for Disabled Persons to the Disability Services Program issued in May 1988. This document outlined the process to be followed in bringing nursing homes for disabled persons under the legislative coverage of the Disability Services Act 1986. There are 65 nursing homes involved, although only 45 are attached to the nursing home sector. Seven of these 45 have signed contracts, leaving 38 to sign. We will oppose the amendments to part 5 of the Bill for the very good reason that the message we are getting from these 38 nursing homes is that they have no faith that the guidelines will do anything to assist them in the transition stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Many organisations have contacted my colleague Mr Braithwaite to voice their concern about the lack of flexibility under the Disability Services Act in regard to residential accommodation and other services for the disabled. They would like to be assured that services currently approved, and providing the necessary standards, will be allowed to continue in their own modem and be funded as previously. There are also reservations about the discretion of the Minister after 1992 on approvals and on admission criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Spastic Welfare League has indicated to the Opposition that there must be flexibility. The League wants it to be understood that a large number of people have disabilities that are so extensive that they would not be able to cope in smaller, cluster-type accommodation, or hostel accommodation. There is not the flexibility under the Disability Services Act for people to be able to draw on different sorts of accommodation. People at the League are also worried about the future of therapy centres. They say that the present thrust of the bureaucrats is to have these centres transferred to State governments because the State governments consider them to be health related, which is definitely not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The North Queensland Society for Crippled Children is also worried about the total lack of flexibility under the Disability Services Act. That Society points out that what is appropriate for some people with a disability-physical or intellectual-is certainly not appropriate for others. Some people do not want to move from group homes out into the community, and they do not want another parent. According to the Society, some older people are getting very worried what will happen. Families are worried. They have security in knowing that their children are being cared for, and are content that these homes are caring for their disabled children. Mrs Martin, one of the directors of the North Queensland Society for Crippled Children, expressed concern about the nurses. Nurses are looking for other jobs; they see no future in their positions and are taking advantage of other courses. The Society is also worried about the effects that the proposed changes are already having on nursing staff. As I have said, many nurses are out now looking for other jobs.</PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Bush Children's health scheme members would prefer not to move to the Disability Services Act because of the Act's inflexibility. The scheme's director said, `We do not know which way to turn, or which way we are going'. These people are very concerned. If they do not sign a contract they will not be funded and, if they sign a contract, they do not know what will happen to them. This is causing concern. They are caught between the devil and the deep blue sea. If they do not sign a contract their funds will be cut and, in many cases, they are quite sure that some of their patients will not be equipped to go into these different types of community homes. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I received a letter from a Bundaberg parents action group voicing concern about the dismantling of sheltered workshops and activity therapy centres; about elderly parents' fears for the future care of their disadvantaged sons and daughters; and about the frustration felt by service providers at the inflexible approach of the Department of Community Services and Health in the implementation of this legislation. These messages are constantly coming into our offices. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has made it clear on numerous occasions that the Disability Services Act is not being administered properly and that the Minister is out of touch in respect of it. We believe that the Minister has isolated himself from the criticism of this legislation that is being levelled from a number of areas. The Minister has stepped away from it and left it to his Department to handle. It is premature and inappropriate for us to support this legislation which would effectively cut off from 1992 one source of funding to nursing homes that cater for, in particular, the severely intellectually disabled. In the committee stage I will be seeking to move a motion to refer this section of the legislation to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a lot of discontent in the community. I have received a letter from the Crowle nursing home. The people in that nursing home have been almost bribed by the Department to sign a contract. Perhaps the word `bribed' is too strong a term; they have certainly been put under the hammer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Coerced, put under the hammer, forced; whatever you would like. The chief executive officer of Crowle nursing home has been told that, if he signs, the nursing home will have as much time as it likes to come up with a transitional plan. In the meantime the nursing home is guaranteed grants at least equal to last year's grants plus the consumer price index increase. Crowle nursing home has been told that there is a general shortage of funds and it was implied that, if it did not sign the contract, it was going to suffer. It was told that the formula, as per the Department's bulletin, would be strictly enforced and, in areas where the nursing home had not spent to its budget level, it would be stuck with that level in future years. This is very serious for Crowle nursing home. At present it is about $80,000 under in wages as it cannot fill certain positions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This home feels that it is being coerced-and these are not my words-into signing a contract when it really does not have any faith in the Disability Services Act. It is caught. If it does not sign the contract it will not get any funding and if it does sign the contract it knows that it will not work. It is very apprehensive about the way the legislation will work. Therefore, I believe it is vitally important that this legislation go before a Senate committee to be examined so that everyone in the community services area can put their point of view and the Senate can reach a bipartisan conclusion. I hope that the Government will respond by supporting this reference to a Senate committee. It is important to give these people who look after our disabled-physically and intellectually disabled-some avenue to voice their concerns about how the legislation will or will not work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning we are debating the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, the Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill 1989 and the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Amendment Bill 1988. The principal piece of legislation incorporates seven Bills which amend various Acts of this Parliament. It is difficult to deal with this legislation because of the way in which it has been presented. But there are two sections in particular which have caused a great deal of concern to general practitioners and the private health insurance area, and it is those two sections with which I will be dealing most extensively. Both of them are particularly complex matters because they involve the assessment of detailed and esoteric data which is difficult to assess. A lot more time is required to collect figures and make assessments and, for that reason, we will be supporting the reference of both these matters to a Senate select committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dealing sequentially with those matters, the first matter is the creation of a register for general practitioners and the circumstances that surround the creation of that register. I remind the Senate that doctors graduate after six years of university work and become registered after a further year of hospital work. It is a very long course and covers a wide range of subjects. If I might say so, it is a good general education but there is certainly insufficient training in that course-either in the university part of the course or in the hospital year-to train somebody to work as a general practitioner. Let me tell the Senate of my experience back in the 1950s when I did a medical course in Adelaide. I suppose that 50 per cent of the time of general practitioners is occupied with dealing with family related problems. We had only a dozen lectures in what was called psychological medicine, and those lectures covered everything from the most serious psychological disability through to the sorts of emotional traumas that beset families all the time-totally inadequate training for dealing with that part of a general practice which occupies about 50 per cent of a general practitioner's time. It was certainly disconcerting to go, as I did, from completing those six university years and my residency in Royal Adelaide Hospital to sitting across the desk from patients for the first time dealing with the sorts of problems that I felt I was ill-equipped to deal with following the training course that I had been given. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, most doctors go into general practice. They learn on the job. They probably make a few mistakes initially, but I do not doubt that the majority of them become excellent general practitioners. Of course, that is recognised in the legislation which the Government is proposing because the register will contain the names of those doctors who have had a sufficient period as general practitioners and they will be recognised for the purposes of the register. But one of the consequences of this inadequacy of training is that general practice has been looked down upon by the academics in the universities. Certainly in my three years of clinical training, much of the training was done by specialists-we had no contact with general practitioners at all-or by those who taught for the hospital year. People going through that hospital year are taught largely by specialists. For that reason there is extremely little contact with general practitioners and with the sort of work that general practitioners have to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been very extensive lobbying on this Bill, particularly from organisations like the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Doctors Reform Society. Both of those bodies have pointed out that, in order to address this lack of status and lack of initial quality of general practitioners, they have been attempting for some years to get more appropriate training introduced within both the university years and the compulsory hospital year. They have been remarkably unsuccessful, in that apparently there is a perception by academics in the university or lack of academic rigour in general practice and a perception of lack of relevance by doctors who are themselves specialists and who are responsible for much of the training within the compulsory hospital year. Having spoken to a number of medical colleagues and having been lobbied very extensively on this matter over recent weeks, I understand that the quality of medical education still leaves a great deal to be desired with respect to education appropriate for general practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's move is a serious attempt to raise the status of general practitioners in the eyes of the community and in the eyes of fellow practitioners, specialists and academics working in universities. It is also a serious attempt to raise the quality of general practice and to give recognition of that through the establishment of a register, the requirement for continuing medical education to remain on that register and the payment of a higher fee to those doctors whose names are on the register. It seems to me that the intention of this legislation is entirely laudable. It may well be the only way to go. By a rather ironic feedback mechanism, it may indeed bring about those very things that the College, the Doctors Reform Society and other organisations have been unable to achieve by other means. Once the status of general practice is recognised, once general practitioners are involved in continuing education, it may be that those doctors that are on the register will gain in status in the eyes of other doctors and that there will be a greater willingness to introduce general practice education back into the six university years and the compulsory post-graduate hospital year. </PARA>
<PARA> But this move by the Government has very seriously divided the medical profession. It is difficult to find any action by this Government in recent months which has so galvanised a group of people as the intention to set up this register. I must say that initially the majority of letters and phone calls I was receiving were totally opposed to this legislation-they were running at a ratio of about 10:1 against the legislation. There was a period about a fortnight ago when the numbers swung marginally the other way and the majority of those who were lobbying me were in favour of the legislation. But more recently, the numbers have swung back again very strongly against this legislation. Honourable senators will recall that last week I submitted a petition from 1,644 doctors from Victoria alone who were all opposed to this legislation. Even if the majority of those doctors misunderstood the legislation and its intention and could be persuaded that it was in their interests, I do not think it is appropriate for the Government to proceed at this time with legislation which clearly a large number of doctors either do not understand or do not want. There needs to be the interposition of a period of review by a committee so that those matters which perhaps have been unjustifiably misunderstood can be dealt with and fears allayed. Those matters which do have substance can be properly dealt with and brought before a committee. Perhaps this may lead to modification of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats, therefore, support the reference of this matter to a committee. We have slightly modified Senator Puplick's proposal to establish a Senate select committee to consider a reference relating to general practitioners and report by the first sitting day in August by asking the committee also to consider private insurance proposals, with which I will be dealing in a minute, and to report on that reference by the first sitting day in March next year. </PARA>
<PARA> Out of the lobbying which has gone on, one can already identify a number of matters which need to be addressed by that committee. Without foreshadowing how the committee may deal with these matters, I think it is worth while mentioning them because they have some substance. There is a need to give consideration to what body would be appropriate to accredit general practitioners. It may be that, in the lobbying that has gone on, there has been an element of politicking between the College and the Australian Medical Association. But let us leave that aside and accept that, particularly in medicine, groups of specialist practitioners have in the past set up colleges and gained accreditation and higher fees. As a general principle I believe that a body which provides accreditation which results in a higher fee being chargeable should, as far as possible, be independent of the professional in-group which benefits from that accreditation. I think that is something that needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> The terms by which a general practitioner shall get accreditation and remain accredited also need close scrutiny. There is a great deal of concern that, in some respects, the terms are quite excessive, particularly in relation to those people who may, for various reasons, fall below the requirement and then seek to go back on to the register later on. I also draw attention to something that is a bit of an oxymoron-that is, subspecialities of general practice. Several examples of this have been brought to my attention: for instance, those practitioners who choose to see mainly patients with sexually transmitted diseases. Family planning may be another one. If the proportion of patients they see gets to the point where the majority of their practice is occupied in that subspeciality then they may cease to be general practitioners for the purposes of the register and may only be able to attract a fee at a lower rate. That would seem to be unfair. The quality of the service that those practitioners are providing to their patients is at least as good as, and maybe even better than, that which they were providing when they were fully within general practice. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, attention has been draw to the lack of any appeal mechanism in relation to the removal of a name from the register. </PARA>

I will see whether the Prime Minister is willing to have it tabled at some future time. In regard to the ambassador, I think Senator Hill's question acknowledged that the Canadian example did not represent a breaking of diplomatic relations but just a recalling of its ambassador for consultations, which in itself is a pretty serious diplomatic move. With regard to Australia's position, at this stage the Government has decided to leave our ambassador and some essential staff in Beijing in order to ensure that Australia retains an effective presence with which to monitor developments and convey our views to the Chinese Government. The recall of the ambassador would remove the most experienced Australian diplomat from Beijing and weaken the skeleton staff which is to remain. But the situation in China, although it seems to have clarified to some extent over the last few days, is still fairly fluid. At this stage the Government's judgment is that it is best to leave the ambassador in place.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Government has announced that it has commenced a review of Bass Strait excise, and that that review will culminate in any legislative change, if that is necessary, to take effect from 1 July 1990. We will shortly produce a discussion paper on excise and resource rent tax on crude oil production in Australia.

<PARA> In terms of the question Senator Devereux has asked me, I have before me a table of OECD nations showing the cost in Australian cents per litre of petrol purchased at the bowser. Italy charges 127c per litre. Australia, according to this list, charges 51c per litre and has the third lowest prices in the list. The only other countries in which petrol is cheaper are Canada at 48c and the United States of America at 39c. Every other OECD country charges higher retail prices per litre for petroleum than Australia; indeed, the major countries are listed in the upper end of that table. In terms of the tax take that the governments of the OECD countries extract from petroleum prices, 24c is taken from the 51c in Australia, but if we go to the top of the table, of the 127c extracted in Italy, 99c comprises tax. Once again, according to this table, Australia is the third lowest of any OECD country with regard to tax take. I table this document for the information of honourable senators. It dispels the allegation that there is a high tax rate in Australia in terms of petroleum retail prices.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that Senator Crowley has written to the Attorney-General putting forward a rather novel aid, that is, removing the person perpetrating violence from a household rather than removing the women and children who are sometimes the victims of violence by placing them in shelters with all the consequent disruption to schooling and the need for quite expensive support to be provided to a whole family which may move out of a violent household situation. Senator Crowley's suggestion, as I have read it in the press anyway, is that by removing the male perpetrator of the violence to a hostel or some such shelter, allowing the husband still to engage in employment, is a piece of lateral thinking and a novel approach which ought to be followed up. I have not had a chance yet to discuss this with the Attorney-General. But the Government has shared Senator Crowley's concern for the human and financial suffering faced by those who are victims of domestic violence. Indeed, it introduced legislation in this very territory, the Australian Capital Territory, as Senator Reid would know, based on a report to the Australian Law Reform Commission which enables victims to obtain an injunction in these circumstances. That injunctive relief is obviously an important protective device.</PARA></TALK.START>

But I am more equally aware of the Democrats' timidity at imposing taxes which can be specified to hit a particular group of the wealthy. I have been asked why I said it is simplistic. I have only read the press reports, so I do not know the full text of the motions which were carried. However, let me take, for example, taxation deductability for interest paid on housing mortgages. If that were to be applied across the board it would clearly provide an additional incentive for investment. There are, and have been for many decades of course, very substantial incentives for expenditure in owner occupied housing. If the interest payments on housing mortgages were to be allowed as a tax deduction, that would provide a very major incentive for further expenditure on owner occupied housing which must have the effect of leading at least some capital investment away from the tradable goods sector. It would also, of course, knock a very substantial hole in government revenue which would have to be covered by expenditure reductions elsewhere, increased taxes somewhere else or a blow-out of the Budget deficit; or if one would like to put it in modern terms-the sort of terms which nobody in Australia would have ever expected to be relevant to the underlying reality until very recently-a reduction in the Budget surplus.</PARA></TALK.START>

I do not approve of capital punishment under any circumstances. I suspect that Senator Chaney shares that view. I note that it is not a view that is shared by the new Liberal Party Leader in Victoria-not that I am suggesting that he supports summary execution.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The short answer to the first part of the question is that no progress has been made. The answer to the second part of the question as to whether I have received a reply from the Minister for Natural Resources is yes, I have. I wrote to the Minister for Natural Resources on 6 June. In view of comments attributed to Nick Greiner, Premier of New South Wales, that he would direct his Minister to reopen talks with the Commonwealth on this matter, I wrote to Minister Causley inviting him to come to Canberra during last week or this week to have further discussions with me on the compromise proposal the Commonwealth has put forward to settle the issue. I received a letter in reply from Minister Causley, which I will shortly table, which acknowledges my correspondence and in an argumentative way seeks to take me to task for comments that I have made, although it is not specifically worded that way. It is a peculiar letter. It ends with this declaration:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am concerned at the apparent misinterpretation of the current position between us. I would appreciate clarification before agreeing to further discussions.</PARA>
<PARA>I received that letter during the afternoon of Friday last and instantly faxed a reply to Minister Causley saying that if there were matters of confusion between us then the most sensible thing was to meet as soon as possible to settle those differences, particularly the dispute about the south-east forests. I am still awaiting a reply from him to the invitation to meet this week to settle the proposal, though I do not criticise him for this because yesterday was a public holiday in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA> This issue is now showing signs of becoming a sterile paper war between Minister Causley and me. If that emerged it would be regrettable. On 18 May I met Minister Causley and put a well-documented, well-researched and thoroughly authorised proposal to him about how we could settle the south-east forests dispute. On 30 May he replied saying in part that he had not studied all of the factors but, nonetheless, that he was not disposed to agree. After the Nick Greiner statement on 6 June I wrote to Minister Causley and I have now received further correspondence. The letter he wrote to which I have just referred and which I will now table raises a debating point which, in the context of this dispute, throws an interesting light on how Minister Causley seems to be handling the matter. It is a silly and stupid proposition that he has raised.</PARA>
<PARA> The argument between us is this: he says that there are not sufficient resources to enable us to conduct a 12-month biological study of the area. I have said to him that, according to calculations based on New South Wales Forestry Commission figures, there are sufficient resources; and, if he disagrees with my allegation and we find as the 12-month study nears completion there are inadequate resources, I will vary the proposal to guarantee that I deliver the proposition I have put to the sawmillers and to the industry in the south-east and will make additional resources available.</PARA>
<PARA> Minister Causley still says that there are not sufficient resources. I have then said that if he still discounts that proposition the State of New South Wales and the Commonwealth of Australia should form a joint monitoring group to assess whether the yield from each of the compartments cut, as we proceed through the study, matches our figures or whether there is need for early correction of our figures. He has not answered that proposition, nor has he answered the proposition that I have put as to how we make the figures good if I am in fact wrong. I believe that on all of the figures supplied I am not wrong and that Minister Causley has not answered any of the reasonable proposals I have put in order to break the deadlock on the issue. He now writes in a silly, stupid way that there needs to be further interchange of correspondence between us before he will agree even to meet to discuss a resolution.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that I have addressed meetings of shop stewards from sawmills and rank and file workers from the Harris-Daishowa woodchip operation at Eden. They have endorsed the proposal subject to guarantees of job security for the 12 months of the study. I have spoken to the Bega and Bombala shire councils and to the Eden Chamber of Commerce. There is a strong view, shared by conservationists as well as industry and community figures, that there should be a quick settlement of this issue. I find it annoying and childish in the extreme that Minister Causley still holds off from even coming to meet the Commonwealth and pursuing any formula that we might be able to devise between us to settle this issue. I table the letter.</PARA>

For the record, I observe that Senator Puplick has not taken a point of order on those grounds as he is so fond of doing when questions come from this side of the House. I will have Senator Boswell's specific reference to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) checked. I was told on Friday that the reasonable benefits limits, or RBLs, are completely unrelated to the superannuation package which is before the Senate now. They may or may not be related to some other legislation which is before the Senate; I am not sure. The sheet of paper which Senator Boswell was good enough to give me on Friday afternoon contained a number of figures, some of which he has repeated in his question. I think the Treasurer's office would now have sent it to the Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC) for an assessment. From my quick reading of them, the alleged losses were hypothetical losses based on an assumption that certain people would remain in government employment for a long period-I am not sure whether it is 10 or 20 years-additional to their existing service, or something like that. I expect that before too long the Treasurer will get and pass on to me an assessment from the ISC about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As for the overlap, if any, between the section which Senator Boswell cited-I did not have time to write it down fully-and RBLs, I will have that checked, but the advice that I received, admittedly quickly, on Friday afternoon was that the superannuation package, of I think five Bills in total, was not functionally related to the RBL question although the RBL is part of the Government's entire superannuation policy, as it should be.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of calls from members of the Opposition, and especially from the new shadow Treasurer, Dr Hewson, for improved-that is, tighter-targeting of welfare benefits. The answer to the last part of the question in which I am asked what effect tighter targeting would have on aged people who had some superannuation income, is that it would depend on the extent to which the targeting was `improved', as Dr Hewson put it, or, in reality, tightened. If, for example, the withdrawal rate of the pension were to be 100 per cent-that is, if at some point for each dollar of non-pension income the pension payable were to be reduced by an equal amount-the effective marginal tax rate for somebody in receipt of superannuation payments would be 100 per cent. There is a considerable gap between the income test which applies now and the 100 per cent figure, which is the tightest bit of targeting that we could get in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not imagine that even Dr Hewson is contemplating a one for one withdrawal of pension entitlements because of superannuation income, but he is clearly contemplating something tighter than presently applies. I wonder how that ties in with the alleged concern of the Opposition for aged people in receipt of or expecting to be in receipt of superannuation benefits, and how it thinks that that will provide a saving incentive of the type that it is always talking about.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also a well known fact that, far from pursuing a policy of improved targeting-that is, tighter targeting-the last time the present Leader of the Opposition contested a Federal election his policy so far as age pensions were concerned was to have no targeting at all; that is, to abolish the assets test so that everybody could escape the target, so that everybody could become an invisible target by transforming income, through some devious means, into assets if he had not already done so. It would be nice to know whether the Opposition stands for tighter targeting a la Hewson, or no targeting at all, as Mr Peacock proposed the last time that he was Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to a comment that Dr Hewson made prior to being the shadow Treasurer and, indeed, prior to being a member of the House of Representatives. In the Business Review Weekly of October 1986, he wrote that the Opposition would have no credibility until it spelled out the details of its taxation policy. Likewise, it will have no credibility until it spells out the details of its expenditure policies and, in particular, with reference to this question, whether it stands for tighter targeting or no targeting at all.</PARA>

I ask: Has the Government considered its position with regard to the naval bombardment and air to ground firing range on the Beecroft Peninsula, Jervis Bay?

Are live bombardment and air to ground firings essential if the Defence Force is to maintain operational efficiency? Does the Defence Force have any other suitable firing ranges in the south-eastern Australian area? Is it a fact that no environmental or Aboriginal objections were made to the Jervis Bay range when it was established nearly 40 years ago, or for many years afterwards? Does the Minister believe that strong objections would not be raised if a new range were attempted to be established anywhere else in the south-eastern Australian area?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope I got down all those questions; I was doing my best. The honourable senator asks for some of the reasons why the Beecroft Peninsula range was chosen in the first place. He suggests that it was partly because it was easier for the New Zealand Air Force and partly for expense reasons at Shoalwater Bay. I think both of those reasons, in part, are true. I think I mentioned in the Senate the other day that there are only two ranges on the whole of the east coast, let alone the south-east coast-Shoalwater Bay in Queensland and the Beecroft Peninsula at Jervis Bay. Given that there are only two ranges on the whole of the coast, one wonders how easy it would be to establish another one if one were to do away with the range on the Beecroft Peninsula.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Hamer also asked whether the ranges were essential. I do not think any defence force can maintain its capability without a practice range and exercises of the kind that should have been held last week. Over the last couple of weeks I have been trying to find out what objections have ever been raised in respect of the range at Jervis Bay. When the range was first commissioned in the early 1950s certainly no objections were raised. Objections regarding the Jervis Bay area generally have been a much more recent phenomenon. I have now found out, at least, where the suggestion that the firing last week might have interfered with 200 Aboriginal sacred sites has come from. Two hundred sacred sites were identified in a report written in 1986. However, those sites were all around Jervis Bay. They were certainly not all on the Beecroft Peninsula. In terms of what I said last week I can confirm that we are aware of only 25 of them on the peninsula and only one in the impact area of the range.</PARA>

I have not been down to inspect the area, but from what I have seen of it in maps and pictures and from the discussions I have had with officers of the Department of Defence, whilst a fence covers one part of it, there is a great area where it is not too difficult to enter the range. Obviously, given the expense that the Defence Force has to go through to set up operations of the kind that took place last week, we cannot afford to have them continually disrupted in the way they were last week. So the Department is looking at new ways to ensure that the sort of reasonable, proper exercise that was to be held last week can be held in future without interruption.</PARA>

It seems from Senator Stone's interjections that he feels that fiscal policy should be tightened further. Therefore, I invite him to provide a list of those areas in which he believes fiscal policy should be tightened further in time for the Government to consider them for the 1989 Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support. Perhaps the question should go to Senator Richardson, if he would rather answer it. I draw the Minister's attention to airline industry estimates which suggest that the air traffic controllers dispute, now entering its fourth month, is estimated to have cost Australian air services more than $26m to date. Given that the outdated conditions and facilities at Sydney Airport are at the heart of this dispute and given that commuter airlines such as Hazelton Air Services Pty Ltd are finding particular difficulty in providing services when they are reduced to one flight slot per hour to service 23 country airports, I ask: When is the environmental impact statement (EIS) for the third runway to be started? Is it a fact that it has not yet commenced? If it has started when did it start and what is the likely completion date? Does the Minister agree that commuter airlines are likely to face severe financial difficulties if the dispute continues without resolution? Does the Minister accept that companies such as Australian Airlines, with losses in the vicinity of $12m so far, are likely to be forced to lift ticket prices to cover these losses?</PARA></TALK.START>

I think the main part of the question really concerns the EIS and the third runway. The difficulties that are being experienced with air traffic controllers are not related to that. It is much more of an industrial relations problem. I understand that undertakings to do the right thing from now on have been received from the air traffic controllers. I only hope that they are kept. It is quite clear, not only with Hazelton Airways but also with a number of internal airlines in New South Wales and airlines generally across Australia, that this has been an extremely damaging dispute. I particularly worry about its effect on international tourism. There is no question that a great many international tourists have had their plans disrupted. I hope that does not reflect too badly on us in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am asked about the environmental impact statement. It has not yet started because the Government is honouring its undertaking to consult with the community about its terms before its commencement. That consultation is proceeding.

My Department does not conduct those negotiations. I understand that commuter airlines are in difficulties as a result of that dispute, but, as I said, it is not a dispute that will be solved by a third runway. It will be solved by the Government and the air traffic controllers coming to a proper agreement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No-one in the airport debate seriously believed at any stage that there did not have to be an EIS. The comment made by Senator Brownhill is typical of the National Party's attitude to the environment, be it the urban environment or the rural environment. Senator Brownhill is a joke, a throwback, when it comes to the environmental debate. There is no doubt that when one considers a development such as the third runway quite clearly there are a number of very important issues to be considered. There are a million people living around that airport who would certainly want to know what sort of effects the third runway would have on their daily lives. Those million people are at least entitled to know, by way of an EIS, what those effects will be. There is a place of which Senator Brownhill may have heard called Botany Bay where Captain Cook landed some time ago. There are a lot of people who consider Botany Bay to be important as well and who are concerned about possible impacts on the bay. Further, had Senator Brownhill bothered to consult the fishing industry he would understand that it is concerned about it as well. For all of those reasons, an EIS is necessary and only the most ignorant of senators would believe otherwise.</PARA></TALK.START>

If that were the case I am sure all honourable senators would be shocked and horrified, but the fact is that Australia has not sold arms to China. If Australia has not sold arms to China one wonders what the import of the question was. Senator McLean is shaking his head. I will read his question. He asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In view of the recent actions in China when the People's Liberation Army turned on the people, massacring thousands, no doubt using some imported arms, does the Minister agree that the Australian Government has no control over the use to which its exported arms are put?</PARA>
<PARA>Given that there is absolutely no correlation between the situation in China and the export of Australian arms, I do not think his question is valid. Nonetheless, it has to be noted that China is a major producer of arms, particularly small arms; in the lower technology areas it is an arms exporter. It is certainly capable of producing armoured vehicles. So the presumption that the Chinese forces would have used imported arms at all is highly doubtful and, in fact, highly improbable.</PARA>
<PARA> The second part of Senator McLean's question also, unfortunately, is based on a false premise. That false premise is that the Government has at any stage weakened controls on the export of arms. In fact, the Government streamlined the processes whereby legitimate defence export requests can be dealt with. Defence exports are subject to rigorous controls in accordance with Customs regulations, and those regulations apply equally to aggressive or defensive equipment. Australia will not export goods to countries in regard to which the United Nations Security Council has instituted measures. It will not export where that export is proscribed by international agreements to which Australia is a party. Obviously the Australian Government would not export arms where they were to be used for the purposes of the suppression of human rights. There are very few Australian arms producers and they are all well known to the Department of Defence, which is the export authority for arms. They are all cooperating with the Defence Department. The Customs procedures make it very difficult to evade the requirements. It is worth noting that those requirements are being strengthened. Therefore, there is no need to review the policy or the procedures for military exports from Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before lunch I was dealing with that section of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill that deals with the general practitioners register. Over the lunch break I had the opportunity to speak to the President of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners who informed me that one of the things I said in the earlier part of my speech was incorrect. I drew attention to the concern that general practitioners who ceased to be general practitioners for a time and then sought to be placed back on the register would not be able to be so placed. I am assured that under the rules which have been circulated, although not widely, that is not the case and those who have satisfied the criteria could immediately be placed back on the register even though for various reasons they may have dropped out of general practice for a time. But that in itself draws attention to the fact that these rules, which clearly are part of what the Government is proposing, have not been widely circulated. There is an opportunity in the next few months for those rules which go with the legislation to be more widely understood. I therefore move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate is of the opinion that women who choose to give birth at home are disadvantaged because of their ineligibility for Medicare rebates for the services of a midwife, and the Government should take urgent action to remedy this unfairness''. </PARA>
<PARA>I understand that the Government is looking at this matter. It is our intention to underscore the concern which has been expressed in a number of quarters. </PARA>
<PARA> The other main matter relates to the reinsurance proposals. For some time in Australia we have had a dual system of health insurance-a public and a private system. The Government, I understand, is committed to the maintenance of that dual system, but it is in a bit of a cleft stick with respect to private health insurance because as in many other areas of its activity it seems to be committed to a market system and market forces. The community rating system is imposed on private health funds. So an anomaly is built into that private system in that the funds are constrained by community rating: that is, people who choose to take out private health insurance will pay a premium which is uninfluenced by their expectation of illness. </PARA>
<PARA> Recognising that, the former Government in 1977 created a reinsurance fund into which the Government itself paid a certain amount of money to pick up part of the cost of those people who claimed against funds in excess of the average. The rule was that the cost of care for a person who spent more than 35 days in hospital could be picked up and paid for out of this reinsurance fund. That fund had $50m paid into it by the Government in 1977. It went to $125m in 1981, and back to $100m in 1982-83. But when the present Government came in, it dropped that amount down to $20m, to $5m in 1986, and to only $1m in 1987, where it has stayed ever since. So this Government has seriously run down the amount of money it places into that reinsurance pool. </PARA>
<PARA> The funds are of different sorts and have different histories. There are a number of closed funds which insure people who are in particular occupations, such as police and teachers. By definition, people who are in full time work are, in general, much more healthy than others in the community. It is known in epidemiological circles as the healthy worker effect. It is well recognised. The open funds necessarily involve a higher proportion of people who are more likely to call on the funds. The open funds are essentially of two sorts. There are the older funds, which have been operating for some time, and several newer funds. The older funds, again by nature of being older funds, will have more older people and therefore people more likely to call on this reinsurance fund. </PARA>
<PARA> The combination of the length of time which those funds have been in operation and the running down of the reinsurance pool by the Government has led to a situ- ation where some of those funds are in extreme difficulty. The consequences of their not being able to meet their commitments would be that the older people in those funds would be disadvantaged. Quite rightly, the Government has recognised that and has sought to address the needs of the elderly in the community of whom there will be more as time goes on. But it has done it in a way which, in our view, is quite inappropriate because it does not address the basic underlying problem. It has sought to levy further the closed funds and the newer funds to pay money into the reinsurance fund and out of that to recoup the claims made not only by those in hospital for more than 35 days but also by all those over the age of 65 years. It is claimed that this is an extension of the community rating system. In our view, the Government is proposing a bandaid measure. It clearly will help those older funds in the short term but not in the longer term. Consequently, in the longer term it cannot help the older people in those funds. Something much more fundamental needs to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> The actuarial data on which the calculation of premiums is based is extremely difficult. For that reason, we have not attempted to make an accurate prediction as to what changes need to be made. The data being difficult, it is appropriate that this matter also be referred to the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance which is to be set up. We are suggesting that the terms of reference be such that that committee report on this reference by the first sitting day in March next year, giving it enough time to look at that data. </PARA>
<PARA> We were minded initially to reject this part of the legislation outright. We believed that that was the best course of action because it would not solve these very serious problems in the long run. But the Opposition has chosen to pass this part of the legislation and refer it to a committee. We are supporting that but, as we believe that the Government's proposal will run into difficulties further down the track, we are proposing a sunset clause to be placed in clauses 37 and 38 of the legislation so that the Government, in essence, can have its present arrangements. These arrangements will stay in place until the end of the year. It will have the report of the Senate Select Committee by the first sitting day in March. It will then have three months in which to review this area of private health insurance and to make modifications in the light of that Committee report. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of proposals have been put forward. It has been suggested that the Government, as it has in the past, put money into the reinsurance pool. That would be of advantage, particularly to old people, because as the costs of the premiums increase, more of the healthy will drop out-this is under the present government scheme-and that will further disadvantage the elderly and those who have heavier claims experience. The alternative, if the Government were to put more money in, would mean that premiums may be kept lower. That might encourage more people into private health insurance. Indirectly, that would benefit the elderly, particularly as more of them would be able to go into private hospital accommodation and relieve the waiting lists. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats, in initially seeking to reject this part of the legislation, were in no way rejecting the needs of the elderly but merely wishing to underscore the way in which this legislation will not fulfil those needs in the long term. What is now proposed clearly will be able to achieve that end. Therefore, the Committee to be set up will have two terms of reference. The first will be the general practitioners accreditation system and registration scheme, on which the Committee will have to report on the first sitting day in August. The second term of reference will deal with this reinsurance matter, the date for the reporting of which will be the first sitting day in March. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention very briefly in the last few minutes left to me that we are also concerned with the matter of accommodation for the disabled. Clauses 53 and 61 propose amendments to facilitate the phased transfer of all nursing homes for disabled persons from the Nursing Homes Assistance Act 1974 to the Disability Services Act 1986 by June 1992. I seek leave to move amendments to Senator Puplick's motion that the legislation be referred to a committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just listened to Senator Coulter's explanations of what the Australian Democrats are proposing to do in respect of this legislation, and I must say that I find those proposals bizarre and most offensive. I am very pleased to support this package of legislation introduced by the Government. I urge all other senators to do the same. Senator Coulter referred to two items that I particularly want to address-the problem of general practitioners and their registration and the problem of reinsurance. He commenced his remarks by saying that nowhere in our training in medical school do we learn to deal with the problems that confront general practitioners (GPs). That was just an attempt at bitty point scoring by the honourable senator. But one of the problems in medicine is that that is not taught to any doctor. Not only general practitioners but all doctors need the skill of being able to listen to patients with sympathy and understanding. In fact, one criticism that is often made against some of our specialist colleagues is that they do not seem to have the capacity to talk or listen to people. If the honourable senator wants to improve medical training by including in the medical undergraduate course such subjects as the consideration of psychological factors, this should be done not only because it might benefit GPs but also because it might be good for general practical medical care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Coulter justifies his opposition to this legislation by suggesting that some of these things were not done back in the 1950s when he was studying medicine. That seems to me to be spurious in the extreme. It may depend on which medical school he went to. I was a tutor for first year medical and nursing students at the Flinders University Faculty of Medicine from the time that medical school was established. I was involved with the human development side and I assisted students in the first and subsequent years to deal with their basic general practice associations and training. In fact, contrary to some other medical schools, the Flinders medical school took general practice and family medicine practice very seriously. For example, it dealt with community medicine in a different way from the University of Adelaide school of medicine. By way of comment on what Senator Coulter had to say, I urge caution, that general practice training--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not misunderstand at all; indeed, I think the honourable senator does. General practice medicine has been acknowledged for a long time as a very worthy discipline. In fact, general practitioners have been fighting in a separate ballpark from the rest of their medical colleagues. Perhaps the honourable senator remembers-perhaps he does not, but I do-the effect on general practice medicine when the then Minister for Social Security, Bill Hayden, established or assisted the funding of the family medicine program. That led to a great sneering campaign-I can think of other words, but I believe they are not parliamentary-by the medical specialists at their general practitioner colleagues. They ridiculed and laughed at the general practitioners for wanting a college, for wanting to upgrade their skills and for wanting to address in-service training and ongoing postgraduate medical training for general practice, let alone the contribution that this could make to the undergraduate training of medicos.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would have thought that in opposing this legislation Senator Coulter is actually contradicting all the things he wants to see happen. What is the possible reason for opposing the establishment of a register of general practitioners under the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners? This simply brings the College into line with other specialties in medicine. The Government has not determined this proposal; it has been done in consultation with the College. It is very similar to the set-up of other specialties. The Government is not determining who shall be a general practitioner or who shall be registered. It is saying, `We will take account of and acknowledge, as you have asked us to do, the importance of in-service training, postgraduate specialist training and the need to increase the skills of general practitioners. If you do that, we will assist in the encouragement that you want to give to the training of general practitioners by providing an increase in fees in recognition of those skills gained by general practitioners'. What possible reason does Senator Coulter have for opposing such a proposal which will do precisely what he reckons should be done? Because apparently 10 per cent or 10 to one of the letters he received were running against it in the first place, he was persuaded to go against his preferred ideas of what would be good for general practice training. I cannot understand how he can stand up in this place and oppose the recommendations in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the people who wrote arguing appallingly about the challenges and the dreadful things in this legislation had their facts wrong and they did not bother to check them out. I have a letter from the Australian Medical Association dated 9 May 1989 which deals, amongst other things, with the problem of women doctors-and I must say that the AMA writing on behalf of equal opportunity means that miracles are possible. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA>The real problem for women is that in many cases they do not practise medicine full time, preferring to practise one or two sessions per week. </PARA>
<PARA>If they practise two sessions a week, by definition under this legislation they would qualify for registration and the higher fees. If they do not, they will continue to enjoy remuneration at the present level. Nobody is going to suffer a setback unless what the honourable senator proposes is carried through this place. Not only would the second tier not be introduced but also the 5 per cent increase to be introduced with the schedule changes in August this year will not take place. </PARA>
<PARA> I will be very interested to see whether the Opposition and the Democrats will say to the general practitioners of Australia, `We are minded', for reasons that are absolutely unclear, `to defer this legislation'. They will hold up the introduction of the new schedule of fees and an increase for about 90 per cent of the general practitioners in this country because they think the Senate might be able to do a little better on this than the appropriate specialist college-the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners-in consultation with the Government. It is interesting that a part of the Senate is minded to set itself above what is in this legislation, which was introduced after extensive consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter suggests that not enough people know about this legislation. Well, many got to know, because they wrote him letters. As a doctor, I have received a letter from the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, but I am not registered as a general practitioner. Presumably, like most of the drug companies, the College has a hit list of all the doctors in this country. I am sure that Senator Baume agrees with me-and Senator Coulter probably does, too-that we get a lot of mail because we are on various mailing lists. I got a letter telling me what the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners preferred in this area, what it had done, how extensively it had talked and how it had written to every doctor involved. It is not correct to say that aspects of this whole matter have not been raised with the doctors of this country. It is interesting to note why, with all that information, a campaign has slowly been mounted to oppose the legislation. What possible objection can there be to a register of general practitioners which will be handled through their own College? What possible objection can there be for an acknowledgment-as this legislation does-of the benefits of in-service training, improved skills and the development of general practitioners? What possible objection can honourable senators have to the acknowledgment of increased skills by giving the incentive of increased medical rebates? I just do not understand what his case is. There is no logic to it. He must be running interference for the AMA or some subset of doctors who have persuaded him to think peculiarly. </PARA>
<PARA> If the honourable senator has some difficulty with the definition and if he had stood up and said something about that, I might have said, `Well, you might have a case until we sort it out-I have spoken to the Department and to the people involved and I think there are minimal difficulties'. Anyhow, even if there are difficulties, they are the sorts of things that the College, and the independent group set up to look after this, will be able to sort out in due course. Does the honourable senator really want to say that the whole thing should be held up, that all GPs in this country should be dudded of an increase in their remuneration, let alone advised that they will not be able to make up their own minds and that it would be better for the Senate to do it for them? I think that would be offensive in the extreme to the professional status of the College and the general practitioners as well as those people in the Department of Community Services and Health who have worked this through. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly, Mr Acting Deputy President. I am sorry if you have not been able to hear. Time constraints prevent me from running through all the arguments. However, Senator Coulter in particular has talked from time to time about the importance of concern for patients. It is the patients themselves, particularly the elderly, who are concerned about the effect of the delay or defeat of this legislation on general practice registration and consequential changes in fees. That would make a difference in terms of remuneration to doctors. A lot of elderly folk who seek to see their doctors may still be charged under the time arrangement instead of under the professional competence arrangement which is proposed under this legislation-that is, the second tier of remuneration. It also means that doctors may be encouraged to cease bulkbilling, at least to some extent. The increased remuneration would acknowledge the contribution of general practitioners in this society. It would also acknowledge their contribution financially and assist them in continuing to bulkbill, as I believe something like 60 per cent of services through general practice are currently bulkbilled. From the practitioners' and the college's point of view, from a recognition of the professional competence and independence of the College of General Practitioners and what is best in terms of care for patients, I cannot see how anybody would want to oppose the legislation. I am totally unpersuaded by the arguments that Senator Coulter put up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I make some comments on reinsurance, I allude briefly to Senator Boswell's motion which seeks to alter the terms of reference of the inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. I am advised by the Chairperson of that Committee that the terms of reference have not yet been brought to her attention, which I think is offensive in the extreme. I believe that the Opposition has discussed them with the Australian Democrats. The Democrats would not support the terms of reference when seven or 10 points were included, but now they have been reduced to four the Democrats think there may be some mileage in it. Again, I do not know why when many of the points raised and the areas floated by Senator Boswell were covered in the Senate Committee's inquiry into nursing homes and hospitals. Senator Walters would have to agree that at that time we looked at the problems of people with disability who found themselves in nursing homes that provided care for a whole range of people. We appreciated then and commented in our report that that was a less than optimal way of attending to the accommodation needs of people with disability. The disability legislation has taken up some of these issues and is dealing with them. It is quite retrograde to ask the Senate Committee to take on this reference in some ways yet again. As we are also dealing with a specific term of reference going to the employment of people with disability, I do not see that we should extend it to housing, particularly as much has already been said about it by the Standing Committee dealing with it. </PARA>
<PARA> When I became a senator I was advised that standing committees' terms of reference were the business of government. Since I have been on the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, we have had nothing but references dumped on us by the Opposition, in cahoots with the Democrats-sometimes because the Democrats want a royal commission and people will not go that far, and in this case because people want to run interference on behalf of the disability legislation. They are not seriously inquiring into this area; they are just making a problem for government. Now people are requiring the Senate Committee to take references as a kind of motion to the legislation. That is not the appropriate way to deal with the legislation. Opposition members should support it or defeat it; they should not muck around. </PARA>

I do not think that I should take up puerile issues. I will turn briefly to the matter of reinsurance, which is a problem for the Opposition. Page 3281 of the House of Representatives Hansard of 31 May 1989 records Dr Blewett, at the beginning of his answer to a question by Mrs Harvey, as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I say to the Opposition that it seems quite clear that what happens on the Opposition benches in the House of Representatives seems not to be transmitted to the Opposition in the Senate. Again, I do not quite understand why the Democrats would want to oppose this. I have heard the word `bandaid' used, but that is a very unfair reading of the aims of the legislation in terms of reinsurance. The legislation supports and develops the community rating principle and that is something we must keep in mind. What the Government proposes-and this is after consultation with the industry and with the support of most of the industry-is that the community rating principle will apply and everybody in the private insurance industry and health area will pick up some contribution to the cost of insuring people who are either elderly or chronically ill. Both of those categories of people are the areas that make the largest and most expensive claims against health insurance. If we want the health insurance industry to survive and to be able to provide extra care and support for people through the private insurance pool, we must also make the costs manageable, affordable and equitable not only for those in the community who buy the insurance but also for those within the insurance industry. It is unreasonable to expect some of the older, more established insurance firms to pick up in large cost the insurance of elderly people, particularly those who either become elderly over the years of insurance with that organisation or join because they know they will get that kind of coverage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important to support the principle of reinsurance. Anybody who argues that the proposal is just a bandaid measure does not appreciate that it continues the principles on which the whole private insurance industry vis-a-vis the Government has been negotiating and has been established since the Government came to office. The Opposition seems to object to it and I do not know why. Does the Opposition suggest that there should not be a community rating? Does it suggest that people should buy insurance according to their means? Does it suggest that there should be front-end deductibles or that people who are well should take the risk of not being insured? Does it suggest that this is just another means by which, one way or another, we can have yet another committee with which it can kick Medicare to death? Does the Opposition remember why Medicare was established? It was established to cover some two million Australians who were not insured and who are now covered. If the Opposition would do away with Medicare, if it has some kind of divine plan in the private insurance area, would it please make it clear so we can look at it and argue to the community what the Opposition really means? Would the Opposition say to people who as individuals on about $9,500 are exempt from the 1.25 per cent-or is it 1.5?-Medicare levy--</PARA>

Would the Opposition say to those people who have children, whose exemption on family income increases by $2,300 or thereabouts each year per child, `We will do away with Medicare. You can buy private insurance or you can risk being uninsured.'? Does the Opposition seriously argue that we should go back to pre-Medicare days when people could not afford insurance and took the risk of being outside it because of the prices-the inequity in costing?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the things the Opposition has to deal with is the fact that Medicare is in place and has benefited those two million people, plus many thousands of other Australians; they make a choice and they have made their choices clear. Private insurance, as a percentage, has settled down to just below 50 per cent. That is how many people insure privately now. The others say, `Thank you very much.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come back to them. It makes no difference talking to Senator Knowles. She hears nothing and learns nothing. When we talk about the quality of medical care in this country we should be very proud. Our public hospital system is excellent, and our general practice and provision of specialist medical care around this country is something that we should be proud of, not something that we kick to death as the Opposition does.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From time to time, of course, there are problems. We acknowledge that. I advert to the hospital waiting lists, which seem to be the only thing on which Senator Knowles can focus attention. They are the only things she can find to criticise. A number of points need to be made. The first is that waiting lists are essentially in the hands of doctors, not hospitals. They depend upon whom doctors list for surgery, elective surgery in particular. We all know that people who need emergency care in this country get it. We also know that people who have coronary operations or need intensive care do not go to private hospitals for the large part. They go to the public hospital system because that is where the quality medical care in this country is provided. The demands on the public hospital system are extensive. We have had it argued at length in this place that the increased demands on the public hospital system depend on a number of causes which are not easily addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> The causes concern the increase in high technology developments in medical care. People who are able to have hip or knee replacements can enjoy that kind of care. They will take that opportunity, and their doctors will urge them to take it, making their lives healthier, happier, and free of pain, at least in large part. There are many other high-tech developments in the medical area that put special strains on the use of public hospital facilities. On a few occasions negotiations have enabled such facilities to be provided in the private hospital system, provided the assistance for that technology is approved by a committee which examines the need for, and the proper distribution of, such high-tech services. </PARA>
<PARA> The other causes of demands made on hospital services have been addressed on a number of occasions. In fact, the Federal Government, in recognition of those difficulties has agreed with State Ministers for health, and is already putting money in place, to assist the State governments in addressing the problems of demand on their public hospitals and those waiting lists. I hope there will continue to be-and, under this Government, I have no reason to think otherwise-imaginative solutions proposed to the challenges of delivering the comprehensive and very good medical care that we have known throughout this country. </PARA>
<PARA> We also know there are some areas where people do not have access to the same excellent service. For example, sometimes people in rural or isolated areas do not have immediate access to the same quality of care as people living in metropolitan cities around Australia. That is also addressed under the general practice proposals, where the hospital provision of services by medical practitioners in rural areas will be accredited towards their general practice skills and development. So in some ways, through the general practice registration and the changes proposed in that area of health, the provision of medical care in the country will continue to try to meet the requirements of an adequate service with a level of skills in medical care which matches as far as possible what is provided in our major urban areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe the reinsurance principles can be opposed. The Government is seriously addressing the way in which we can have the best equity in the health reinsurance area. The Government also has letters and press releases from Australian pensioners and the Australian Council on the Ageing, saying that they strongly urge the support of this legislation to allow the reinsurance proposals to go through. I do not understand why the Opposition continues to oppose these very reasonable, comprehensive and modest changes under the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill. These changes have been examined by a wide range of people who will be affected. They have been developed after deliberate and serious consultation with the people involved. They meet the proper requirements of what is proposed under the legislation, giving a definition of a general practitioner; acknowledging the importance of postgraduate in-service training, and providing a financial incentive to support that principle and encourage it. We have received approval for the reinsurance proposals from pensioners and chronically ill people. They know the proposals will enable them to buy private insurance because the costs will be shared by a number of companies and able to be kept modest and in check. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the disability legislation is concerned, I simply make the comment that it is peculiar that the Opposition, instead of opposing the legislation, has moved a motion for a reference, yet again, to a Senate select committee without approaching the chairperson of such a committee, let alone anybody else. That is a very inefficient way to tackle legislation. I do not believe the proposals in this legislation will disadvantage people, and I do not believe a Senate select committee will provide more information to improve what is proposed under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I urge those people who think a Senate committee inquiry into general practitioner fees will be the way to parousia, let alone a better answer, to rethink. The costs to general practitioners around the country will be extensive indeed. The increased payments to general practitioners amounting, on estimate, to $15,000 a year, will be deferred, if not denied, for many months. The definitions-which seem to be at issue, rather than the substance of the legislation-will not necessarily be improved by asking a Senate committee to take over the role of the college in consultation with government. I think it is arrogant in the extreme to suggest that is the better way to go. If the problems are only definitional, that should have been the substance of Senator Coulter's objections rather than historical references to the time when he was at school. I do not believe there is any substance in the Opposition's criticisms of any of the proposals under this legislation. I will be interested to hear what other arguments-spurious as they will be-the Opposition mounts to convince me otherwise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again we are debating in this chamber further amendments to the National Health Act. What a shambles the Government's Medicare has become. During the years this Government has been in power we have had 17 different changes to Medicare, not counting the updating of income thresholds. Now we have an additional number before us today. It is about time that the Government realised that Medicare is just not working. Despite everything that the Government has done, or attempted to do, medical and hospital services are rapidly deteriorating, at the same time becoming so expensive that the Government is unable to contain the blowout in expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Public hospitals are strapped for funds. We have long hospital queues and have had for years. Senator Crowley said that that was a problem, that Medicare had a few small problems. People in those hospital queues do not believe it is a small problem at all. It is just plain bad medicine. We know there have been deaths among people who have been waiting in hospital queues. It is time the Government realised that Medicare and its general philosophy on medicine has to be changed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government in its early days did everything possible to get rid of private hospitals. It socialised three-quarters of the health funds business in the hope that this would sound the death knell for private hospitals. When that did not work, it reduced the Medicare rebate to patients in private hospitals to 75 per cent of the doctors' scheduled fee. If patients had the temerity to want private insurance to pay the additional cost of private contributions on top of the levy they were already paying, the Government penalised them and would not allow them the 85 per cent rebate that patients had received until then. </PARA>
<PARA> These gross inequities have caught up with the Government. As Dr Blewett has forced patients out of private insurance and out of the private hospital system, slowly but surely the public hospital system is buckling under the weight. Public hospital queues are lengthening, their costs are escalating and the Government's health bill is skyrocketing. Instead of realising that the Government's whole philosophy is at fault and instead of making appropriate changes, this incompetent Minister applies more bandaids. He is intent on blaming everyone except himself. He has called the doctors every name he can lay his tongue to. Only under Dr Blewett has this country seen nurses on strike, doctors resigning from their jobs, and pathologists taking the Government to court-and, I might add, winning. Only under this Government have we had patients dying before they have been attended to because of hospital queues. Only under this Government have pharmacists closed their doors in protest against government measures. Prior to this the medical and paramedical community worked extremely well. As I have said, further bandaids are now to be applied through this legislation. What a woeful reputation this Government has acquired in such a few years!</PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before the Senate deals with several areas. I will describe first the Government's proposed changes to the general practitioners' (GP) schedule fee. I believe this is the first step in a preferred provider scheme. The Government has decided that there will be two types of general practitioners: the good general practitioner and the lesser general practitioner. The good general practitioner will be on the vocational register and the lesser general practitioner will not. The good general practitioner will attract a higher rebate than the lesser general practitioner. As usual, the aim is to cut costs and to help the Government overcome the blow-out in its financing of Medicare. I have only to quote from the second reading speech of the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) to point this out. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>In the longer term, the Government expects general practitioners to be more willing to care for more complex conditions within their competence and to be more discriminating in their use of specialist referrals, prescribing and diagnostic tests. </PARA>
<PARA> This should lead to reduced costs in the secondary and tertiary sectors and overall a much more effective use of health resources. </PARA>
<PARA>Once again, it is not a case of good medicine or otherwise; it is just a case of cutting costs. How will the Government do this? A few minutes ago we listened to Senator Crowley telling us what a wonderful thing a vocational register for general practitioners was. In this Senate we can only debate what is in the legislation. We are being told that there are agreements with the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, but we do not have that in the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill. All we will have in the legislation is what is being debated in this Senate. I would like to quote from the Bill because I do not believe that all doctors, no matter which side they are on-whether they belong to the College and agree with it or to that group of doctors opposing the College's moves-understand the position. Under the heading `Vocationally registered general practitioners', we find:</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this section is to provide for the registration of certain medical practitioners as vocationally registered general practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA>It then states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission is to establish and maintain a Vocational Register of General Practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> A medical practitioner may apply to the Commission for registration under this section. </PARA>
<PARA>A medical practitioner `may apply' to the Commission. There is no appeal provision if he is rejected. He may apply and he may be knocked back. </PARA>

<PARA> . . . or . . . the applicant is, in accordance with the regulations, eligible for registration under this section . . . </PARA>
<PARA>But we have not seen the regulations. I have sought them but they are unavailable. We are being asked to pass legislation in this Senate that says two things: either a medical practitioner can be registered if it is in accordance with the regulations-we have not seen the regulations and we do not have a clue what they are or what would be the correct thing-or a medical practitioner can be registered if the Royal College says, `You are a pretty good chap'. We have not seen any criteria by which the Royal College could abide that state who should be on the register. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard a lot. We heard Senator Crowley stating that she cannot imagine how we could possibly object to this legislation. That is obviously because she has not read the Bill. She has talked about continuing education and about all the highfalutin things where the Royal College has reached agreement with the Government, but we have not seen them. Despite what Senator Crowley might think, this Senate passes only those things that are written in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, has all the bureaucrats beside him. Why do they insult the Senate by bringing forward legislation that they know this Senate cannot pass? How could we possibly pass legislation that is so shoddily written and contains no criteria? How do we know what will be in the regulations when the Minister has been so lax as to not have them before the Senate at the appropriate time? How do we know what agreements the Minister has made with the Royal College? They are not in the Bill. We cannot pass things in this place that are not in the Bill. I am not interested in the second reading speech of the Minister for Community Services and Health. He has a number of things in his second reading speech. For example, he states:</PARA>
<PARA> A vocational register of general practitioners;</PARA>
<PARA> the requirement that for general practitioners to remain on the register they undertake continuing medical education and quality assurance programs accredited by the RACGP;</PARA>
<PARA>This is in the Minister's second reading speech but it is not in the Bill. He then says:</PARA>
<PARA> In assessing a practitioner's medical practice, the RACGP will have regard to . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is not in the Bill. It is of no use the Minister putting it in his second reading speech. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has accepted that fellowship of the RACGP, or an equivalent post-graduate qualification in general practice, should ultimately be the only experience and training which make it appropriate for a practitioner to be placed on the vocational register. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not in the Bill. It is of no use the Minister giving a second reading speech that has nothing to do with the Bill in front of us. I have never voted for a Bill that has not set out in detail what the legislation should be. I have no intention of ever voting for a Bill that does not do so. The Minister goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> The RACGP has defined part time practice as a minimum of two sessions a week, which the Government regards as a generous provision. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, it is not in the Bill; there is nothing in the Bill. He says that the assessment will be on an individual basis against the eligibility criteria. What are the eligibility criteria? They are not in the Bill. There are so many other matters that I would only be wasting my time if I went through pointing them out. This Senate cannot pass legislation when it has no idea what it is all about. The only time the Bill mentions continuing medical education is when it says that if such education is not undertaken, the person will be thrown off the register. There is no appeal to get on the register and no appeal if one is thrown off. There is nothing in the Bill that says what criteria should be used. </PARA>
<PARA> The next section is on the pathologists. The Opposition is very happy with that and will pass that section. After all, the pathologists took the Government to court and won. We are very happy that that at least has forced the Government-even though it has been dragged screaming-to do the decent thing. Senator Crowley said that she believed that the GP fee might stop bulk billing. Perhaps the penny is dropping; perhaps the Government has seen the light and will get rid of bulk billing. The Minister has not suggested that; it was referred to by Senator Crowley, so I am not sure whether it is fact or otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the question of day surgery beds. The Government is trying to push doctors into using day surgery beds. Doctors are already using day surgery beds to a greater extent than in the past but the decision to do so must remain that of the doctor and his patient. Under this legislation, they are being pressured once again as a cost saving exercise-not as good medicine-to use day surgery beds, which means patients going into hospital and coming out the same day, not staying overnight. They are used when a doctor wants to perform a minor operation on his patient in hospital rather than in his surgery. The doctor must not be pressured. I do not believe that this is the way to go. Doctors are moving that way anyway, but the Government is trying to force the issue. For example, according to the Government, a doctor must have a patient in and out on the same day for a dilation and curettage. If the doctor decides that the medical condition of the patient requires an overnight stay, he then has to fill in forms and put in certificates. This is all the red tape that every socialist government delights in. I could imagine nothing more debilitating for any doctor or his patient than for the doctor to have to fill in forms and write a certificate to make sure that his patient gets proper treatment. There has been very little consultation on that. Indeed, there has been none at all with the medical profession. For that reason we will oppose that provision. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the reinsurance pool. Despite what Senator Crowley says, the Opposition will support this. But we believe that the health funds are now in such a situation, with the Government already having socialised three-quarters of their business, that a Senate select committee should be set up-not a Senate standing committee, as Senator Crowley understood the decision to be-to have a look at the handling of the health funds. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, this is a bandaid measure. First, the Government tried to send all the health funds broke. Finally, Dr Blewett decided that he would have to do something about it. After all, if one of the big funds went to the wall just before an election, he would not be too popular. So he has put forward a bandaid measure to prop up the funds by putting $20m into a reinsurance pool. The Opposition has always believed in community rating. It has been part of its policy from way back. There should be a requirement for all funds to insure all those who wish to be insured-the young and the old-so that the whole funds shares the costs of those most at risk. In other words, the young and the healthy help pay for the aged and frail. They will be aged and frail one day. As I have said, the method proposed by the Government is a bandaid measure only. It is not the way the Opposition would go. It is only a tide over until after the next election. Senator Crowley is obviously unaware that we will be supporting that particular clause. I do not know how she gets in such a mess with some of the things that she misunderstands. We believe that the matter should go to a committee so that it can inquire into the present situation of the health funds as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Time will permit me to touch only very briefly on the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Amendment Bill. Its aim is to change to a needs based application for hostel care. It will provide 60 hostel beds for every 1,000 frail aged in the population. It will also reduce nursing home beds quite considerably to 40 such beds for every one thousand frail aged people. Indeed, this will reduce the present number of nursing home beds by over 25,000. The lack of flexibility is introduced by a provision which prevents the Minister from granting an approval in principle for additional hostel places, with recurrent funding if doing so will cause a maximum number of committee hostel places in States, Territories or regions to be exceeded. That is in the aged care area, and there is considerable concern out there that people will be put out of hostels and nursing beds so that the Government can abide strictly by the Bill that we are debating. </PARA>
<PARA> There is tremendous concern out in the community, not only in the aged area but particularly with the disabled. The disabled community, particularly the parents of disabled people, regard the abolition of the hostel beds as a great tragedy. We are told that the disabled should be out in the community, that they should not be in hostels where many could cope. We are told that they would be far better off either in private homes or sharing with other disabled people in one or two-bedroom homes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has got to understand the great degree of disability and the concerns of parents. I have attended many meetings of the disabled to find that the parents of children, who are gradually getting older and who have been settled in hostels very happily for a considerable number of years, are showing great concern that those children will be put out into the community without the proper support that they believe is necessary. The Government is now very belatedly trying to respond to those concerns in the community. Prior to the last couple of weeks or so, people looking after the disabled in hospitals were told that they had a certain time limit for their changeover. They have been told now that further time has been given to them but there is so little flexibility in the whole of this area that people are very concerned. I think the Government will have to take into consideration the problems that are being expounded in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I now come back to the general mess of Medicare. If the Government has decided that its philosophy is not working, that it will have to stop bulkbilling and that it can no longer downgrade medical services to the people, for heaven's sake it should come out and tell us now and start afresh, and the Opposition will support it. As long as the Government goes on putting bandaids on Medicare it will never make a go of it. I appeal to the Minister to start afresh. We have had 17 amendments to Medicare legislation since the Government has been in office. We have another half dozen now. The Government should start afresh and clear up the whole sorry mess. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating amending legislation in a package of three Bills-the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, the Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill 1989 and the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Amendment Bill 1988. I will deal first with the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill. Like the other two Bills it represents a startling change in direction from where the Government has been heading for some years. It proposes massive changes to the organisation and funding of health services in Australia. It is divided into four main sections dealing, first, with the provision of pathology services; second, with the provision of day surgery services; third, with our medical reinsurance pool, which is vital to the survival of medical insurance in Australia; and, fourth, with the locational registration of general practitioners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The section on pathology establishes a series of rebates for certain conditions which have been agreed upon between the Government and the pathology industry itself. It represents the end product of some years of Government harassment of the industry, which resulted in the industry finally taking the Government to court-which shows how aggressive the Government has been through all that time. The Government at that time had removed unilaterally many services from the pathology list. The upset and disadvantage suffered by patients was great and the action showed a great lack of concern for the people. The court found for the pathologists and the judge's recommendation was devastating in its criticism of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government had always promised the people the best, fairest and most equitable health service in the world through its Medicare program but since its inception the Government has done nothing but restrict and curtail services to the people in every area-pathology, pharmacy, medical and surgical as well as nursing homes and hostels. This has got to a stage where thousands and thousands of people are on waiting lists for elective surgery, for example, at public hospitals. The public hospitals themselves are glutted while the private hospitals have empty beds. There has been harassment to all the providers of care such as the pathologists, radiologists, pharmacists and general practitioners. The Opposition is passing this part of the Bill as there has finally been consultation, cooperation and agreement on the schedule between the Government and the pathologists. </PARA>
<PARA> Day surgery has been around for many years. It has been late arriving in Australia but it is now here. The concept should have been adopted years ago except that the Government could not bring itself to understand just what it meant. Indeed, the Government ridiculed day services and said, without any evidence, that they would provide an inferior service at a higher cost. All the evidence from countries which had day surgery showed that their services were of high quality and of lower cost than similar services in Australia, while providing a better and faster service that was most acceptable to patients. However, the Opposition opposes this legislation for the same reason that the pathologists took the Government to court: because there has been a lack of consultation between the Government and the people who wish to provide the service. The Government is trying to dictate which type of patients will attract what benefits for what conditions in which day surgeries. These are all decisions which should be made between the patients and the doctor with regard to the ability of day surgery to accommodate the procedure. </PARA>
<PARA> Concerning the alterations to the reinsurance pool, the Government maintains that it has a great concern to ensure the provision of services for the aged and chronically ill. But over the years it has shown anything but concern by the gradual withdrawal of its subsidy to the reinsurance pool. Initially the subsidy used to be over $100m a year. A couple of years ago it was reduced to $100m cold and then, I think, to $20m. Now it has been reduced to $1m. This has put all the medical insurance companies on their beam ends. The cost has been paid from the operating surpluses of these companies. No longer do they have the financial strength to provide adequate medical insurance. Had they been allowed to function without undue government interference, this would not be the case now. </PARA>
<PARA> When Medibank started at least 75 per cent of people were privately insured, so it could be fairly claimed that community rating operated-that is to say, the younger, healthier members of the community paid a slightly higher premium in order to cover those requiring more expensive care. By the time Medicare got under way just over 60 per cent of the community carried private medical insurance. After the way in which this Government has operated the system, at the present time only 46 per cent of people are covered by private medical insurance. Any claim that community rating operates now is completely spurious because a clear majority of people are not covered by private medical insurance. If the Government does not put more money into the reinsurance pool, medical insurance companies will have to increase their premiums and this will discourage more people from becoming insured. What the Government is doing now will only aggravate the situation. On top of this, the Government has indicated that it is moving out of the reinsurance pool subsidy altogether and that it is throwing the whole weight of the people it has made poor back on the Government. There can be no relief from the medical insurance industry. The Government will have to shoulder the lot. </PARA>
<PARA> The medical insurance business is in such a muddle now that a full blown Senate committee of inquiry is indicated and this is what the Opposition is recommending. We are allowing this part of the Bill to pass mainly on the assurance of the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) that if it is not passed we will be disadvantaging the aged and the chronically ill. I do not believe the $20m bandaid relief which the Minister is providing to the insurance companies will stave off the evil day. Indeed, it is probably a cynical move to shore up the system so that medical insurance can be taken off the agenda should there be an election. Perhaps the Minister's plan has backfired because his decision was obviously made with the expectation of an early election and now there is little prospect of that. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the vocational registration of general practitioners, it has long been the objective of the Federal Government to gain control of general practitioners. This was only thwarted in the days of Medibank by the fact that general practitioners were all registered in their individual States. Any regimentation of general practitioners into a nationalised health service would require complementary State legislation. This proved impossible to obtain because of the consternation that the Medibank arrangements were causing at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> However this Bill establishes a Federal register for general practitioners who can be put on it or off it on the grounds of whether they are recognised by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. Thus it would be possible for the Government to control not only the numbers of doctors in general practice but also the way they practise, to say nothing of the invasion of privacy of their patients. The Government has not introduced any regulations concerning the vocational registration of general practitioners. But it expects us to trust it to introduce acceptable regulations on the grounds that it has an understanding with a restricted group of general practitioners which only represents a minority of general practitioners in Australia. The Government already has the central register of medical practitioners (CROMP) system in existence in Australia on which most of the specialists are recognised by the Federal Government. The only outstanding major body of doctors not on a central register is the general practitioner. The Government has not made moves so far to nationalise the procedural specialists because it would be impractical to do so without having first got the general practitioners harnessed. </PARA>
<PARA> However, members of CROMP are sitting on the dragon's lip. This was mentioned by the Minister for Community Services and Health in his second reading speech when he said that this legislation was going to be the forerunner of other legislation to place specialists under Federal control. They are sitting on the dragon's lip and when the time is right the fiery fingers of the Federal Government can sweep them into the dragon's maw. The mechanism the Government is using to coerce the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners into accepting its proposal is to stuff its members' mouths with gold. That is to say, members will attract a higher rebate than non-members. Perhaps I should not say `members'. They are people recognised by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners as well as their fellows. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BJ4">Senator SHEIL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is what happened when the British Government nationalised the health service in Great Britain. All this is being done on the grounds of quality assurance, continuing medical education and peer review. The Opposition is not opposed to continuing medical education and high quality medical care. But if the Government's administration of continuing medical education and high quality medical care is the same as its administration of Medicare which promised the best and fairest health system in the world, we can have no confidence in its performance. It is for this reason that the Opposition is referring this matter to a Senate committee for a full inquiry and wide consultation before such a major move as this Bill proposes is accepted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition is prepared to pass clause 10 of the Bill provided it does not come into operation until a date fixed by proclamation, which is after the Senate considers the inquiry and then passes a resolution. The Committee is to inquire into the precise meaning of clause 10 and its implications for doctors, including general practitioners and patients. The inquiry will consider approval or an amendment to clause 10 and is to report back on the vocational register of general practitioners by the first sitting day in September. The inquiry is also to report on the effectiveness of the present health insurance arrangements in Australia in depth. Both aspects of the inquiry are of extreme importance to the further administration of medical services in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The criteria for a general practitioner to qualify for the new general register have not been spelled out by the Government. The Government maintains it has come to some agreement with the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. But this is being carefully kept under wraps so that until the last few days most general practitioners have been completely unaware of this hidden agenda. However it has come to light and was quoted from today by Senator Puplick in his reply at the second reading stage of the Bill. It has been widely circulated by the Australian Medical Association (AMA). As far as I can make out from reading it, it represents the kind of straitjacket which the bureaucracy would dearly love to place on general practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA> The register itself is to be kept by the Health Insurance Commission, not by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. Under this legislation, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners could be replaced as the arbiter of general practitioners' standards by `a body specified in their determinations'. That could be anybody. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BJ4">Senator SHEIL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walters is quite right. It is the beginnings of a preferred provider scheme. The Minister for Community Services and Health quoted the Doherty inquiry into medical education and the medical work force as saying that current medical courses do not prepare doctors adequately to provide good quality general practice and that a medical skills goal is the education of an undifferentiated medical practitioner who is qualified to enter intern training. Professor Doherty also specifically recommended against mandatory vocational training and found:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>There is no firm proof that re-certification improves the quality of health care. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister was selectively quoting from the Doherty report. In any case if the fault is with medical education, that is what we should fix up. We should not put the doctors in a straitjacket. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Community Services and Health maintains that the general practitioners' decision to undertake all these new arrangements is completely voluntary and that general practitioners will not be disadvantaged if they do not register. However, at page 3 of his letter to general practitioners of 30 May 1989 he stated that to remain on the vocational register, general practitioners will be expected to take part in continuing medical education and quality assurance programs as well as to be subject to new random practice audit and monitoring arrangements as well as peer review. All of these types of initiatives have been tried in various forms by different countries. The one thing they all have in common is that they are all failures. Because of the Government's coercion and surveillance of medical practitioners there has been a retreat from the patient in those countries. Doctors tend to practise defensive medicine so they do not cause hiccups on the Government's computers. Doctors' practising, prescribing, operating and visiting habits are all compared with the area average of their peers. If the computer shows a substantial difference in any of these areas, the doctor is visited by a Commonwealth Health Department counsellor to attempt to bring him into line. </PARA>
<PARA> How will patients feel if they know a doctor is prescribing and treating them to preserve his status as a recognised general practitioner with the Health Insurance Commission rather than in the interests of getting them better? How does the doctor feel if he is being coerced with respect to which pills may be prescribed for which condition, how many may be prescribed, how many repeat prescriptions are allowed, the conditions on which he can or cannot put patients into hospital, and how long they can be admitted for? Government surveillance of all these areas puts the mocker on the practice of medicine. It attracts bureaucratic interference and puts an intolerable burden on the proper practice of medicine. The practice of medicine is an art. It is an increasingly scientific art; nevertheless, it is still an art. It is being denigrated by the Government promising the best and fairest health care system in the world and then severely restricting and curtailing the services it provides. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent restructuring of the AMA has recognised the separate medico-political interests of the craft groups. It is now up to the leaders of those groups, with the Federal office of the AMA, to establish effective communication between each group and the Federal Government. This goal has been compromised by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, which has split off and done a deal with the Minister for Community Services and Health. </PARA>
<PARA> Care of a sick person is a tremendous responsibility for a doctor. No limits should be placed on a doctor's ability to provide his patients with the best medical care he can. However, in recent years third party interference has eroded the ability of physicians to care for their patients. A doctor's judgment can be adversely affected if he must continuously be worrying about being criticised or fined because of the treatment he provides to a patient. This is all contained in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> One matter which seems almost minor at this time is the provision under this legislation of 008 telephone numbers to enable people outside local telephone areas to ring the Department of Community Services and Health for the price of a local call. An amendment along these lines was foreshadowed by Senator Puplick last week in his speech of reply on the telecommunications legislation. It was not supported at that time but it was indicated that if this provision were brought in with each Bill for each department then the Opposition and Democrats would support it. I am happy to see this happening. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to changes in staffing and direction proposed in the amendments to the Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill and the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Amendment Bill. The Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill is an initiative to allow people who are disabled to stay at home rather than being in an institution. It is a complementary Bill to the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Amendment Bill 1988. The big initiative that the Government seems to be taking now is to dismantle all of the services that have been established over many years to look after people with disabilities. Importantly, there are no regulations included in this legislation. It has only guidelines which are being administered in a very flexible way. This has thrown the industry into confusion and I can understand that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government seems determined to ensure the dismantling of all of these services. This follows an inquiry into the provision of disabled services in the early 1980s. It involved government representatives attending international conferences. In its wisdom the Government decided that the general world movement was to take people out of institutions and put them back into the homes from which they came. That may be all very well. But expert services are provided by organisations such as the spastic children centres, the Montrose Home for Crippled Children and the Endeavour Foundation and have been built up over a long time. Enormous capital is invested in these services. </PARA>
<PARA> Now the Government thinks that it is taking those organisations along gently in telling them that they have to dismantle their services, sell their property and scatter their different services around the cities in which they exist. It is very difficult to work out who is right and who is wrong. The Government thinks it is enlightened, progressive and going the right way. It very well may be. But the sudden change has come as an almighty shock to the industry. A disability can affect different people to different degrees. The provision of expert services and rehabilitation in one centre may be of more value than scattering them to the four winds. It seems only sensible that this matter should be referred to a committee that can go into it in detail so that the whole industry can become aware of what is involved for it with the application of this type of legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate is an opportunity to review where we are with health policy, to examine what the Government is doing and whether some of the initiatives make sense. The Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, the main Bill in this package, brings together several disparate propositions. When the Bill was first put up for debate the House of Representatives had risen and we did not think it was returning. At that point we were faced with the usual element of legislative blackmail: the proposal that either we support the Bill or the good parts could not come into operation. There is not too much point in complaining about that. We did it when we were in government; Labor does it when it is in government. It simply reflects the arrogance, incompetence and lack of feeling for parliament and the requirements of the parliamentary process that characterise government and some elements within the Public Service. Of course, the House of Representatives is now coming back, even if only for one day. We can therefore give this legislation the attention it warrants and deserves. If there are amendments the Bill can be returned to the other place and dealt with there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One could reflect that anyone listening to this debate here, in the other place or in the wider community may have wondered, been bemused or been a bit confused by the concentration on questions of money-on dollar inputs-as if dollar inputs in medical services, of themselves, had anything to do with the health outcomes. It is a reflection of the intellectual poverty of the so-called health debate that it is about cash inputs only, about power relationships or about service provision and payment for service provision, and not really about what is achieved in health. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth reflecting on the health goals of the Government. One of the advantages of program budgeting is that each year we receive from the Department of Community Services and Health a set of explanatory notes which contain in them some statements of departmental mission, some statements of purpose and objectives. Some goals on health set out in the documents presented to the Estimates committees are available. The kinds of goals to which the Government addresses itself in those documents include improving the health and well-being of the Australian community. We can judge what is being proposed today by whether it helps to achieve that goal. Does it improve health; does it promote good health and reduce illness? It is not a question of whether we are paying for more things more efficiently. It is a question of whether this legislation has any relationship to the goals laid out in the explanatory notes of the Community Services and Health portfolio-the Government's own notes, its own goals and objectives, against which we are entitled to evaluate what is proposed in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The onus is on the Government and on Government senators to establish, if they can, some direct relationship between cash subsidies, money inputs, co-payment arrangements, medical benefits rebates systems and any measure of health. The Government has to tell us why paying differently makes people healthier. That is the goal it has identified in its documents and we would like to relate what the Government is proposing in this legislation to those goals. In the jargon of evaluation practice, do the inputs which are provided, the structures which are used and the process arrangements have anything at all to do with the health outcomes which are supposed-not only by the naive and the simple-minded like me-to underpin and to justify the whole medical service financing structure? The Government should tell us why paying more or less affects the health outcomes of this country in terms of what we get by way of better health. In discussion of the outcomes that occur, this debate has been awful and the contributions of Ministers in their second reading speeches have done little to add to it. It should be about better health, or else it is a con. </PARA>
<PARA> It is possible that the low level of the health debate reflects ignorance rather than malice-I am willing to acknowledge that. Yet there is so much to which we could have pointed in presenting this legislation. For example, we know that there has been a major improvement in the outcomes in Australia for the last decade or so for ischaemic heart disease-what the public calls heart attacks. It should be a proper and necessary task for a parliament to ask itself the obvious question: why have these outcomes improved? What has led to improved outcomes, to lower mortality and to better results in relation to ischaemic heart disease? What can we learn from our success in this area which we can now apply more widely? What might we wish to do differently, based on what has improved? It is not an irrelevant question and one would have hoped that the Department of Community Services and Health would have presented an omnibus Bill that had something to do with health. </PARA>
<PARA> A colleague skilled in these matters has concluded that some of the improvement in ischaemic heart disease has come from better drug therapy for high blood pressure, improved high technology interventions such as coronary artery angiography and coronary artery bypass surgery and lifestyle changes such as better diet, more exercise and less smoking. One would have expected that governments would grab on to that information, that they would concentrate subsidy and assistance on those things which actually work. We know that there has been an improvement in coronary artery disease outcomes. We know now what causes it-lifestyle changes, drugs for blood pressure and certain high technology interventions such as coronary artery surgery. We would have thought that the Government might have concentrated more subsidy and assistance on those things which work even if it meant removing subsidy from other areas which do not work. We might have thought that it would have meant better access to certain drugs, better access to coronary artery angiography, or better access to coronary artery surgery when that was needed. I cannot forget, neither can my colleague, Senator Puplick, that one of our political heroes, John Clarkson Maddison, died while waiting for a coronary artery bypass operation. He probably died unnecessarily. We are not going to forget that. We know that this intervention works. We would have expected better access to it if the Government were impressed by the outcomes, but this Government is either mad or bad. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It could be both. This Government has made more expensive and more difficult the access to certain drugs which help produce these better outcomes. We had a not very edifying debate about a year ago in this place in which we tried to stop the Government's attempts to remove access to these drugs. The Government has limited its support for high technology interventions and it has provided too little support to lifestyle changes. What has been provided to support the lifestyle changes-anti-smoking, better diet and more exercise-is absolutely pathetic, especially when those changes might require the Government to put itself into conflict with powerful commercial interests. I say to the Government, `It is hard the first time, but the more often you put yourself into conflict with the commercial interests, the easier it gets'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Meanwhile, the debate about money and power goes on as if it is a debate about health. This Bill is just another episode. Since this is a debate about subsidy, money, support and co-payments, let us look at some of the critical figures and some of the critical data. First, the level of our gross domestic product (GDP) devoted to providing medical and associated services has not altered a lot in spite of the Government's claim one way and critics' claims the other. Rises in expenditure by government seem to have followed more or less the rise in GDP and have been less than the rises in average weekly earnings in recent years. Further, the share of GDP going to the medical services sector has been constant. One year it was 8 per cent, but it has been constant mostly at about 7.5 per cent to 7.8 per cent, and the figure in 1985 was actually 7.5 per cent of GDP. I have a table from the Department's book entitled Australian Health Expenditure which sets the total health expenditure as a percentage of GDP from 1970-71 to 1985-86. I seek leave to have that table incorporated in Hansard. I have already shown it to Senator Bolkus. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. If one examines the health expenditure of a number of developed countries over 15 years, one sees that it is not possible to say that our expenditures have leapt ahead or, to use a phrase, `have blown out' compared with some of those other countries. To make that point, I seek leave to have a diagram incorporated in Hansard-it is acceptable to Hansard and has been shown to Senator Bolkus-which makes this international comparison clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Further, hospital costs have not risen significantly during that period as a percentage of the total. This point is worth dwelling on for just a moment. It does not reflect complete credit on governments obsessed with accounting rather than with the needs of people. I will explain: if the number of aged people in our population is increasing, as it is, and if we accept, as we must, that age brings with it increasing morbidity, perhaps we should be demanding that hospital costs do increase significantly in real terms to keep pace with the increasing needs of the more dependent-in this case, the aged members of our society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It depends on what our goals are. If the goals are financial-honourable senators all know the argument that all expenditure is bad and the only good government expenditure is minimal government expenditure-then we will continue to hold costs even while the target population increases, even while specific social need increases and even while the policies, particularly the policies of this Government, effectively increase the barriers to access to the services which do exist. </PARA>
<PARA> If on the other hand our purpose is, as mine is, to provide care where it is needed and access to care to some agreed standard, even to a modest standard, where that is needed, then we should want to increase our expenditures at least in line with demographic changes in our society. If there are more aged people-and that means more cataracts, more enlarged prostates, and more hips needing replacement-we should be providing extra services. This explains to some extent why we hear so many complaints from so many constituents about waiting lists and a lack of services. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that waiting lists are fallacious measures to some extent. They reflect some measure of illness and pathology decisions. As I said, if there are more elderly people there are more cataracts, more prostate operations needed and more hips needing replacement. But waiting lists also reflect the decisions of doctors about pathology-I am not criticising those decisions-and there is always some element of double counting in waiting list figures. I have seen estimates that it is as high as 25 per cent. However, I utter a word of caution. If we are having a serious debate and if we want those who understand these matters to take us seriously, we should acknowledge that in this country the essential statistics for making judgments about health are lacking. It is a great pity that only the Commonwealth, via the Health Insurance Commission, has until now had adequate information to tell us about the outcomes we are achieving in health. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is much more complicated than some people seem to comprehend. For example, no one seems to want to tell us how hospital moneys might have been redistributed away from patients towards higher staff payments. This happened with award decisions which were made in favour of nursing and medical providers-long overdue decisions. However necessary or just such a series of decisions might have been, it is still relevant to our understanding of what resource division within a rigid budget cap is doing to people. If there is only the same amount of money in relative terms and more of it is going to the staff, then less of it is going to running the hospitals day to day. </PARA>
<PARA> In any event, it seems that the funding of hospitals has always been badly based. It has been based merely on incremental additions to historical accounting. It has not been made on any more rational basis. That is still the case. Hospitals are not responsible or answerable for service provision. They are less accountable for what they achieve in terms of access to services in their area than they are to the accountants who insist that they operate within a budget cap. They are more accountable to the accountants and less accountable to the community. That is madness. </PARA>
<PARA> Enough of this more general comment. I would like to mention a few parts of the legislation. Let us start with the proposed changes to pathology funding. There is a continuing matter of concern and principle. The principle is: What decisions will we make in the future to underwrite at public expense new pathology products or practices? It is not adequate to say that there will be automatic funding of all pathology services at all times for all people, whatever is introduced. The question of subsidy, of co-payment, has to involve the paymaster as well as the person who orders the tests and the person for whom they are done. Answering that question is not simple. The paymaster, after all, is the public. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us ask: Are we improving health outcomes with new tests or with new technology? I have already mentioned that with coronary artery angiography we think we can answer yes to that question. But we cannot always answer it with a yes. Unless we can demonstrate better outcomes, the question of subsidy is at least open to argument. It is not a question of limiting the right of doctors to offer or to order or to charge for tests. It is simply a question of the conditions under which public co-payment will be undertaken by the Commonwealth. We cannot be pathological Luddites. Progress in pathology is not about to cease. New tests are always emerging. But if the only outcome for health is marginal gain at large cost, the public interest might better be served if the subsidy were to be directed elsewhere. If there is a continuing acceptance by all concerned of the justice of the cost-benefit approach, or of program budgeting-as in government departments-that will be a gain in itself. We can use that approach for pathology services just as we can for the evaluation of any other payment anywhere else in the government system. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only that, but some other major advances in pathology technology are almost upon us which might allow more product at less cost and even at less rebate, perhaps with no reduction in profit or income for the pathologist. I mention only dry cell chemistry, which might eventually be such an advance. In that and similar circumstances there will need to be a continuing re-examination of the quantum of subsidy for particular tests. We do not oppose the Government's proposals in this Bill in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering this Bill, let us consider for a moment the new approach proposed for the remuneration of general practitioners, which has been mentioned by other speakers in this debate. The Government proposes the certification of those with special skills in general practice in much the same way as Senator Walters's husband has been certified as having special skills in obstetrics and gynaecology and as some of us-Senator Sheil and I-have been certified as having special skills in internal medicine. The proposal provides for some contentious administrative arrangements-some faulty administrative arrangements, I think. They have been addressed by my colleague Senator Puplick and by some of my other colleagues. There are some other problems in what has been proposed. The proposal will also mean higher rebates for those who are certified. </PARA>
<PARA> The fee for service system we use to rebate doctors is truly Gortonian in its history, its genesis and its concept. It derives from the old $5 Gorton pronouncement. As a concept it is post-Nimmo and circa 1970. We should remember that as we approach the 1990s. Any system is capable of being rethought and might benefit from a new approach-even this one. While ever the old system remains yet medical practice continues to alter, while ever some doctors continue to improve and extend their professional skills and other doctors do not, the system will become more difficult to operate and less rational as a totality. </PARA>
<PARA> The system warrants our examining it with a view to recasting it. We can ask whose interests we need to serve. Is it the interests of the community-those of us who will be sick and who will need care-or just the interests of the providers? It is not an either/or question. We in the Parliament are duty-bound to concern ourselves first with the community interests, if we can determine what that is, and if we can work out how best to pursue it. We would hope that we could marry within one arrangement the interests of the consumers of services with the interests of the providers. There can be no questioning of the fact that general practice remains the basis of the delivery of most medical services in Australia. Sadly, the question in this Bill of greater rebates for those practitioners certified by the College has degenerated into a battle for power between the Australian Medical Association (AMA) and the College. That is not necessarily good if we are looking at the interests of health services consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will remember that the AMA has always represented doctors in fee negotiations with government, at least until very recently when it withdrew. The College played an academic role only, at least until recently when it also got involved in fee negotiation. It is interesting that, coincidentally with the arrival of Dr Bruce Shepherd on the political scene as a major player, the AMA refused to continue to negotiate fees for rebates with government. The two events are probably not connected, but a vacuum was created. The College has moved to fill the vacuum by negotiating these new fees. Of course the AMA should return to play its traditional role as chief fee negotiator with government on behalf of the profession. It will do so better if it abandons some of the current overblown rhetoric and perhaps reflects more of Bryce Phillips and less of Bruce Shepherd, and gets back to dealing with the paymaster, whoever the paymaster is, on behalf of its membership. By its membership I mean those of us who pay our subscriptions to belong to the AMA. </PARA>
<PARA> Medical incomes, after all, are based on two things: fees and rate of throughput. While the arguments rage about who will and who will not get access to the new higher rebates, the fact remains that the time taken for each consultation will at the end of the day still determine the income of each individual doctor. We do not want to bring about a situation where doctors are taking less time for each consultation because of economic pressure. Hopefully, we will examine this matter in the Select Committee. Senators will try to hear the views of all, to be fair and wise, if that is possible, and to advise the Senate in double quick time so that the scheme, in some amended form, can be started. It has to be brought back with its faults remedied, its injustices removed and its inconsistencies and intrusions overcome. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Walters drew attention to some of the worst features of the proposals and some of the things that are missing. We have to get those fixed. Let us work towards upgrading continuously the professional skills of medical practitioners. Let us not pretend that doctors are now prepared ideally and that medical school prepares someone adequately for family practice. Let us not pretend either or expect that doctors should just become reactive prescribers. They should still remain consultants, listening to people and responding to each person individually. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators might be aware of some recent criticism of the lack of basic skills on the part of young medical graduates by the new professor of orthopaedic surgery at the University of Western Australia. Professor Jerzy Sikorski found that certain simple orthopaedic problems such as sprains could not be assessed or treated by new graduates. His observations are important because they highlight the importance of prolonged and adequate training to turn basic undifferentiated medical graduates into skilled family doctors. Let us do our part to improve and reward the holistic skills of doctors, if not with the present proposal, which seems flawed, with some variant of it, after more mature consultation and consideration and possibly with different detail if it emerges that different detail is needed. </PARA>
<PARA> Another element in the legislation relates to day surgery and to payments relating to day surgery. I want only to say that the issue here is one of subsidy and money. There is no question of principle. The issue at hand is that the Government has not consulted with the parties involved about the changes it wishes to introduce. Until that has been done adequately we do not intend to support the proposals. We do support the greater use of day surgery facilities but we want more discussion with the National Day Surgery Advisory Committee. We will vote accordingly at the appropriate stage of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a few moments to discuss the new proposals for the reinsurance pool. These are simply proposals to require certain health funds to contribute more than they do now to the reinsurance pool, which will share the cost of some of the worst risks in order to relieve some of the burden on certain other funds. We know that people take private health cover because Medicare does not deliver on its goal to provide `access for all according to need, funded by all according to means'. Medicare cannot guarantee access to all. It is not funded from its contributors. The whole proposal before us makes a mockery of any pretence that there is a free market in health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider ourselves to be the users and consumers of health services. We know that 80 per cent of hospital and major medical costs are incurred in the last year of life. None of us knows exactly when our last year of life will be but it will apply to us just as it applies to other people. The fact remains that in New South Wales-perhaps not in Victoria or Queensland-when faced with a serious illness, as with most other people, I would opt for the public teaching hospital if I had the choice. In Sydney that choice would be qualified by support for the Sydney Adventist Hospital or for St Vincents Private Hospital, which are first class private institutions. But it is generally a valid theory that if we were sick enough we would want to go to a major hospital. People such as me want to go where the care is best. The problem in my State is that the private hospital system is not at present good enough to provide a real challenge to the public hospital system. I would like it to be; I wish it would be. It does not provide the challenge that private education does to the public school system. People insure privately for two things-a choice of doctor and better hotel facilities. But at the end of the day we want the best care. We can do without the other characteristics-choice of doctor or a good hotel-if the quality of care is markedly better. </PARA>
<PARA> The trouble is that as more and more people are forced out of health insurance the system becomes unsustainable. There is a myth about community rating. It is a myth that has existed ever since the special account was abolished early in the 1970s. That special account, which provided public funding for the uninsurable groups in our society, made health insurance viable. Without that and without adequate reinsurance it is not viable. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other things I could say about this legislation. I remind the Government of its own goals. They are to ensure that people have access to necessary health services, to promote better health and to ensure that all Australians have access to necessary health services at reasonable costs. On these tests the Government's own goals, the Government's own boasts, the Government's policies, are failing to deliver. They are policies about money and they are quite inadequate. The Opposition will assist the Government in proposing these committee references. I hope the Government will accept them in good order. Our criticisms are valid and important. We will force the attention of the Government to our concerns today and in the Select Committee. I believe that we will do a real service to the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As is usual under this Government we are debating cognately Bills which cover a broad range of areas. In one Bill we are debating pathology, day surgery, health reinsurance and a vocational register for general practitioners. In the other Bills we are debating changes to residential arrangements for the aged, disabled and homeless. Each of these matters is so important that I would have liked to address each in detail but time and the way the Government mishandles its business preclude me from doing this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must make some comment on the proposals for changes to aged care hostels and funding for those hostels. The Government clearly intends that the number of aged people in nursing homes decline and those in hostels increase. Its policy is such that there will be an increase in the dependency of hostel residents with more category 4 and, especially, category 5 residents going into hostels. The Government has recognised this in the information sheets that it provides to applicants seeking approval to operate Commonwealth subsidised hostels and nursing homes. That document states:</PARA>
<PARA> At present hostels cater for residents of varying levels of dependence. However it is anticipated that the proportion of hostel residents requiring personal care services such as assistance with bathing, toileting, dressing and mobility will rise in the future . . . Funding incentives have been built into the program to take account of the change. </PARA>
<PARA>However, there seems to be no recognition that these increasing dependency levels will also mean that changes must be made in the physical layout of hostels. It is not good enough to let hostel residents walk long distances through exposed walkways-to me, coming from Melbourne, that means exposed walkways in the freezing cold-to have their dinner. I have seen this situation in more than one hostel. I do not know how many hostels the public servants have visited but, if the number of nursing homes they have visited is any indication, I presume that not many of them have seen the sorts of facilities that are operating where residents have to walk these long distances and where managers of the hostels have told me that the residents are almost frozen by the time they get to dinner. There are no funds for taking the meals to their rooms. Unless we can modify the hostels and the arrangements and maybe even get some funding for meals to be delivered to rooms for residents who are not well, this system will not work. The price we will pay if we do not do this will be the deterioration of the health status of hostel residents and an increase on demand in our nursing home places. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National parties object to the changes in the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 affecting private health insurance because they are a quick fix solution. The proposal will not provide a long term solution to the problem of increasing rates and will not safeguard the health care interests of elderly Australians. The problems in the health care industry have arisen, firstly, due to an ailing Medicare system that provides no incentive and no reward for belonging to a private health fund. A declining proportion of the population is privately insured. Currently, that proportion stands at 45 per cent compared with 61.5 per cent when this Government came into office. This is exacerbated by the fact that it is the young and healthy who are dropping out of private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the problems are due to the fact that the Labor Government has not been, and is not committed to, supporting the reinsurance trust account, which is the means by which the cost of health insurance for the aged and chronically ill is spread over all health funds. We have heard a lot of rhetoric from the Hawke Government telling us that it is committed to community rating and the reinsurance account. If the Government believes that community rating and reinsurance are the way to go, why has it withdrawn its support for the reinsurance pool to the tune of a cumulative $450m over the past five years? This one-off $20m injection that the Government is now offering is an opiate fix which will relieve the pain in the short term but will not cure the underlying chronic disease. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National parties will allow part 4 of the Bill to pass, but we recognise this as only a quick fix solution, and we have recommended that a Senate select committee be set up to look into the long term arrangements of the health insurance industry. The amendments in part 3 of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill allow for the introduction of a vocational register for general practitioners (GPs). The requirement for general practitioners to remain on the register is that they undertake continuing medical education and quality assurance programs accredited by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP). It also allows for the introduction of a two-tier system of rebates, and an audit and monitoring procedure to be undertaken by an independent peer review organisation-so independent that it would appear from the documents which I have received that `the nominees of the RACGP, will constitute a majority of votes on the board'. So much for independence. How can this Senate be expected to support this legislation when details of the audit and monitoring procedures have not been formally communicated to us by the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett)? I ask the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, who is on duty, whether it would be possible for the Senate to receive formally details of the auditing and monitoring procedures, because this is an important part of this legislation. We need to know what is involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year, the Committee of Inquiry into Medical Education and Medical Workforce, chaired by Professor Doherty, examined over 400 submissions. Among the many recommendations put forward by that Committee were a number aimed at enhancing the new registered practitioner's preparation for general practice. I seek leave to incorporate into Hansard the relevant section of the executive summary pertaining to this. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The summary read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee sees particular importance in the design of curricula that would give students the knowledge, attitudes and skills needed to meet new challenges during a professional lifetime. [5.4.7] It supports greater emphasis than is currently shown in several medical schools in undergraduate training in general practice, and recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA> 5 (iii) Medical schools aim to provide exposure to general practice, early in the course as well as providing at least a month's block experience in general practices or community health centres late in the course. [5.4.2]</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recognises that serious resource constraints on the tertiary education sector have restricted undergraduate programs. It realises that allocation of funds to universities and within universities is influenced by many factors outside its terms of reference. It does however recommend action by the Commonwealth Government on two matters: practical training for general practice and the recruitment of suitably qualified staff. [5.4.2, 5.7.2, 5.8]</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee notes the shortage of resources available for the teaching of general practice and recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA> 5 (iv) The Commonwealth Government provide grants to match university allocations to ensure that at least $1000 (in 1987 dollars) per student in the final year of the course is available each year for placement and supervision of students in general practice and community health centres. </PARA>
<PARA> In making this recommendation the Committee recognises that university departments of general practice will find that the additional funds can be best utilised in various ways according to local circumstances, and may allow the development of model university teaching general practices as well as better utilisation of community health centres for teaching. [7.3.5]</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee (with one member dissenting) expresses concern at the impact on the recruitment and retention of academic staff, and hence on the quality of medical school teaching and research, of disparities in remuneration flowing from recent industrial awards for part-time and full-time hospital staff in several States. It draws this concern to the attention of relevant State and Commonwealth Government departments and teaching hospitals, and on a majority vote of 6:1 recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA> 5 (v) A working party of bodies involved in the employment of clinical academics in teaching hospitals, including State Departments of Health, teaching hospitals, universities, and the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, be established as a matter of urgency to seek approaches to the problem of significant salary disparities between clinical academics employed by universities and specialist medical staff employed by hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> It also recommends by similar majority vote that:</PARA>
<PARA> 5 (vi) The National Board set up an appropriate working party to review salary discrepancies and other influences on recruitment of academic staff, including medically qualified staff, to preclinical and paraclinical departments in making recommendations that the working party should take note of any effect on salary relativities of recommendations by the working party proposed in recommendation 5 (v). </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LI4">Senator PATTERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The Committee also recommended that all Australian States and Territories require graduates to undertake a second pre-registration year. It also said that it believed:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the incorporation of general practice experience into the preregistration period will be advantageous to all practitioners whether they become general practitioners or specialists and will contribute to recruitment to general practice. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard recommendations 6 (iv) and 6 (v). </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> 6 (iv) Medical Boards accept the principles that the preregistration years should:</PARA>
<PARA>be served in more general posts with, by negotiation, opportunity for positions relevant to future vocational training; and</PARA>
<PARA>include a substantial component in general practice, community health centres or other suitable placements outside the hospital system,</PARA>
<PARA>and move to implement requirements to those effects as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> 6 (v) Funds (and training for supervisors) be made available for community health centres, general practices and other community placement agencies to provide placements for preregistration trainees in the second year experience, such funds to be provided by the Commonwealth Government (as currently happens with first year Family Medicine Program trainees). </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LI4">Senator PATTERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was interested to read in a June family medicine program (FMP) newsletter that the Australian Health Ministers Conference of March of this year accepted that there be two years pre-registration training, comprising a suitably structured intern year and a second year of supervised practice acceptable to the relevant medical board. The Doherty report recommends that pre-registration years should be served in more general posts and should include a substantial component of placements outside the hospital system. There has been no objective evaluation of the capacity of newly registered doctors to undertake unsupervised practice. One could imagine, despite some of the concerns expressed in the Doherty report, that many of them would compare favourably with some of the out-of-date practitioners who will be eligible under the grandfather clause for automatic inclusion on the register. How did the Government come to the conclusion that all newly registered GPs were giving inadequate care? How will the Government evaluate the effect of the increase of general practice emphasis in the undergraduate program and the pre-registration years? One could argue that it would have been better to direct some of the funding being used for postgraduate vocational training to these innovations and to evaluate these before embarking on the vocational register scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a number of ways of assessing the levels of competence. One of these is to evaluate the examinations set by medical schools. We know that these have not been investigated by an independent body. A second way to assess competence would be at the end of the pre-registration years when an examining body could examine those medical graduates wishing to go into unsupervised general practice rather than just assuming that all post registration students are equivalent to the lowest common denominator and not equipped for the task. One can presume only that this component of the legislation was based on a deal done with the RACGP-an organisation to which only 35 per cent of general practitioners belong-a deal done to divide up the rebate increases disproportionately and to line the family medicine program's education nest at the expense of the medical schools. </PARA>
<PARA> The question that must be asked is: what is the matter with our medical schools if, after six years and two years now of preregistration, the ability of our commencing practitioners is being queried? Might it not be appropriate to ask what an injection of some of the funds being directed to the FMP could achieve to make good some of the deficiencies identified by the Doherty report? I am sure that the deans of our medical schools would welcome some of that funding to attract clinically qualified staff especially into the pre-clinical years, to fund the administration of the complex arrangements associated with placements in out of hospital experiences-I know that in one university some of these programs have been curtailed because there are not sufficient administrative staff, not clinical or academic staff, to organise these out of hospital experiences-and to employ part time clinicians in applied programs, tutorials and group discussions in the pre-clinical years in particular. The Minister for Community Services and Health, in a five-page propaganda letter to doctors on 30 May, said:</PARA>
<PARA> I think you would agree with the conclusions of the recent inquiry into medical education and medical workforce (Doherty) that current medical courses do not prepare doctors adequately to provide good quality general practice. University medical schools in the western world-including those of Australia-have as their goal the education of an undifferentiated medical practitioner who is equipped to enter intern training. In Australia that practitioner may then enter general practice or undertake vocational training in another medical discipline. </PARA>
<PARA> The Doherty report concluded that it is highly desirable for all general practitioners to also undertake vocational training. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister is, in my opinion, suffering from an acute case of selective attention. I think Senator Sheil referred to this. The Minister is reading into the Doherty report what suits his agenda. The Doherty report recommended increased funding for final year undergraduate supervision in general practice and community health centres, increased supervised experience in these areas in the registration years and, in recommendation 8 (i), that `the Government continue its financial contribution to vocational training of general practitioners'. I ask for leave to incorporate in Hansard recommendations 8 (v) and 8 (vi) and the preamble to these. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee gave extensive consideration to the proposal that vocational training for general practice should be made mandatory. It saw the following points as important:</PARA>
<PARA> Several of the recommendations it has made elsewhere in this report (for an altered balance between hospital and community in the undergraduate course, for a two-year preregistration period including community placements and for greater support for continuing education) should, by increasing the amount of time spent in training for general practice, substantially contribute towards the quality of general practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is not convinced that sufficient resources and appropriate hospital and community training posts are available in all States to accommodate the needs of all potential general practitioners as well as trainees in the various specialties. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee sees risks in creating what might become a disenfranchised class of registered medical graduates who are neither general practitioners nor specialists, and recognises possible cost pressures for higher fees for ``specialist'' general practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee sees the mandatory concept as potentially inflexible for several groups of practitioners, including specialists reverting to general practice, graduates switching from other specialist training programs and for those returning to the work force after career interruption. It also believes that the mandatory concept would present difficulties for many graduates, for example, in hospital positions, wishing to undertake part-time general practice such as locum tenens appointments. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly the Committee recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA> 8 (v) Mandatory vocational training and special registration of general practitioners not be introduced at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> 8 (vi) The Department of Community Services and Health, in five years, commission a review of the outcome of this Committee's recommendations, and of other developments, on the quality of training for general practice, and then recommend whether vocational training for general practice should be made mandatory. [8.7]</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LI4">Senator PATTERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Doherty recommendations which I have just had incorporated counter those being put forward in this legislation. The Doherty report recommends that `mandatory training and special registration of general practitioners not-I emphasise the word `not'-`be introduced at the present time'. Why the Government wasted its money on the Doherty report and why people pored over 400 submissions is beyond my comprehension if this is the result. The Minister has been at pains to tell us that this is not a mandatory register. Not only is the Minister suffering from acute selective attention; he is also deluded. He is deluded if he thinks that the bulk of medical practitioners, medical interns, medical students and the Opposition will swallow this bait. I guess it is okay if poorer people attending community health centres have less well trained-in the Government's definition-general practitioners who command a lower rebate, but I suppose that their voice is currently not being heard. As Senator Peter Baume said, in this debate we really have not talked about the outcome and what will happen to patients; we have talked more about doctors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take issue with the Minister when he says that it is false to claim that women will be disadvantaged. I wish the Minister could have been with me at the meeting in Melbourne a few weeks ago attended by more than one thousand medical students and interns. If he had bothered to consult with them he may think differently. This legislation will affect women. In particular, it will discourage young women from choosing medicine as a career-a professional course which, unlike many of the other professional courses in the universities, attracts at least 50 per cent of women. This legislation will undo that. I hope this Government will live to rue the day if this legislation goes through in its current form. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us now look at the non-mandatory vocational training the Minister is advocating in the legislation. Millions of dollars are being injected in the vocational training program. What do we know about the efficacy of these programs? Before the Senate supports the Government's vocational training program, it would be valuable for us to have access to objective data which is generated from the Health Insurance Commission. For example, I have seen data on a sample of FMP trainees on a GP rotation. The data seemed to indicate that while the average number of services provided in the dominant category in the survey period was 646, the minimum was 85. This is over something like a 10 week period, which means that a trainee GP sees about eight and a half patients a week, and the maximum 129. One might question the quality of the experience being gained by the trainees at either end of that extreme. Dr Hetzel, in an evaluation of the FMP program in 1986, said:</PARA>
<PARA>There has been no single study which indicates that vocationally trained general practitioners provide better care for their patients than untrained general practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA>The Doherty report referred to the review of the FMP commissioned by the Commonwealth Government in 1982 and undertaken by Hurley and Cummins. The Doherty committee reports them as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>There is very great difficulty in assessing standards of medical practice, including general practice, and no reliable objective measure was available to determine the effect which FMP has had on standards of general practice. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the very thing that Senator Peter Baume was talking about-standards of general practice; what actually happens to the patient who goes in there for the treatment and what sort of treatment that person will get. The Doherty report said-this was echoing a point made by J. S. Norell in 1981 in an English study:</PARA>
<PARA>the first thing which must be admitted is that their assertion, that vocational training is `a good thing', rests on a belief, as yet unsupported by good evidence, of demonstrable benefit in terms of improved patient care. </PARA>
<PARA>The Hurley and Cummins 1982 review said:</PARA>
<PARA>The FMP has probably had little, if any, influence in stimulating an increase in the proportion of medical practitioners who elect to enter general practice, and the Committee has no evidence that FMP has influenced the movement of general practitioners in areas of special need or under service or to remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA>The Doherty report asked the question: are there any clear benefits from vocational training? Its answer was:</PARA>
<PARA> Intuitively it would seem reasonable to anticipate benefits to the community from having a system for training of general practitioners. However there are no studies available that demonstrate such benefits or, conversely, the cost are incurred by not having such a system. A United Kingdom report (Norell 1981) suggested that though recipients of GP vocational training acquire certain skills earlier than non-trained GP's the differences soon disappear. Also, in surveys 10 years apart no increase was detected in certain desirable attitudes of GP's despite a substantial increase in the number of vocationally trained GP's over that period . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Let me assure the Senate that the Opposition is strongly in favour of continuing education and, in professional organisations, setting mechanisms in place to ensure that their members are up to date and competent practitioners. We have seen that put in place by the Australian Society of Accountants. We have seen how some of the other professional organisations within medicine such as the Royal Australian College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists have done that very well without the sort of trauma that we seem to be experiencing in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This part of the legislation warrants examination by a Senate select committee for a number of reasons. There is disquiet amongst many members of the medical profession and medical students. The Minister would have us believe that this is because they do not fully understand the legislation. Reference to a committee will, if the Minister is correct, serve to allay their fears. I doubt that that will happen when this committee is put in place. In fact, I think it will raise more questions than the Minister will be able to answer. There is a question mark over the efficacy and durability of the changes to general practitioners' competence as a result of vocational training. The Government's committee-the Doherty committee-has recommended that mandatory vocational training and special registration of GPs not-as I emphasised before-be introduced at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> We have before us two important and divisive issues: firstly, health insurance; and, secondly, the proposed vocational register for general practitioners with the two-tier rebate system. The only reasonable course open to the Senate is to examine these issues in detail. The Senate Select Committee proposed by the Liberal and National parties will provide the opportunity for broad and comprehensive consultation. It is blatantly obvious, from the amount of concern, the number of petitions received and the amount of lobbying that has gone on, that the medical profession as a whole, is not, as the Minister indicates, fully informed. I think that, as a result of reading that letter he sent them, they will be even less informed. The community is not informed. It has not been broadly consulted. This Committee will enable that comprehensive consultation. After that, and only after that, will we have the much more considered and informed decision that that Labor Government opposite has denied the people critically affected by this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating a number of Bills cognately-the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, the Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill 1989 and the Aged and Disabled Persons Homes Amendment Bill 1988. As my colleague Senator Patterson previously said, it is a shame that through the Government's mismanagement important Bills are always debated cognately and rammed through together at the end of a session. This really does not give us the opportunity to address the very important aspects of the legislation before us. Tonight I wish to address my comments to two main features of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill. The main feature of this Bill constitutes a real confidence trick of a Labor Government that is telling us that it is doing a favour to doctors and private health care in a rather vain attempt to take health off the agenda prior to the next election and to tickle the tummies, I suppose, of some of the doctors who have been almost bashed to death by this Government over the last six and a half years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill is very interesting for a number of reasons. I suppose it is distinguished by what information it does not contain. We are being asked to make decisions in the Senate today without being privy to specifics of what the Bill is all about. The Government's rhetoric may have changed but the substance is not far different when it comes to the two principal aspects of the Bill. As I said, after all the doctor bashing that Dr non-medical Blewett has conducted over many years, the Government seeks to create a discriminatory vocational register of general practitioners (GPs) under the ultimate authority of the Health Insurance Commission, under the guise of raising the status and incomes of some doctors, while it has spent so many years reducing the real incomes of doctors. It also seeks to redistribute the burden of reinsurance within the private health sector without regard to the long term viability and survival of private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) talks of the new general practitioner fees package rather than the method of its implementation-a two-tier system of general practitioners that will inevitably brand many as somehow second-class doctors. We have heard from the Government today and on previous occasions that this legislation is not going to create second-class doctors, but in fact we see in the Bill itself the very words that will allow it to create second-class doctors. I wish to quote from proposed new section 3f (9), which states:</PARA>
<PARA>The General Manager of the Commission or an authorised officer may make available to members of the public, on request, the names of medical practitioners who are registered under this section and the addresses at which they practise. </PARA>
<PARA>That really rings alarm bells to me for a number of reasons. First, it creates those who have been registered and those who have not. Secondly, it has the probable ultimate goal and effect of creating a preferred provider scheme, and that is something which I think many doctors, particularly those being pushed by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP), would find abhorrent. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Minister speaks of an agreement reached between the Government and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, he underscores the fact that other important facets of the medical profession have not been consulted. Those facets are more strongly opposed to change that is ill-considered, whatever the sincere beliefs of the RACGP, which, I might add, represents less than half of Australia's general practitioners. The Minister admits that there has been little consultation, yet the Government is trying to ram this Bill through the Senate in the dying hours of this session to try to bluff us, the doctors and the community in general. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is saying that this matter should go to a select committee, as opposed to what Senator Crowley said about its going to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. It is not going to that Committee, and if Senator Crowley attended some of that Committee's meetings she might know a little more about what happens there. Before she comes in to take any point of order or to make a personal explanation, I suggest that honourable senators check both the minutes of that Committee and the Hansard transcripts to see how regularly she does not attend. We are suggesting that this matter should go to a Senate select committee for further consideration and further and proper consultation with those who are concerned with the outcome, and that should be all of us, because ultimately it comes back to us and the effect it will have on us as a community generally. </PARA>
<PARA> It is rather characteristic of this Labor Government to use part of the medical profession to sell these changes, just as it tried to hide behind the Voluntary Health Insurance Association of Australia to push the case for its bandaid solution on the bucket reinsurance changes. Indeed, the Health Insurance Commission is funding the promotion of the new arrangements by the RACGP, and this has been revealed in the following editorial from the Medical Observer, which I wish to quote from because it concerns me. I think it would also concern many of the general practitioners who have taken the lead from the College to write to many senators and members calling for `the early passage of this legislation'. The editorial says:</PARA>
<PARA> `The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners . . . has accepted responsibility of promoting the accord to all Australian general practitioners prior to the introduction of the differential fee rebates on 1 August 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> `This promotion will be funded by the Health Insurance Commission which will give broad guidelines on the avenues of promotion and the target audiences. </PARA>
<PARA> `These include the public and a significant proportion of the funds will be used as media advertising just prior to implementation date, these funds having the secondary gain as good vote-catching material.'</PARA>
<PARA>I think many doctors would now be concerned that they had been used as pawns by this Government to get the issue of health off the agenda. The standard of health care in this country has steadily declined ever since the Whitlam years and it has further declined since the Hawke Labor Government came to office in 1983. Let there be no question at all that the medical profession as a whole has not been taken in by this Labor con trick. On 31 May, a meeting at the Charles Gairdner Hospital in Perth, attended by 80 health professionals-doctors and medical students-overwhelming rejected the case for a vocational register as put by the RACGP. Significantly, 50 per cent of those attending the meeting were female. Despite the Labor Government's denials, it is proposing to erect an enormous barrier to the 45 per cent of medical graduates who are women and who may wish to enter general practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition believes that the requirement to complete the certificate of training approved by the RACGP in order to qualify for the vocational register is discriminatory in respect of a number of important medical fields. My belief that it is discriminatory is based on a document which supposedly contains the sweetheart deal that has been done between the Government and the College, but which is not contained in this Bill, so we do not know the detail. All we can do is assume that the deal has been done. The Bill does not spell out or even hint at the requirements that we are being asked to vote on here this evening. Doctors who have worked in such fields as sports medicine, clinics for students, women's health or family planning and who have not fitted in five years of general practice, will be denied entrance to the register based on that deal that has supposedly been done with the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The requirement of what in effect is 11 years full-time training before qualification for the vocational register will prove prohibitive for women graduates who, having completed their degrees and internships, then wish in their late 20s or early 30s to have children and practise only part-time. Supposed concessions enabling current women GPs, who have worked part-time in their child-bearing years, to qualify for the register under the five-year grandfather clause, ignore what will happen to today's students and young resident medical officers and the situation that will prevail after 1995. I was alarmed when Senator Crowley said earlier this afternoon that women doctors had not a thing to worry about. I think it is rather sad that a Labor senator can promote this legislation and quite deliberately mislead doctors by saying that it will not affect them. It will, and we can categorically--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will withdraw the word `deliberately'. But I believe that Senator Crowley has, by her words this afternoon, misled many doctors who, having heard her, would now believe that they are not going to be affected. This Labor Government will in effect be telling a generation of young women that, if they want to be mothers as well as doctors, they had better resign themselves to being permanently in the second tier group of general practitioners. The losers will be not only the graduates but also those patients who might quite validly prefer to see women general practitioners. How ironic it is that the Hawke Labor Government, which brought in laws to regulate private conduct in the 1984 Sex Discrimination Act, and which sought to regulate business through affirmative action legislation in 1986, is now condoning discrimination against women medical practitioners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a Liberal I believe in equality of opportunity for men and women alike. I shall always oppose reverse discrimination, but we have here an undeniable disadvantaging of highly motivated and qualified women because they have exercised the human choice of motherhood or the professional choice of working in specialised health areas of concern to women. The Senate needs to be aware that the concession of allowing two half days per week in general practice over five years for current medical practitioners to qualify for the vocational register applies only to strictly routine work in approved practices. Should the doctor in question have been working other half days during the same period in some other form of medical work, such as specialised clinics, he or she will not qualify. To have worked four sessions per week over four years in general practice is less acceptable than the vaunted two sessions in five years, which to me is a further example of the bureaucratic and restrictive nature of the proposed requirements. It would be of great interest to know just how many women general practitioners were consulted by the non-medical Dr Blewett and his Department before they made the use of the agenda of the RACGP that suited their purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> It is only a few weeks since 20 April when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), amidst the customary fanfare, launched the national health policy, full of such high-sounding but insubstantial promises of better services, information, data collection, training and participation in decision making. Even he had the gall to say that women `want more women to be trained to deliver those services'. Yet his Government is the government that here today is trying to disenfranchise women. The limitations that the Bill will impose on opportunities for women to serve as general practitioners make an utter farce of this policy. </PARA>
<PARA> As a Liberal I do not support the concept of what the Government is doing. However, I do support a general concept of encouraging the highest degree of capability of Australian general practitioners and of ensuring that their professionalism is fairly remunerated. What we have seen year after year, as I have said before, is this Government trying to pull down the real incomes of doctors. Now, through some miraculous foresight when it sees an election around the corner and identifies that health will be a major problem, it says, `Whacko, here we go. We'll increase doctors' fees, but we'll make two classes of doctors in the process'. That is just not desirable. </PARA>
<PARA> I question the assumption that the Government's objectives are best achieved through compulsory vocational training. Non-medical Dr Blewett is not accurate in stating that the vocational register is consistent with advances occurring in many similar Western nations. The facts do not support that. The facts are that in the United States, Canada and New Zealand vocational training for general practitioners is voluntary and extends respectively for three years, two years and one year. In Britain a mandatory vocational training scheme of three years has been in effect since 1982, but the April 1988 report of the Committee of Inquiry into Medical Education and Medical Workforce noted that studies into the characteristics of United Kingdom general practitioners have not shown any change since then. </PARA>
<PARA> This raises the basic question as to whether mandatory training produces better patient outcomes. Clearly, the Labor Government in drafting the Bill has ignored the recommendation of the inquiry that received evidence from bodies such as the Hospital Doctors Association of Western Australia and the Australian Medical Students Association, stating that the program proposed by the RACGP was too long. The inquiry recommended against compulsory vocational training for general practice on the grounds that insufficient suitable training posts were available, a disenfranchised class of registered medical graduates would be created, and the concept would prove a barrier to various categories of practitioner-just as this legislation will prove to be. Is it not a shame that here we have yet another example of a government refusing to take on board the results and findings of an inquiry? We have seen that happen time and time again. Probably the most notable inquiry that the Government refused to look at was the inquiry into the Australia Card. It decided to go ahead with its proposal. In this case the Hawke Labor Government has, at best, bought into one side of a very complex professional argument without proper consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also question the assumption that those doctors who do attain a place on the vocational register will not benefit financially to anything like the extent the Government suggests. There is no question that doctors outside the register will be forced increasingly to rely on other methods to survive. Given the Labor Government's track record in its treatment of health professionals, who are front-line targets whenever scapegoats must be found for the inherent costs of Medicare, it will have a deep vested interest in keeping the vocational register as small as possible to limit the amount of higher rebates. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crowley also said this afternoon that the only complaint I could make about Medicare concerned waiting lists. She must have been on some other planet for the last 4 1/2 years. If she had bothered to listen, she would have heard me give her a list as long as one's arm of what is wrong with Medicare. The list gets worse and worse, to say nothing of the list of people waiting for treatment in public hospitals, which she could not deny is very severe. Again, there is a fundamental flaw in a Bill that gives ultimate control of a vocational register to the Health Insurance Commission and leaves such sensitive and essential questions as auditing to future finetuning legislation in another session of Parliament. That is just an utter disgrace. The Government says, `Vote on something tonight and we will finetune it another day'. Why on earth should any of us do that?</PARA>
<PARA> What is of even more concern is that there is no appeal process in this whole structure. The Health Insurance Commission, through the RACGP recommendations, can put people on or off the list. However, if they are taken off the list there is nothing to allow an appeal. How much more unfair could that be? The Bill talks about minimum requirements. What are the minimum requirements? We should not ask because the Government will not tell us anyway. The situation is a particularly serious one, as is the situation with reinsurance. Just as this Government seeks to con general practitioners into thinking that it is doing them a favour, so too does it pose as the saviour of the major private funds of the health insurance industry. The Minister actually stated:</PARA>
<PARA>I have always maintained that Medicare's continued success and high popularity is dependent upon the maintenance of a strong, viable private health care sector. </PARA>
<PARA>That in itself is an admission of the failure of the whole concept of socialised medicine. Similarly, for decades Soviet agriculture was saved from collapse by the relatively small amounts of land farmed independently by the peasants. The Minister's hypocritical admission is not matched by effective action. The industry is getting a Private Health Insurance Administration Council so that the Department can do its dirty work at arm's length. </PARA>
<PARA> All insurance costs for those contributors over 65 will be met from the reinsurance pool, forcing up the premiums of the employment based closed funds and newer funds to meet increased contributions to the pool. The Government is doing no more than imposing a mechanism to meet the immediate losses of those major funds with high proportions of elderly contributors, and its own contribution to the reinsurance pool is a one-off $20m-an amount equivalent to less than 0.2 per cent of the 1988-89 health budget allocation. The Government tells us how wonderful it is in putting $20m back into the reinsurance pool, but it does not tell us at the same time what it has taken out since it has been in office. Clearly, this is no more than a bandaid on the bucket that is supposedly upholding the community rating principle to which the coalition is strongly committed. In fact, it will have the effect of weakening the same principle. If younger and fitter members of the new for-profit funds, when confronted by increased premiums, should choose to let their insurance lapse and rely upon what the Government, with its other face, still promotes as a free Medicare system-free, my boot-then the needs of elderly contributors will be met from a shrinking financial base and the basic problem will be exacerbated. For community rating to work effectively and justly, there must be real incentive for Australians in good health and below the retiring age to maintain private insurance. No insurance system can survive without coverage of low risk groups. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this Government there is no incentive to maintain private health insurance other than if someone wants to have surgery when one requires it. There is absolutely no financial incentive whatsoever. The supposed incentive offered by the Government is for people to pay twice-pay their Medicare levy, which covers about only one-third of all Medicare and health costs, and pay their private health insurance premiums. It is not the fault of the smaller health funds but that of the whole Medicare system that the Hospital Benefits Association Ltd in Victoria suffered a decline in membership from half a million to 253,000, losing another 13,000 members last year. How typical, I might add, that these figures are public because the Federal Department leaked them. So much for the new-found friends of private insurance!</PARA>
<PARA> Private insurance, which used to be enjoyed by 63 per cent of the population in 1983, looks to a decline from the present level of 46 per cent coverage not only because of the inherent structural problems of Medicare but also because of the deliberate policy adopted towards the private health sector by the Hawke Labor Government. This Government has withdrawn $99m from its contributions to the reinsurance pool, removed the $140m bed subsidy for private hospitals, forced the private funds to pay a 25 per cent gap in the public hospital costs of privately insured patients and stipulated that all such patients shall be regarded as private patients, whatever the nature of their treatment and accommodation within a public hospital. It is no wonder that the Australian Private Hospitals Association realises that this stopgap solution will be of no benefit to private hospitals when public hospitals have every incentive under Medicare to attract private patients, leaving private hospitals with spiralling costs that many privately insured Australians can no longer afford. How sad it is to hear Labor senators talking about reducing the queues in public hospitals by creating more public hospital beds, while there are private hospital beds not being utilised. Their socialist stance will not allow them to see the benefits of private health insurance, private health cover, private doctors and private hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> For all its lip service to the private health sector that saves Medicare $2.7 billion annually in hospital costs, this Government, by its actions, shows that it is prepared to further a situation where the percentage of privately insured Australians will fall. With each one per cent fall in private cover, the annual cost to public hospitals increases by $80m. On the other hand, a realistic contribution to the reinsurance pool of $200m-not $20m-would enable a 10 per cent reduction in private health contribution rates to be made. That, in turn, could result in a 10 per cent increase in those covered and this would save the public health sector $200m annually. Otherwise, this legislation, conferring a minimal benefit on 70 per cent of those privately insured and a massive disincentive on the remaining 30 per cent to maintain their cover, is taking us towards a situation where, in five years time, we will be lucky to have 40 per cent of Australians retaining private cover. </PARA>
<PARA> Private health cover should not be something that is exclusive to the wealthy. This Government is making it more and more that way, because private health cover is now becoming a luxury. People faced with high interest rates are now deciding, more and more, to opt out of private health cover, thus putting more and more of a drain on the public purse. We should remember that governments do not have any money; they have only taxpayers' money. It is not sufficient for people to run around saying, `The Government should provide'. If there were an incentive for people to provide for themselves, there would be less demand on government. But this Government is so blinkered that it will not consider that alternative. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation will mean an increase in the massive queues at public hospitals while private hospitals close, and those that do survive will be priced beyond the range of ordinary Australians. This deceptive Bill, when examined, shows that the Hawke Labor Government is no friend at all of the medical profession or the private health sector. We urgently need the select committee of inquiry that will look at the real issues concerning health that the Government, quite deliberately and consistently, seeks to evade. Foremost among these issues must be the ability of hospital Medicare to meet its basic objectives. We need to establish what support needs to be provided to the private health sector if community rating is to remain a reality. The only option we have is for the whole subject to be looked at in great detail by a Senate select committee which, at the end of the day, once the subject has been sensibly and thoroughly assessed, can make a balanced decision-not a decision based on a piece of legislation which contains no information and no facts about what we should be voting for. That should be a source of major concern. I hope that general practitioners and health insurance funds understand the ability they will have to communicate their concerns to the select committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer to only one item in the package of Bills-the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill, the Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill and the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Amendment Bill-that we are discussing tonight, and that is the reinsurance arrangements that are proposed by the Government. The Government, in terms of its propaganda war on this issue, had undoubtedly won. It has won because the Opposition, which initially indicated it would oppose this legislation, will now support it. I still believe that people are entitled to a clear view of what is going on in this reinsurance exercise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has won, in terms of its propaganda, on the basis of saying that what it is about in these reinsurance rearrangements is, allegedly, supporting the community rating proposals. It is not doing anything of the sort. I intend to show that what it is about could very well end up in the destruction of that community rating proposition. The formula that is used to allocate reinsurance claims is based on the number of policyholders, not on the premiums paid. Of course, that impacts particularly heavily on the price of low cost insurance products, which are, not surprisingly when one is paying for them from one's own back pocket, most popular among low risk groups in the community. What the Government is now proposing, amongst other things, is to change this concept of reinsurance away from the chronically ill towards the aged. By a sleight of hand the Government, in equating the two, says that the chronically ill are aged, and the aged are chronically ill. Of course, they are nothing of the sort. We have a totally new concept, and that is the aged. In addition, the costs of other patients in hospital for longer than 14 days will be included. </PARA>
<PARA> Approximately 70 per cent of current contributors to the schemes will benefit as a result of these changes. Therefore, 30 per cent will be disadvantaged. Seventy per cent will be advantaged inasmuch as the contribution rates they have to pay will probably stabilise for a short period. Certainly those contribution rates will not fall. However, the 30 per cent of contributors who are being disadvantaged will have their rates increased. Let us be clear about the fact that 70 per cent of contributors will benefit only because their rates will not rise-they will merely stabilise-and 30 per cent of contributors will not benefit from this exercise because they will be paying more. That 30 per cent of contributors will be disadvantaged to a large extent. In fact, the larger funds will milk some $18m from 300,000 contributors. If that is not bad enough, those 300,000 contributors-basically, the 8 per cent who belong to the smaller funds-already massively subsidise the larger funds and the other 70 per cent of contributors. That 8 per cent of private contributors contribute nearly 50 per cent of the present cost sharing arrangement. The Government is now proposing that that 8 per cent should pay not only 50 per cent but more than 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Which funds will be milch cows for the Government? The employee based funds. Let us examine some of those funds. The New South Wales Government Employees Health Fund, which gets no subsidy of any kind and operates on overheads of $59 per member per year, is one of the smaller funds that will be milked; it will have its fees raised by the Government. The Hospitals Contribution Fund of Australia, which charges 33 per cent more and has overheads of $111 per member per year, will benefit. In other words, inefficient funds will get more and efficient funds will have to pay for it. Not only new funds are involved. Indeed, one of the oldest funds in Australia, the 100-year-old Tramways Benefit Society in Victoria, has overheads of $63 per member per year, while the Hospital Benefits Association Ltd in Victoria has overheads of $113 per member per year. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, funds that have been operating inefficiently will now be subsidised to continue to operate inefficiently. Thank you very much: officers can be paid their large salaries, the funds can be housed in large headquarters, they can have bad share portfolios; yet the Government will subsidise them, with the money coming from the pockets of the small, efficient funds with low overheads that have put their money back into products for their contributors. </PARA>
<PARA> Those large funds that we are talking about that are now running around the place crying poor have been quite happy to take subscriptions for the last 20 years from these people that they now wish to offload. They have had the use of those people's funds for the last 20 years and now they are saying, `We don't want to look after them any more; they are now aged, or they are spending more than 14 days in hospital. We will offload them and we want other people to pay for them'. This gives a whole new meaning to the take and run exercise-and that is what it is. But it is even worse than that because many of these larger funds that have an interest in private hospitals will now get 100 per cent of all hospital costs for every person over the age of 65. The Government has not required those funds in any way to change or lower their premiums. The Government has not required anything of those funds. So a fund that owns a private hospital can recover its own hospital fees from other funds and also take a return from the hospital. That is a lovely little exercise in which the Government is now engaging. </PARA>
<PARA> The funds to which 30 per cent of contributors belong-that 30 per cent of contributors who will suffer-will find that they will be deserted by many of their contributors as they raise their rates to pay for the subsidised funds. Those 300,000 contributors have 450,000 dependants. Oddly enough, by and large, the funds that have been set up by employee groups, and often by unions, have low overheads and are efficient. They do not have glossy headquarters but they run an efficient, lean exercise. Undoubtedly, as the smaller funds raise their contributions they will lose contributors. That has happened everywhere in the private insurance industry to date. The overall effect will be that fewer people will be insured. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the exercise will be a very odd one. The young and the healthy will not pay the higher contribution rates and they will move out of the funds. Since December 1983, the percentage of people with private health insurance has fallen from 61.5 per cent to 46.2 per cent. That means there will be fewer people insured and fewer to contribute to the reinsurance pool. Of course, the Government has recognised that what it is doing will lead to fewer people being insured and smaller amounts of money going into the reinsurance pool. The Government, knowing that it has an election on its hands, has agreed to put $20m into the reinsurance pool. For how long? Wait for it-for 18 months, because it is having an election in the next 12 months. So all it is doing is putting $20m into the reinsurance pool for the next 18 months. That is the time frame that has been put on it. It is so transparent that those people who actually fall for it would really have to have rocks in their heads. The Government, in a bandaid approach, is buying its way through, and just past, the next election, and what happens after that would be of absolutely no interest to it if it has been re-elected. It has not shown any interest whatsoever in private insurance cover.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government wants to diminish it. There will be an increase in cover for those people aged 65 and a reduction in cover for the low risk groups. Of course, this will lead to an increase in average claim rates, as the young and healthy move out. There will be extra demand because all people over the age of 65 are now being categorised as chronically ill. So we will have an increase in average claim rates for the industry as a whole and a subsequent upward pressure on premiums. The only way in which the private sector can deal with the extra demand and increased costs is to increase the money coming in. The only money coming into these funds is by way of premiums. So in 18 months time-if the Government is lucky this probably will not pick up until just after the next election-the aged will be paying more as a result of these changes; fewer people will be privately insured; there will be more demand on public places; and a number of the small employee based funds that have been made into milch cows for this exercise will be out of business. All of that will occur just after the next election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government is engaging in a very cynical exercise of manipulating the electorate and, in particular, those groups that represent people aged over 65 within our community who, unfortunately, fell for this hook, line and sinker. They will be the ones who will be paying more because we are driving to the wall the small, efficient union based and employee based funds. That is what this exercise is about. The Government would not be involved in that or at all interested in taking on those funds-because, as I say, most of them have been set up by unions-unless there was a quid in it for the Government. The quid in it for the Government is very easy. It will have a patched up arrangement going through to the next election. It will not have a large public fund collapse on its hands in Victoria. That is what this is about. Let us be very clear about that. It does not want any of those funds collapsing around its ears. It wants to limp through to just after the next election. If they all collapsed then, the Government could not care less, because the next election after that will not be for another three years. </PARA>
<PARA> The odd situation is that those 20 employee based funds are run by boards elected by their members either directly or through their trade unions. They have low administrative costs compared to the funds which will have to be propped up. They will be keeping their members, as they do, after retirement. Some of these funds, unlike the public funds that the Government is now going to have to subsidise, have actually been reducing the premiums for their elderly contributors as an incentive for them to stay with the funds. The administrative record of these funds is second to none, unlike some of the other funds that have gone into extraordinarily useless advertising. They have had enormous losses on the stock markets. One has only to be invited to see them in their plush headquarters to know that a lot of the money is going elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government had reallocated to reinsurance the $200m that was there when the Government introduced the new arrangements, that would have been a healthy fund to assist those who are chronically ill. Under those circumstances, their contribution rates could very well have dropped by as much as $3 a week. It has been reliably estimated that 5 per cent more Australians would have taken out private insurance and that the Government would have saved $350m in hospital costs, an overall gain of $150m. If it had encouraged people to take out private insurance by leaving the $200m in there, the Government could have made $150m on the exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us be clear what the Government is doing with regard to this matter. This particular piece of legislation, which unfortunately the Opposition has now said it is going to support, in this context, is simply legalised theft from a number of small private, efficiently run organisations. That legalised theft will be used to prop up failing funds simply in order to get the Government out of a hole until the next election. Legalised theft is no better than illegal theft. The end does not justify the means. I certainly will not be voting for legalised theft when it comes to this particular measure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the time constraints we have in this debate, so I will limit my remarks to those parts of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill dealing with the fee arrangements of general practitioners (GPs) and amendments to the Nursing Homes Assistance Act. The Australian Medical Association (AMA) and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) originally suggested a new content based fee system in September 1988 for introduction on 1 November 1988. The main difference between the proposed new content based fees and the old time based fees was that the new fees were to be defined by the complexity of what the doctor did during the consultation, not the time taken for the consultation. While this proposal was rejected by the Government, it did offer to both the AMA and the RACGP the opportunity to discuss changes to general practitioners' fees. The RACGP accepted that offer; the AMA did not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think we should place on record just what the agenda of the AMA is. The main aim of the AMA is to create dissatisfaction with Medicare by creating a large difference between GPs' fees and Medicare rebates. The AMA proposed general practitioners' fees of $25, as contrasted with the schedule fee of $18.60 and the Medicare rebate of $15.85. The AMA, which refused point blank to be involved in negotiations with the Government, has now attacked the agreement and recommendations that the joint working party, comprising representatives of the Government and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, has produced. Having refused to participate in the process of the working party, the AMA is now trying to defeat the legislation here in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The AMA's actions have antagonised not only general practitioners but also its own members. Let us take Dr Eric Fisher as an example. For 40 years a member of the British Medical Association and then the AMA, he was the general practitioners' craft representative on the Federal council of the AMA. In his letter of resignation dated 24 May 1989 from both the AMA and its Federal council, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>My position as craft representative in which I have endeavoured to promote unity in general practice has become untenable. I have rarely been consulted about general practice matters. The position is purely a cosmetic one. I cannot in all conscience hold such a false position. </PARA>
<PARA> Repeated press releases concerning general practitioners have been issued without any consultation with the craft representative. Some of these press releases are clearly calculated to divide general practice. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The AMA must give up this obsession with attacking the Royal College of General Practitioners and instead spend its energies on behalf of all general practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I do not believe it has the capability. It lost the opportunity to become a constructive organisation by varying the recommendations of the Cotton Report. It appears to have learnt very little from that exercise. I would dearly have loved to see a resurgent AMA. I believe it will get absolutely nowhere by trying to dominate the profession rather than working for it. Its political ineptitude is being hidden behind the so called ``new look'' in which nothing has really changed. </PARA>
<PARA>What an indictment of the AMA. The AMA is now dominated by a small and conservative group-in fact, a rump-whose main goal is the destruction of Medicare. Not only do we have the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners supporting the Government on this legislation, and the AMA alienating and antagonising its general practitioner members, but the Doctors Reform Society has also been brought into the debate. The Doctors Reform Society, not surprisingly, has condemned the AMA for opposing the negotiated fee changes for general practice. In a recent press release, Dr Robert Marr of the Doctors Reform Society said:</PARA>
<PARA> The resignation of Dr Fisher validates a recent survey of all GPs throughout Australia that showed 78% of GPs did not think the AMA was doing a good job representing GPs. </PARA>
<PARA> The AMA represents less than 50% of GPs but even 55% of AMA member GPs who responded to the survey were dissatisfied with the AMA. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Marr said that the Doctors Reform Society calls on the Liberal Party's health spokesman Mr Peter Shack and the Australian Democrats' health spokesman Senator John Coulter to support GP fee changes in Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> This morning I listened with interest to Senator Puplick's tirade. He described the negotiations between the Government and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners as a cosy, closed shop deal. Senator Puplick also claimed that the Government had not acted on the recommendations of the Doherty report-the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Medical Education and Medical Workforce. It became clear from Senator Puplick's contribution that he had not read the Doherty report. He was probably just too busy defending the vested interests of a small group of conservative specialists whom the Liberal Party and the Opposition have always represented. There seems to be no care for the consumers, the patients or for the vast majority of general practitioners in Australia. There seems to be no concern for recommendations 8 (i) to 8 (vi) of the Doherty report, which call for general practitioners to undertake vocational training. The report says on page 289:</PARA>
<PARA> General practice has a key role in medical practice and education, as a discipline in medical care which required a distinct style of practice and point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> Appropriate vocational training is highly desirable and should be available to all entrants to general practice. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the report to Senator Puplick and suggest that he read it. There is no doubt that the majority of general practitioners support this legislation. I believe that the legislation is in the best interests of health care in this country, the best interests of GPs and certainly the best interests of patients. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to draw attention to a report that has been written for the New South Wales Council for Intellectual Disability by Ms Karen McLoughlin. The report relates to the accommodation of young people with intellectual disabilities in private nursing homes in New South Wales. Ms McLoughlin describes them as a `particularly neglected and hidden group', as the report outlines. The report gives three examples of people with disabilities who live in nursing homes in New South Wales. I would like to outline them here. </PARA>
<PARA> Example number one is Shirley. Shirley has a severe intellectual disability. She has been raised in Sydney in a succession of special purpose nursing homes catering for children with special needs. When she was two years old Shirley's application for nursing home benefits was approved by Commonwealth medical officers (CMOs). Now she is 19-too old for the children's home. Yet the piece of paper which had been rubber stamped when she was two is still valid. Shirley was able to be placed in a local geriatric nursing home without any further contact with the CMOs. In this home there is a group of other young men and women who have also graduated from the children's home and a larger group of non-disabled elderly men and women. A registered nurse is on duty 24 hours a day but it is not always possible to monitor the interactions between the residents. Some programs have been attempted with the younger residents but the staff have no special training and feel that their divided energies disadvantage both groups. </PARA>
<PARA> Example number two is Ken, who is 30 years old and has a severe intellectual disability. He had lived with his parents in a country town all his life. Three years ago Ken's mother died and his elderly father was unable to care for him. Ken's case was referred to the CMOs and he was approved for nursing home benefits. As there were no special purpose nursing homes in his local area Ken now lives in a geriatric nursing home. No other people with an intellectual disability live in the nursing home and there are no staff qualified to provide the special programs that Ken needs. </PARA>
<PARA> The third example is Margaret. Margaret is 40 years old and had a severe intellectual disability and epilepsy. When Margaret had some recurrent bouts of illness a few years back, her elderly aunt could no longer care for her at home. Margaret was approved for nursing home benefits and admitted to a large geriatric home near her aunt's home in Sydney. Now she has completely recovered from her illness but her aunt does not feel that she could cope with caring for Margaret at home again. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the plight of these people must be addressed. Can anyone argue that these people would not be better off away from nursing homes if they are capable of independent living outside? The Disability Services Act places great emphasis on appropriate consumer outcomes-access to independent living skills and a range of other services which add immeasurably to the quality of life of people with disabilities. For that reason I support very strongly the legislation that is before the Senate today. </PARA>
<PARA> I was disappointed in Senator Boswell's earlier comments that he believed that the amendments before the Senate would provide less flexibility for disabled people in nursing homes. I believe that the exact opposite is true: the Government's amendments will provide more flexibility. Many people with disabilities do not require the type of nursing care that is given in nursing homes. Many people could be accommodated in less restrictive environments. The proposed amendments will give disabled people more opportunities. With support, some people who currently live in nursing homes can live in the outside community. The Disability Services Act allows for disabled people to be treated as individuals. It means that people with disabilities have a choice. New services will encourage disabled people who can cope to leave inappropriate and artificial environments. They can choose more appropriate community based accommodation. Ongoing assistance and training will be provided for disabled people who are able to leave nursing homes for a better or more appropriate home. The Disability Services Act is supported by disabled people and service providers. I hope that the Senate can see fit to do the same. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate this evening is debating cognately the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, the Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill 1989 and the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Amendment Bill 1988. I wish to restrict my remarks to two amendments to this package of legislation. In the first case I wish to address my remarks to the Australian Democrats' amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill and speak to the motion. The amendment states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>but the Senate is of the opinion that women who choose to give birth at home are disadvantaged because of their ineligibility for medicare rebates for the services of a midwife, and the Government should take urgent action to remedy this unfairness. </PARA>
<PARA>Homebirth is an alternative that a growing number of women are choosing. In Western Australia, in particular, women are choosing the alternative of the homebirth rather than a hospital birth. But this means engaging the services of a midwife. If a woman has a general practitioner or a specialist to assist her to give birth, she can claim a Medicare rebate. But if a qualified midwife assists in the homebirth, she is not eligible for a Medicare rebate. It is indeed unfortunate that doctors, for the most part, do not choose to assist women in homebirth. I know that there are exceptions but they are very much in the minority. </PARA>
<PARA> In assisting a homebirth, a qualified midwife will be present for some hours during labour, as well as providing antenatal and postnatal support which, of course, can be complementary to any care also given by a general practitioner or a specialist. Because there is no Medicare rebate, midwives tend to charge minimal fees for a homebirth. I have even heard that they have charged virtually no fees at all. Nonetheless, the result of this situation is a case of discrimination against women who cannot afford to have a homebirth. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out to the Senate that an increasing number of women are recognising the advantages of a homebirth. For a woman to give birth in her own home in familiar surroundings far away from a hospital atmosphere results in a more relaxed situation. Indeed it is now recognised that the woman herself can be better off in such circumstances. Of course, so can the newborn baby. Homebirth is not for everyone but some women want this. Other women feel more secure in a hospital situation. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as possible the woman concerned, if she is to have a homebirth, must expect a relatively uncomplicated birth. Of course, should this not eventuate and should it be deemed necessary for the woman to be transferred to hospital, a midwife can always arrange this. As the majority of births are what one could categorise as normal and, indeed, as they are more likely to be normal if unnecessary medical intervention does not occur, there is no reason why a woman who chooses a homebirth should not be allowed to have it. </PARA>
<PARA> I also point out that in Western Australia midwives have access to hospitals. In fact, if the woman is to be transferred to a hospital the midwife can assist at the hospital. With conscientious prenatal care most complications or difficulties that are likely to arise are, in this day and age, predictable. Women greatly appreciate the special personal support which can be given by a midwife. A lot of women do not see themselves as sick patients. They recognise that hospital treatment may be necessary but for normal child birth a lot of women do not regard it as necessary. Rather, they see themselves as taking part in a natural and beautiful process which can be uncomfortable, even painful. It can make a woman feel particularly vulnerable. Therefore, that is all the more reason for women to require the sympathetic support that they can have from a midwife. </PARA>
<PARA> A qualified midwife has more than enough qualifications and knowledge of gynaecology and obstetrics to be able to assist a woman in the birth process. If things go wrong-and unfortunately they can go wrong at times-then most women would appreciate being able to be in a hospital and surrounded by the latest equipment. If this happens in Western Australia, the woman can still have her midwife with her as in Western Australia midwives have delivery rights in hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been pointed out to me that Western Australia would be a good State in which to have a pilot scheme involving an increased use of midwives. I would like to draw the Senate's attention to a task force which is currently reviewing obstetric, neonatal and gynaecological services in Western Australia. The aims of the task force are to assess the quality of care currently being provided; to determine whether resources are being used effectively; to consider the needs of groups requiring special attention, such as adolescents, Aboriginal people, women from non-English speaking backgrounds, the disabled and those who are economically disadvantaged or who reside in isolated areas; and to investigate the possibility of alternative types of services which will allow for increased consumer choice. That is what I am talking about: the ability of women to choose a homebirth if this is what they want. </PARA>
<PARA> The terms of reference and objectives of the task force include investigation of the current hospital obstetric practices, including the frequency of intervention in child birth; the provision of medical services to pregnant women in emergency situations when giving birth in a non-hospital setting; and the role and range of duties undertaken by midwives, including the role, training and access to hospital of independent midwives. The Democrats are of the opinion that a woman who chooses to give birth at home should have access to Medicare rebates by being able to claim for the services of a qualified midwife. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to address some remarks to the amendment put forward by Senator Boswell wherein he moved that proposed amendments contained in part 5 of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs for inquiry and report by the first sitting day in October 1989. The Democrats strongly support the thrust of the amendments put forward by the Government to part 5 of this legislation, those relating to accommodation for the disabled. But we have some concerns. We believe that integrated accommodation for disabled persons needs both adequate funding and an assurance that the service provisions by the non-government sector are of the highest quality. Senator Boswell's amendment to this part of the legislation would mean that a Senate committee would look into aspects such as these. I point out that in the Australian Capital Territory it costs on average $11,000 per person in integrated housing per annum. It is double that amount in the States because these service provisions are not subsidised by other services as they are in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Once disabled persons have been de-institutionalised it is important that there be a close tie-up between home and community care and the attendant care program. There may be problems in instituting these changes, which the Democrats support, because people who are used to institutionalised care may find it difficult to adjust to non-institutionalised care. We find that problem right across the board. It is well known that people who spend a large part of their lives in institutions as children find it hard to cope with life outside an institution upon reaching adulthood. We just have to look at the statistics in our prison system to see how many of those who are, unfortunately, regular clients of that system spent a part of their lives in institutions. There have been criticisms that the Disability Services Act is too inflexible and it is imperative that accommodation choice be individually based. Within the system there must be a choice of bigger homes, although the Democrats believe that there should be no more than 20 persons in each home. This is particularly important in the country and for emergency accommodation where small homes of four persons may not be appropriate. The question must also be asked as to why indexation remains at the discretion of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> We certainly support this matter being referred to a Senate standing committee, but we believe that it should be sequential and not concurrent. In other words, the Democrats will pass part 5 of the legislation, but will also vote in favour of these matters being referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. The final implementation of this amending legislation will not occur until 1992, so there is just time for considerations at the start of its implementation. Besides which, guidelines will be associated with the legislation and it will be possible for the Committee to assist in setting those guidelines. However, as I understand it, Senator Boswell has agreed to the date being changed. Having spoken with the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Zakharov, I have found that she is of the opinion-and I would agree with her; I cannot speak for the Committee because it has not met to discuss Senator Boswell's amendment-that the Committee could not possibly look at and report on these considerations by the first sitting day in October 1989, so we are seeking to have that date changed to the first sitting day in March 1990. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The current health system into which all Australians have been flung falls a long way short of that which the Government promised to all Australians through Medicare. The Government promised to provide a fair system in which the ability to pay was not to be a major determinant of access to health services and, therefore, changes to our health system are long overdue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately the legislation which we are debating this evening and that piece of legislation to which I particularly wish to refer in this cognate debate, the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, completely fail to make the correct changes which the health system in Australia requires to make it more responsive to the needs of all Australians. Medicine is undergoing a time of great change in which many patients receive less than the best possible care. Thousands of low income Australians on public hospital waiting lists are the front line casualties of Medicare. This list grows steadily longer with each day that passes. Fears in the community that Medicare has failed to deliver access to hospital care has induced about 22 per cent of Australians on the lowest incomes-those who are health card holders-to take out private hospital insurance at extreme financial hardship to themselves. It is for these very people that the public health system is designed. It is for them and their health care needs that we have a public health system so that they do not need to have private health insurance. Meanwhile we find that many other people on higher incomes who can well afford to take private health insurance are opting out of that expense and taking the risk of their own good health. As I said, this legislation does nothing to improve that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are several significant elements to this legislation. It involves alterations to the reinsurance arrangements for private health funds, it seeks to establish a private health insurance administration council and it also seeks to introduce a vocational register for general practice medicine. It seeks the promotion of day only hospital treatment, and it seeks to introduce a new pathology services table and to alter the way in which that table can be changed. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the Federal Government has removed some $500m of health expenditure from its Budget and loaded it onto the private health care sector since the establishment of Medicare, private health insurance is failing to keep up with costs. This legislation does nothing to remedy that situation. The changes that it proposes with regard to private health insurance are a direct consequence of that fact. The coalition does not oppose those changes but it needs to be recognised that Medicare has failed completely to provide appropriate responses to the deficiencies in our health care system. The Government has failed to protect the interests of the aged and chronically ill by providing sufficient support for the Health Benefits Reinsurance Trust Fund. The Hawke Government has provided only $47m to that trust, compared to some $525m provided by the previous coalition Government. The additional injection of some $20m which it is seeking to provide through this legislation is an inadequate response to the needs of the Reinsurance Trust. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's proposals inadequately address the problems which health care funds face as a result of the introduction of Medicare and the significant reductions in Commonwealth contributions to the reinsurance pool. As I said, the Government has ripped some $500m out of the reinsurance pool over the time it has been in office. As a result it is forcing those funds with limited membership to provide the funds which it has ripped out of the system. The result of this will be that any advantage from the changes, in particular to the aged group in our community, will be minimal and likely to be short-term. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government claims that it is introducing this aspect of the legislation, this contribution to the Reinsurance Trust Fund and increasing the provision which those limited funds are required to make to the Reinsurance Trust Fund, to ensure the survival of community rating. But community rating cannot survive under the current situation. Only some 46 per cent of the population has private insurance. That percentage is decreasing. That is the rub for this legislation. As I said, the Government claims that it is protecting community rating but it has destroyed community rating by reducing the incentive and the capacity of many people to take out private insurance. Community rating can operate only if a significant proportion of the community has private health insurance. It is meaningless if a relatively small and declining percentage of the community has private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition's health policy will demonstrate our commitment to protecting the health care interests of the aged and the future of the private health care sector generally. That is why we are moving that this whole issue and a number of matters with regard to this legislation be referred to a Senate select committee for further investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation also involves changes to the Australian Institute of Health Act which concerns the anxieties of State and Territory governments about the need to make additional provisions to safeguard the handling of information made available to the Australian Institute of Health. We support the passage of these changes but we particularly want to ensure that the handling of confidential health information should be both sensitive and in the interests of vital research work aimed at raising community health standards. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the changes to pathology services, the legislation provides for regulations under the Health Insurance Act 1973 to govern the operation of the pathology services table. It also repeals the provisions establishing the Pathology Services Advisory Committee and replaces the existing schedule of pathology services with a new schedule. Again, the Opposition will support those sections of the legislation which relate to pathology service delivery. These amendments are very much overdue. The manipulations which occurred in this area in November last year served only to create a totally unworkable pathology services table. It is estimated that the new pathology services table will result in a full year saving of $45m over the estimate based on the August 1987 table. In addition, additional savings of $47m in 1990-91 and $49m in 1991-92 have been identified in attachment F of the Government's economic statement. The Opposition will allow these changes. The unholy mess in which the Government has dumped pathology services and the problems associated with attempts to operate policy decisions via a third party-namely, the Pathology Services Advisory Council-are quite obvious and we will support those changes.</PARA>
<PARA> Through this legislation, the Government also proposes changes to encourage day only hospital treatment. Therefore, the legislation permits greater flexibility in the determination of basic hospital benefits for day only treatment in a hospital or day hospital facility. It will make provision for medical practitioners to certify that in special circumstances a patient requiring day only treatment may be eligible for an overnight stay. It will provide different amounts to be payable in respect of different classes of professional attention and treatment in different classes of hospital. In principle, the coalition supports the greater use of day only hospitals. Despite this, we will oppose this aspect of the legislation because we believe that no changes should be implemented without exhaustive discussion with representative organisations of the medical profession and the National Day Surgery Advisory Committee. The extent of consultation in which this Government has been involved is entirely inadequate as a basis for this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation also seeks to establish a general practitioner vocational register. This creates a new class of general practitioner defined as a `vocationally registered general practitioner'. It empowers the Health Insurance Commission: firstly, to establish and maintain a vocational register of general practitioners; secondly, to add and remove medical practitioners' names from the register; thirdly, to advise the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners of the state of the register; and, finally, to provide the general public with details of those on the list. As was stated earlier by coalition speakers, this section of the legislation will take the control and administration of general practitioners out of the hands of the college and put it into the hands of the Health Insurance Commission. In other words, it will place another section of medical care in the hands of the Government bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not oppose, in principle, that there should be incentives for general practitioners to acquire additional skills, to undertake further education and training and to raise the standard of general practice. But we oppose the way in which this legislation seeks to give effect to those objectives. The Government has acted too hastily in seeking to establish this new circumstance, as it did with regard to pathology services, without allowing the fullest consideration of this issue by the medical profession as a whole. We believe that a change such as this requires comprehensive consideration to be given to standards, fees, rebates and accreditation. That is why we are referring this issue to a Senate select committee which will consult widely and report back to the Senate on the legislation before any changes are made. </PARA>
<PARA> These days the focus of Australia's health system is primary care, also known as general practice. This is an area which has been particularly neglected under this Government. More than 80 per cent of Australians visit a general practitioner each year. The majority of general practitioners-almost 59 per cent-are in group practice. There are 70 million general practitioner consultations every year in Australia. That is about 192,000 for each day of the entire year. There are some fundamental problems with the operation of the health bureaucracy and the Federal Government now has the opportunity to address and transform the quality of medical care administered through general practice. It is an opportunity which this Government is demonstrably neglecting. It is not repairing that neglect through this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The health bureaucracy is obsessed with the concern that doctors care more about earning big money than with administering care for the ill in our society. It seems to have forgotten that only a small proportion of people who need medical attention actually have to use hospitals. So general practice is bearing the brunt of the community's dismay with the system as it currently stands. The Government needs to give much greater consideration to this area. Even in small rural environments, let alone urban complexes, there are many ways available for the community to avoid seeing general practitioners. There are hospital casualty departments, family planning clinics and community health centres with their attendant community nurses. General practitioners are competing with greater numbers of their own profession and a variety of allied health professionals for their patients. It would seem that the most cost effective type of doctor, the well trained and well motivated general practitioner, is far too valuable to be replaced by these other agencies; yet, again, the Government is encouraging their replacement. On the one hand the community wants convenient access to the medical care and skills which a general practitioner offers and on the other hand it expresses concern periodically about the level of general practitioners' fees. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the complexities which are now evident in the Government's general administration and funding of our health care system and the way in which the Government is fiddling the system to hide the utter failure of Medicare, the Opposition will seek to refer significant parts of this legislation to a Senate select committee. That inquiry is required urgently to investigate not only the many proposals in this legislation but also the general shortcomings in the health care system. I commend the Opposition's proposed course of action and urge the Senate to support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of the Government to reply to the debate. I think the Senate will agree that the views of the Opposition, and some views of the Australian Democrats, have been canvassed extensively. Government senators have rebutted some of those views on the Bills before the chamber-the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, the Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill 1989, and the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Amendment Bill 1988. There have been a host of speakers, and a number of amendments have been proposed. A motion has just been amended by Senator Boswell on behalf of the National Party. Notice was given last Thursday morning by Senator Puplick, in anticipation of this debate, of one motion which is before the chamber. The Australian Democrats have moved an amendment to the motion for the second reading. If one listened to the contribution to the debate by honourable senators opposite one would have heard a number of questions foreshadowed for the committee stage. A number of amendments have been foreshadowed also. Having said that, it is true that the Opposition has indicated its support for a number of the Government's proposed measures in this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I go to the detail of what I wish to put to the chamber, I will sort out the wheat from the chaff. I will pocket the wheat and reply to the chaff. Let me identify that the amendment to the Australian Institute of Health Act 1987 improves the confidentiality provisions of the Act. It is an amendment upon which the States agree. I understand that the Opposition does not oppose it. The amendment is needed for the States to begin to provide statistics to the Commonwealth under these provisions. I understand that that will not be opposed. I acknowledge the support that we have obtained on that measure. </PARA>
<PARA> The next is the amendment to the pathology services table. Again, I understand that both the Opposition and the Australian Democrats do not oppose this measure. The pathologists themselves support the change. Therefore, I understand that that is agreed. I thank the Opposition and the Democrats for their support on that score. I could recite the same litany as I have for the previous two amendments on the Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill 1989 but I understand that this is also supported. There is no need for me to enter debate on those matters. A number of observations have been made about them in Hansard but I will not delay the Senate by referring to them. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to the day hospital benefit arrangements for insured patients. This raises an interesting aspect of the debate. From listening to the speakers it is fair to say that there is Opposition support for the concept involved. The argument is not whether the Government is proposing to do the right thing but whether the Government has adequately and exhaustively consulted all of the organisations that one would expect to be consulted on a measure such as this. Indeed, on 25 May in the debate on this Bill in the House of Representatives Mr Shack, the shadow Minister for health, in his address commented that the Government had not had any discussions or consultations on the proposed new day surgery arrangements at that time. I think that was a fair enough comment, given the state of knowledge that Mr Shack had on that occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the Minister for Community Services and Health, Dr Blewett, has taken steps to advise Mr Shack of the detail of the consultation. In a letter dated early June the Minister set that out in detail with a list of the organisations that have been formally consulted. Twenty-three organisations have been consulted. I do not propose to read them into the Hansard. I do not even propose to incorporate them because they have been referred to often enough in the public debate but I do table the document setting out the list of 23 organisations that have been consulted. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the 1987 Australian Health Ministers Conference, where it was agreed that the Commonwealth would review day hospital facility benefits, the Department of Community Services and Health has had continuing discussions with State and Territory health authorities, the hospital and insurance industries and peak medical bodies. The discussion paper produced in March this year outlining possible new arrangements was essentially the product of those consultations. This discussion paper has been widely distributed. I refer to the list that I have tabled as part of the distribution. Departmental officers recently held meetings with a number of those organisations and more are planned in the future. To date responses on the paper show general support for the concept and the Department has received many constructive suggestions on the appropriateness of the procedures to be included for day surgery. An extensive consultative process is being carried out by the Department. That extensive consultation procedure will be completed by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is for me in this debate to put, I think fairly, to the Opposition that the Government has demonstrated its bona fides as to consultations. The Opposition may have been seized of a different impression when Mr Shack made those statements. It is my understanding that the Australian Democrats at least understand the extent to which we have attempted to consult honestly and exhaustively and that they do support the Government on this measure. I think it would be appropriate for the Opposition also to recognise that we have done the right thing, and to support this measure. However, I commend it to the Senate. The Government will be looking for a majority vote when this matter is put to the test at the conclusion of the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me therefore go to another piece, in the sequence in which I have my list of issues before me, of what I initially thought might be described as chaff, but which I am prepared to recognise as wheat. The Australian Democrats have moved the following amendment to the motion for the second reading:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add: `, but the Senate is of the opinion that women who chose to give birth at home are disadvantaged because of their ineligibility . . .'</PARA>
<PARA>They are claiming that the Government should take urgent action to remedy the alleged unfairness of that position. At first blush it seems to me--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Powell" NAMEID="O14">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O14">Senator Powell</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about second blush?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to second blush in a minute, because it has a very important role to play in this debate. At first blush I am inclined to support the Democrats' proposal. The Government believes that we can meet the intent of what the Democrats are proposing, but in a more effective way. I make the side comment that for us at least the art of government is making a real change. It seems to me that the motion proposed by the Democrats is to tack their flag to the mast, that they are interested in a symbolistic expression of view by the Senate on this matter. It is in the pursuit of the desirable objective that, if we believe something is worthwhile, we should change the status quo to conform to that-that is, the achievement of real change-that I propose we go a bit further. The Government does not disagree with the intent of the Democrats' amendment, but we would not be in favour of a simple extension of the fee for service arrangements for midwives assisting with home births. The issue of the extension of fee for service to midwives was considered, as honourable senators may know, by the Medicare Benefits Review Committee, chaired by the then Justice Robyn Layton. But that Committee did not favour fee for service arrangements for home births, despite the exhaustive canvassing of the issue before it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This issue was again raised extensively during the consultations on the development of the national women's health policy. The Department of Community Services and Health has been considering several options, as indicated by Senator Coulter in his earlier remarks. The Government would like to see a wider range of birthing options available to women, but there are issues other than the simple financial arrangements which must be considered. For example, safety issues must be considered in attending or having home births. There is the question of hospital admitting rights available to midwives. State programs also enter into this consideration. The New South Wales Government, for example, recently released a major report on that subject. So the Government would like to provide financial assistance for those women who choose an appropriate home birth. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the wording of the amendment be something along these lines: `but the Senate is of the opinion that the Government should take action to provide financial assistance for midwives associated with home births'. The honourable senator might consider those words and give me some sort of indication, before I resume my seat at the end of this address, as to whether she finds them satisfactory. I regret that in the rush to the wire, when we were expecting one or two more speakers to speak, I have not had a chance personally to canvass them with the honourable senator in private prior to dropping them on her in public, but I am sure she will appreciate the circumstances in which I am operating. Where does that lead us to in terms of the issues? I think it leads us to Senator Boswell's--</PARA>

On my shopping list of matters the next is the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act. We understand that there is general agreement but that an amendment may be moved at the committee stage. At the moment I am not aware of the nature of the amendment, so I will reserve my comments until the committee stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That brings me to Senator Boswell, who interjected a moment too soon, and to his motion, which he has just amended to substitute-as I took it to be-`March 1990' for `October 1989'. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not on his back. It is a very broad back and capable of supporting a lot of weight, but I am not contributing to the weight that is already there. Let me say a number of things about Senator Boswell's motion to refer the matter to a committee. The first is that the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Amendment Bill seeks to provide incentives for transfer of nursing homes for disabled persons from the Nursing Homes Assistance Act (NHAA) to the Disability Services Act. The Disability Services Act provides access for people with disabilities to a more appropriate and extensive range of services. I think that that is common ground between us. The nursing homes involved have been advised that once they transfer under the Disability Services Act, additional funding as necessary will be made available to enable them to deliver a less restrictive range of services to people with disabilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In view of that, we have to say that Senator Boswell's motion serves no real worthwhile purpose. It would serve only to delay the benefits of the Disability Services Act being extended to people with disabilities in nursing homes. In our view that is not desirable. The handicapped programs review has already dealt with these matters and the Disability Services Act offers the best way of addressing them. The nursing homes and hostels review identified young people in nursing homes as one of the most disadvantaged groups. This Government wants to address that problem through this legislation. The Disability Services Act offers a very flexible range of responses to people with high support needs not limited to the nursing homes option, which is all that is available under the NHAA, and deferral will reduce time available for transition by nursing homes. Any deferral is likely to mean a full year's delay because the homes are funded on an annual budget. I put it to the Senate that that is a backdoor way of attacking the Disability Services Act, which enjoyed all-party support. The current arrangements for nursing homes are the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> With those words I have to say that we will not support even Senator Boswell's amended proposal as a motion, and nor, I understand, will the Australian Democrats. We would want the provisions to be carried and then we would support an inquiry into the issues Senator Boswell has raised, and thus there can be an analysis of all those things by the Senate Standing Committee, but it is desirable to get the particular amendments in place and operating. That is my understanding of the support the Government will enjoy in the chamber on the issues that Senator Boswell has canvassed. </PARA>

I will try to arrange for them to be passed to the Opposition by the Whip. If there is any doubt, I can go back and explain them. I have a few other remarks to make about the nub of the issues before this chamber and what has excited community debate on the Bills. Senator Puplick is looking expectant, and that brings me to Senator Puplick's--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought that what passed across Senator Puplick's countenance was a swift flicker of interest because I might be coming to what he proposed in this chamber by way of a motion last Thursday. If that was an expression of anticipation, let me reward it by coming to Senator Puplick's motion. This motion is not supported by the Government, and we will seek to persuade senators to vote against it. We do so, having weighed the content of the motion, and reached a number of unfortunate-for Senator Puplick-conclusions which, nonetheless, are points I should make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Puplick's proposal really falls into two categories. It deals with general practitioners and the health insurance amendments which the Government is proposing in this legislation. The section on general practitioners is brief. Senator Puplick is seeking to have it referred to a Senate select committee, which is to present its report on the first sitting day after 1 August. It would be quick work for a Senate select committee to canvass all the issues set out in this section but it is, nonetheless, within the competence of the Senate. The second part of the proposal is extensive in scope. It is proposed that, if this motion is carried, the Senate select committee which would be constituted should report by the first sitting day in March. There are 10 different and distinct points to the terms of reference, and it is proposed that the committee should conduct a review covering almost every aspect of medical health insurance in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> I mentioned the changes concerning general practitioners. The new GP fee arrangements are designed to provide financial incentives for general practitioners to undertake appropriate vocational training and maintain their skills in what is a rapidly changing field. I think most people would agree that vocational training for general practitioners is highly desirable. Indeed, the Australian Medical Association (AMA)-which, I believe, given the comments made by several senators opposite, is properly described as pulling the puppet strings of the Opposition to block this legislation-says almost as much in its own policy platform. Let me quote selectively from the policy platform of the AMA on this point as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Adequate post-graduate training is pre-requisite for unsupervised medical practice. </PARA>
<PARA> No medical practitioner should enter unsupervised general practice without having completed such training. </PARA>
<PARA>The policy goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> Regular participation in continuing medical education is essential. </PARA>
<PARA>Those policy commitments of the AMA at that point are congruent with what the Government is proposing here. The Government is trying to encourage both vocational training and continuing medical education, and making both a pre-requisite which is what AMA policy requires. Those GPs who have sufficient practice experience, or who complete appropriate postgraduate training and who are prepared to undertake continuing medical education will be eligible to use a new set of Medicare scheduled items with higher Medicare fees and rebates. They will be eligible to enrol on a new vocational register and they will be rewarded for their efforts in undertaking general practice training just as physicians and surgeons are enrolled on vocational registers and receive higher rewards. I believe that the new arrangements will enhance the status of GPs and, more importantly, provide an improved career structure. They will promote better quality patient care, and will provide general practitioners with an opportunity to spend more time with their patients. They should result in reduced requirements for the ordering of expensive diagnostic tests, pharmaceuticals and unnecessary referrals. I stress that the new arrangements are entirely voluntary. For those GPs who are either ineligible or who choose not to enrol, the current items will remain on Medicare so that no-one is disadvantaged and no-one is worse off. The fact is that about 90 per cent of general practitioners, both full time and part time, would be automatically eligible to enrol and thus could be better off. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Puplick's motion is rightly seen as a cynical attempt by the Opposition to display mock concern for patients and for the quality of health care. In fact, the motion is nothing short of a political manoeuvre. I think this motion attempts to undermine and discredit what the Government is trying to do and I do not believe that it should be supported in any sense. </PARA>
<PARA> I could make many other remarks about this provision but I want now to turn to the health insurance aspects of the motion. As I have said, the health insurance aspects are dealt with in a long explanation in the motion; there are 10 elements to its terms of reference. I stick with my remarks about the Opposition's position on GPs being cynical, but the Opposition's position on health insurance has to be seen as fairly transparent cynicism as well. </PARA>
<PARA> These terms of reference will try to put before a Senate select committee a wholesale review of health insurance in Australia and drag evidence from people and organisations around Australia over the next several months in an effort to dramatise what I think the Opposition believes are imperfections in Medicare. These terms of reference would attract argument on that score and provide a forum for organisational representatives to come forward and make allegations which would then attract cheap headlines without full explanations in answer to those allegations appearing-or, if they ever appear, they appear right at the back of the newspaper. These terms of reference would also try to organise or modify public perceptions of health services and the health insurance system in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> If someone were to quiz me on that subject it would be fair to ask: Why would the Opposition do that? I think the real reason the Opposition would do that, and why it is proposing to do that on this occasion, is that it does not have any sort of health policy itself. In order to try to pretend expertise or standing in the field of health insurance and health delivery in Australia, the Opposition has chosen to cover its own lack by turning over to a committee all these issues to attract and generate as much public criticism of the health insurance provisions that the Government supports and, by that means, overcome the weaknesses in its own ranks. The Opposition would serve Australia much better if it were to put clearly and cogently before the community its own proposals in a way in which they can be analysed and properly criticised, rather than go on a head hunting expedition in the form that it does with these proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise that the Australian Democrats are proposing to support Senator Puplick's motion. I am entirely surprised that a political party, which built its reputation years ago on a quip by its then leader, Don Chipp, that its purpose in life was to `keep the bastards honest', is departing from keeping honest the alleged bastards-who I assume are us. </PARA>

<PARA> In summary, therefore, there are a number of proposals on which we are of the one mind. That is a good thing.

There are a number of proposals, such as the second reading amendment by the Democrats, which we can find a way of supporting. It is intended to shuffle off a number of proposals to a committee, rather than face the hard decisions that governments must make in order to govern a country. It is proposed that we establish yet another endless and purposeless inquiry, which will induce no new evidence. It will serve the political purpose of screening the inadequacies of the Opposition and, maybe, the Democrats, in the health area and will merely delay the effective management by this Government of what is, in terms of Medicare and its relations with the medical profession, an enviable record that any government could aspire to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment on the revised second reading amendment. In essence the form of words of the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) has been picked up by Senator Jenkins. I suspect that the origin of this amendment owes something to the technique known as parthenogenesis on the Minister's part; nevertheless, it causes a degree of confusion as far as the Opposition is concerned in terms of exactly what the second reading amendment now means. We are unsure to whom it is proposed that financial assistance should be provided-in other words, whether it should be to the expectant mother or to the midwife. We are unsure as to the basis upon which it is to be provided and the extent to which it might be provided for the actual act of birth and the attendant presence of the midwife or whether somebody who is planning to have a home birth and wishes to consult the midwife in advance will be provided with some sort of financial assistance. We are unsure whether the amendment proposes a new schedule in terms of establishing a schedule of fees or rebates for midwifery services. We object in principle to the question of this all being taken, as it were, on the run by the Minister in producing a form of words, there being no opportunity to debate the substantive issue of whether or not homebirths should be financially supported through the Medicare system. That has been the subject of ongoing debate in the chamber. It is not as if this is a matter which has not been raised and debated in the chamber in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore I put on record that the Opposition will not specifically support this particular amendment. Nevertheless, given the fact that the Minister and the Australian Democrats have obviously come to an arrangement on the matter, we do not intend to divide on the question. I simply say that I do not believe that the forms of the Senate are particularly well served by adducing second reading amendments in this fashion, which leave a great deal unstated, and deny us the opportunity to explore in some detail precisely what is meant by the second reading amendment. If the amendment were being proposed to the Bill itself, we would have to take a quite different approach. But, on the basis that it is intended to be some sort of commitment-and I take it that it is a commitment, the Minister having offered it up, as it were-we will at some later stage seek avenues to explore precisely what the Government has in mind in this regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Puplick's final remarks were significant. In a sense, the Government has offered a commitment. The Australian Democrats say that at the moment, prior to, hopefully, the passage of this amendment, there is nothing in place. There is no commitment; there is a vacuum. Senator Jenkins, having participated quite significantly in two homebirths as the birthing parent, has some commitment to this amendment-as do various others of us for other reasons. We do not believe that failure to support this amendment can be excused on the basis that it is a motion developed on the run-if you like, housebirth rather than homebirth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If it is an issue which is of concern to the Opposition, equally as it is to the Democrats, the Opposition would be able to understand the process that is at work here. If you like, it is democracy in action. There is a proposal before the Senate to fill a very important vacuum. It is one that ought to be supported on the basis that it fills that vacuum in a significant way. As Senator Puplick has said, it is a commitment. It may not be the commitment which the Democrats sought to get at the beginning but it is certainly one on which we are prepared to build. Indeed, I understand from Senator Puplick's remarks that the Opposition will be prepared to build on it. Therefore, it is a good foundation for the future of homebirths in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make the Government's position plain in view of what has been said. I agree with the summary that has been given by Senator Powell. The Government is acknowledging that contained in the original Australian Democrat amendment is an ideal worthy of endorsement. It is to that proposal that we have brought forward this form of words which we believe enables us to do that. We believe there is indeed a need to see a wider range of birthing options for women. That includes the issue of homebirths and that there are a number of elements associated with that other than simply the question of whether the cost of the midwife's attendance can be a Medicare deduction. It is best to deal with all of those things such as safety, admittance to State hospitals and so on comprehensively. It is that proposal we accept and we see the amendment in that light.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Puplick has raised a series of questions which are a detailed examination of a number of elements of how this arrangement would work in practice. He has said that, unless he has an answer to those queries, he cannot be sure what sort of animal he is being asked to buy at the auction here. He therefore declines to bid and will vote against the amendment. I think that is a fair summation of Senator Puplick's position. None of those questions was answered by the amendment which he had full notice of, that is, the Democrats' original amendment. We do not propose to answer those issues here. But we hope to meet Senator Puplick's expectations a little further down the track when we develop the essence of this proposal. </PARA>

We have before the Senate a health Bill, the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989. The Australian Democrats have put forward some rubbishy amendment and the Minister asks that we respond spontaneously. I have never heard such drivel in all my life. The Minister has not costed the proposal, as Senator Boswell so rightly says. The Minister has no idea what he is letting the Government in for, no idea of the commitment he proposes to give. He does not know whether he is making a commitment to the midwife or a commitment to the mother. He does not know what he is doing. He merely says, `Let's act spontaneously'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">=m by leave-Senator Coulter has proposed three amendments to the motion which I originally moved for the establishment of a select committee and for the terms of reference of that select committee. I indicate that the Opposition will agree to the amendments proposed by Senator Coulter to my original motion. Essentially, they are to add a term of reference requiring the Senate select committee to investigate the level of government support for private health insurance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> They split the reference of the various matters to the proposed select committee in the following fashion. They require the select committee to deal with clause 10 of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 and associated matters, which are those relating to the vocational register and to the reimbursement arrangements for general practitioners, and to report on that question by the first sitting day in August 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the more detailed term of reference, term of reference (d) regarding the effectiveness of the current health insurance industry structure and a series of particulars, the amendment requires that that report from the select committee be presented on the first sitting day in March 1990. The Committee, once established, would have an immediate task to discharge, the report on clause 10 and the general practitioners arrangement, and would be required to report on the first sitting day in August. It would then have an ongoing remit, as the Americans so quaintly say, to deal with the question of health insurance and to report back in March 1990.

But we will provide that clause 10 commences on a date to be fixed by proclamation. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps I can simplify all that by putting it into plain English. This part of the legislation, having now, by the previous resolution of the Senate, been referred to the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance, deals with the establishment of the vocational register and the establishment of a differential payment for general practitioners as to whether they are on the vocational register. Our amendment will provide that although having been passed this section of the Act shall not come into effect until the Senate, firstly, has received the report of the Senate Select Committee which has to be provided by the first sitting day in August and, secondly, has considered that report and decided by resolution to bring section 2 into operation. If the Senate does not pass that resolution section 10 of this Act cannot be proclaimed. As a result, the vocational register and differential payment for general practitioners on the basis of whether they are on the register will not come into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a device which means that the Bill passes, but its proclamation is delayed until the Senate takes positive action in order to bring that into effect. It cannot come into effect by mere effluxion of time. It cannot come into effect simply because the Senate has received a report or, indeed, has debated that report. It can only come into effect when a resolution of the Senate has been passed bringing it into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> When we come to clause 10 I will have a fair bit to say about the question of the vocational register and the Government's proposed scheme. I will indicate why it is that we have fundamental concerns about that. The proposed amendment to clause 2 provides the delay mechanism which once inserted will prevent this coming into effect until some time after the report of the committee. As a result, two things flow. In the first instance, the committee must report. In the second instance, the Government must provide the time and the opportunity for the Senate to debate that report and to decide by resolution whether clause 10 in the printed form, which we now have in the Bill, or in some amended form as a result of the recommendations of the Committee, comes into effect. To save the time of the Senate this evening I indicate that we have had a look at the proposed amendment foreshadowed by the Australian Democrats which alters certain words and adds words to our amendment. The Democrats' amendment proposes to omit the words `approves a report from the Senate Select Committee' and insert `having concluded debate on the Report of the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance on section 10 of this Act, approves proposed new sections . . .'. I indicate that the foreshadowed amendment by the Australian Democrats is acceptable to the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have some slight difficulty with the words `approves a report' in the Opposition's proposed amendment. Normally reports are not necessarily approved but are received and, after debate, may or may not be approved. That is the reason for changing the wording to `debate on the report'. Clearly, the report may contain material which the Senate may accept or accept in part.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address some remarks to clause 10, which deals with the establishment of the vocational register and the differential rebates for general practitioners. I ask the Minister to answer specifically a question that Senator Peter Baume raised in his address during the second reading stage. I ask him squarely: How does a system of differential rebates paid to general practitioners assist patients? Also, can the Minister tell me when the Government will respond to the recommendations of the Doherty report? The Doherty report has been raised at some length in debates this evening, and in particular in a very perceptive address in the second reading debate by Senator Patterson. The Doherty report, which was entitled Australian Medical Education and Workforce into the 21st Century, dealt with the question of continuing medical education. I read the following extracts in relation to this matter from pages xix and xx of the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Medical Education and Medical Workforce:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Committee gave extensive consideration to the proposal that vocational training for general practice should be made mandatory. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to discuss certain matters and states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee sees risks in creating what might become a disenfranchised class of registered medical graduates who are neither general practitioners nor specialists, and recognises possible cost pressures for higher fees for `specialist' general practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee sees the mandatory concept as potentially inflexible for several groups of practitioners, including specialists reverting to general practice, graduates switching from other specialist training program and for those returning to the work force after career interruption. It also believes that the mandatory concept would present difficulties for many graduates, for example, in hospital positions, wishing to undertake part-time general practice such as locum tenens appointments. </PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly the Committee recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA> 8 (v) Mandatory vocational training and special registration of general practitioners not be introduced at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA>I appreciate that the Doherty report is talking about mandatory vocational training and the Government is talking, it says, essentially about voluntary vocational training. There is certainly a difference. But quite clearly, the issue of the extent to which the financial pressures become almost mandatory for those seeking career advancement is one which the Government has not addressed. So we have two questions, and I will come back to them in a moment: firstly, how do differential rebates to general practitioners assist patients; and secondly, when will the Government respond to the recommendations of the Doherty report?</PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the analysis which I believe correctly identifies the fundamental weakness in this vocational register. I will quote at some length the comments made in the House of Representatives on 25 May 1989 by my colleague Dr Michael Wooldridge, the member for Chisholm. Dr Wooldridge stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The worst thing about this proposal is the closed shop nature of it. Prior to my entering Parliament I was involved in discussions as a representative of the younger doctors with members of the College, with the Family Medicine Program (FMP) and the Australian Medical Association (AMA), and I can tell the Minister that after all those discussions representatives would tell me that what this was really about was the hope that one day they could control medical manpower in general practice. What they want to do is put up a hurdle that is so great that it will stop people entering general practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has talked about what happens overseas. He has told the House that in Canada this happens and in England this happens. I would like to tell him what the Doherty report said. This was a report the Minister commissioned. I am sure he knows it. In the United Kingdom: four years training including registration. This is compulsory. I am referring to page 267 of the report. In New Zealand: voluntary, one year. In the United States: voluntary, three years. In Canada: voluntary, two years. What are we doing in Australia? Involuntary, six to seven years; and that is what it is, because we have one year internship with proposals around the States to make it two, and to become a Fellow of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners it is now five years. These conditions are not applied anywhere else in the world. This scheme will reduce the number of women that can do that sort of training, just like the College of Surgeons has done, and the Government will consign to the scrapheap some of the most idealistic and capable young people that this country has. </PARA>
<PARA>I put it to you, Madam Temporary Chairman, that no country has proposed this length of service. Allegations about the Swedish system have yet to be substantiated by anything that the Government can bring forward in terms of the training which is required for qualification for entry into the scheme after it starts in its new form and after those who are already practising have been grandfathered-which is the stated term-into this scheme. As Dr Bryce Phillips, the Federal President of the Australian Medical Association, has said, in many respects the scheme is a blank cheque for more government control of the medical profession. It has been introduced with virtually no consultation within the wider medical profession. The Government has negotiated solely with a small select group of negotiators within the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners which represents only a small proportion of those upon whom the changes will impact. We made the point earlier today that a large number of general practitioners do not support what the College has allegedly done on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> This scheme will split general practitioners into two distinct groups: those who are registered-and therefore their patients will receive a higher rebate-and those who are not. I want to indicate the discriminatory nature of that operation. I quote from a paper circulated to honourable senators which was prepared by a number of recent younger graduates-Dr Zelle Hodge from Brisbane; Dr Rod Macrae from Melbourne; Dr Amanda McBride from Sydney; and Dr Ann Geschke from Melbourne. They say in their paper-I propose to read a fair bit of it-that the legislation strikes hardest at some of the groups in society most susceptible to the effects of financial hardship, including women, children, country people, university students and the terminally ill. The paper states:</PARA>
<PARA>Women patients are demanding women doctors. This is supported by the Federal Government's own National Women's Health Policy released in March 1989 at the Australian Health Ministers Conference. However, this legislation will discriminate against women practising medicine as General Practitioners, both in the training requirements which go far beyond the accepted overseas training requirements, and basic hours worked per week before eligibility, for the Vocational Register. </PARA>
<PARA> This means that the patients (that is women and children) of these women doctors will be financially disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Crowley indicates her support for that further disadvantage against women and children in Australia. The paper continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, discrimination will exist against those doctors that practise in areas of: women's health, breast and cervical cancer screening, and family planning clinics. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, this is also discrimination against women patients requiring these health and medical services. </PARA>
<PARA> Women patients are demanding women doctors yet the length of training precludes many women from a long-term career commitment in medicine after six years undergraduate and five years post-graduate training. Discriminated Patient Groups in the wider community include:</PARA>
<PARA> Country Patients . . . accessibility to registered doctors</PARA>
<PARA> Lower socio-economic groups may not have access to doctors on the Vocational Register</PARA>
<PARA> Ethnic patients e.g. a Vietnamese community, may not have access to doctors on the Vocational Register. </PARA>

<PARA>It gives the example that, where a doctor practises and has two sessions per week as a general practitioner, he or she may be accredited by the college, but if three sessions, for example in women's health, are added, these are classified as not being predominantly in general practice and are, therefore, not accredited. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Crowley were paid on the basis of her net worth she would be a pauper. Patients and doctors will be disadvantaged under this legislation by government fiat on the basis of whether they are on a vocational register, as designed by a cosy agreement between the College and the Government on this matter. The Opposition believes that these are the sorts of issues which should be examined in some depth in the Senate Committee inquiry, and the evidence will speak for itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Earlier today Senator Crowley made a very interesting remark about Senate committees. She said this reference was being `dumped on Senate committees'. They were her words. She said she understood that the role of a Senate committee was to take its riding instructions from the Government. That is typical of the way in which elements of the Labor Party think Senate committees ought to work. They think they are there simply as flunkies for the Government of the day. According to Senator Crowley, given that Senate committees have a majority of Government members, they should have their terms of reference given to them only by the Government. We know the way in which Caucus operates. We know that Senator Crowley would no more criticise her factional colleague Dr Blewett than she would make a serious contribution to a public health debate. She has expressed the attitude that the proposed Senate inquiry should not be established because the Government has not given it its terms of reference. That is precisely what the Opposition believes the Senate Committee ought to do: it ought to look at all things including those which are a potential embarrassment to the Government, to see where the facts lead. The facts will speak for themselves if the Senate Committee is given the opportunity, as it will be, of dealing with this very complicated but very important part of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore conclude this part of my discussion of clause 10 by asking the Minister again: How will the differential rebates paid to general practitioners assist patients? When can we expect a response to the recommendations in the Doherty report?</PARA>

He said, however, that in order to protect doctors already engaged in general practice, other qualifications and training would be accepted in the meantime, including membership of the college, a certificate of satisfactory completion of the family medicine program, or five years experience in general practice. He said that this would ensure that doctors who are currently in practice would be able to qualify for the register on the basis of experience before the tighter requirements come into effect.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Puplick asked two questions and made a number of comments about his version of reality concerning the Government's proposal. Senator Coulter's entreaty was that since these matters are to be canvassed at length by the Committee, we should not dally at this hour of the night, given the legislative program that we have. My heart strings are certainly pulled towards Senator Coulter's position because I would like to see us dispose of this legislation as quickly as possible.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just one.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walters has asked one question. While absolutely disposed to Senator Coulter's position-he asked a pertinent question-the debate should not move on until I have at least responded to some of the things Senator Puplick has said. As I have pointed out, he made a number of observations. I should go into some detail about his claim that what we are proposing to do here is far more stringent than what might be done in other comparable countries. On that point, the changes we are proposing are consistent with overseas practice and developments. As I have said constantly throughout this debate, there is no compulsion for general practitioners (GPs) to undergo further training. The minimum requirement remains: undergraduate medical training for five or six years plus an intern year and, currently, the family medicine program is four years-two in a hospital plus two others. There is scope for improved efficiency and discussions are under way with the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) to reduce it to three years, which, after an examination, could in future years lead to fellowship of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. The three years voluntary training that we are proposing compares with three years compulsory vocational training in general practice in the United Kingdom for anyone wishing to enter sole practice or partnership. Of course, few GPs are salaried. In Canada there is two years of voluntary training-compulsory only in Quebec, but other provinces are moving that way-with some three-year training places and pressure for general extension to three years. Though training is voluntary, it is increasingly difficult for doctors without such training to establish themselves. For example, hospital accreditation is difficult without postgraduate training. In the United States of America there is three years voluntary training, but most family physicians now undergo such training. Establishing oneself without such training is increasingly difficult.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I conclude this round-up of allegedly less stringent overseas requirements by mentioning New Zealand. In New Zealand, there is one year of voluntary training, but the New Zealand Medical Council has recently introduced an indicative register for GPs who demonstrate competence and training. Current requirements are demonstrated competence and five years experience, three of which must be in general practice. From 1990, doctors will have to be members of the Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners, which involves passing an examination. So, given that quick circuit of the world, I do not think it can be said that what we are proposing in our legislation is more stringent. Indeed, I think the reverse can be said. </PARA>
<PARA> Allegations about discrimination figured in many of the speeches in the second reading debate. Indeed, I remember Senator Knowles making a big play about this in her contribution to the debate. It arises again in this debate. The first allegation is that the package discriminates against women doctors. These claims mainly relate to the alleged difficulties for part time doctors. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) will accept two sessions in one practice as meeting its requirements for experience in general practice. It already provides training programs based on part time availability for its fellowship. Doctors who are ineligible or who choose not to apply will still have access to existing GP items. The recent South Australian survey conducted jointly by the South Australian Government, the Australian Medical Association and the RACGP found that 67 per cent of female GPs had some family medicine program training, compared with 35 per cent of males, and that female GPs report attending significantly more formal education meetings than their male counterparts. I believe that female doctors may find it easier to meet some of the requirements and do not appear to be unable to do training or continuing medical education. So I do not accept that the package discriminates against women doctors. </PARA>
<PARA> It has also been alleged that the legislation discriminates against doctors, mainly women, specialising in family planning, sports medicine, women's health and student health. Doctors will be assessed on training, experience and the type of practice. If their clinical practice is predominantly a general practice, they will be eligibile, provided that they have the necessary experience and training. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the other question of discrimination-the argument that rural doctors will be disadvantaged. The RACGP will accept certain experience in country hospitals as experience in general practice, thus advantaging rural doctors over their city counterparts. Continuing medical education and quality assessment programs are largely designed around self-directed learning-for example, videos, self-assessment Viatel patient surveys and practice management surveys, which are readily accessible to rural doctors. If there is a shortage of doctors in rural areas, non-enrolled doctors have nothing to fear from competition from those who are enrolled. </PARA>
<PARA> To complete the round-up of the discrimination arguments, I turn to the question of whether patients of non-enrolled doctors will be disadvantaged. The answer is: only if their doctors move to the new fees. Public education awareness and competition from vocationally registered doctors is the best countermeasure to this. The Government will launch a substantial education publicity program to ensure that all patients understand these new arrangements. So, on that basis, I do not think it can be argued, as it is in this debate, that the alleged discrimination will exist. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now turn to the questions that Senator Puplick has explicitly put to me and which were also raised by Senator Peter Baume. I regret that I did not hear Senator Peter Baume's speech; I would have liked to. As I took it down, Senator Puplick's first question was: How does the system of differential rebates assist patients? The second question which I took down was: When will the Government respond to the Doherty report-the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Medical Education and Medical Workforce? I take question one first. In the debate over these issues the Government has been at pains to stress that these proposals would promote a better quality of patient care. That is one of the positive advantages. The proposals will provide an opportunity for general practitioners to spend some time with their patients and should result in reduced requirement for the expensive ordering of diagnostic tests and pharmaceuticals and for unnecessary referrals. From that point of view it can be well and truly argued that the proposals before the chamber would assist patients greatly. </PARA>
<PARA> As to Senator Puplick's second question, on the Doherty report, the truth is that the Government is responding to the report. Many of the recommendations, as Senator Puplick knows, are properly the province of State governments and/or require State and Federal Government cooperation for their implementation. For those reasons, the Commonwealth has referred the Doherty report to the States. Some of the recommendations have been dealt with at the Australian Conference of Health Ministers. The need for two years vocational training, for example, is one of the issues that have been raised there. The Doherty report did not recommend mandatory training for medical practitioners and what the Government is proposing is along the lines of the report. We are responding in this way to the Doherty report. We are working through the recommendations in that manner. </PARA>
<PARA> I trust I have provided adequate answers to the questions that have been raised but I take the point of Senator Coulter that now that the proposals are being sent off to a committee-and that is not the Government's desire; it is the Opposition's desire-it seems a waste of the chamber's time to canvass them. </PARA>

As I have taken it down, the question was: Where are the eligibility criteria in the Bill? The Bill provides that doctors will be registered if the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners certifies that they have appropriate training and experience in general practice. The criteria to be used by the RACGP are in the agreement with the Government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Resources obviously has said, `Okay, it is not in the Bill; it is just an agreement between the College of General Practitioners and the Government'. I have not seen it. None of the honourable senators on this side of the chamber have seen an agreement. We do not vote on an agreement; we vote on legislation. There is nothing in this legislation that mentions an agreement. There is nothing in this legislation that sets out criteria that the college abides by. I do not see how the Government can expect the Senate to vote on an agreement between the college and the Government instead of voting on legislation. If the Minister says that we should just accept an agreement unseen which the Government referred to in the second reading speech of the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett), I believe it is a first for this Senate. I have never seen legislation put to us before that does not give details of how the legislation will be carried out. Again, I ask the Minister: can he tell me in clause 3f (6) (b) what are the regulations? Are the regulations already framed? Is the Senate entitled to see the regulations before we pass legislation that says that a general practitioner, so long as he is an applicant and is in accordance with the regulations of eligibility for registration, is all right? How on earth do we know it is all right? Can we see the regulations? If they are not ready, when will they be ready?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I asked the Minister in my speech-he may have answered but I may have missed it-to provide details of the auditing and monitoring procedures and the structure of what is to be called, I think, the Independent Peer Review Organisation. I do not seem to have received any of those details. I know that Senator Coulter said that this is going to a committee but I may not have the pleasure of being on that committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also have concerns about people's eligibility for programs such as the family medicine program. I wish to give an example of a young medical graduate in Melbourne who wanted to participate in the family medicine program as a trainee. She had a number of years at a hospital and thought that she was interested in doing plastic surgery. She realised that this was going to take an enormous amount of time. She had a priority of having a family so she decided she would go into general practice. On approaching the family medicine program she was told that because of the length of time she had spent in a public hospital she was not, therefore-I am quoting her; I rang her again today just to check-a dedicated general practitioner because she had started off on a surgery program. </PARA>
<PARA> If this is the sort of thing that is going to go on and people are not going to be eligible for the family medicine program, we will have a group of people who will not be able to reach the standard required to get the higher rebate because they are deemed by those people in the family medicine program as not being `dedicated general practitioners' because they had a change of heart in their career structure. The Minister may not answer that question at the moment but I am sure it is a question that will be raised by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to ask the questions on notice that I gave the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) earlier this afternoon. My first question was: will the Minister advise the average and, if possible, the standard deviation of the number of consultations undertaken by trainees during family medicine program rotations in supervised general practice? It was indicated to me outside by one of the advisers that they may not be able to give me this figure. But I have a figure here which was provided under the freedom of information provisions to a general practitioner in Melbourne on the number of general practitioners who had been in the family medicine program rotation. I think I mentioned in my speech that some of those trainees had on average seen 8.5 patients per week and others had seen 129 patients per week. It seems to me that there is no supervision under the system of looking at a practice when it is selected as a practice for family medicine trainees to see whether it has a sufficient number of patients or a sufficient case load to provide the trainees with an adequate general practice. One of the other questions I asked on notice was, `Does the family medicine program use Health Insurance Commission payments as a tool to monitor and identify those practices whose case load is such that they may not provide training for general practice experience?'. </PARA>
<PARA> Again I have another example of another general practitioner in Melbourne who was actually in a family medicine program and complained about the treatment that the person was receiving in the placement. A representative from the family medicine program said, `We have already had complaints about this doctor'-I do not know how the doctors are chosen for these trainee appointments-`but we were short on teaching staff, short on people to take on as trainee practitioners, so we kept using him'. This doctor refused to go out when a trainee was dealing with a patient with cardiac arrest. The trainee rang and said, `I believe this patient is dying. I have rung an ambulance. Will you come?'. The doctor said no. This is a person who is being paid a family medicine program allowance, who is reaping the benefit of the rebate the students bring in, and he refused to come. There was no supervision from the family medicine program of the quality of training being provided. The trainee rang concerned about the level of treatment she would be able to give, and what help did she get? None. Finally, when she rang again the doctor came.</PARA>
<PARA> I also ask the Minister whether he can advise as to the average weekly payment and the minimum and maximum weekly payments received by supervising practitioners from the Health Insurance Commission for services rendered by family medicine program trainees. I also ask: What is the direct subsidy payment per week provided directly by the family medicine program to supervising doctors for each trainee? Another question one ought to ask is: How are these doctors who are supervising trainees chosen and selected and what basis do they have for the responsibility they are given for training young practitioners?</PARA>

There is no intention to introduce any regulations at this time. But regulations would be tabled in the Senate if they were introduced later. Whether the regulations come forward may depend on the inquiry that the Opposition has voted for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the question of the details of the arrangements between the Government and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP), I have before me a copy of a document called Raising the Standard: General Practice and Quality Patient Care-an agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners dated 2 March this year. I am advised that details of this agreement have been sent twice, once by the Government and once by the RACGP, to all general practitioners in Australia. The document I have is a working document but I will arrange for a copy of it to be delivered to Senator Walters forthwith. I might point out that it is available generally. My remarks about general practitioners in my earlier answer are the same as I would make with reference to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Patterson said that she advised me of her intention to raise certain questions. She indeed came to see me and said that she would raise some questions in her speech. I alerted the Department of Community Services and Health. She asked her questions through the duty Minister at the time, Senator Button. Let me answer Senator Patterson's four questions directly. I am advised that the information sought in her first question is not available currently. I will undertake to acquire it as soon as I possibly can and provide her with it. Neither the Department nor the Health Insurance Commission has a comprehensive list of the names of trainees from which this information could be derived. </PARA>

Again, neither the Department nor the Health Insurance Commission has a comprehensive list of the names of supervising practitioners from which the information could be derived.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Turning to the third question, I understand that the subsidy comprises two parts; namely, a salary subsidy to assist the training practice in paying the salary for training, and a teaching allowance to the supervising practitioner if he is involved for a minimum of 3 1/2 hours a week in direct contact teaching. These allowances are provided for in the contract of grant between the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Commonwealth. The actual amounts are negotiated within maximum amounts set down in the agreement. The amounts for salary subsidies are: first placement, for up to 13 weeks, up to $325 a week; second placement, for up to 13 weeks, up to $275 a week; and third placement, for up to 13 weeks, up to $175 a week. The teaching allowance is up to $200 a week. I cannot recall what Senator Patterson's fourth question was, but the one answer that I have for that question is no. I hope that adequately answers that question. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will remind the Minister of the question I asked because it is very important: Does the family medicine program use Health Insurance Commission payments as a tool to monitor and identify those practices whose case loads are such that they may not provide trainees with adequate general practice experience? I have received a copy of a sample of group trainee practitioners, acquired under freedom of information-I think it took 10 weeks-which showed a minimum number of consultations under a general category of approximately 8.5 a week and a maximum of 129 a week. I would begin to be concerned-and the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) ought to be concerned-if, as Minister, I were paying a family medicine program subsidy for a salary and a teaching allowance in respect of a general practitioner who was seeing eight patients a week. Those doctors would be better off in a casualty outpatients department seeing patients with cuts and bruises, coughs and colds and whatever else than seeing eight patients a week in a general practice. From my inquiries, it seems to me that all one needs to be a family medicine program supervisor is a vacant room-he must have a vacant brain as well, I think-to which the trainee can go. Not much else seems to be required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are objective ways of measuring the experience that trainees get. One is to look at the number of consultations and the amount of rebate that the trainee brings in. In some cases the trainee sees zilch, and in other cases he sees 129 patients a week. If a practice is as busy as that, I wonder what supervision is going on. It may be that we should look at the one in the middle where there is at least some time for the general practitioner to discuss with the trainee the patients that he has seen. That was the question I asked. </PARA>
<PARA> The other question that the Minister has avoided-I am sorry to harp on this-is: what were the details of the auditing and monitoring procedures for the so-called Independent Peer Review Organisation? I have received some material-I do not know where it came from, but it has been coming into my office unofficially at a rate of knots-concerning a committee that has three Royal Australian College of General Practitioners members, one medical person from another medical organisation recommended by the RACGP and one or two other medicos. According to the material, the committee can co-opt people but they do not have voting rights, a quorum will be formed by the RACGP members and the majority vote will have to be that of the RACGP members. The Minister calls it an Independent Peer Review Organisation. If the Minister cannot provide us with that document--</PARA>

Mr Temporary Chairman, this morning you discussed the decline in and the problems associated with higher education.

If the Minister and any of his advisers sitting over there have had anything to do with tertiary institutions and rotations for clinical practice they would know that it is time consuming and difficult to organise students for country and city placements. There is not enough money to do it. Senator Crowley is asking why we are involved, why we are concerned. The Government has not interfered with the registration of obstetricians and gynaecologists, with the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, or with the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These peer review arrangements will inevitably involve auditors having some access to patient records, as do other peer review processes already operating in hospitals and supported by the Australian Medical Association and other professional medical groups. The proposals provide substantial safeguards to protect patient confidentiality. That is a matter that Senator Patterson raised. Those safeguards include a requirement that the procedures of the IPRO should be acceptable to the profession as a whole. The audit report would remain confidential to the practitioner and to the Independent Peer Review Organisation. Notification of any problems would cover only the broad general cause of concern and not identify specifics. The IPRO would be required to ensure the confidentiality of all patient information. Auditors would be from a different region and would not have ongoing contact with the practice. As I have said, legislation is necessary to implement the proposals and the Parliament would have the opportunity to ensure that it scrutinised that legislation. I hope that answers the question.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While the Minister is getting that information I draw attention to a couple of matters which arise from his previous answers. I think they reveal the validity of having decided that this matter should be sent to a Senate committee for further investigation. In essence, the Minister has told us that the Government proposes to introduce a scheme the basis of which is a working paper. It is not even a negotiated, concluded formalised agreement; it is a working paper which has allegedly been circulated to all sorts of general practitioners. Needless to say, this chamber, asked to vote on this legislation, has not had the courtesy of being provided with copies of that agreement or working paper. Senator Walters has asked for a copy. Undoubtedly, she will be provided with one, and I hope that courtesy will be extended to all senators who have taken part in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is little surprise on this side of the chamber at the enthusiasm with which Senator Cook is commending this closed shop agreement. That is what it amounts to. I understand the warm inner glow which Senator Cook has for closed shop agreements, negotiated with the Government by a particular minority in one field of medicine to the exclusion of other parts of the medical community, to the exclusion of some of the other general practitioners and, of course, to the exclusion of the proper interests of patients. It will be recalled that Senator Cook did not in any sense answer the question which I put to him as to what is the benefit to individual patients. He said that this was a matter of promoting better quality patient care. We do not promote better patient care simply by paying some doctors more than others unless the Government is prepared to accept the corollary of that proposal; namely, that those people who are provided with medical services by people who are not vocationally registered, for whatever reason, should accept that they are being provided with lower quality health care. That is the corollary of the proposition which the Minister has put to us this evening. We have not had an answer to Senator Walters's fundamental question as to why people in the sort of situation she described would bother constituting themselves into a general practice anyway in terms of the arrangements which the Government is now putting before us. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Minister has not been prepared to indicate to the chamber the full details of the Independent Peer Review Organisation. We are all in possession of a document entitled `Independent Peer Review Organisation-Operating Principles'. The Minister should either tell us that this is a forgery, a bogus document, a nonsense document, or the basis upon which the auditing and monitoring functions will be carried out. If it is the latter, the Minister should table it and make it part of the formal public record so that we can debate it; otherwise, we will go through the charade of people reading out sections of the document claiming that they represent the concluded agreement or that they are operating principles. The Minister should tell us what it is. We all have the document. There is no great mystery about it. If the Minister is not prepared to table it, we will table it. He should tell us whether the concerns which have been raised about the way in which certain principles will operate are legitimate. He should tell us what the Government says these particular matters are. He should come clean with the answer to the question Senator Patterson has raised so that we will be able to make some progress, otherwise we will go through the process this evening of having a look at these 25 principles. It will be like drawing teeth. The Minister should tell us what they are. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Puplick made a speech in which he said I would find happiness, joy, or some cosiness or whatever, in a closed shop arrangement. I do not accept the allegation that the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners is a minority organisation, which I think was the term used by Senator Puplick. Most specialists in Australia gain recognition for having fellowships in the relevant college. Medical colleges determine the training requirements and examination standards. The RACGP is the appropriate body for the determination of standards for general practitioners. I do not accept that it is a minority body. It is the proper and relevant body. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick referred to a document and foreshadowed a lengthy teeth drawing exercise. If he wants to go on an excursion, we can do so, but I repeat what the Government has said about this document. It is not a final document. It is not a binding document. It is not a document which is intended to constitute a body of law or on which legal principles are drawn. It is a discussion document and, as a discussion document, it sets forward a proposal for discussion. Because it does that the Government intends to continue that discussion and bring it back to the Senate at an appropriate time-I may be wrong in this; the officers in the advisers' box can indicate if I am-possibly around October this year for legislation in the Budget session. It will be dealt with in that way. Here we are, with all due respect, ascribing to a document more than what the document is. To do that would be to commit a grievous sin, albeit we could still go through the teeth drawing exercise. </PARA>

Senator Walters says, `For heaven's sake, why do you not provide them to the Senate? Why does the Government require the appeals to be there?'. My understanding is that it may well be beyond the legal authority of the Commonwealth to compel the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners to provide that mechanism. I am advised that the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners will provide a form of appeal. If Senator Walters is asking me to compel the College, I raise the defence that maybe it is beyond our legal competence to do that.

Proposed new section 3g quite clearly identifies the role of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, which is to advise the General Manager, who is essentially the registrar, who keeps the list.

I say no more than has been said in here tonight. The Minister made light of Senator Patterson's point earlier when she said that the Government was dealing with a minority group. That is perfectly true, but the Minister denied it. There are 3,000 members of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and about 13,000 general practitioners in Australia. By far the greater majority disagree entirely with what the Government is doing here. The Government is putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that it is the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners that will be the authorising body. However, with the stroke of a pen and just by gazetting it, the Government can change the authorising body and go to any other independent body that it chooses.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with the Government Whip, Senator Jones, in the message of condolence to the parents of Michael Anderson. The matter about which I wish to speak tonight is the future use of the Bruce Stadium. I have spoken on this matter before in this chamber, most recently on 4 May 1989 when I asked a number of questions about the ownership of the Bruce Stadium and in whose custody it presently lies. I have not received any answers to the questions I raised at that time, which is somewhat disappointing. I also point out that at that time I incorporated a statement of the then Minister for the Arts and Territories, Mr Holding, which indicated that the firm of Price Waterhouse had been engaged to negotiate a financial agreement with the Canberra Raiders. I ask whether the Government has that document, and whether it will be made available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today, the Deputy Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory put out a press statement and held a press conference in which he gave the ACT Government's support for the proposal to redevelop the Bruce Stadium to enable the Raiders to use it as their home ground. I certainly do not oppose the Raiders coming to Canberra but I believe that the people of the ACT are entitled to more information than has been given at the present time about the facility. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>The ACT is gaining a $40 million asset which we will develop into a first-class multi-use sporting venue. </PARA>
<PARA>The question that now needs to be answered by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) is whether the stadium is a gift to the ACT Government or whether it is an asset being transferred for $40m or for some other amount. If it is not a gift, what are the terms under which it is being transferred?</PARA>
<PARA> This afternoon the Deputy Chief Minister apparently indicated that the Australian Institute of Sport would be entering into a lease with the Bruce Stadium Trust, which will be established to manage the stadium. I also ask the Minister for Administrative Services: When was the property transferred to the Australian Institute of Sport and what arrangement does the Australian Institute of Sport, the head lessee, have with the Bruce Stadium Trust?</PARA>
<PARA> I wrote to the Minister for Administrative Services on 5 June, as I had received no response to the speech I made on 4 May. I asked him what was happening, what the arrangements were for ownership and whether the stadium was to be transferred to the Australian Capital Territory Government as a gift, an encumbered gift or by way of a sale. I also wrote to the Deputy Chief Minister on 5 June asking him questions about the arrangements. I have not had an answer from him either. It is important for the people of the Australian Capital Territory to fully understand the financial arrangements. The Bruce Stadium will need to bring in a considerable amount of revenue to pay for the money that will be borrowed to redevelop it. As has been indicated by the Deputy Chief Minister, it will be operating on full commercial principles. If it is not able to operate in that fashion, who will make up the shortfall? It seems to me that it would be a fairly expensive facility for any other group to lease, so that will have an impact on the amount of revenue that can be raised. </PARA>
<PARA> The other questions which are still outstanding are: What will happen to the Northbourne oval? What arrangements will be made for improving road access to Bruce Stadium and the parking facilities there? I have no doubt that, when the Raiders play there, massive crowds will be wanting to attend, and I will be amongst them. But the present arrangements for parking in that area are putting enormous stress on the facilities when the indoor stadium is crowded with 5,000 spectators watching a Cannons match. The cost of upgrading road access and parking in the area will need to be taken into account sooner or later. Is it being included in the redevelopment costs or is that an additional cost? How much of this will ACT taxpayers be paying?</PARA>
<PARA> As I have said-and I stress this-my interest in this matter is in no way concerned with trying to keep out the Raiders as there are significant benefits to Canberra in having them based here. But I think we are entitled to know about these matters. The ACT Government, since it was formed, has frequently stressed that there will be open government and that we will know what is happening. But at present I think both Federal and ACT Ministers have failed to give the people of Canberra the information they are entitled to. </PARA>

It is significant that, when Senator Zakharov tabled the document, she overlooked the fact that it was prepared by Mr Cooper and that, by and large, the document is a response by Mr Cooper to criticisms contained in the minority report of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts of Mr Cooper and the veracity of his evidence. If honourable senators examine the document they will see at the bottom of it that it is written by Mr David Cooper; otherwise they would not know that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In large measure the minority report produced Committee evidence which is contradictory to Mr Cooper's views. In my view, the document produced by David Cooper is nothing more than a self-serving instrument designed to vindicate the views he upholds and the evidence that he gave to the Committee. In my view, the document is a distortion of the facts. It reeks of bias, it is riddled with illogical conclusions and it is so confused in its reasoning that it leads one to conclude that it is written without regard for the truth. The first major paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA>As is a common occurrence with standing committee reports, the tabled document included a dissenting report by Senators Crichton-Browne, McGauran and Panizza, which is highly critical of the majority findings of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is palpable nonsense. The minority report's recommendations are based on the evidence and it is not critical-let alone highly critical-of the majority report. </PARA>
<PARA> The document entitled On Shaky Ground, written by David Cooper, is a criticism of the minority report written by Senators Crichton-Browne, McGauran and Panizza in respect of the potential of the Kakadu National Park region. I find remarkable the fact that Cooper supports much of his document by referring to his own evidence or his own writings. I might say that I hardly find that persuasive evidence. For instance, Cooper tells us in 1:</PARA>
<PARA>Coronation Hill lies within an area known to the Jawoyn people as the ``Sickness Country''. The Sickness Country derives its significance from an important and dangerous creation Being Buladeno (Bula) whose spiritual essence pervades the landscape. Jawoyn custodians fear that disturbance of Bula by activities such as mining will result in apocolyptic destruction . . . </PARA>
<PARA>On that occasion, Cooper refers to his own evidence. I make no particular judgment about the relevance of the sickness country. However, what Mr Cooper does not disclose is that part of that sickness country was subject to a Jawoyn land claim in 1987. Mr Justice Kearney found, and I refer to parts 4 and 5:</PARA>
<PARA>The two senior claimants who spoke with knowledge of Areas 4 and 5, Peter Jatbula and Sandy Barraway, did not convey an impression of interest in those areas or of any strong attachment to them. While several sites in the vicinity of Areas 4 and 5 were named and their associated Dreamings identified, no evidence to establish common spiritual affiliations by the claimants of those sites or the performance or spiritual responsibilities for those sites was given in either open or closed sessions of the enquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say, inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA>However, the traditional evidence put forward in relation to Areas 4 and 5 is insufficient to enable any finding to be made that the members of that group (or any group, for that matter) are the traditional Aboriginal owners of those areas, within the meaning of the Act. While there are sites on both areas and Dreamings to which the Jawoyn have links . . . the existence of common spiritual affiliations to sites on Areas 4 and 5, or to sites which can be linked with those areas, is not established; nor is there evidence of a strong traditional attachment to Areas 4 and 5. Accordingly, the claim to Areas 4 and 5 fails. </PARA>
<PARA>That tells us that, in the view of the Land Commissioner, the claims were not of intrinsic value in respect of the criteria set down in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 for them to be granted as traditional land. In the next paragraph of this dissertation, we are told:</PARA>
<PARA> In 1985, custodians discovered exploration activity in progress at Coronation Hill, known to the Jawoyn as Guratba. Coronation Hill was subsequently registered as part of a large sacred site complex, the Upper South Alligator Bula Complex. </PARA>
<PARA>The truth is that the custodians did not discover exploration activity in progress at Coronation Hill. They were told that exploration activity was taking place by the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Authority. At this point Mr Cooper neglects to mention, although he did mention it later on because he had no choice, that it was he who was driving the motor vehicle, whose occupants were Larry Ah-Lin and Peter Jatbula, and that he drove them to Coronation Hill. In fact, Mr Cooper drove past an employee of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) down a dead-end road. When he returned, as inevitably he was bound to, he was asked by that employee who he was and the purpose of his business. He was at first reluctant to disclose who he was or the nature of his visit. Mr Jatbula, Mr Cooper and Mr Ah-Lin were subsequently escorted off BHP's property by the employee. </PARA>
<PARA> Cooper at that stage having identified himself and the names of the others and said that he was an employee of the Sacred Sites Authority, BHP then contacted the Coronation Hill joint venture operation office in Brisbane, which contacted the Sacred Sites Authority, which in turn advised that Mr Cooper was working in the Eva Valley area and that if he happened to be on Coronation Hill he was surely lost. Of course, the truth is that he had driven directly from Katherine to Coronation Hill. He was lost to the extent that he was driving down a dead-end road, but he certainly knew where he was trying to get to. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not suggest that there is anything sinister about that, but let us have the record honestly on the table. Mr Cooper's role in the decisions of the conduct of these matters ought to be seen for what it is. Clearly, Cooper took Jatbula and Ah-Lin out to Coronation Hill to see what exploration and prospecting was taking place. Mr Cooper tells us that the custodians brought exploration activity by BHP to a halt. Mr Cooper neglects to mention in his document that he attended the meeting of the Jawoyn people when they discussed BHP East Coronation Hill exploration on 1 July and that he addressed that meeting for 45 minutes, speaking in the most forceful, powerful and persuasive way that he knew possible, presumably to convince them that they ought not to agree to mining. We are further told in Cooper's document that:</PARA>
<PARA>The Dissenting Report, however, lacks any semblance of impartiality. It has been constructed so as to cast doubt on the credibility of the concerns of Jawoyn custodians about Coronation Hill and the Bula Sickness Country. To achieve this end the authors of the Dissenting Report have repeated discredited allegations regarding the views of senior custodians and the role and propriety of those statutory bodies charged with assisting custodians in preserving their traditions and religious beliefs. </PARA>
<PARA>There were not organisations; there was one organisation. He was talking about his own, the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Protection Authority. Although the report does not say so, Mr Cooper's name keeps appearing in footnotes. If Mr Cooper is saying that I personally questioned his propriety, for my part, I have to say frankly that I question his evidence and I find it, by definition on the evidence we have taken, not to be truthful. I will deal with that a little later on. Cooper's main complaint seems to be that the minority report does not take as gospel his word. He finds it offensive that the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts can be inexorably led to a conclusion on the basis of clear and precise evidence given to the Committee by the elders and custodians of the Jawoyn people. He says this about the minority report:</PARA>
<PARA>Instead it relies heavily on three controversial and problematic pieces of evidence, namely . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He then refers to evidence that was given to us relating to one Steven Davis, which was dealt with some nights ago by Senator Grant Tambling, so I shall not traverse that territory again. He also finds it offensive for us to find compelling evidence given to us, as he describes, `in camera' by the Jawoyn custodians-evidence `taken by the Senate Committee at Barunga on 9 March 1987'. He refers then to what he claims to be hearsay evidence of a meeting that took place at Barunga on 15 August 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of finding it offensive that we took cognisance of and drew conclusions from evidence given by the Jawoyn people to our Committee, I find it an absolute cheek for Mr Cooper to criticise the evidence given to the Committee by the elders simply because it is a piece of evidence that the Committee received first hand that does not agree with a view that he has put. It is not without significance that it contrasts with other material produced which is allegedly a contrary view of the Jawoyn people and which is helped in its preparation by Cooper in the name of the Jawoyn people. In the publication Cooper goes on to say, talking about the Barunga evidence:</PARA>
<PARA>The publication of these transcripts is highly prejudicial to the standing and credibility of the Aboriginal custodians concerned, reflecting an opportunistic exploitation of their comments without fair or proper regard for their concerns, or indeed, for the public perception of the veracity of these concerns. </PARA>
<PARA>In truth, the publication of the transcripts is prejudicial to Cooper's views, to the evidence that he has given, and to the view that he would have sought the Jawoyn people to give us. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, Senator Grant Tambling dealt with material provided to the Committee by one Steven Davis. I do not want to traverse that ground again, but this whole document is riddled with accusations, criticisms and ridicule of Mr Steven Davis. Mr Cooper does not tell us that in some way, the details of which I am not familiar with, the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Protection Authority, or the Director, Mr Ellis, with clearly the overt encouragement and support of Mr Cooper, is engaged in some form of litigation with Mr Davis. It seems that this document in some way puts outside the court the views he has. This is what Mr Cooper tells the world in his report:</PARA>
<PARA>It is perhaps illustrative of the tension and confusion surrounding these meetings that a rumour circulated amongst Aboriginal custodians, that they would ``be shot'' if they did not give approval for BHP Gold to go ahead at Coronation Hill. This rumour, corroborated by a number of custodians, was voiced by senior custodian, Nipper Brown, during the meeting of 4th July where he is recorded as saying, `` . . . let him. Give it up [Coronation Hill] him. `Nother way you only get a bullet''. Nipper, it should be noted, was one of the principal informants used by Davis to obtain the transcript which was later quoted in the Dissenting Report. It was, in fact, recorded on the day before Nipper made the above statement. </PARA>
<PARA>Again Mr Cooper failed to mention his own contribution to that debate and the fact that the NLC came along to a meeting on 4 July and in a very aggressive, verbally bullying way he sought to convince the Jawoyn people that they ought not to agree to mining on Coronation Hill. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that Mr Cooper is obsessed with Mr Davis's evidence, I will bother to read this section of our report and our treatment of the video transcript. Mr Davis, I might say to enlighten the Senate for those who are riveted to this speech, provided the transcript of a video which he had taken with a number of senior custodians. It was suggested by Mr Cooper that we found this document so compelling that it led us to make the recommendations that we did. Let me make it quite clear that our report says:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Davis states he was asked by Sandy Barraway, Nipper Brown, two senior Jawoyn custodians, to take them to Sleisbeck to see a major Bula site-a Bulalak-which they had identified from photographs taken by Arnott and reproduced in a 1962 edition of Oceania and accompanied by one of his articles. According to Davis, previously Brown and Barraway had been led to believe, by the others (not Aborigines) the major Bula to be located elsewhere, in fact, on Coronation Hill, a confusion caused by a period of loss in living memory . . . </PARA>

<PARA>. . . not only of the major Bula but of other, sites of significance to the Jawoyn people. </PARA>
<PARA>I then go on to explain who attended the visit to Sleisbeck. It was Nipper Brown, Sandy Barraway, Roy Anderson, Queenie Brown, Willy Byer, Rebecca Byer, Rita Anderson and Phyllis Wynjorroc. They are all very senior people in the Jawoyn community. I then went on to repeat the wording of the transcript that was given to us and was incorporated and became part of the evidence. On each occasion I referred to Mr Davis's conclusions and not our own. I concluded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>We agree with the majority report that this evidence seems to cast some doubt on the validity of the original decision to include Coronation Hill within a registered sacred site. </PARA>
<PARA>By any measure, any sensible person reading our report would see that we are simply faithfully reporting the evidence that was given to us and reporting the conclusions that Mr Davis has made and not conclusions that we have made. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Cooper went on to make a number of other claims. He suggests in his report that I had received information from the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Authority and that I had misrepresented what was given to me. Mr Cooper would not be aware of the truth of the matter and I will deal with this later. At the time I spoke to the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Authority I was faithfully taking down verbatim that which was given to me. I wrote it into the report at that very moment. I was relying neither on memory nor on second-hand evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the lowest point of Mr Cooper's self-serving document is his arrogant assertion that evidence given to us by the Jawoyn is wrong. He then produces in his report some obscure conversation he alleges he apparently had with one of them on some unknown occasion. He again expresses real indignation that the minority report relies in part on the evidence of the Jawoyn custodians for its findings rather then his own opinion. He then has the audacity to try to explain that the custodians' evidence was wrong. He offers some drivel about Nipper Brown telling him he did not understand that blasting would take place.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Zakharov's interpretation, to be clear to her, was simply pathetic drivel. It is interesting how Mr Cooper's private conversations with the custodians are quite different to the evidence the Committee received from the custodians. However, that notwithstanding, I shall quote the evidence and report of the Committee on the matter of explosives being used following the visit to Groote Eylandt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I bother to do that at some considerable pain to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and no doubt to the other honourable senators who are sitting here tolerantly, because it is put by Mr Cooper that Nipper Brown and the other senior custodians of the Jawoyn people, having been to Groote Eylandt, seen the open cut operations and the explosives, had come to some obscure belief that it was possible to extract all the gold, all the silver and all the other minerals and metals from Coronation Hill without using explosives. This would be achieved by some wondrous means of putting into the ground a diamond drill bit which would bring out these minerals. Senator Devlin, the Labor member on the Committee, asked:</PARA>
<PARA>If the Jawoyn people are prepared to let exploration go on, knowing full well that there is gold, platinum and everything else at Coronation Hill, are you saying you would not be happy for these minerals to be mined after completion of the exploration. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a pretty reasonable question to ask. Exploration permits are not granted if, at the end of the day, it is not intended to let somebody mine the area. Mr Fordimail, one of the elders-somebody who has always taken the view that Coronation Hill is a sacred site and ought not to be mined-responded:</PARA>
<PARA>We are quite happy with the way BHP has been doing it because it has agreed to employ the Jawoyn people. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Townley then asked:</PARA>
<PARA>So you would most probably be happy if you could get a suitable agreement with the people who might do the mining?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Fordimail responded, `Yes'. Later the chairperson, Senator Zakharov, asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Have the BHP people said they would get you money if mining went ahead?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr McDonald, one of the Jawoyn elders, said:</PARA>
<PARA>They showed us what they were doing at Groote Eylandt. We went to Groote Eylandt and had a look around at what BHP does with them there. They showed us around there and the Aboriginal people were happy with what BHP had done with them. When we came back we had a meeting about that with the Jawoyn mob and they said that if there is mining like that it is alright. </PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that was pretty elementary and something that most honourable senators would be able to interpret at first reading. The Committee's minority report went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>We are advised by BHP that Jawoyn people in inspecting the Groote Eylandt mining operation saw exploration activity, mining activity, the town layout and rehabilitation of the island. They observed blasting, quarrying and all the normal functions of a mining operation. BHP state that they also went to some trouble to explain to the Jawoyn people the difference in the size of the projects and the method of open cut mining. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, BHP was making it clear that Groote Eylandt was a modest operation compared with that which could be expected on Coronation Hill. The minority report also stated:</PARA>
<PARA>It is difficult to conclude that Jawoyn custodians, having visited Groote Eylandt and observed mining operations, could have been labouring under the misapprehension that Mr Cooper ascribes to them, particularly given the quite precise and unequivocal statement given by Mr McDonald. </PARA>
<PARA>That was not an unreasonable conclusion to draw from the evidence. Mr Cooper made much of the fact that women were present and contributed to the evidence given by the Jawoyn elders at Barunga. However, he conveniently overlooked the fact that the witnesses provided for the hearing were decided by him and the Jawoyn people. I assume that Senator Zakharov may have had some vague involvement in selecting witnesses. Under the circumstances, I would assume that the witnesses representing the Jawoyn people would have been selected by the Jawoyn people and no doubt Mr Cooper and not Senator Zakharov, because to my knowledge neither she nor any of the other Committee members had met them. For Mr Cooper's part, the women's evidence was not a bit helpful to his anti-mining cause. Not only did he claim that they should not have been there but also the thrust of his insinuation was that they would now know what they were talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> To refresh the memory of those who are still riveted by this speech, perhaps we should look at the Jawoyn land claim. I am sure I do not need to remind the Senate of the statutory requirements of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 for establishing traditional Aboriginal ownership. They are the local descent group, sites in Jawoyn traditional country, common spiritual affiliations, primary spiritual responsibility and traditional right to forage. They are all matters which go intrinsically to the heart of the claim. I refer the Senate to pages 36 and 56 of the Aboriginal Land Commissioner's report on the Aboriginal land right claim of the Jawoyn people. What they will see, in splendid, sparkling black and white, are photographs of Sarah Flora. The captions of two of the photographs say `Sarah Flora gives evidence at Jurrangluk' and `Sarah Flora gives evidence to the Commissioner on site'. There is another photograph on page 6. Obviously, Sarah Flora had some appeal either to the photographer or to the Commissioner. She appears in the report three times in half-page photographs, as giving evidence, or as doing this or as doing that. The report is riddled with quotes by women cited by the Commissioner as giving evidence which he uses either to dismiss the claim or to accept the claim. But he certainly accepts the evidence from the women as central to the determination he will make regarding the definitions I have just read out. </PARA>
<PARA> Now we have this Mr Cooper, a fly-by-night white man, telling us that these people have no right to be at a committee meeting of the Senate-people who were invited by the Committee, the Jawoyn people themselves. And this Mr Cooper has the audacity to say that women should not be there. The women cited in this report are the same women who gave evidence to our Committee. I have no doubt that when they gave their evidence for the purpose of the land claim, Mr Cooper would have embraced with some enthusiasm the evidence they gave, standing by its veracity. When one reads the evidence of the Jawoyn women elders, it is not difficult to understand why Cooper is not pleased with it. I have their evidence. I seek leave to table the evidence that was provided at Barunga. </PARA>

The evidence I seek to have tabled is but an extension of that which was tabled by Senator Zakharov herself but a week ago as a result of the release of in camera evidence by Mr Cooper which is contained in the report and which I am now fully able to read out. All I am asking for is leave for the extension of that evidence to be tabled. That is the thrust of it. It is not new material. Senator Zakharov knows the evidence intimately. But, Mr Acting Deputy President, if in spite of that you wish me to proceed, I will so do. I now have three minutes, 180 seconds, in which to speak.

I will complete my remarks tomorrow night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The thrust of what I am saying is that the Aboriginal women, whose evidence Mr Cooper referred to but which I am not allowed to refer to, gave compelling evidence of a nature which would lead any responsible committee made up of wise counsel to believe it ought to draw certain conclusions. They were conclusions that we ultimately felt compelled to follow. Mr Cooper refers to my questioning of the Jawoyn people as firm, close and improper. If I were able to table this transcript people would be able to read it in the blessed relief of their homes or wherever they choose and see that the evidence was taken with care, sensitivity and due diligence to the responsibilities cast upon me. One of my colleagues, now departed from this chamber, went to some trouble to ask the witnesses before us whether they felt quite comfortable and relaxed and whether they were intimidated in any way. With considerable enthusiasm they all nodded to Senator Townley. I cannot say what they said because I am not allowed to, but they nodded very agreeably that they were not in any way intimidated by the questions put to them. Cooper, referring to the presence of women, states in his report that this information was conveyed to the Committee in submission, but that the dissenting report fails to acknowledge this evidence despite using large extracts of the Barunga transcript obtained in problematic circumstances. Mr Cooper is saying that we have not used his evidence. I seek leave to have the balance of the evidence tabled. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to advise the Senate of some obstructionism and petty mindedness by the Australian National Railways Commission (AN), the rail line owned by the Federal Government, which did its best to obstruct an exciting bicentennial project. It is now effectively robbing an eager group of volunteers of $21,000, apart from the group's entirely voluntary contribution to the project, which was a trans-Australia rail journey by hand trike-to be a world record hand trike journey. There is no doubt that the committee which ran this bicentennial project agreed to the mean-minded demand from Australian National for $21,000 in order to get this project approved. It then hoped that it would be able to bring a sense of reality to this obstructionist, bureaucratic and, one would gather from its past activities, fairly incompetent body.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This matter goes back to May 1987 when the first request was made to Australian National to operate a Sheffield hand-pushed trike from Perth to Sydney via Adelaide as a contribution to Australia's bicentenary celebrations. From May until January 1988, which was the start of the bicentennial year, Australian National obstructed this project by refusing to give its approval. For example, on 15 July in his first response to the May letter of the Across Australia Hand Trike Committee, the Manager of Australian National, Mr D. G. Williams, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Although your proposal sounds fascinating and would no doubt create a considerable amount of public interest, I regret to advise that I consider it impractical to allow such a journey over this corridor. </PARA>
<PARA> With the extremely high traffic density which exists on this route, Australian National has to work very hard to achieve and maintain its passenger and freight performance goals. A movement of this nature, which would probably take several weeks to complete, has the potential to create a large number of serious problems with our scheduling. There would also be considerable additional costs involved especially if a locomotive (a resource very much in demand due to rationalisation) was to remain captive to a support train. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore although I believe that your idea is certainly a novel one, I am sorry that I am unable to accede to your request. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the first shot in a campaign of obstruction. It went on and on. The Across Australia Hand Trike Committee was not disheartened. Mr John Cooper, the project's administrative manager, wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on 20 July 1987. Mr Cooper is certainly no supporter of our side of politics; he evidenced his support for Mr Hawke in his letter in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I have been a railwayman for some 30 years and I am proud of the fact. My current position is Chief Train Controller with the State Rail Authority of New South Wales. A group of fellow workers believe that the railway man has played an enormous significance in the development of this great country and thus should be included and saluted during the Bi-Centenary Celebration next year. </PARA>
<PARA> Our Committee has put forward a plan to hand operate a Sheffield push trike from Perth to Sydney as the focal point of our salute. The operations of the trike would involved in excess of 1000 people right across Australia. It would be the longest trike journey in the world, and we believe would attract its good share of publicity among a host of other great events planned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Bicentennial Authority's Special Director is most enthusiastic and has indicated that it is the type of event which they are in need of as it involves people right across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>That certainly did not do much for Australian National because there was still no joy. On 9 September Mr Cooper wrote again to Australian National asking it to reconsider its obstruction. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I recently read the glowing reports which the Government of South Australia cast on Australian National for its part in that State's 150th Anniversary. What we are seeking is to honour these men and the thousands which passed before them . . . It is not our intention to cause massive disorganisation to your regular operations, but to compile a reasonably workable timetable for the journey around existing services. </PARA>
<PARA>The point I make here is that it is good enough for Australian National to participate fully in the 150th anniversary of South Australia but it is not good enough for it to participate in Australia's bicentennial celebrations in any sort of reasonable, coherent, decent or honourable way. That letter received a response on 29 September from Mr Williams, the General Manager, who wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> As indicated in previous correspondence a movement of this nature, taking several weeks to complete, has the potential to create serious operating problems and I am not prepared to alter Australian National's stance in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA>Once again, it is straightforward, uncomplicated obstructionism. Australian National said that the project `has the potential to create serious operating problems'. In fact, that was all bunkum; it did not. On 27 November, Mr Peter Duncan, who was then the Minister for Land Transport and Infrastructure Support, wrote back to Mr Cooper and said:</PARA>
<PARA> Australian National has advised me that your proposal would involve substantial disruption-</PARA>
<PARA>it has gone from a potentially substantial disruption to a substantial disruption-</PARA>
<PARA>to train scheduling on a route with extremely high traffic density, and that it is unable to grant your request. </PARA>
<PARA>He ends up:</PARA>
<PARA> I am sorry I am unable to assist you. I certainly support the recognition of Australia's railway pioneers and hope you can arrange an appropriate salute. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government, not being prepared to do anything practical to help, hands out some soft soap, some nonsense words, and does nothing. On 26 December 1987 the Trike Committee again wrote to Mr John Charter, the Assistant General Manager of Australian National, pointing out just how it could do this without disrupting transport and without disrupting schedules. I quote from the letter:</PARA>
<PARA>It is now proposed the SHEFFIELD CONQUEST-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Trike-</PARA>
<PARA>be worked under perway conditions such as an inspection car checking the line. The trike can be removed . . . by the 4 operators without difficulty. It is anticipated that the average speed of the trike would be approximately 15 kph and this would give as a daily distance of 150 kph based on a 10 hr day spread over twelve hours. This would be the maximum distance proposed and in effect working on siding to siding the distance would be less, example day one of the AN Section would be Kalgoorlie to Karonie, a distance of 131 kms. </PARA>
<PARA>So it was established clearly that there would be no disruption to schedules. On 6 January 1988, at last, eight months later, Australian National energetically springs into action. Having delayed this project until the bicentennial year had started, it created immense difficulties for organisers in getting it under way. But on 6 January Australian National wrote to Mr Cooper saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we agree, in principle, that the project . . . be approved. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate the position which Australian National has taken, namely that the project should be at no cost to this System, and secondly the progress should be such as to produce no disruption to our normal commercial traffic. </PARA>
<PARA>That is all very well. It need not have taken eight months to work that out. I am interested that it says that the project should be at no cost to the system. But from the bills that have been sent to this volunteer committee, it looks as though there has been some profit to Australian National, unless its costs of doing things are just unbelievable. On 8 July 1988 Australian National again wrote to Mr Cooper outlining what these costs would be:</PARA>
<PARA> At this time costs associated with the supply of support staff for safeworking reasons has not been finalised, and you will be advised when to hand. Costs for the haul of the support vehicles between Broken Hill and Kalgoorlie, returning via Adelaide is $2,850.60 per car. </PARA>
<PARA> As Australian National's contribution for the Across Australia Sheffield Hand Trike project, I am prepared to make the ABJX-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the particular carriage-</PARA>
<PARA>available at no charge for the duration of the project, however, there will be a haulage charge of $2,371.00. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know how Australian National gets that figure; but, if that is its actual cost of operation, I am astounded. It looks very much like its normal charge for commercial users. If that is so, it is an absolute disgrace. On 18 July 1988 the Hand Trike Committee wrote to Mr Bannon to try to get him on side. In fact, it ended up getting the New South Wales Government rail system and the Western Australian rail system on side. Only Australian National insisted on charging it money. The Committee in a letter to Mr Bannon stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . on 26 December 1987 we submitted an amended application to Australian National based on the use of NSW Rail Transport Museum Locomotive and using enginemen who have volunteered to work the train without receiving payment. This system is widely used by rail societies in NSW and also at Peterborough South Australia on the Steamtown Museum trains. We had men lined up who were ready, willing and able to support this project. However, at the meeting of the Federal Council of the AFULE in Launceston in March this year, a ban was placed on their men participating in our salute. </PARA>
<PARA>It is incredible that this one rail union-all the other rail unions have agreed to participate on a voluntary basis-insisted that there should be no volunteer operation, and a ban was placed on its men participating in the salute. The letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Once again we were forced to go back to Australian National and seek another solution. During negotiations with Australian National we were frequently reminded that Australian National is a commercial operation with little interest in heritage or the past and that they would be making a charge for the service they provided. </PARA>
<PARA>Has Australian National never heard of public relations or of the benefit of actually involving itself in a project like this, in the same way as a genuine, fair dinkum commercial operation which knows how to make a quid, rather than lose a quid, which is apparently Australian National's greatest attribute? Surely, a company with commercial wisdom would have been prepared to use this as a promotional activity. After all, it was prepared to do something similar during the South Australian 150th anniversary celebrations. The letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA> On 13 July I received a quote for moving the travelling exhibition we have prepared which contains a sales and historical display van; a lounge-dining-shower car; a sleeping car to accommodate 20 people; a service van containing mobile workshop, power generators, spare parts and cooking facilities. All these vehicles have been made available by the State Rail Authority of New South Wales at no cost. The ABJX wagon referred to in the attached letter from Australian National is owned by them and they have made it available, but unlike Westrail or State Rail, they require us to pay for this movement, which in total amounts to over $16,000. </PARA>
<PARA>What a great contribution! What a great sense of national pride by Australian National! That is a misplaced title if ever I have heard one. The letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to this cost, the provision of safe working employees is expected to be in the order of $10,000. This amount of money is beyond our capacity and although we have been busily seeking sponsors it is really difficult to convince railway suppliers and supporters that they should sponsor this event when the organisation which stands to benefit most, that is Australian National, is seeking to make a hefty charge to move the vehicles necessary for the Salute's progress. </PARA>
<PARA>Another letter to Mr Hawke in 1988 states in part:</PARA>
<PARA> Our biggest section is controlled by Australian National from Kalgoorlie to Broken Hill. Once having obtained approval it was then a matter of costs. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter outlines the cost situation and it then outlines also what happened to the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen when it withdrew its support and prohibited its members from being involved in the movement of the support unit unless on duty and receiving their full award wage. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> All other major rail unions have not only pledged their moral support, but actually made financial donations to the cause. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter then appeals for Mr Hawke's assistance in meeting this payment, either by paying Australian National the actual cost it is seeking, or by convincing Australian National management it should support an historic salute to its own history. On 12 September 1988 another letter was written to Mr Hawke outlining what had happened when the salute started at the Perth terminal on Saturday, 3 September. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the West Australian Minister for Transport Mr Bob Pearce, and the West Australian Commissioner for Railways, Dr Jim Gill, both offered their sincere congratulations to the team that had orchestrated the salute, saying they believed the railway system had a great future and it was fitting that we salute those who have made this exciting future possible. The West Australian Government supported this salute totally, and Mr Pearce and Dr Gill joined with our Chairman, Ken McCawley, and Executive Officer, John Cooper, and pushed the Sheffield Conquest for the first section of this across Australia push. </PARA>
<PARA>The Western Australian Government is doing the right thing, even to the extent of pushing for this. Mr Hawke and Mr Peter Morris were asked whether they would like to get physically involved in this salute by pushing the vehicle at some stage. There are those who say that neither of those people could push anything uphill at the moment, but regrettably they were unavailable and could not participate. </PARA>
<PARA> Even Mr Bannon wrote to the Hon. Ralph Willis, the Minister for Transport and Communications, asking him to help out. Mr Bannon was totally on-side. In December 1988 Mr Bob Brown, the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support, wrote to Mr Bannon in response, saying:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the charges Australian National proposes would recover only the direct additional costs of having the project on the rail system. </PARA>
<PARA>If these were the direct additional costs it is no wonder that Australian National cannot make a quid. The invoice which I have before me shows that it cost $21,584.05. Quite frankly, I am appalled if that is what it cost. I seek leave to table the invoice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. On 14 March 1989 there was another letter to Bob Brown from the executive officer, which was very disappointing because the committee had had to guarantee that it would personally pay the account from Australian National as it could not get support from the Government and from sponsors who said, `We're not interested in paying Australian National for the right for you people to do something that Australian National should be allowing you to do and should be joining in and helping you do'. After the great farewell given by the Western Australian Government and its Ministers and the Western Australian Rail Commissioner, the letter to Bob Brown noted:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To arrive in Adelaide and find not one executive officer from Australian National there was not only disappointing but almost devastating. </PARA>
<PARA>So not only did Australian National obstruct the thing for months and charge some $21,000 but also it could not even turn up when the bicentennial project arrived in Adelaide-a bicentennial project which was in the main celebrating the Bicentenary of Australia by drawing attention to the contribution to Australia's history of railmen, particularly those involved in that large stretch of rail from Kalgoorlie to Broken Hill. The letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The whole purpose of visiting Adelaide was because it is Australian National's headquarters and a major keystone in the journey across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>It continued:</PARA>
<PARA> I well remember Mr John Charter of Australian National telling me not to arrive or leave Adelaide on Sunday . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Presumably that was because it wanted to be involved in this matter. In that letter Mr Cooper, who, as I have said, is an executive of State Rail in New South Wales, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The real cost to Australian National of our event would have been less than one tenth the amount charged. </PARA>
<PARA>It is noteworthy that everyone else did not charge anything, including Ansett Airlines of Australia, which provided, free of charge, tickets for travel to and from Perth on a space available condition for some members of the crew. I will mention a few more letters briefly because I think this is an absolute disgrace. My friend and colleague from the Australian Labor Party in New South Wales, Mr Stephen Martin, MP, has been involved in this matter and has done his best to try to encourage the Government to do something about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to Senator Crichton-Browne's speech earlier I want to say that he is reiterating what was in the dissenting report, and taking quotations out of context. I want to make it clear that, once again, Senator Crichton-Browne has quoted very selectively from the evidence, including in camera evidence. I also want to quote from two documents written by the Jawoyn people themselves. One is a report of the Jawoyn Working Party which was presented to a number of people in this Parliament late last year. I quote from the executive summary of that document, which, incidentally, was presented by at least two senior custodians and four other traditional owners. The document states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Jawoyn-the traditional Aboriginal owners of major areas of Stage Three of Kakadu National Park-wish to make it entirely clear to the readers of this document that we reject mining and exploration in the Sickness Country . . . Since the late 1950s our people have attempted to convince non Aboriginal people that the Gimbat region is of great spiritual significance to the Jawoyn. Jawoyn people have always maintained the importance of the Bulademo (Sickness Country). Within the traditional cultural values and beliefs of the Jawoyn, the Bulademo sites complex cannot be disturbed in any way . . . We have come to Canberra to tell the politicians that we do not want mining or exploration in the Sickness Country. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a fairly definite statement. Secondly, I would like to quote from a media release dated 13 June, again from the Jawoyn Working Party in response, I understand, to Senator Tambling's press release and speech. It quotes Mr Robert Lee, the Chairman of the Jawoyn Working Party, and states:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Lee said that the report by Mr Cooper, ``On Shaky Ground'', had been tabled with the permission of senior Jawoyn custodians of the Sickness Country, and did not contain material offensive to them. ``Cooper's Report was all about Aboriginal views being misrepresented and distorted,'' Mr Lee said. ``Senator Tambling has shown that he would like our views to continue to be belittled and forgotten. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1), (2) and (3) Federal, State and the Northern Territory Ministers responsible for censorship matters considered recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material and new guidelines for the classification of films and videos in Darwin on 30 June 1988. Following discussions of the guidelines, Ministers asked the Chief Censor and the Chairman of the Films Board of Review to tighten the application of the guidelines at the top end of the `M' and `R' categories when classifying violent films or videos. There was no question of reclassification and no undertaking to reclassify such material was sought.</PARA>
<PARA> On 1 December 1988, the Board was given the power in the Australian Capital Territory to recall for reassessment videos which had been on the market for more than two years and which had caused public disquiet, or where the Board had reason to believe that community standards had changed significantly. The Board has recalled thirteen videos and will be making its decisions public on these videos when complementary State and Northern Territory legislation is in place.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) and (5) Material which is considered likely to disturb, harm or offend those under the age of 15 years will be assigned a Mature classification. While most adult themes may be dealt with, the degree of explicitness and intensity of treatment will determine what can be accommodated in this classification. The guidelines approved by the Ministers in Darwin in relation to the `M' category are:</PARA>
<PARA> Language: Crude language may be used, but not when it is excessive, unduly assaultive, or sexually explicit.</PARA>
<PARA> Sex: Sexual intercourse or other sexual activity may be discreetly implied or simulated.</PARA>
<PARA> Violence: Realistic violence of medium intensity may be depicted, but violent depictions with a high degree of realism or impact are acceptable only if contextually justified.</PARA>
<PARA> Other: Drug use may be depicted, but not in an advocatory manner. Supernatural and ``horror'' special effects usually warrant an `M' classification.</PARA>
<PARA> The guidelines do not indicate that ``realistic sexual violence . . .'' may receive an `M' classification `` . . . if contextually justified''. The whole category is governed by the general principle that ``the degree of explicitness and intensity of treatment will determine what can be accommodated in this category''. Unlike the `R' and `X' categories which have mandatory age proscriptions, the other categories, including the `M' category, are advisory only and responsibility for determining what children under 15 years watch at the cinema or on video rests with parents.</PARA>
<PARA> All films and videos classified after 1 May this year will carry consumer advice to assist parents in making decisions about material they consider is suitable for their children to watch.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The Chief Censor has supplied the following extract from the report of the Film Censorship Board on THE ACCUSED:</PARA>
<PARA> The Board was unanimous in its opinion that, whilst contextually justified, the re-creation of a brutal rape which reinforces the terror of the victim and the callousness with which she was treated by the males in the room, was sufficiently detailed and impactful to warrant a Restricted Classification.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Chairman of the Films Board of Review has supplied the following extract from the minutes of its meeting held on 15 December 1988 at which the Review Board considered an application for review of the decision of the Film Censorship Board to classify THE ACCUSED `For Restricted Exhibition'.</PARA>
<PARA> The Board of Review was at first equally divided on the merits of the appeal. Three members felt that the scene in question-presented as the recollections of a witness during a trial-was contextually justified; the others agreed with the Censorship Board that the scene went beyond the limits for an `M' rating. All members agreed, however, that the film contained a powerful message, and made a socially significant statement about rape and the degree of complicity of those who might witness crimes of sexual violence. The Board of Review, after prolonged discussion and a careful scrutiny of the guidelines for film classification, agreed by majority that an `M' classification was appropriate. The Board of Review insisted, however, that such a classification should be accompanied by a warning about the subject matter of the film. Accordingly, the Board of Review directed that THE ACCUSED be classified `M' (For Mature Audiences), and that publicity for the film be required to include the following statement: ``CENSORSHIP WARNING: THIS FILM CONTAINS SCENES OF GRAPHIC SEXUAL VIOLENCE''.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 31 May 1989 (Hansard, p. 3105), Senator Calvert asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health, this question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is directed to the Minister for Community Services and Health, and relates to the present guidelines issued by the Department of Community Services and Health on the approval of admission to a nursing home. Is the Minister aware that the present guidelines preclude from admission to a nursing home any person who may have been a resident of a state institution for a period which may have been as short as one year preceding the application for approval? Is he further aware that this guideline also applies to persons who may similarly have been residents of state institutions for three years in the past five? Does the Minister acknowledge that such guidelines infer that many elderly persons, who may be required to enter such institutions for treatment of a temporary illness, are precluded from ever returning to the nursing home situation despite a recommendation to the contrary by Commonwealth medical officers? Will he also acknowledge that such guidelines are causing considerable hardship for those who are unable, because of geographical isolation, to relocate their families closer to their homes once treatment has been completed? Finally, could the Minister please advise whether the Department is considering altering the existing guidelines to address some of the issues to which I have previously referred today?</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Housing and Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Section of the ``Guidelines for Approval of Admission to a Nursing home'' relating to residents of State psychiatric institutions was adopted in 1986 following a large number of nursing home admission applications from such residents where the reason for admission was given as ``closure of hospital beds''. This type of application is still being received.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth cannot be expected to bear the cost of savings realised by State Governments when State institutions are closed down and the State fails to make appropriate alternative arrangements for their accommodation and care. It remains the responsibility of State Governments to continue to provide care for long term residents of State psychiatric institutions particularly when those residents are discharged because of closures. Alternative arrangements are the responsibility of the States not the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA> For this reason, the Commonwealth guidelines do preclude persons who have been long term residents of State institutions from being approved for nursing home admission. However, the guidelines specifically state that exemptions may occur where the application fulfils the criteria for admission in the National Health Act section 40ab (3) and:</PARA>
<PARA> where the application is for admission to a special purpose home related to the person's disability; or</PARA>
<PARA> the applicant has been admitted to the State institution for an acute episode while still a nursing home patient, or where admission was for less than twelve months or three years in the last five; and</PARA>
<PARA> the applicant suffers a long term physical illness, which overrides any psychiatric disorder or intellectual disability, and</PARA>
<PARA> the physical disability cannot be adequately managed in the State institution, and acute hospital care is not appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> These exemptions would cover the case of a nursing home resident being required to have treatment for a temporary illness in a State institution and then wishing to return to a nursing home. There would therefore be nothing to prevent such a person from returning to the nursing home providing his or her physical and mental condition continued to require nursing home care.</PARA>
<PARA> In general, nursing homes are neither staffed nor equipped to provide care for people with psychiatric disorders. Most people with psychiatric disorders would not be helped by being admitted to a facility which is intended to provide nursing and personal care mainly for people with physical disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA> For these reasons I do not intend altering this section of the guidelines in response to the issues raised in the question.</PARA>
