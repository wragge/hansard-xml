<TITLE>Health Care for the Elderly</TITLE>
<PARA>Honourable the President and members of the Senate Assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that,</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's population is ageing and most people require more health services as they grow older. If open-not-for-profit Health Funds are to be able to meet the costs of providing benefits to their older members at affordable rates, those costs need to be shared equitably. Some Health Insurance organisations are being allowed to avoid meeting the health costs of sick and elderly people.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled, urge the Government to, take the necessary action to reverse rising cost trends and provide positive incentives to encourage all Health Funds to share the cost of health care for sick and elderly Australians.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament; the humble petition of the undersigned showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That Kingsford-Smith Airport is becoming increasingly congested and existing facilities are inadequate to handle the number of aircraft or their passengers.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government's plans to divert aircraft from Mascot to Bankstown and/or increase landing charges for peak periods will do little to relieve congestion and will place enormous financial and other burdens on commuter airlines and their passengers.</PARA>
<PARA> We therefore call on the Federal Government to take heed of airline and travel industry warnings and</PARA>
<PARA> 1. give immediate approval for the construction of a third runway at Mascot</PARA>
<PARA> 2. upgrade existing radar and other traffic control facilities to enable Australia's high safety record to be maintained.</PARA>

<PARA> We deplore the violations of human rights being perpetrated by the Vietnamese Government, and in particular draw attention to the religious intolerance of this regime.</PARA>
<PARA> We call upon the Australian Government to exert its influence to request the Vietnamese Government to cease its detention, harassment and other mistreatment of thousands of Buddhist monks, nuns and clerics of other religions.</PARA>
<PARA> We seek the assistance of the Australian Government in obtaining the release from incarceration of religious detainees and prisoners in Vietnam.</PARA>

<TITLE>Home Ownership</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that-</PARA>
<PARA> Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.</PARA>
<PARA> Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled require the Hawke-Keating Government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many Australians out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Senate assembled in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate that the Government is about to introduce into the Senate, legislation changing health insurance. These changes will increase the cost of health insurance to members of employee based funds and will do nothing to help the elderly, as is being claimed. Big public funds will increase their surpluses by taking money from more efficient funds. People will be forced back into Medicare, which will not help to maintain private health insurance.</PARA>

<PARA> (a) recalls that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) in his second reading speech to the Australian Capital Territory (Self Government) Bill 1988 on 7 November 1988 on behalf of the Government said:</PARA>

<PARA> The speeches read as follows=m</PARA>
<PARA>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The primary purpose of this Bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 to provide increased funding to higher education institutions over the 1989-91 triennium. The additional funding will total some $24 million in 1989. The increased funding is being provided in accordance with well established Government procedures for the cost supplementation of higher education grants. Under these arrangements provision is made for the additional costs of increased salaries of higher education staff and for increases in other costs such as equipment and building costs that are incurred up to the start of the program year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for a reduction in operating grants for 1990 and 1991 to take into account the Government's decision to phase out the Subsidised Overseas Student Program. The amounts involved are $23 million in 1990 and $43 million in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> These funds will be used instead to finance scholarships to enable overseas students to obtain full fee places in Australian higher education institutions. The new arrangements therefore will not reduce the total level of funding available for institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also makes provision for self-government in the ACT. Under the amended Act the Signadou College of Education will receive its grant payments through the ACT Treasury on the same basis as payments are made to institutions in the States and the Northern Territory. The ANU, the CCAE and the Canberra Institute of the Arts remain as Commonwealth institutions and accordingly will be funded through Appropriation as at present. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the Explanatory Memorandum and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>STATES GRANTS (TECHNICAL AND FURTHER EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to make provision for supplementation of grants of financial assistance to the States and the Northern Territory for technical and further education for 1989. The Bill also makes provision to include the Australian Capital Territory in line with self government for the Territory and excludes fees payable by overseas students from the condition of financial assistance relating to the charging of student fees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides an additional $9.562 million to ensure Commonwealth grants for technical and further education in 1989 are maintained in real terms and will provide funding for the Australian Capital Territory from 1 July 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>
<PARA>STATES GRANTS (SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act 1988 to make adjustments and variations in the price levels of the financial schedules in the Act and to provide for the payment of grants to schools in the Australian Capital Territory under the Act as a consequence of ACT Self-Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides an estimated $36.6 million increase in appropriation for schools in 1989, including $21.7 million for the ACT in the second half of 1989. This brings 1989 Commonwealth schools funding to an estimated total of $1982 million. </PARA>

<PARA> But in the private side of politics, where enemies can be friends and enjoy a laugh, Senator Baume rang Senator Schacht late yesterday to say thanks and express his pleasure at the end result. </PARA>
<PARA>Those words are totally, absolutely and completely false. The first conversation I had with Senator Schacht for three weeks was this morning when I verified with him that he had made no such remarks to that journalist or his newspaper. I underline the fact that I certainly would not and did not convey such a friendly response to Senator Schacht. I informed him this morning that further action would be taken on this matter. I am grateful to him for acknowledging to me this morning that we had had no such conversation and that he had no knowledge of how the newspaper had written such a report. One has enough to put up with in the media without this kind of ludicrous invention. </PARA>

I just want to confirm Senator Michael Baume's remarks that I had not spoken to him for three weeks until three-quarters of an hour ago in the corridor and then just five minutes ago here in the chamber. I certainly have said to no journalist that I received a congratulatory telephone call from Senator Baume. Yesterday I did say in a radio interview that I had taken a copy of the poster to Senator Baume's office on Monday and handed it to his research officer, who I think had a laugh. I do not know whether that laugh could be taken as being indicative of support or chagrin. I certainly cannot recollect saying to any journalist anywhere that I had received a telephone call of congratulations from Senator Baume. I confirm that. I think the Brisbane Courier-Mail should acknowledge its error. On the general matter of the poster, I have to say to Senator Baume, as I told the media, `If you keep writing, I will keep producing'.</PARA></TALK.START>

The reality is-and Senator Schacht will be hearing about this in another arena-that, in a most totally unauthorised way, Senator Schacht took words that I had said would be used by the Australian Labor Party. I said the Labor Party would do this and do that. At no stage were they my words in the sense that I was saying them as my words. They were words I said the Labor Party would use.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on an unfinished chapter in Australian history; that is, the Vietnam war. The chapter relates to the failure of the Whitlam Government to establish an end of war list on the return home of the Australian troops from Vietnam. After every war which Australians have served in an end of war list has been drawn up. The Vietnam war stands as an exception. End of war lists are established for the purpose of recognising individual acts of valour that were overlooked in the disruption of the war and awarding to individuals or their families a medal of honour from the armed forces on behalf of all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The establishment of such a list has much to do with maintaining a certain spirit of Australia-a spirit born out of the Gallipoli campaign-that spirit of pride and appreciation Australians have towards service men and women in times of war. Regardless of the horror and evil of war, Australians have always had an appreciation of and respect for those who fought and died wearing the Australian uniform. That is what each Anzac Day parade symbolises. Not to recognise individual acts of valour in the Vietnam war would be to destroy that spirit passed on through time by the Anzacs. Unless the decision not to establish an end of war list is reversed, the Vietnam veterans can never be on a par with veterans from past campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA>Appropriation Bills</PARA>
<PARA> Documents received under the Freedom of Information Act show that three defence departments-the Army, the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force-made two requests for the establishment of an end of war list. The first request was made in 1972 and was rejected upon the grounds that hostilities were continuing in Vietnam. The second request was made some nine months later when all of the Australian troops were home. It was also rejected, this time on the ground that the establishment of such a list would be seen to be celebrating that war. It is worthy of note that the Army specified the number of awards it believed that the end of war list should total, and the Air Force clearly argued that such a list would allow the recognition of a number of cases of gallantry and distinguished service that were not recognised at the time of hostilities. So it is unquestionable that the armed forces desired the establishment of an end of war list. However, the then Minister for Defence, Lance Barnard, rejected their view on the ground that it would be seen to be celebrating the war. That decision distinctly lacked an understanding of the Australian people and their history. Nobody at the time of Gallipoli or since could claim war as an event to celebrate. Indeed, Gallipoli was both a wartime and political disaster. Yet, what we do recognise and remember from that time are the individual acts of valour and those Australians who did not come home. </PARA>
<PARA> The Whitlam Government failed to understand this characteristic of Australians. The Whitlam Government was so engrossed in the politics of the day that it was willing to sacrifice the respect and dignity of the returning troops and the families of those who did not return. It sacrificed them for political expediency and favour. We have had to live with that mistake ever since, as we have had to live with defeat in the Vietnam war. The real hangover and shame of this lost war come from the fact that the Whitlam Government was unwilling to accept an age-old tradition in Australia, that is, in the event of defeat we recognise and, indeed, uplift those who served this country. Sadly, every government since has lacked the courage to overturn that decision for the single reason of fearing the revitalisation of the war debate. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not until the 1987 coming home parade, organised by the Vietnam veterans themselves some 16 years after the soldiers left the battlefields of South East Asia, that the first step towards bridging the gap between the veterans and the Australian society was taken. It was a very moving event for those who watched the thousands of Australian men and women march. The marchers had been given no victory, no glory and not even any pride in having done their duty until this day. One could not help but believe that, on this day, Australia had begun to heal the bitter divisions of the war, that the spirit of all that had made the Australian characteristic so unique in the world had returned-that unique spirit of unconquerable determination of Australians against adversity. Certainly, that spirit of mateship was present that day, when stories of bravery and loss were told. </PARA>
<PARA> If the coming home parade was the first step taken, the second step must be the approval of an end of war list. Many will say that time has passed and it is best to let such a controversial war be forgotten. `Besides', they will ask, `how could any investigation after so long reveal adequately the events of that war?'. To that I would reply that, in this Senate just before Christmas, the War Crimes Amendment Bill was passed. That Bill sought justice some 50 years after World War II. The justice that was sought there was to seek out war criminals. The justice I seek is to seek out war heroes. In my speech on that Bill I said:</PARA>
<PARA> As we fast approach a new century, the year 2001, we are being asked to look back to a time that for so many was a time in history books, old film footage and, indeed, museums, and I am one such person who was not even born when the atrocities occurred in the Second World War. So it is significant for me to add that my generation has never been asked to go to war. We have been privileged with an era that has not challenged our beliefs to a point where we must take up arms and defend them in war. I rise to speak for that very reason. What my generation owes to past generations is due to the will and suffering of past generations of Australians and Europeans. My generation can say that they live in a free Australia. I believe that the past era should not be forgotten. A time should not be placed on justice, nor should there be a time to forget the dead. That is what every shrine of remembrance in this country asks of us-`Lest We Forget' the fallen soldier and civilian. </PARA>
<PARA>I hold that same belief in seeking the establishment of an end of war list. Nobody should doubt that, because of the decision not to establish an end of war list, there are now many unsung heroes of the Vietnam war. I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate one such case which is worthy of investigation. The story is told of 23-year-old Second Lieutenant John Fraser, C Company, 3 Royal Australian Regiment. His act of courage occurred on Hill 323, Phuoc Tuy province, in March 1968. Second Lieutenant Fraser was leading his platoon along a ridge when suddenly a mine detonated. The 23-year-old Fraser had put his foot down on a jumping jack mine. Such a mine leaps into the air before it explodes. Hearing the mine set, he immediately placed his other foot on the mine to prevent it exploding up in the air. The explosion knocked his men to the ground, but they were safe. Fraser had stopped the mine from doing its real job. John Fraser's voice then echoed out of the settling dust, `Don't come in for me. Don't come in. There are more here'. Lieutenant John Fraser was eventually airlifted out by helicopter, but died soon after. His body was brought home to the Gold Coast and given a military burial. </PARA>
<PARA> I am reminded of one story told to me by a veteran. He said that, while his attitude was against Australians being called up to fight, he believed that, once in the battle zone, every soldier was duty bound to fight with every ounce of strength for those fellow Australians alongside him. If there was one weak link in the fighting chain, all his mates would be in danger. That was the atmosphere and reality of the war zone in Vietnam regardless of opinion and demonstrations at home. It is to that that John Fraser and the others who served in Vietnam were so true. Today, John Fraser is survived by his father, who is 80 years old. Here is a man who has love for his lost son, a son who will be forever young, just like those young Anzacs who lie in the graves in Gallipoli today. The Fraser family and all who know the story can be forever proud of our Australian hero, Lieutenant John Fraser. It is not without significance to note that the people of the Gold Coast have not forgotten John Fraser. A memorial park has been established in his memory. To the people of the Gold Coast, John Fraser is a home town hero whom the authorities have ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> In seeking some proper investigation into Lieutenant Fraser's action, with the hope of no more than recognition in the form of a mention in dispatches, I forwarded a request to the then Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mrs Kelly. On 8 March I received a reply that can only be termed disgraceful. The Minister conceded that the events leading to the death of Lieutenant Fraser were reported correctly. However, without evidence or proper investigation, and on one general's advice, she rejected the possibility of Fraser's action and the reported explanation by the soldiers on the spot. Quite frankly, her letter does not make sense. There is a gap in her rationale. She must answer the question: how was the mine kept in the ground? I for one do not accept Minister Kelly's explanation as at all convincing or complete. </PARA>
<PARA> My own investigations into the case have led me to discussions with the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, serving personnel at Puckapunyal in Victoria and soldiers who served in Vietnam, including those who served under Lieutenant Fraser and were part of the patrol that he led that fateful day. I have received technical advice on the workings of a jumping jack mine and the possibilities of human endeavour in wartime. These investigations lead me to favour the view that Lieutenant Fraser's actions did occur as reported. My views were further confirmed when I strolled through the Australian War Memorial in Canberra and read the stories of other Australian heroes that are displayed. How great those stories are but how many would be hard to believe if they were not witnessed? But such is the greatness of human endeavour in times of war. It is all very well for Minister Kelly and General Gration to sit back in their Canberra offices and calculate-by slide rule perhaps-the technical possibility of Lieutenant Fraser's actions. But they ignore the outer bounds of human endeavour in a war zone. I wonder whether General Gration has lost his vision of what the Australian soldier can be. </PARA>
<PARA> The main point is that there are many variables in this case that have been utterly dismissed without proper investigation by the Minister and the general. Minister Kelly's letter to me on 8 March is further flawed-deliberately or otherwise-when she states that the end of war list was not established on the advice given by the defence forces to the then Minister for Defence, Lance Barnard. As I have already pointed out, freedom of information documents show that that is not the case. On two occasions the defence forces made a request for the establishment of an end of war list. To add further insult, Minister Kelly finishes her letter by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> It would be most regrettable if the recent publicity which has been given to Second Lieutenant Fraser's death has given rise to fresh expectations by his family . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Those words intimate that the matter should not receive further publicity. I can assure the Minister that it has always been my intention to treat this matter with the respect it really deserves. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously Minister Kelly did not mean what she said because the private letter to me-which the Fraser family had not seen-was published and released to the media. How that came about can only be explained by the office of Ros Kelly. It is disgraceful that the Minister would allow such a letter to be released publicly. </PARA>
<PARA> We must ask the question: Did the Minister have a deliberate purpose? I can only conclude that that purpose was to embarrass those seeking to reinstate an end of war list. Why? Let us look at the politics of Ros Kelly and her motivations. I refer to an article in the Australian of 23 July 1987 when she was first appointed to the Ministry. That article goes a long way to give a clear indication of what her motivations would have been. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>It was studying in the hotbed of activism in the 1960s, the University of Sydney, that quickly changed Mrs Kelly's attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA>`The Vietnam war politicised me-that's how I started to get involved in the Labor Party,' she said. </PARA>
<PARA>It is becoming increasingly clear that Ros Kelly is a 1960s flower power child who has grown up but still carries all the spite and prejudices of that time. Minister Kelly is of the same generation as Lieutenant Fraser but has spent the years that he could not live ignoring those who went to Vietnam. Minister Kelly has never been able to accept that some believed enough to fight the war and that all believed enough to fight for their fellow soldiers, next to them in the trenches. The Minister has locked herself into a 1960s mentality and is relishing the vindictiveness she can now administer in her powerful position in Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Since approximately March this year a new Minister, the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons), has taken up the portfolio of Defence Science and Personnel. I request Minister Simmons to establish a military tribunal that will take a wide range of evidence with the aim of making recommendations with respect to the establishment of an end of war list and to re-open the investigations into the Fraser case and any other worthy case. The Minister should also issue an apology to the Fraser family for the publication of the leaked letter to the media and then undertake an investigation into the leaking of the letter. The new Minister should be made aware of the determination of many to achieve the requests I have outlined. </PARA>
<PARA> My campaign for the re-establishment of the end of war list is backed up by the Vietnam Veterans Association and the Returned Services League of Australia. Further, a grassroots campaign has been launched to make the weight of public support obvious to this Government. There cannot be a proper investigation of Fraser's case or any other case without the establishment of an end of war list. All forgotten cases from the Vietnam war deserve the military status of an end of war list investigation and not a mere one-off departmental check by the Minister. I ask the new Minister to view this issue in a far more patriotic manner than his predecessor has done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning we are having a cognate debate on the various Appropriation Bills of the Federal Government and on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill for the current financial year. These Bills provide funds for the remainder of the financial year over and above the funds which were budgeted for in August last year. They do not break any new ground; they simply provide extra finance for the operations of the Federal Government in the current financial year. The Bills are a confirmation of the overall direction in our economic policy, which is already in place. They offer an opportunity to discuss the Government's overall policy approach and, in particular, the question of fiscal policy; that is, policy relating to Government spending and taxation in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Hawke Government's record on fiscal restraint is well documented and is unparalleled in Australian history. For example, in 1987-88, the previous financial year, the Commonwealth Government recorded its first Budget surplus, as distinct from deficits, in 35 years. It is a matter of public record now that that surplus is to be over $5,500m for this financial year. We are looking at a surplus again next year, and the indications are that there will be a surplus of significant magnitude. However, the figure for this financial year will be $5,500m. So there has been a massive turnaround in the finances of the Commonwealth Government. It is a matter of public record that the Fraser Government went out of office in 1983 with a prospective deficit for the 1983-84 financial year of some $9,600m, which is an enormous figure. So in total terms there has been a turnaround from a deficit of over $9 billion to a surplus this year of over $5 billion. After the next financial year, real Commonwealth spending-that is, Commonwealth outlays adjusted for price indexes-will have declined for four years in a row. There have been very strong financial stringencies in Australia with real cuts in Government spending for four succeeding financial years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government has restrained its own activities. It has also brought about cuts in the borrowings and expenditures of the State governments. As a result of that, the totality has been a drastic reduction in public sector demands on the financial markets. For example, the public sector borrowing requirement is now a zero figure. When the Liberal Party left office in 1983 the amount of borrowing by the Commonwealth Government and the State governments was equivalent to almost 6 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product or Australia's national income. The figure was in fact 5.9 per cent of gross domestic product. The Liberals are saying that, despite these recent financial stringencies, despite the financial stringency of the current year and despite the prospective stringencies next year, further cuts in Government spending can and should be made. I would like to issue a challenge today to members of both the Liberal Party and the National Party to say where those further spending cuts could be made. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7I4">Senator MAGUIRE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not get an answer, as my colleague Senator Ray has said. We have pared Government spending year after year since 1983. There are now no easy options in cutting Government spending, and it is all too easy for members of the Opposition to make these claims that further spending cuts should be made. Where would they make these cuts? Would they cut age pensions? Would they cut family allowance payments? Would they reduce the number of university places in Australia funded by the Commonwealth Government? We are still waiting for Liberal Party policies in a range of areas, whether they be tax policies, industry policies or expenditure policies. I ask specifically where those extra spending cuts would come. For example, on Tuesday of this week Senator Newman, one of the defence spokespersons for the Opposition, gave notice of a motion concerning the removal of a helicopter squadron from the Royal Australian Air Force. I think her notice of motion actually read that we were scrapping this particular helicopter squadron because there was too much priority being given to fiscal and budgetary matters. I must check the wording of that notice of motion, but I think I am correct in saying that. There is an area where $100m or $200m-I am not quite sure what the cost of refurbishment of those helicopters would be, but it is very substantial for each aircraft-would have been added by the Liberals to government outlays in the current financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my own State of South Australia, month after month we see Mr Alexander Downer, one of the dumped shadow spokespersons-and he claims to be a dry member of the Liberal Party and an economic rationalist-calling for higher expenditure in his electorate. Whether it be expenditure to improve television reception in the area by Commonwealth Government outlays being increased or whether it be other facilities for his area, including upgrading the railway track in the region, there is a classic case of a Liberal Party member of parliament calling in the local media for higher government spending and hoping that members of the Government will not notice it and that he can get away with it in his local electorate in the Adelaide Hills. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Ray has now given me the wording of Senator Newman's notice of motion that was given here on Tuesday. I point out that subparagraph (c) of that notice states:</PARA>
<PARA>condemns the Government for its stupid decision to sacrifice defence capability to budgetary expediency. </PARA>
<PARA>She is a person who should know better. The front bench of this Opposition was supposedly reconstituted a fortnight ago. Here they are now saying that the Hawke Labor Government, its Treasurer, Paul Keating, and its Minister for Finance, Senator Peter Walsh, are placing too much priority on and giving too much emphasis to Budget factors in making these decisions. I hope that we do not have the spectacle of other frontbenchers in the Opposition moving motions in this place in respect of their pet areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It happened again today, did it? There is a classic case again of more money being wanted for the Australian Capital Territory, I presume. I hope that we are not going to find individual shadow spokespersons in this rabble, this divided Opposition, calling for Government spending in their own favoured areas and the areas on which they focus. The notice of motion given by Senator Newman just nails members of this Opposition to the mast: they really want high government expenditure in their areas of policy speciality. I believe that this Government has tightened fiscal policy, government spending and taxing to the point where fiscal policy is carrying as much of the total burden as realistically can be expected in policy formulation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important to note that under the Hawke Labor Government incomes policy has played a major role in regulating the Australian economy. The cost of recent wage increases in the public sector is included in the additional funds sought in one of the Appropriation Bills that we are debating today. I refer specifically to the 3 per cent national wage increase which appears in one of the Bills. The recent wage decisions and the wages-tax trade-off highlighted in the April economic statement are the cornerstone of Labor's success as economic managers in this country. When I talk about the incomes policy, I refer to the accord with the Australian Council of Trade Unions. That accord is the fundamental difference between the Labor and conservative parties in this country when it comes to the management of Australia's national economy. During the years of the previous Liberal Government economic policy was characterised by confrontation and division, by a tearing apart of Australia's national fabric, by an increase in unemployment and by a disastrous series of economic events, summarised by our lack of international com- petitiveness. I will certainly be debating that with Senator Stone this afternoon and acquainting him with a few of the factors contributing to the lack of Australia's economic competitiveness under the previous Liberal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor's incomes policy is based on cooperation and consensus through the accord with the trade union movement. As a result of that economic policy, that managed increase in wages and incomes in the economy, we have seen a stark turnaround in the unemployment rate and in the job figures in Australia. For example, I am pleased to note that under the accord with the trade union movement, our economic policies have now resulted in the creation of over 1.4 million new jobs since 1983. People might say that is just a figure, but let us look at the scale of those 1.4 million jobs in relation to the population of this country. For example, the extra 1.4 million new jobs over the six-year period is equivalent to creating a new job for every man, woman and child in the cities of Adelaide and Canberra combined. That is what we are talking about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stone, we are talking about the labour market at the moment. I wish that the Liberal Party would show some interest in the labour market in this country. I sit in this place week after week, month after month, waiting for an urgency motion congratulating this Government on the creation of jobs in this country, on the reduction in unemployment, on the creation of record numbers of job vacancies, but the Opposition will not bring one forward. It seems to think that economics is about financial variables, not about people. It does not seem to see economics and finance as having an end result, and that is creating employment and livelihoods for the Australian people. It is all about exchange rates, inflation indexes and financial variables, which are not really bottom line things in the economic system. They are parts of the economic system. Today I am talking about the fact that under this Government, 1.4 million new jobs have been created, equivalent to the combined populations of Adelaide and Canberra. Senator Stone's record, when he was the Government's chief economic adviser at the Treasury over the road, was the destruction of 186,000 jobs in the last years of the Fraser and Howard Liberal Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are accurate figures, Senator Stone; 186,000 jobs were destroyed around this country as a result of his economic policies and the advice that he gave Mr Howard and Mr Fraser when they were the economic Ministers running this country. It is a disgraceful record when 186,000 of our country men and women were thrown on the industrial scrap heap. They were thrown out of work by the policies of these people. Senator Stone is going to have the cheek to come in here this afternoon and lecture us on this side of the House about Australia's so-called lack of economic competitiveness. I am going to hand it right back to Senator Stone and the other members of the Opposition this afternoon, because they have got it coming to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is the greatest exercise in hypocrisy that I have seen over a six-year period, since I have been here, to have people who destroyed jobs, who actually used unemployment as a tool in this country, lecturing us. That is all they did. They had no other policy, no incomes policy and no accord with the trade union movement-they used unemployment as a lever. They deliberately sat in their very cushy offices over in the Treasury and the Reserve Bank in Sydney and they used unemployment as a tool. They said, `How do we keep down the growth in wage rises in this country? How do we moderate wage cost growth in this country? The idea is to create the reserve army of the unemployed'. In a sense they were Marxists because they believed in the concept of the reserve army of the unemployed. They said, `If you are going to moderate wage growth in Australia, you create slack in the labour market', and that is what they deliberately went about doing under the Fraser-Howard Government. I am sure that was the sort of advice Senator Stone and the Reserve Bank were giving to the Government in 1982. What did we see as the result of that policy? We saw that the Government had to have increasing dollops of unemployment just to produce a given effect on the consumer price index. It said that it would fight inflation first and it found that month after month it had to create more and more slack in the economy because that policy just did not moderate price rises in the Australian economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stone is over there quibbling, but the facts are on the record. The Government had to squeeze the labour market more and more to produce a given effect on the price indexes in Australia. That is the reality, and that is why we won the election in 1983. People were asking last week in Canberra, `Why did John Howard get dumped from the leadership?'. I have been telling the Liberals for six years why John Howard would never be Prime Minister; because people in Australia remembered him as a failed Treasurer. That is what it is all about. He could not get legs as the Leader, because people around Australia remembered the fact that 186,000 people got thrown on the scrap heap in 1982 under the policies of the Liberals. Our consumer price index was out of control, and I will be talking about that this afternoon. I am prepared to repeat these figures this afternoon-an 11.5 per cent increase in prices in Australia when we came to office. That is the reality of the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Maybe the Liberals think that Australians are fools and they do not remember. But when we talk to people around Australia about the problems the Liberal Party leadership had, the reply is always about that failed Treasurer, that man who drove the Australian economy into the ground, aided and abetted of course by Senator Stone, who is sitting here today trying to defend himself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will talk about that this afternoon, Senator Stone. Most of these jobs have been in the private sector. In fact, two-thirds of the new jobs have been full time positions. As a result of that there has been a massive reduction in the unemployment rate. When the Liberals left office and Senator Stone was sitting in the Treasury pulling the economic levers, unemployment was at the double digit level. In fact it peaked at a seasonally adjusted rate of 10.4 per cent during the recession in 1983. Now the unemployment level is not at those rates of the 1930s, which we were experiencing six years ago, it is in the 6 per cent range.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7I4">Senator MAGUIRE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Six years ago the conservatives adopted policies of industrial confrontation. If we summed up the conservatives' approach to economic management in Australia, it would have been to try to take on the trade unions. Their policies were policies of industrial confrontation, as distinct from the policies of consensus and conciliation in the labour market practised by this Labor Government under the accord. The results of those policies of conciliation are there for all to see. For example, there has been a significant reduction in the incidence of industrial disputes in Australia over the last six years. Days lost as a result of industrial disputes in Australia are now at relatively low levels. There has been a massive decline in the number of working days lost, of enormous benefit to employers and businesses. They are not faced with industrial disruption and their cost levels have come down as a result of the reduction in the number of strikes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am pleased to note that in recent years in my own State of South Australia the level of industrial disputes has reached the Japanese level. I do not hear any members of the Opposition calling out, `Well, that is really wonderful news'. Japan has always been paraded in front of Australia as being some sort of economic superpower, which it is, and, according to the Opposition, having very sensible labour relations policies. They are the sorts of things it puts forward. In States such as South Australia, because of policies under both a State Labor Government and the Federal Labor Government, we have policies of industrial conciliation and industrial cooperation and the incidence of strikes is now lower than in West Germany and approximately equal to the Japanese level. For that reason South Australia received the go-ahead from the Hawke Labor Government to develop the replacements for Australia's submarine fleet. I believe that one of the key reasons for my State of South Australia being chosen for the fabrication and assembly line site for the Australian submarine fleet was the very low industrial relations problems in that State. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the key policies we will be putting into place from 1 July will be the wage and tax trade-off to help reduce inflation. We are taking to the Australian people a round of personal income tax cuts, increases in family allowance payments, increases in family assistance payments and significant increases in pensions. As a result of the wage and family allowance payments we see that the Government can help play a significant role in reducing the level of inflation in Australia by granting higher after-tax income to people through government programs rather than encouraging workers to seek the same after-tax income through large wage rises. We see enormous benefits for businesses and employers in Australia and for Australia's international competitiveness in going down that road and awarding significant tax cuts rather than encouraging very large wage rises. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most important things to mention is the increase in family allowance payments and the further increase in the family allowance supplement. It is very important to note that since the Menzies Government introduced the original child endowment payment of five shillings a week in about 1940, and under the various programs that followed on from that, no government in Australia has ever adjusted family allowance payments or child endowment payments for increases in the cost of living. We know that families spend those allowances typically on food and clothing for their children. Those allowances in the past have never been protected against the increase in the cost of living. From January next year the Hawke Labor Government will make the first ever cost of living increase to family allowance payments and to the new family allowance supplement payments. The dependent spouse rebate provided for on the personal income tax form will also be adjusted for inflation. As a result of those measures, employees will find from 1 January, in subsequent months, very significant increases in their after-tax income and their family disposable income effectively equivalent to quite significant wage rises. Those increases in family allowance payments and wages will be equivalent to about half the cost of the wage rises employees otherwise would need to get from employers. </PARA>
<PARA> The trade union movement, through the accord with the Government, has agreed to keep wages growth to about 6 1/2 per cent next financial year-an unprecedented figure when we consider that Australia's economy is booming and growing very rapidly. Normally in such circumstances we would find extraordinarily large wage rises occurring, but the Government has an agreement with the trade unions to keep wages growth to about 6 1/2 per cent next financial year. We calculate that, as a result of the tax cuts and the increased family assistance payments, employees will obtain increases in their after-tax income equivalent to wage rises of about 12 per cent. We are saying that it is better to give tax cuts and increase family allowances than to boost wages directly-that helps the competitiveness of the Australian economy-but the bottom line is that these tax cuts will produce wage-equivalent rises next financial year of about 12 per cent. There will be a very large increase in household purchasing power next financial year as a result of these increases. It is a pity Senator Stone has left the chamber; I was half way through giving him a lecture on economics a while ago. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stone is opposed to them. I will be referring to this this afternoon. I will ask Senator Stone what his attitude to these tax cuts is. The reason we have brought these tax cuts in is very much in line with the terms of the urgency motion which will be moved in this place by Senator Stone this afternoon about increasing Australia's international competitiveness. That is what it is all about. It is about giving Australian families higher disposable income, higher after-tax income, without creating huge wage burdens for employers. We are keeping down the growth of wage costs in Australia to a figure of about 6 1/2 per cent next year by giving significant personal income tax cuts from 1 July.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have made the point. It is most unfortunate that Senator Stone was not here to say what his position is on these personal income tax cuts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Appropriation and Supply Bills. Senator Stone, on behalf of the Opposition, has foreshadowed an amendment which, in part, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . but the Senate condemns the Government for its failure to pursue policies which will address the twin evils of a dangerous level of foreign debt and declining living standards, leading to a growing loss of control over the future of Australia . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment goes on to particularise the details of the Government's failure in seven paragraphs. I propose to address a part of this amendment. I refer to the clear ministerial and administrative incompetence of a tired and blundering government. Any listener who likes to pick up any of today's newspapers will find stories of ministerial and administrative incompetence. I picked the Australian Financial Review to look at today because it is not known as a paper which supports the Liberal and National parties. For many years it has clearly been a great supporter of the Hawke Government. I will refer to two stories in today's Financial Review. One story reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Tax man gets it wrong: The Australian Taxation Office has said there are too many errors in the advice it gives in response to inquiries from taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA>The article quotes Mr Brian Nolan as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> We have found that the error rate is very high but we still get more right than we get wrong. </PARA>
<PARA>That is marvellous, is it not? The quote continues:</PARA>
<PARA>working very hard to upgrade the standard of the inquiry people generally. </PARA>
<PARA>That same newspaper carried a story about the Australian Customs Service. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> The National Crime Authority will examine the effectiveness of the Australian Customs Service in stopping the smuggling of drugs . . . Customs staffing had been static for the past three years and the numbers involved in barrier duty had declined. </PARA>
<PARA>They are two stories of administrative incompetence by this Government. That is just an introduction to what I propose to say about this tired, blundering Government. As I said, if we pick up any newspaper anywhere in Australia today we will find such stories. In yesterday's Australian Financial Review there was a story about the Senate rejecting an Opposition copyright move. Both the Opposition and the Australian Democrats moved amendments to the Copyright Amendment Bill. The story states:</PARA>
<PARA> A Government spokesman said that it had not supported either amendment because of the complexity of the issue. Insufficient time had been allowed for proper debate to take place, he said. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government, not the Opposition, controls the debate in this chamber. This is another example of this Government's administrative incompetence. The Government did not support either of the two amendments that were before this place because it needed to apply its mind to these complex issues. I thought that was what governments were all about. But it did not have time to do so and it rejected the amendments. As I said, the Government controls the time for debate in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> The front page of an edition of the Melbourne Sun published last week carried the headline `We got it wrong'. That article referred to the speech by the retiring Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia in which he acknowledged that the Government has got its economic policy wrong and that Australians will have to face falling living standards because of these economic disasters. That is all coming about because this Government is tired, worn out and its Ministers have run out of steam. Its Ministers no longer can come up with the ideas that are needed to generate the process of making decisions. This process started during the last Australian Labor Party election campaign when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) got it desperately wrong. On 23 June 1987 he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Interest rates are falling and under Labor will continue to fall. Labor will continue to pursue policies which will allow interest rates to fall further. </PARA>
<PARA>He told the people of Australia absolute nonsense in order to get the Labor Party re-elected. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) both acknowledged in the Parliament yesterday that the only way the Government can stem the demand in the economy at present-demand which the Government intends to feed by a tax cut of $30 and which the Labor Party is claiming is not a bribe for the purpose of an election-and retain the value of the Australian dollar overseas is by further increases in interest rates. The Government is predicting further increases. Yet back in the election campaign of 1987 the Prime Minister conned the people of this nation and told them an absolute lie. I am sorry, Madam Acting Deputy President, I think I have to withdraw that word. </PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Finance, who, in many ways, has been the only person on the Government side with the courage and the determination to try to make changes in the economy which need to be made, is tired, worn out and, unfortunately, is now making mistakes. Yesterday in this place he had to acknowledge that he had made a mistake last October when he said that the current account deficit would not exceed 4 per cent in the first 10 months of the financial year. Of course, it has exceeded that. The Government's prediction that the deficit would not be in excess of $9.5 billion is absolutely wrong. That was its Budget figure. We now know that the deficit is currently over $14 billion and that at the end of the year it will clearly be around $17 billion. Imagine what would happen if the budget figure of a public company were so far out, if it had a budget deficit of $9.5 billion and the end result was a deficit of about $17 billion. This is a clear indication that the Minister for Finance is worn out and tired and has lost his drive. Clearly, the Treasurer is in the same boat. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh and I served on a Senate committee together for a period of time. As members of that committee, he and I grew to respect each other. Back in the middle of March Senator Walsh flew to Canberra with his wife, having made up his mind to get out of Cabinet. Apparently he brought his wife here so that they could say their farewells. He had deliberately decided that he wanted to retire from the Parliament because he was tired, burned out and thoroughly fed up. The Sydney Morning Herald states that Senator Walsh was:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . utterly fed up with the way the Cabinet was behaving. He had run out of both energy and patience. </PARA>
<PARA>Why was he fed up? He was fed up because Cabinet was trying to cope with a decision about a third runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport-a problem which has beset this Government for about six years. The Government failed to take up the decision which the Liberal and National parties made in their last year of office in 1982, which was to build the third runway at Sydney. Yet Senator Walsh, six years down the track, was unable to persuade this Government to make that decision. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer talked him out of resigning. An article in the Australian Financial Review of 23 March said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . they told him his departure would be a terrible blow for the Government because it would be seen as a vote of no confidence in its economic management and a symptom of a Government in decline. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister and the Treasurer recognised how symbolic Senator Walsh's departure would be. The honourable senator was talked out of taking that action because it would have been seen as a symbol of a government in decline.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me remind the Senate what the Government did about Sydney Airport: it made the Clayton's decision. It decided that a third runway would be built if the environmental impact statement, which it was about to put into motion and the results of which it expected to receive in 18 months' time, said that it was all right. Have honourable senators ever heard a decision which is not a decision expressed in such terms? That is exactly what the Government said: `We will have an environmental impact statement. We look forward to receiving it in 18 months'-by which time, it knew, it would probably be out of office-`and then we will decide whether or not to build the third runway'. In the meantime we have the crisis of people trying to fly into this country. At present, one of our greatest revenue earners is tourism, yet people are unable to get into Sydney because of the absolute mess at that terminal. If the Government had taken up the decision made by us in our last year of office, the third runway would by now be completed, and the mess would not exist. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government tried to con the people of Australia into believing that calling for an environmental impact statement-a report to be made in 18 months' time, followed by a decision-was a decision. Did the Government believe that Mr Hawke's credibility with the Australian people was such that they could be conned into believing that that was a decision? Of course, Senator Walsh knew that that was nonsense, and he decided that it was time to get out. However, out of loyalty to his party, he stayed. </PARA>
<PARA> But he is now making mistakes. Yesterday he acknowledged that he had been mistaken in his prediction, in percentage terms, of the current account deficit. Let me relate another mistake that he has made within the last couple of days. I refer to the cutting of Austel's budget by 20 per cent before the body actually gets established. Let me tell the Senate about Austel. As Mr Hawke acknowledged in the course of the 1987 campaign, there is a desperate need in this country for micro-economic reform-fixing up things so that they work better; trying to introduce some competition so that people work harder for better results; trying to improve productivity and quality; trying to do things more cheaply; trying to reduce the cost of shipping goods around Australia; trying to fix up the problems of transport. </PARA>
<PARA> We spend an absolute fortune importing communications equipment. Here, the Government said that it would do something about micro-economic reform. It decided to create a body, called Austel, to regulate that reform. The coalition parties say that in this area the Government has not gone far enough, and in that regard we have major criticisms of the Government. But at least it was doing something. It said, `We will create Austel to regulate this industry, instead of allowing Telecom to be both the regulator and one of the participants'. But before Austel starts operating on 1 July the Government has slashed its budget by $1m. In its first year Austel was to have $5m to enable it to get established, but that figure has been cut by 20 per cent, and, as a result, its staff will be reduced from 70 to 58. I say to Senator Walsh, who has talked long, in this Parliament and in public statements, about the need for micro-economic reform, that this is another example of a government blundering from mistake to mistake as it continues down the path of failing to address the real issues of the nation, failing to take the necessary action to bring about some competition in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, we are facing a deficit for this year of nearly $17,000m. We need to take steps to overcome that. The Government has its difficulties in the macro-economy. It has difficulty with interest rates. If interest rates are lowered, the value of the Australian dollar will collapse, and the Government will have great difficulty in paying the interest on its borrowings. In the past 10 days the Australian dollar has fallen by about 5c, resulting in an increase of about $2m in the amount of money that the country needs to earn in order to make those payments. That is what a simple fall can do. It is the sort of problem that the Government is facing in what is called the macro-economy-holding the dollar up with interest rates, while hoping and praying that commodity prices will not fall, hoping and praying that the prices we get for our wheat, our wool and our coal will not fall. It is the good prices that we are getting for those products that currently are keeping our deficit at what the Government is apparently satisfied is a modest figure-$17,000m. </PARA>
<PARA> If the value of our wool clip or of wheat or of coal on the world market falls drastically, the bottom will fall out of the value of the Australian dollar. Similarly, if the Government lowers interest rates, the value of the Australian dollar will fall drastically. So the Government is locked into high interest rates. It is locked into trying to knock the demand out of the market-and it is doing just that. Talking to business people around the country at present, I get the impression that the retailers have reduced their buying considerably. No doubt, in due course the Bureau of Statistics will tell us that this happened in May, but I am telling honourable senators now that it is happening already. As a result of this Government's policies, demand is falling considerably. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the Government is therefore locked into these policies in the macro-economy. However, it could do something about the micro-economy. But what has it done? It has put Mr Willis in charge of the Department of Transport and Communications, and micro-economic reform in that Department has stopped dead because Mr Willis is not prepared to take the tough decisions that need to be taken. That is why Senator Walsh is worn out. That is why Senator Walsh is tired. He is sick of hammering Cabinet Ministers about the need for these reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has lost its vision totally. It is floundering in a hopeless morass of indecision. It is unable to make the important decisions, unable to govern, and the sooner we throw it out, the better. The Governor of the Reserve Bank has made it perfectly clear that the Government has made terrible mistakes during the last 12 months. In a recent speech to the National Farmers Federation, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> How fast can you expand the economy without running your head into inflation and running your head into balance of payments problems? The answer is most times not very far, and at the present juncture is zero. </PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to say that we are overdoing it, that we have to cut back. The Governor of the Reserve Bank is saying that the future under this Government will bring negative growth. We are talking about a recession. We may be talking about far more than a recession because of the way this Government is governing, or not governing, this country. Is it any wonder that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer can think of only one thing, that is, to get the next election over with as quickly as they possibly can? If there is a window of opportunity, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer will be through it and into an election campaign in a flash. The window of opportunity opens on 1 July this year when a half-Senate election becomes an option. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us see whether the Prime Minister and the Treasurer can con the people once again that interest rates may fall for a very short period, or whether they can con the people into believing that they are going down the right path. If they can, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer will be through the window of opportunity and into an election campaign in a flash. We understand why. It is because the Governor of the Reserve Bank has told us that we are looking at negative growth-that is, a recession-next year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has acknowledged the mistakes that he has made. He recently said that the Government would have no hesitation in tightening policy-that means all arms of policy, including interest rates. Notwithstanding the present high interest rates, the Treasurer as recently as last week said that they will have to be tightened further. When one economic journalist asked the Treasurer, `Are you talking also about wages policy?', the Treasurer said, `No, wages policy is as tight as a drum'. What nonsense that is! What the Treasurer meant was that the Government was tightly locked into a deal with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and that it was not game to break the deal to give a tax rebate of $30 and a wage increase because it knows that that will destroy the accord and there will be a wages breakout, the likes of which we have not seen for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Treasurer said last week that wages policy was as tight as a drum. But what did the Prime Minister say last night? When asked about economic policy last night the Prime Minister said, `We are looking at the way in which all the arms of policy are operating'. When asked whether that included monetary and fiscal policy, the Prime Minister replied, `And wages policy, too'. The Prime Minister contradicted the Treasurer. Is any further evidence needed that this Government is blundering from indecision to indecision to the detriment of this nation?</PARA>
<PARA> We know that the Government knows what ought to be done. We know that the Government knows we ought to be looking at some form of wage pause or wage freeze. That is the thing, together with the breaking of the drought and the recovery from the world recession, which fixed the economy in 1983. This Government has benefited from the Fraser Government's wage pause-not from anything that the Labor Party did when it was elected in 1983. It benefited from those three factors over which it had no control. The Government goes on blundering from one thing to another. As I said earlier, the Governor of the Reserve Bank made the position clear when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The major miscalculation that we all made, including myself, was to underestimate the power of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>He also admitted that the Government had not properly thought out the impact on demand of its April wage-tax deal. I have been talking about incompetence. The Governor of the Reserve Bank has acknowledged the Government's incompetence by saying that the Government had not properly thought out the impact on demand of its April wage-tax deal. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has run out of steam. I can recall at one stage of this Government's term of office someone saying that it was the best Liberal government the nation ever had. I totally disagreed with that; nevertheless, people on the Labor side of politics were saying that it was the best Liberal government the nation had ever had. This Government has now run into a brick wall. Government members were saying that it was a time when the Government was showing initiative, bringing about change and demonstrating that there were things that could be done. We have been talking now for five or six years about the desperate need to change activities so as to take the country forward into a productive, competitive economy which will keep down prices to the benefit of the people-an economy under which we stop taxing people to their death, so that it is not necessary to tax ordinary wage earners at the rate of 40c in the dollar, and so that it is not necessary for a married couple with a couple of little children to have an income of over $623 a week in order to survive. That is what has happened under the Labor Government. To live in, say, Sydney, a young couple needs $623 a week to survive, which forces the wife to work, notwithstanding the number and age of her children. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has done absolutely nothing worthwhile for this country since the election in July 1987. The last two years have been totally wasted as it has blundered from one incompetent indecision to another incompetent indecision. It is time the people of Australia threw the Hawke Labor Government out and put in a government which has the determination to make the necessary changes to bring about the reform that this country needs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating cognately some Appropriation Bills. In that context, I would like to speak about the need for productivity increase in Australia. I would like to say something about the accord and how the union movement and others have benefited from it. Cooperation between the union movement and management in this country has advanced considerably over the last few years. I have just been speaking to somebody from the Prices Surveillance Authority. It is interesting to note the comments made by that body, which was set up in March 1984. At that time there was no proven record of wage restraint. There was some unease in the business sector as to how the Government would operate. But since that time this Government has proved that through the accord a rationalisation of wage increases can take place. Business has been given a very thorough and a very profitable context in which to proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is now proper to discuss the decision made by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, as it was then called, in August of last year, when it laid down certain principles in the national wage case. It is in the light of those principles that there is now movement towards award restructuring. If one looks at the record of this Government since it came to power in March 1983 it can be said proudly that the productivity of this country has been given a most fruitful context in which to move forward. There has been a realisation that there is a need for cooperation between management and people on the shop floor, on building sites and elsewhere. Of course, from time to time there are problems. For example, last night I spoke of the problem that arose in North Melbourne and I think in another place in Northcote with Henderson's Industries Ltd. </PARA>

If one looks at the circumstances, one can sympathise with those actions. At the same time I have to say that those actions create problems for the economy. But they are not the sorts of problems that can be solved simply by saying that one section of the community should bear all the burdens, that section being the people who actually produce the goods and the services, the workers on the shop floor or on the building site. There is a need to understand that there must be trade-offs between employer and employee, trade-offs between workers and management. Unless that approach is taken there will be difficulties in making award restructuring as profitable as it might otherwise be.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly did not take any money for it. I was there in an observer capacity. What came out was that the employer groups on that occasion-simply on that occasion-were premature in bringing that application. The Commission found, I think fairly, that the employers were unprepared, at that point in time, to discuss fully and properly how award restructuring might go on. I will speak of some of the propositions put from time to time by employers which on reflection would be better not put. For example, they have asked workers to work 12 hours a day, three days a week. There was one suggestion that the hours per year be worked out and that once people had worked those hours, in whatever period of the year that management chose, that would be sufficient for the year. The hours could be worked perhaps in nine months. For the other three months the worker would not be employed and the wages paid would be paid not in terms of overtime worked per day but in terms of overtime worked beyond the total yearly hours. When one thinks of the need for people to enjoy family life and to enjoy a reasonable and steady income over a full year, those propositions become quite absurd.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a need to think not only in terms of the economy but also in terms of the sort of society that we wish to live in. It becomes quite oppressive if people are asked to work unreasonably long hours and under poor working conditions for pay which is at times sufficient to sustain only the most frugal of living. The problems come not so much from top management but from middle management and from the way those people who are in direct control of the work force conduct themselves. We are a more sophisticated society than was the case in the nineteenth century. People are now better educated and have a better understanding. There is less need for the master-servant relationship than there used to be. Instead, there is a need for cooperation between those who manage and make ultimate decisions and the people who actually do the work. If that cooperation is forthcoming production will increase. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, it is on that basis that many of Japan's industries have made the startling advances that they have. In many of Japan's successful industries there exists a cooperation between the work force and management. It is in that context that the move towards award restructuring is taken. If properly carried out award restructuring will set out career paths for people employed in industry and elsewhere, will set up an opportunity for that work force to earn more and will set up an opportunity for industry to become more productive. It will provide Australia with a better educated work force, and with a management that is more sophisticated and is better able to appreciate the true needs of any particular industry. In that way, Australia will go forward as, indeed, it must. </PARA>
<PARA> That happy situation will not be obtained if either side is put under undue and unwarranted attack. A disaster could occur in the future if either management, the people who manage and control business, or the work force, through the unions, is put under unreasonable attack. Unfortunately, the unions are often put under undue and unwarranted attack in this chamber. Recently, for example, there has been much discussion on the waterfront industries, the railway unions and others. If members of the Opposition were to come to power and were to pursue their present industrial policies, much harm could be done. It seems to me that there is an intent in many of their policies so to confine, restrict and restrain the unions that they would not properly be able to carry out their necessary functions in the interests of the work force of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is talk of bargaining at the shop level rather than at industry level. There is talk of moving away from an accord to people bargaining to the best of their ability, which usually means that those with industrial strength-for example, those who have skills which are in short supply-get very large wage increases compared with those granted to workers who do not have industrial strength. It may be argued that that would encourage people to obtain skills. In my view it would not; it would lock them into a situation in which they and their children and grandchildren would be held down because of their inability to get out of their particular situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Skills can be developed through colleges of technical and further education and other education facilities. The question then becomes who should pay-how much industry should pay, how much the Government should pay and how much the workers themselves should pay. Those issues will be discussed over the next few months. It seems to me that this Parliament should be facing those issues rather than attacks being made in this chamber willy-nilly without an analysis of the best way forward. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems is that the Industrial Relations Commission itself has not made clear what it means by award restructuring. I had hoped that the decision of the full Commission setting parameters within which people were to discuss these issues would be given by now. I do not think it has come down yet but it is expected to come down quite soon. Once that happens, the way that the Commission intends discussions about award restructuring to proceed will become clear. Certainly, there are already reasonably well defined guidelines. Efficiencies should be built into the system, the productivity advances that we all desire should be looked to in any awards that are restructured, and efficiency and productivity should be increased. That will be done through a more highly skilled work force and, hopefully, increases in pay. It is quite clear that, if the work force is to continue to make sacrifices and is now to develop greater skills, it ought to be remunerated. It would be unfortunate if the work force were to obtain extra skills and not be paid for them. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the issues that we should be looking to over the next few months to ensure the skilling of the work force and to ensure that the education not only of the workers but also of management can improve so that productivity can increase. This Government has set the pattern for that. It has provided a means whereby people can receive higher and better education. For instance, one Bill before us is entitled `An Act to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988, and for related purposes'. In the context of skilling the work force, this Government has made astonishing advances. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the issues to be dealt with is the audit of skills already available in the workplace. The skill auditing process should be done on a cooperative basis. It is for both management and workers to judge which skills are already there. It would be disastrous if management were to claim management prerogative and say, `We as managers will decide which skills are already there and what awards ought to be paid in respect of them'. Again, it is a matter for cooperation and it is that feeling of cooperation, that inculcation of a culture in which there is cooperation across industry and across all of those engaged in it, which will lead this country forward. </PARA>
<PARA> That could well become the most distinguishing feature between the policies of this Government and those of the Opposition because, unfortunately, the rhetoric from the other side is that of the adversary picking out one party in the industrial scene and attacking it. What is really needed is an approach in which the various players in the field, in the industrial scene, are encouraged and asked to cooperate and are given proper rewards. The track record of this Government since 1983 shows that it has the program by which this can be done. It will continue to pursue that line and to pursue it successfully. It has the runs on the board. It has the people in jobs-well over one million more of them. Industry has boomed. Investment is high. With some adjustments and considerable sacrifice still to be made, this country can go forward in the 1990s much better off than it was in the 1970s. It will be a decade of the Hawke Labor Government working in cooperation with the union movement which will give this country a flourishing economy in the 1990s. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How many senators watched the television program Nobody's Children which was shown last week? Did our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) or his minders bother to familiarise themselves with the plight of these abused and forgotten children? Did the Treasurer (Mr Keating) see the program? If they did, is the Prime Minister still willing to say that he is on track with his promise at the last election that by 1990 no child will be living in poverty? What absolute rubbish that statement was. The Prime Minister has abused and used those forgotten children. He has used them for his own political purposes, giving them promises and expectations that he knew at the time could never be fulfilled. In the lead-up to an election, this Government will promise anything and will use and abuse anybody for its own political purposes just to give its grinning face some credibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australians are no longer prepared to accept the promises. Earlier this year Mr Hawke promised that interest rates would fall. Since then they have been increased by all the banks and lending societies. The Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Bob Johnston, said that brutal adjustments are needed. He has made it quite clear that those adjustments are now necessary because the world's greatest Treasurer has let our debt and inflation run riot just because he is unable to make the hard decisions that are necessary. It is no use Mr Keating, in his usual fashion of abuse and intimidation, abusing the Governor of the Reserve Bank for being too honest. Someone has got to be honest and the Government certainly is not. It is important that the Treasurer be honest with the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that we no longer hear about his J-curve. At least he has had the decency to give up the J-curve theory. How could he do otherwise when we know that in the first 10 months of 1988-89 Australia's deficit on the current account of our balance of payments has already reached $14,040m compared with the Treasurer's Budget forecast of $9,500m for the whole of the year? After only 10 months we have had a rise of just on $5,000m. Many forecasters are now predicting that for 1988-89 the deficit will be as high as $17,000m. Bearing in mind that Bob Hawke said that interest rates would fall, we know that, despite the present extremely high interest rates, the Treasurer said on 16 May that, if necessary, interest rates will rise even further. </PARA>
<PARA> People are hurting out there. Young families are selling their homes. As we go around our electorates we see more houses up for sale than we have seen since 1983. Last month the housing interest payments of just one family that I was talking to had gone up an additional $76. It is not just that. Since this Government has been in power, the personal tax of these same people has gone up by over 87 per cent. The Government has clawed back $35.2 billion this year compared with $18.8 billion when we were in government. That is not the consumer price index (CPI) increase; it is this Government's increase. The amount has very nearly doubled. </PARA>
<PARA> That is only for starters. Remember Mr Keating's choice of option C at the summit conference that was to introduce a consumption tax of 12 1/2 per cent? We all remember what happened to that. We all know that Mr Hawke, in a motel room, along with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, scuppered that proposal in a hurry and left Mr Keating high and dry. But that did not stop Mr Keating. He has still, very surreptitiously, gone down that road. Sales tax revenue-and this is on top of personal tax-has more than doubled. It has gone up by over 147 per cent under this Government. The Government never tells us about this. The housewife does not know that she is paying 36c to the Government every time she buys orange juice-a sales tax rate of 10 per cent. Every time she buys her washing powder she pays $1.93-nearly $2-to the Government. This is on top of her personal tax. She does not realise that; and the Government does not tell her. </PARA>
<PARA> How many of the families are aware that they are paying 20 per cent sales tax on biscuits they buy? On Milo they pay 10 per cent. Let me give a few examples because the people are completely unaware of the situation. There is 30 per cent sales tax on articles such as watches, clocks, cameras, film and slide projectors. There is 20 per cent sales tax on beer and wine. Of course, there is an excise duty on top of that. A 20 per cent sales tax is imposed on all our soft drinks, like Coke, and on cosmetics. Every time a woman puts lipstick on she pays an additional 20 per cent to the Government. Every time she buys toilet rolls, tissues or toothpaste she pays 20 per cent sales tax. Every time she feeds her pet-her dog or her cat-20 per cent goes to the Government. Every time she buys a wheelbarrow or garden fork she pays 20 per cent sales tax. There is 20 per cent sales tax on flavoured milk. The list goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at items which are subject to a 10 per cent sales tax. When people buy blankets they pay 10 per cent to the Government. If they buy a tea-towel they pay 10 per cent to the Government. Every time they buy a packet of potato crisps the Government grabs back 10 per cent. Every time they buy a cup and saucer or a glass they pay 10 per cent. Every time people strike a match they pay 10 per cent to the Government. The list goes on and on and on. Every time new home owners buy something to furnish their houses they pay 10 per cent sales tax. They pay 10 per cent on all soft goods such as curtaining. Every time they buy brooms, buckets, rubbish bins, fridges, heaters, stoves, kettles, vacuum cleaners, washing machines, sewing machines and knitting machines, they pay 10 per cent to the Government. How many people are aware that the Government has increased those sales tax items by 147 per cent since coming into office? That is only for starters. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the other taxes that this Government has raked in. There is an enormous list: the abolition of the housing interest rebate, tax on lump sum superannuation payments, the abolition of the health insurance rebate, an increase in the concessional expenditure threshold, the introduction of the Medicare levy, the prescribed payments system, the medical expenses rebate, negative gearing, and capital gains tax. We all remember Mr Hawke's promise prior to the election when he said, `Let me make it clear in words that even the Opposition can understand that there will be no capital gains tax'. What did he do as soon as he got in? He introduced a capital gains tax. The list continues: the abolition of the deduction of entertainment expenses, restrictions on tax free threshold, substantiation of employment related expenses, fringe benefits tax, an increase in the Medicare levy, the abolition of dividend income rebate, the quarterly payment of provisional tax, the foreign tax credit system, the abolition of accelerated depreciation, tax on superannuation contributions, the tax file numbering system, tax on government business enterprises, tax on foreign income, and the gold tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us see how some of those have increased. When the Government introduced the Medicare levy in 1983-84 it collected $365m. Five years later it has increased from $365m to $2,315m. That is the figure it has increased to, yet the promise was that it would remain stagnant. When the Government brought in the prescribed payments system in 1983-84, it collected $251m. Today it is collecting $1,175m. Fringe benefits tax has doubled in three years. It has gone from $535m in 1986-87 to an estimated figure of $1 billion this year, which is a big increase. I have already dealt with the sales tax. When we were in government we collected $30m in debits tax. Under this Government it has risen to $360m, which is an increase of 1,000 per cent. We are being told that the figures for capital gains tax are not yet available. There are no figures available for 1987-88 and no estimate has been given for 1988-89. What is the Government hiding there? How many people know that they are paying 28c a litre direct to the Government every time they buy a litre of petrol at the service station? The revenue collected in crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas and petroleum products excise has gone up by 34.61 per cent since this Government came into office. The total taxation revenue collected by this Government since it came to office has increased by 99.88 per cent. What is the Government doing with it? In five years the Government has increased the total taxation revenue by nearly 100 per cent. It has increased it not by 50 per cent, but by nearly 100 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government cannot keep taking taxes from the people at the rate that it is. It cannot keep taking more and more from Australian families. It must realise that there is a limit. Family taxes have nearly doubled. Home interest rates have gone from 13 per cent to 16 per cent or 17 per cent-if families are lucky enough to have got their loan from a bank. Yet Mr Keating keeps telling us that all is well, that we are not the banana republic that our neighbours see us as, that there will be no child living in poverty under the Hawke-Keating Government, and that everything is on track. The people out there just do not believe the Government. They will prove that when Mr Hawke does decide to go to the electorate. People are sick of paying the taxes they are paying to the Government. Knowing that the economy is in crisis, people have been willing to pay taxes to get us out of the mess. They are not willing to pay taxes that only increase the mess. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few comments on the appropriation for the Antarctic Division, particularly the matter of the letting of the tenders for the Antarctic replacement vessel. This follows on questions that I asked the Estimates Committee D on 13 April. It was brought to my attention because there was a lot of concern about the replacement vessel for the ill-fated Nella Dan. Accusations were raised both before and in Estimates that unfair advantages were given to some tenderers and that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) had caused some irregularities to occur in the tendering process so as to favour the Carrington shipyard in New South Wales prior to the last New South Wales State election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Ralfs, who was one of the tenderers, queried the Minister on how or why his submission was altered. The answer that was received in Estimates from the Deputy Director of the Antarctic Division was that there was an error in the information that went to the Minister but that it was not material to any decisions and did not influence any decisions. When asked by Senator Puplick how Mr Ralfs became aware of that incorrect information, or misrepresentation of information, Mr Blunn's answer was, `We do not know the answer to that question'. He went on to say, `I am satisfied there was no evidence to suggest'-et cetera. There was a certain amount of speculation about how Mr Ralfs found out that his submission had been altered. I do not think that question has ever been satisfactorily answered. I believe that some attempt should have been made to answer those questions, to be fair to everybody. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that in the letting of tenders for his vessel the overseas tenders for construction and operation were much less than their Australian counterparts. Quite obviously, to judge from what has transpired, the overseas bidders were warned off so that the vessel could be Australian built and manned, for political reasons. It did not stop there. Even when the Australian tenders were looked at, the lowest tender, submitted by Australian Shipbuilding Industries (WA) Pty Ltd, was outbid on a commercial basis by  P and O Polar Australia Pty Ltd. It had received a subsidy from the then New South Wales Labor Government so that the vessel could be conveniently built in New South Wales. As I said, this was just prior to the last State election. There is no question that the Minister, Senator Richardson, was in this right up to his neck. </PARA>
<PARA> It was further revealed in Estimates that the Minister announced the selection of the P and O Polar contract before contracts had actually been negotiated. I think that is the crux of the whole problem. The concern I have is that the Australian taxpayers have been ripped off because of what the Minister did and the way he did it. Senator Puplick asked:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the announcement by the Minister, I take it, of the selection of P and O Polar as the successful tenderer before the contract had actually been negotiated. Was that announcement made before the contract had been negotiated?</PARA>
<PARA>Quite rightly the Secretary, Mr Blunn, replied that yes, it was. That is a rather unusual way of doing things. I would have thought in this day and age that to gain every advantage for the Australian taxpayer perhaps a bit more prudent housekeeping should have been done. Again one would have to ask why that was done. The answer of course was so that P and O Polar would get the contract, subsidised by the New South Wales Labor Government and built by the Carrington shipyards. I do not think there is any question that overseas operators and builders could have provided a better and cheaper vessel. In fact the estimates show that it would have been about half the price. </PARA>
<PARA> Further questioning showed that the Deputy Director was sent overseas early last year to inspect add-ons that could improve the capabilities of the vessel. But when I asked whether there had been regular inspections of the vessel and how many, we found at first that that could not be answered. Later on the Deputy Director remembered that an officer had been up there three times. I would have thought that once a project of such importance to this country was started, where the powers that be send the Deputy Director overseas at taxpayers' expense to find out all the latest technology that could be added to this vessel, someone would have shown an interest. Instead, no-one seemed to be showing any, or very little, interest in the whole project. At the moment everybody is waiting to see when the vessel is going to be finished. Regardless of all the promises, because of the sloppy way this whole matter has been handled by this Minister, we have to query whether the vessel will be available for the 1989-90 Antarctic season. If it is not, only time will tell how much more money is going to be squandered on this project. Quite a few questions of mine were not satisfactorily answered in the Estimates Committee. I would like to place the Minister on notice that I will be asking further questions in the committee stage about this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make just a few observations about the whole fiasco. I would not argue that a strong argument can be put, and was put, that there were, and are, certain advantages in having an Australian-built and crewed vessel. My main argument is that, because of the way that this matter has been handled by the Minister, it has cost the taxpayer far more than it should have. Whatever figures we use, it would be fair to say that originally the overseas crewed and manned vessel would cost about $7m per annum for a 10-year contract, while the Australian equivalent, I believe, ended up at about $10m per annum. The Minister's exuberance in letting the New South Wales electorate know that the preferred tender was for the P and O Polar ship to be built at Carringtons in New South Wales had the effect of protracting negotiations for six months, and that deferred the starting date of the vessel by that time. That is why I believe there was a big doubt about whether this vessel would be available when it should be. That will mean that this Government will then have to turn around and negotiate further contracts at great expense for leasing another vessel for the forthcoming season, and it will put our endeavours in that future world park that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) would like to see in Antarctica further behind. When answering a question about the timing of the announcement, the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the decision to announce was part of the Cabinet decision. I think that should also be on the record. </PARA>
<PARA>It may have been part of the Cabinet decision, but I would seriously ask whether the Cabinet was aware that the Minister was going to do it when he did. By letting the tenderer know that it was going to get the contract and then, by some means or other, the Deputy Director in a very unprecedented action sending off a letter of intent also, this allowed the tenderer not only to delay the negotiations but also to negotiate a much higher price without any comeback. In fact it could be about $25m. I think that figure could be-and I hope it will be-backed up by some of the answers I get to my question in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very disappointed with some of the answers I received, as I said earlier. One that concerned me was when I asked what the actual contract price was, and I was told it was $124m all up. When I asked further, `Have you any idea what the actual price is now?', I was fobbed off by being told that in arriving at that price there were a number of variables, including the operation of cost inflation factors. That is fine, but I do not believe that was a satisfactory answer, because I believe that the figure of $124m was arrived at in such a way as to include the variables and the cost inflation factors. I asked: Why then could not the same factors be used to give me and the Senate an all up cost? I think the answer is that this matter has been so embarrassing to the Minister that his officers were told to keep quiet about it and not to cause too much flak. </PARA>
<PARA> We went on for quite some time asking further questions. It is fair to say that there was no doubt about the answers that we received. I asked whether there were cheaper vessels available of a similar type to that which was needed, and it was admitted that there were. There was an offer made by a company called Reiber, which would have put a vessel in Australia and which we would probably be using now for about half the cost. I would have asked, given all the facts that we have had before us-I do agree that it would be more preferable to have an Australian tenderer and Australian crewing-how far we go to promote local industry and the use of local labour when, in this shabby exercise, the taxpayers look like paying about $60m to $70m more than they should. That does not include the inconvenience that has been caused to the Antarctic program for 1989-90 and the probability that there is going to be another great expense foisted on the Antarctic Division when it has to charter another ship for the 1989-90 season. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise for a few moments to speak on the appropriations for the parliamentary departments for the year ended 30 June 1990 and for other departments for additional appropriations which have been made in respect of the year ending 30 June 1989. I rise because I believe that the level of funding for the Parliament at present requires us to address the fundamental question of the role of the Parliament, the functioning of the Parliament and the capacity of the Parliament to fulfil its obligations and responsibilities in an open and free democracy such as ours, particularly one that is modelled very much on the Westminster system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing is made up of the President of the Senate in his capacity as the head of the Department; the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, representing the Government; Senator Chaney as the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate; and some other distinguished and notable senators elected by this chamber. That Committee has for three years expressed the unanimous view that the level of funding made available by this Government for the purpose of ensuring the efficient and effective functioning of the Senate in particular and the Parliament in general is less than adequate, less than the minimum required for the purpose for which the Senate was designed and placed in the Constitution in the intrinsic way it was as a vital part of the Parliament and of the voice of the people and as a reflection of democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh, the Minister for Finance, is seeking to treat the Parliament as he does a burgeoning Government department that can be afflicted with the wounds of the sword of cuts in the pursuit of government decisions in respect of the larger macro-economic determinations. In other words, the Senate is being treated as if it were an ordinary government department which in times of financial restraint should have its appropriations reduced accordingly. It might be appropriate to defer funding for roads, it might be appropriate to defer funding for airports, it might be appropriate-if it be the wish of the Government-to defer expenditure on public housing, public construction and public purchasing or to make reductions in the purchasing of VIP aircraft for the pleasure, convenience and, one might say, indulgence of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke); but it is not appropriate in any circumstances, whatever the economic climate or judgments of the government of the day, to reduce the expenditure of the Senate to the point where it is unable to function, monitor, examine or scrutinise the activities of the Government, manifest primarily in its legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of the day, under the determination of Senator Walsh, it is his view-a quaint and, I hope, unique view-that the level of funding available for the Parliament ought exclusively to be the right and responsibility not of the Parliament but of the Government. In other words, Senator Walsh is saying that it is for the Government to determine the level of supervision and scrutiny his Government ought to have. I say with respect that this takes us back to the seventeenth century Stuart kings who would sit on the throne with a bag of money and tell the Parliament how much they would give, for what purpose and to what ends. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not suggesting that Senator Walsh is by any means a king-far from it-but he has the mentality of somebody who believes that all knowledge and all wisdom resides in his judgment. There is no man more dangerous than he who knows he is right. Wise men contemplate these things and hope they are right, but that is not Senator Walsh's style.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the end of the day, if a government has exclusive right over the funding of a parliament it has exclusive control over the role that parliament plays. It ought not be forgotten by the major parties on either side of the chamber, by the independents or by the public at large that the Parliament is not the plaything of governments, that the Senate is not the proprietary interest of the government of the day but rather a reflection of democracy and the place for people's representatives. The Government is but one organ within it, and the administration of government is but one arm of that organ. The Parliament does not belong to the Government. When decisions are made in respect of funding for the Parliament they ought not to be made on political lines. Governments ought not to make judgments as to what they want parliaments to do. On the contrary, governments have a responsibility to ensure that parliaments have a capacity to function in the way intended. That is presently not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, when we had to make application through negotiation for supplementary appropriations the Appropriations and Staffing Committee of this Senate unanimously resolved that the level of funding available to the Senate was less than the minimum required. We had supplementary applications in the first place because the original funding made available by Senator Walsh and his Government was insufficient and totally inadequate. That was perhaps best reflected by a letter written by the President of the Senate to Senator Walsh on 16 August 1988, in which he referred to Senator Walsh's correspondence. He said, inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA> We remain firmly of the view that we are in the best position to determine the appropriate level of funding for the Parliament in consultation with our officers, and in the case of the Senate, in consultation with the Appropriations and Staffing Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>The President was saying that he, the President, representing the Senate, and the Speaker, representing the House of Representatives, are in the best position to judge and determine the levels of funding required for the proper-I use that word advisedly-functioning of the Parliament. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Should you proceed with the distribution of funds in the manner outlined in your departmental telex of 8 August 1988, it may be necessary to seek recourse to additional estimates later in the financial year. Every effort will be made however, to contain expenditure during 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA>So the President was making clear to Senator Walsh that the level of funding available in the original appropriations was not adequate and that it would be necessary, no doubt, to make supplementary applications. And, of course, it was. When those supplementary appropriations were being negotiated, we again found that they were less than minimal. </PARA>
<PARA> While it may sound trivial, let me give the Senate a simple example of the obscene levels of funding cuts. There is not adequate funding in the appropriations for this Parliament for each member and senator to have a simple dictaphone. We would expect to find a dictaphone in a pimply-faced 18-year-old's civil service office. This simple mechanical device that is needed for the ordinary discharge of one's responsibilities is unavailable to members of parliament. It is rather cute that when Ministers need things such as colour television sets, extra electronic devices, paintings worth millions of dollars that they have gorged themselves with and which they now distribute amongst their offices, dictaphones or other equipment, they avoid the constraints and restraints that are placed on other members of parliament. They simply ring up their departmental heads and say, `I could usefully use the latest and greatest in computers'. Surprise, surprise-the next morning the equipment arrives from the department. So the Government departments are funding the Ministers' offices. But ordinary-perhaps I should not use the word `ordinary' because I assume that most people elected to this chamber are extraordinary-non-Ministers are deprived of the ability to function normally. I raise that point, trivial as it might be, because it epitomises the difficulties. If it is difficult to get a tape recorder, which costs absolutely nothing, imagine how difficult it is to raise funds for the more important activities of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> For my sins, I am Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts which is inquiring into drugs in sport. Vital evidence that we require to be given in person has subsequently had to be given in writing. Honourable senators will understand the inadequacies of receiving evidence in that way. It is impossible to cross-examine a letter. In some respects I have grave concerns that committees are not getting all of the evidence that they require in order to draw conclusions and discharge their responsibilities in accordance with their terms of reference. So the Appropriations and Staffing Committee has found it necessary, through long correspondence with the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, to ensure that he understands the levels of funding required for the Parliament. If my memory serves me correctly, there was one occasion when the Senate was looking--</PARA>

Has the Minister's attention been drawn to an article in the Australian Financial Review of 21 May headed `Pilots urged to arrange jobs, credit in case of strike`? Does the article mention a memorandum sent by the vice-president of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, Captain Noel Holt, urging Australia's domestic airline pilots to find second jobs, encourage their families to seek work, and even apply for second mortgages, in readiness for what is described as a long industrial campaign over maintenance of real wages?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The article in question was drawn to my attention a short time ago. I am fully aware that the Australian Federation of Air Pilots has raised the prospect of an industrial dispute, involving domestic pilots, over a pay claim. As I understand it, the pilots have not yet had detailed talks with the airline operators about their proposed pay claim. As highly paid people, they are, of course, in a unique position to make the arrangements to which the article that Senator Jones has quoted refers. Not many other people in the work force are in such a position. I would encourage the pilots to pursue their claim without recourse to industrial action and, if need be, to refer the matter to the Industrial Relations Commission for resolution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the light of the Government's wages policy, which has remained firm in a period of very high demand for labour and of a strong economy-strong, contrary to previous experience in Australia-neither the pilots nor any other group can in any circumstances be exempted from the requirement to use the Industrial Relations Commission's conciliation and arbitration mechanism for the purpose of having their claims treated.</PARA>

That may have been approved on the understanding that there would be no further shipments, but only as a discretionary concession in the circumstances of the particular case. I will need to check that, however. So far as I am aware, there has certainly been no variation in the rigour with which we have applied our sanctions policy to all the forbidden categories of goods.

<PARA> The Australian Government is aware of reports that, following the annulment of the Panamanian election, the Panamanian Government has presented to the Opposition a plan proposing that its leader, Mr Guillermo Endara, head a three-man ruling junta; proposing that General Noriega should retire in two years; and calling on the United States and Panama to adhere to the Panama Canal treaties. As I have previously indicated publicly, the Australian Government believes that the problems faced by Panama can be resolved only by the Panamanian people, using accepted democratic and constitutional means. We have taken the view, of course, that the Panamanian elections were fraudulent, as they are universally denounced to have been. Although the official results were not released, the opposition candidate, Mr Endara, was estimated to have received more than two-thirds of the vote. We are concerned that any proposed solution to the crisis in Panama should be constitutional and should respect the will of the Panamanian people. In this context I repeat the call of the Australian Government that General Noriega should stand aside.</PARA>
<PARA> Certainly we strongly support calls from Latin American governments and from the United States, who have the most direct interest in a solution, for a peaceful and constitutional outcome, leading to the restoration of democracy in Panama.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may be a matter of some surprise but I am aware of this concern expressed by the Association of Rural Fire Authorities over the closure of the National Bushfire Research Unit. That unit was established four years ago within the CSIRO to conduct a national research program into bushfires. It was originally intended that the unit would be jointly funded and managed by CSIRO and users of the research. In pursuit of that arrangement it was hoped that the unit would receive external funding of $200,000 from fire authorities to plan and manage research in conjunction with local authorities. Users of the research carried out by the unit have shown no willingness to contribute to the program. The Government regrets the poor level of response from the States, particularly when the risk of bushfires in this country is so great.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My colleague the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, Mr Jones, proposes to ask the Prime Minister to write to State Premiers asking them to raise their level of participation in bushfire research. However, due to the lack of user support for the national body, CSIRO sees no need for the continued existence of the research unit as a separate entity. The research being conducted by the unit will continue as part of the normal operations within CSIRO's Division of Forestry Research. CSIRO has taken this action because the cost of providing the unit with separate management and administrative guidelines was excessive, given the failure of the States to contribute to the unit's activity. The division will certainly maintain the present level of funding for bushfire research, which is about $270,000 a year, and will seek individual collaborative research projects with other bodies including those which were envisaged initially as potential collaborators. It is anticipated that there should be considerable demand for CSIRO'S expertise in this area. To that end, CSIRO is setting up a liaison committee for the bushfire program to provide a method of interaction with users.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposals that were first outlined by Prime Minister Shamir during his visit to Washington in early April were the subject of Israeli Cabinet approval on 14 May. They provide for the election by Palestinians in the occupied territories of representatives to negotiate with Israel. At this stage not all the details associated with the proposal, including details on the election process, are available and a number of outstanding issues remain to be resolved. These issues include the participation of Palestinians from East Jerusalem, the withdrawal of the Israeli defence force from the territories or at least from the main urban centres during any election campaign, the possibility of international supervision and, in many ways most importantly, the implications of the proposal for the evolution of an independent Palestinian state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore, against that background, while the proposals are welcome, they appear to me to fall short of the broader approach which the Australian Government has made it clear we believe is an appropriate and necessary response to recent developments; that is to say, including Israeli dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), which would, under the present plan, be excluded from participation in the election process. However, it must be acknowledged, of course, that the proposals offer a possible basis for further exploration and may, indeed, prove to be a basis for a way forward. While the PLO and Palestinian notables in the occupied territories have rejected the Israeli proposal, they have not ruled out the principle of elections provided they are part of a comprehensive plan including the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the occupied territories.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government's position is one of encouragement to all parties to the dispute to continue to take advantage of the opportunities which now exist for progress towards a settlement. We note in this respect Secretary of State Baker's remarks, widely reported this morning but made yesterday, in which he called on Israel to `lay aside once and for all the unrealistic vision of a greater Israel'. He also called upon Israelis to `reach out to Palestinians as neighbours who deserve political rights'. The Australian Government certainly continues to support the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people, including their right, if they so choose, to independence and an independent state, and supports the convening of an international conference as a means of resolving the Arab-Israeli dispute.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me acknowledge that all this occurs in the context of very serious continuing pressures on Israel in what continues to be an extraordinarily difficult situation for the Government and people of that country. That must never be forgotten or overlooked in responding to questions of this kind.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know whether the point that Senator Patterson has raised was ever explicitly considered by the Australian Statistician. To the best of my knowledge, it certainly was never addressed in submissions that went before Cabinet. It is always a matter of judgment as to how many questions ought to be included on the census form. I have forgotten how many we did settle for this year, but the recommendation for the preferred number, which I think came from the Statistician himself, was accepted. The more questions there are, the more expensive the census becomes. It is not trivial. If I remember correctly, adding just one extra question costs about an extra half a million dollars or $1m. It also makes the processing more complicated. It is a matter of judgment as to where to draw the line on the number of questions and the amount of detail required. However, I do take the point that is made in the question; that is, if maintenance payments received are not recorded on the census form, it could distort the true income positions of quite a significant number of households. I will take the matter up with the Treasurer, who I trust will take it up with the Statistician. It may well be a bit late to make any changes.</PARA></TALK.START>

This overpayment of the service pension is not related in any way to the veterans' special TPI rate pension.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The answer to question No. 2 is no. Mr Stones's claim was processed in accordance with departmental procedures. The overpayment occurred because it was stated on Mr Stones's application form that he was not in receipt of superannuation income and this led to the overpayment. Mr Stones's files contain brief references dated December 1970 and February 1976 to his being in receipt of a DFRB superannuation pension. This was some years before his application for a service pension was lodged in 1982. The systems, which have been in place for many years, did not allow for the degree of cross-checking which would have picked this up.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that in April of this year, at the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual conference in Hobart, I announced that I would bring forward the review on crude oil excise foreshadowed in 1987 by the then Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Gareth Evans, and that we would commence the review in September this year rather than in June 1990. I now announce that we will commence the review in June this year, so we are bringing it forward even further, and will conclude, we expect, any application of the results of the review in June 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The primary focus of the review will be on crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas excise in Bass Strait, the North West Shelf and onshore production areas and offshore royalty arrangements. The review will be based on a fundamental analysis of the prin- ciples of resource taxation, including questions of equity, efficiency and the impact of taxation on the community and the industry. The review will be undertaken by a task force from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy in consultation with other departments, drawing on the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics for independent contributions on economic analysis and on the Bureau of Mineral Resources for independent technical advice. I table the terms of reference of the review. At the same conference of the APEA, Senator Chaney, on behalf of the Opposition, delivered a speech in which he dealt with excise. It is impossible to understand from the written text of that speech the attitude of the Opposition on excise. Senator Chaney said:</PARA>
<PARA>I welcome the emphasis you are now putting on the argument that oil should be taxed similarly to other extractive industries.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not sure what that means. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>That appears to me to be a desirable long-term goal and it is reflected in the Resources and Energy policy which the Opposition put down before the last election which provided for royalty arrangements in lieu of secondary taxation for future discoveries of oil.</PARA>
<PARA>To refer to royalty arrangements in lieu of secondary taxation is like saying that all imports come from overseas, because royalty arrangements are secondary taxation. Maybe that is the sort of promise that Senator Chaney gave to John Howard prior to his removal as Leader of the Opposition. A number of people from the industry have asked me for the meaning of the Opposition's promise. I am unable to inform them because it is in fact a contradictory promise. In my discussions on the meaning of the so-called contradictory promise `royalty in lieu of secondary taxation', somebody said to me, `There are two things about Senator Chaney I object to-his face'.</PARA>

I might say that the reforms the Government proposes on health insurance are a clear case of why a Labor government is necessary in this country. The reforms will bring equity and compassion to the way in which private health funds levy their fees for insurance. The proposals that I understand the Opposition is associated with would support a charge to younger people at a lesser rate than the charges to older people, on the basis that older people get sick more often and therefore should pay more for their health insurance, rather than spread the charge across the whole of the population on an actuarially calculated basis.

So far the New South Wales Government has not accepted that proposition, although I am waiting, as I said yesterday, for a written response to my proposals.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the honourable senator's third question, I have made a decision to provide for some forestry activity in 9 per cent of the National Estate forest in the south-east area. That forestry activity is not, I have to say, in conformity with the advice of the Australian Heritage Commission. I have had to make a decision based on an exhaustive examination of prudent and feasible alternatives. Yesterday in the Senate I tabled the written consideration of how I arrived at that decision under section 30 of the Heritage Act. I made the decision on those lines and on the fact that there are upwards of some 700 families in the south-east forests whose livelihood is directly affected by the timber industry. Their future is a consideration that has to be taken into account by a government that has to balance both the industry and environmental considerations and the fact that those families exist in an area which is not enjoying high levels of employment. In fact, the unemployment level in that area is twice the New South Wales average. On the basis of their needs and the industry's needs, I have decided to provide for cutting in, as I said, 9 per cent of the National Estate, leaving 91 per cent of the National Estate forests for the study that I referred to a moment ago.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the last part of the question, the EIS that is being conducted at the present time is being carried out by the New South Wales Forestry Commission. The one on which we are operating at the moment was needed to underpin the cutting plan for this year; the one being conducted will be needed to underpin the cutting plan for next year. The proposal that I have put to the New South Wales Government would enable us at the end of the period that I have proposed to have a complete environmental assessment of the south-east region to be able to select what areas of forest outside the National Estate can be considered for cutting. I would hope that at the end of the year that I have proposed we would then make a rational decision after giving consideration to all the competing weightings of interest and concern about the forest. That would be a logical and rational way of dealing with the matter. I hope that the New South Wales Government will now consider my proposal in greater detail, that it will not dismiss it superficially as it has but will respond in detail to the proposal. I believe that the community of that area wants a decision and wants this matter to be settled.</PARA>
<PARA> I am still waiting for a response from Senator Puplick. Yesterday, Senator Richardson and I both asked him to say whether he supports the New South Wales Government, whether he supports us or whether he has some other position. His silence on this matter is deafening. If silence be consent, I assume he supports the New South Wales Government. Because the policy of the Opposition in terms of minerals and energy is to abolish export controls in certain circumstances, I want to know whether Charles Blunt, if he proposes the abolition of export controls on woodchip exports, is going to stand up and argue for the retention of those export controls.</PARA>

Does he agree or disagree with that proposition?

<PARA>the ratio of private sector debt-</PARA>
<PARA>to total debt-</PARA>
<PARA>is much higher overseas than in Australia. In 1987, private-sector debt accounted for 75.5 per cent of total debt in Brazil, 86.2 per cent in Mexico and 85.8 per cent in Argentina. This highlights how overweight the public sector is in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>I have asked my Department to check these facts. It appears that Mr Hadler's figures were based on data from external debt of developing countries world debt tables published by the World Bank. However, he misunderstood the tables because they refer to the source of the borrowings and not the borrower. In fact, Brazil's foreign debt of 75.5 per cent is borrowed from private sector sources in the rest of the world. That is where Mr Hadler misunderstood the table. He assumed that the borrowers were in the private sector instead of the lenders being in the private sector. The same applies to the other countries concerned. The figures are clearly not comparable with Australian Bureau of Statistics figures for the proportion of Australia's gross foreign debt which is held or owed by the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA> The World Bank tables do allow some comparison to be made. If we take the figures on that basis-this is publicly owed debt or publicly guaranteed debt as a proportion of gross domestic product-the Australian figure was 16 per cent in 1986. In the same year, Argentina's was nearly 66 per cent, Brazil's 41 per cent and Mexico's nearly 84 per cent.

<PARA>In the Senate on 23 May, Senator Harradine asked a question relating to the use of UHF television channels in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA>The question covered a range of issues, most of which were well and truly covered in the answer which I provided.</PARA>
<PARA>However, I undertook to follow up with a supplementary answer to cover any outstanding points and now do so.</PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, let me reiterate that the Government has adopted the use of UHF channels for the provision of new and additional television services in Tasmania, principally so that those extra services can be introduced with a minimum of disruption to the reception of existing services. This cannot be achieved if the licensees are granted VHF channels in Hobart and Launceston.</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, it is quite incorrect to suggest that UHF is unsuitable for use in Tasmania. It has been clearly demonstrated both here and overseas that UHF can provide clearer, better quality pictures that VHF.</PARA>
<PARA>It may well be true that additional translators will be required; in fact, the licensees should probably be providing additional translators for their existing VHF services.</PARA>
<PARA>I wish to assure senators, and the people of Tasmania, that both the Government and the Department of Transport and Communications will be doing what they can to ensure that the licensees provide all the translators required to deliver first class television reception to all the residents of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, I make the point that whilst the UHF transmission equipment needed by licensees may well be more expensive than the VHF they would prefer, this is not the case for the UHF reception equipment required by viewers. In fact, UHF reception equipment is expected to last longer and be cheaper to maintain than the VHF equivalent.</PARA>

The investigation has now been completed and a full report has been made available to me. In essence, the investigation by the AFP headquarters officers has confirmed that at the time Assistant Commissioner Winchester was murdered, Commander Worthy was at home with his wife and family. In negation of suspicion of any involvement it has been established that there was no argument or conflict between Commander Worthy and Assistant Commissioner Winchester and no other motive or circumstance that could give rise to the slightest suspicion that Commander Worthy was responsible for or involved in the death of Assistant Commissioner Winchester. Commander Worthy has now returned to his former duties as Officer in Charge, ACT Region, Crime Division. That is a briefing provided to me by Deputy Commissioner John Johnson.</PARA>

<PARA>This matter is not put forward this afternoon as a matter of public importance, which is perhaps the more normal device in this place. It is put forward as a matter of urgency because it is indeed a matter of urgency and we shall vote on it. It is matter of urgency that action be taken by the Government in the face of a deepening balance of payments deficit; in the face of massive growth in our foreign debt; in the face of growing foreign ownership of Australian land and other physical assets; in the face of a sharply increasing rate of inflation; in the face of a very high and rising level of interest rates; and finally, in the face of the developing signs of a recession later this year. Underlying all this is that fundamental lack of competitiveness which is referred to in the terms of this urgency motion. </PARA>
<PARA> It is remarkable to observe the change that has occurred in those in the Government who have had the chief responsibility for economic policy during the last two years.

Last week, on Tuesday 16 May 1989, Mr Keating was faced with yet another disastrous monthly balance of payments current account deficit. In that case it was for April, with an amount for that month only of $1,191m. On this day he faced a less than usually compliant media conference. I make that comment because Mr Keating has had the best run from the media in this country that I can remember any Treasurer having out of the 11 that I personally served, including Mr Keating. Mr Keating has begun to wear out the patience of even the media of this country. That is clearly because his own credibility has begun to fall disastrously in the eyes of the people who were previously prepared to accord him a great deal of credibility. What did Mr Keating say last Tuesday? In responding to a question he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the problem is that even off this year's current account-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, this year's estimated current account deficit of nearly $17 billion-</PARA>
<PARA>we'll be looking at something like $2 billion worth of interest payments next year-</PARA>
<PARA>I think he meant interest payments and other payments, for example, property income payments, but I will let that pass-</PARA>
<PARA>just off this year's alone, so the trade accounts have got to run $2 billion faster just to stand still. </PARA>
<PARA>That is perfectly correct. The only surprising thing about the statement by the Treasurer last week was that he appeared to have discovered that fact for the first time. At a later point during that media conference Mr Keating referred again to that problem. He picked up in his rather magpie way another piece of economic jargon he had just heard no doubt from one of his officials-the concept of the net income deficit which appears in the balance of payments releases each month by the Statistician. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>That is simply the net deficit on our external payments . . . we make overseas on interest and other forms of property income against those we receive from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>He said further:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the net income deficit will be large this year, it's already-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, for the 10 months to April-</PARA>
<PARA>at 10.4 billion, it will be higher than that by year's end . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is undoubtedly true. It will be $12 billion by the year's end. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it will be higher next year . . . we're not going to be seeing because of that a massive decline in the current account deficit even for next year, even for next financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Keating recognised in that statement that even on that account alone, on account of having to pay interest on this year's deficit on the borrowings and the sales of assets which will result from this year's deficit financing, we will be up for another $2 billion next year. </PARA>
<PARA> I said in the Senate yesterday in the course of my remarks on the Appropriation Bills, and I will say it again, that this sort of thing reminds me of the experience that we have probably all had at one time in our lives of trying to chase our young children down an escalator. If we get into that situation we can, depending on how fleet of foot the children in question may be, catch them. The escalator is going up while they are going down and we are after them. We can actually catch them. We can go down faster than the escalator is going up. However if we keep on doing it for too long we run out of puff. We find that the escalator is going up faster than we can run down. That is exactly the situation which Australia is approaching under this Treasurer, who suddenly appears to have discovered that extraordinarily important fact, that extraordinarily important consequence of his policies in this place for the last six years. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer again to the remarkably expansive media conference held by the Treasurer on Tuesday of last week. He referred on that occasion to the tyranny of debt, picking up no doubt one of Geoffrey Blainey's phrases and adapting it. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . this is the tyranny of the debt, you keep building up this net income deficit and Australia can't keep living on overseas savings, it just can't keep building up a stock of debt which it has to service and seeing a higher proportion of its trade receipts committed to that servicing. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree with the Treasurer. Verily a Daniel come to judgment. But where has this Treasurer been for the last six years that he did not discover this before this time, before our current account deficit on the balance of payments reached something like $16.5 billion to $17.5 billion this year? What could be more urgent, given the motion before the Senate today, than that tyranny of debt which the Treasurer himself referred to only eight days ago? We have a Treasurer who, while he is suddenly coming to his senses, is also starting to talk gobbledegook. I apologise to the Senate if it does not understand these words because I frankly find the greatest difficulty in understanding them. I am quoting them in order to illustrate the fact that we have a Treasurer who is no longer really on top of his portfolio. He has lost his grip. At a later point in his remarks, having been asked a question by one of our more perceptive journalists, the Treasurer, Paul Keating, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there is a structural increase in the current account coming off the net income deficit as a permanent feature, there is some sort of implication in the question that once we get to some point of tightness it all sort of falls away, it doesn't all fall away, what falls away is the increment and the increment falls away as the merchandise trade deficit turns around and then reduces the current account deficit as it reduces the net income deficit or as the merchandise trade deficit overcomes the net income to reduce the current account deficit . . . that's the process which is being undertaken,</PARA>
<PARA>All I can say is that, if that is the process which is being undertaken, God help us. The Treasurer has lost his grip. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Bronwyn Bishop interpolates, Gilbert and Sullivan would have loved it. By contrast, let us have a bit of hard, plain and commonsense speaking about this matter from a respected figure in the economic policy arena-the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr Bob Johnston, who was also speaking to a conference, the conference of the National Farmers Federation in this city last week, the day after the Treasurer spoke. I do not wish to attribute this motive to Mr Johnston but perhaps he felt he had to correct some of the impressions that the Treasurer may have created with the last remarks that I quoted for the Senate. Mr Johnston, on page 7 of the prepared text of his speech on the subject of debt, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Our overseas debt is rising at an increasing pace. The escalator is beginning to run faster than we can run. </PARA>
<PARA>On page 12 of his prepared text he drew attention to the fact that on the whole for almost two years now the Government has had a dream run on what the economists call the international terms of trade. The prices of our major export commodities have risen and have gone on rising until very recently, although they are showing some signs of weakness now. As a consequence we have been improving on that account alone. It is nothing to do with Government policies; just what is happening in the outside world. We have been in a situation which is favourable to us to improve our balance of payments. Our international terms of trade rose by 9 per cent in 1987-88. It was originally estimated to rise by 9 1/2 per cent this year. In fact, it has risen by more than that-something like 14 per cent to this point. The Governor was drawing attention to the fact which concerns many people: that situation will not last forever. The Governor said:</PARA>
<PARA>There must be a significant downside risk to the continuation of growth at the pace of the past six years. </PARA>
<PARA>This, after all, is the man who is charged with the institutional responsibility for the care of the currency of this country in terms of the Reserve Bank Act. Mr Johnston went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>These uncertainties make it more imperative-</PARA>
<PARA>a very strong word, implying urgency-</PARA>
<PARA>that we come to grips with our own current account situation as soon as possible. As I have mentioned, this involves (as a first step) getting the growth in demand back within the limits of our productive capacity. When we have done this, there will still be much to do . . . but our own task, at the Central Bank, is clear-to lend the weight of monetary policy to the task of slowing the economy to a sustainable pace of growth. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Johnston also said by way of interpolation into his prepared text that `if we do not do it'-if we do not do the things that I quoted him as saying-`if we do nothing at all, we'll simply set the scene for a very brutal adjustment of the economy at the behest of market forces'. That is what this Government is heading this country towards at present. This is what the Governor of the Reserve Bank said. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of that and the fact that we are debating a matter of urgency, who on the Government side is going to speak in this debate? Where is the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh), the Minister representing the Treasurer? He is not listed on the speakers list. I do not wish in any way to denigrate the Leader of the Government, Senator Button, who will be leading for the Government but the Minister who ought to be res- ponding to this motion is the Minister representing the Treasurer. But where is he? Instead, we are to have a contribution from Senator Button. We are going to have a contribution from Senator Maguire. As a matter of fact, we have already heard from Senator Maguire this morning in the debate on the appropriations. He told us then what he would be saying this afternoon. I presume that he can write only one speech a day or that he can have somebody write only one speech a day. </PARA>
<PARA> But where is Senator Walsh? Senator Walsh is not in the chamber and he is not responding today because for nearly two years now he has been telling his colleagues that they have got it wrong and that they have not been doing enough. In September 1987, just after the 1987-88 Budget, Senator Walsh told a gathering of Labor lawyers in Perth that there were 200 adjectival programs which had neither equity nor any other rationale to support them and which could be cut out but that his colleagues could not face up to the task of cutting them out. </PARA>
<PARA> On the Face to Face television program in October last year the Minister had some more things to say which were referred to in a question in the Senate yesterday. I will not repeat those comments other than to say that at that time the Minister committed himself to the view that unless the balance of payments improved we would have a sharp fall in the Australian dollar, which we have now just had, and that when that occurred there would almost certainly be-I do not want to put too much in the Minister's mouth-a need for further action by this Government on its own excessive spending. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Minister in question called on the Prime Minister earlier this year to tender his resignation, to tell the Prime Minister that he proposed to resign. He was talked out of it no doubt on the basis at that time that there was going to be a very early election and that he should not destabilise the Government by getting out just then. Where is the Minister this afternoon? He is not in sight. We had Senator Maguire this morning telling us that this afternoon he will be hopping in to the Fraser Government. When was that? I can hardly remember it. </PARA>

<PARA> This morning Senator Maguire was trying to tell us about the sharp rise in unemployment which occurred in the last year of the Fraser Government, caused, he said, by that Government. Senator Maguire appears to have forgotten that that very sharp rise in unemployment which, as he quite rightly said, took the figure to 10.4 per cent of the work force, was caused by the wage explosion in 1981-82. Who was that initiated by? It was initiated by Senator Maguire's friends, Senator Button's friends-I will not say Senator Walsh's friends-and certainly Mr Paul Keating's friends in the Australian Council of Trade Unions. It was initiated particularly by Mr Laurie Carmichael of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union (AMWU), by Mr John Halfpenny, then of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union and now the Secretary to the Trades Hall in Victoria, and by Mr George Campbell, who is now the Secretary of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, in company and concert with those two well-known heroic figures of the accord, Mr Bill Kelty and Mr Simon Crean, who are now somewhat in the discard.</PARA>
<PARA> We know the reason for the large rise in unemployment in 1982-83. It was given to us by none other than Mr Paul Keating, the Treasurer, at the Hobart Labor Party conference. Pointing his finger accusingly at Mr George Campbell of the AMWU he said, `George, don't you talk to me about this. You've got 100,000 dead men around your neck'. It is a fact that some people in the trade union movement did learn something from that experience. If they had not, there would never have been the so-called accord which this Government has spent the last six years talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me back to the whole matter before us today-the balance of payments crisis and the debt crisis. In the very brief time available to me, let me say that just over two years ago today the Treasurer of this country spoke about the banana republic which was facing us if we did not do something to deal with our growing debt and balance of payments problem. At that time our balance of payments was $14.8 billion in deficit; this year it will be $16 1/2 billion or $17 billion in deficit. At that time our debt was about $75 billion; today it is $95 billion. When the figures are published for the end of March in about a week's time it will probably be well over $100 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Can anybody tell me that this is not a matter of urgency, that these matters are not to be dealt with urgently by this Government? What is the Government doing about it? The Government has its head in the sand unless, as the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) at the table has denied today, there is a review going on of wages policy and other government policies. I have to say that it is a matter of urgency that immediate action be taken to address this fundamental lack of competitiveness which underlies Australia's balance of payments and debt crisis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stone, the Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate, spoke for 20 minutes and at the nineteen- minute mark he said, `Let me get back to the subject'. In his urgency motion he referred to `the need for immediate action to address the fundamental lack of competitiveness which underlies Australia's balance of payments and debt crisis'. Sadly, Senator Stone said nothing about those issues at all. What we got was a recycled Treasury bureaucrat's speech about a number of issues larded, if I might say so, with Senator Stone's own demonology which he has used on a number of occasions in this place about what happened in 1982, the various people whom he thought were responsible and so on. The Government does not retreat from some of the issues implicit in the matter of urgency itself. But, with respect, it is insufficient to state the problem as a matter of urgency, as Senator Stone has done, and not address the issues, which are referred to as the underlying issues, relating to the balance of payments and debt crisis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government will oppose the motion because it implies that the strategy that the Government has in place in relation to the reduction in both the current account deficit and the foreign debt and their return to more sustainable levels is inappropriate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I said it implies that it is inappropriate. It also implies that we should immediately change tack and panic. But change tack and panic in what direction? One can read Senator Stone's speech in the Hansard tomorrow ad nauseam as many times as one likes and one will find no suggestion as to what directions we should take and with what speed the Government should do it. Neither of these responses-neither an immediate change in tack nor panic-is what is required. The Government's response to the current problems, to which the urgency motion refers, is to dampen the level of domestic demand. It is interesting that Senator Stone quoted Mr Bob Johnston of the Reserve Bank of Australia on a number of occasions. Mr Johnston's conclusion, which Senator Stone finally got to, was that growth in demand had to be reduced. Of course, the Government is entirely in agreement with that. Current policies are designed to reduce the growth in demand, and the various arms of economic policy are focused on these causes. The level of domestic demand in the economy and the need to improve the supply capacity are the two main causes of the current trade problem, and these are matters that the Government is addressing with various arms of economic policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This does not for a moment imply that we should give the knee-jerk response that the urgency motion seeks. It does not for a moment imply complacency on our part, or an unwillingness to adjust the mix of policies as conditions change. This Government has always been prepared to do that, and has done it throughout its period in office. I suppose that at Question Time yesterday I gave a formula answer to a question about when we were going to do this and when we were going to do that. It was a formula answer such as I have often given to questions about foreshadowed wage policy or foreshadowed policy in relation to exchange rates, interest rates or anything else. Ministers have been subjected to such questions over a long period. We have not been unwilling to adjust the mix of policies as conditions change. There was some evidence of that in the outcome of the Premiers Conference last week, indicating the Government's recognition that fiscal policy needs to be reined in a little not only in relation to grants to the States and States' borrowing capacity, but also in relation to the borrowing capacity of Commonwealth authorities. Both those matters were announced in the context of the Premiers Conference. Senator Stone was short on prescription, but one has to examine the view that the Opposition takes of this matter at a time when it is urging us to take immediate and precipitate action, a knee-jerk reaction--</PARA>

<PARA> Let us look at some of the public statements made by the new Opposition leaders about some of these issues. Senator Stone quoted what the Treasurer had said two years ago, and Senator Walsh quoted Senator Stone's prediction of a recession, which did not happen. We could all play that game, but let us look at some more recent statements by Opposition members on issues that go to the question of underlying competitiveness. In March 1989 Dr Hewson, the new shadow Treasurer, speaking about tax policy, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The position is, we haven't really made up our mind about when we will announce it and how much we will announce. </PARA>
<PARA>On the same date Andrew Peacock, the new Leader, is reported as having said:</PARA>
<PARA>We have done the work. We have got our fiscal policy, including the tax package, the expenditure package and a target Budget surplus. We will announce it when we are ready, not when demanded to by an increasingly desperate Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not want in any way to turn the tables on Senator Stone, or to turn the stone-if that is not unkind-but I repeat what Mr Peacock said six weeks ago:</PARA>
<PARA>We have done the work. We have got out fiscal policy, including the tax package, the expenditure package and a target Budget surplus. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable senator comes in here today with an urgency motion telling us what the problem is, but he will not tell us that big secret, which the Australian people might be entitled to know. According to his new Leader, somebody has done the work, got the fiscal policy, got the tax package, got the expenditure package, and a target Budget surplus. On 17 August last year-the last occasion, I think on which he referred to tax policy-the then shadow Treasurer, now Leader of the Opposition, said:</PARA>
<PARA>I can give an undertaking, as you will see when we release our tax policy, to give significant tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA>Now he is mumbling around the country about real tax cuts, as distinct from the Labor Party's tax cuts. He is hinting at real tax cuts which could be introduced if his Party were in power. As the Opposition always does, he is saying two things at the same time. I acknowledge that, quoting Bob Johnston, Senator Stone has said that we have to dampen demand considerably, or at least slacken the growth in demand. The Opposition is saying that the Government is not doing anything about living standards but that it-the Opposition-would do both things at once. It says that it would improve living standards. In the course of his remarks Senator Stone said-or at least implied-that the Opposition would do something about the things that Bob Johnston talked about. That is a Houdini-like solution. If the Opposition is going to launch urgency motions of this kind, it will have to make up its mind about some of those things. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of fiscal policy, taxation policy, and so on, the Opposition, concerned that this is a matter of urgency for the whole Australian community, for the Australian people and for the Senate, is keeping as a deep secret what it would do in the circumstances. </PARA>

Of course, the real point of the Opposition motion is to imply that nothing is being done to increase the level of competitiveness in the Australian economy.

Senator Stone was in agony as he made his speech in the Senate, with all the conflicting pressures on him as a result of his chosen vehicle for his political launch in this place. Those problems of deregulation which were ignored by conservative governments over many years come back to haunt them when they are confronted with them, even in opposition: the question of company tax rates, which have been enormously reduced under this Government; government taxes and charges, which have been addressed on an ongoing basis--</PARA>

What the Opposition continues to do is to recycle the problem and avoid the issues as they appear in Senator Stone's motion regarding the underlying causes of this problem, in the same way as conservative governments for many years ignored the underlying issues relating to this question of international competitiveness. Senator Stone is a bit different from the rest of the Opposition, and therefore naughtier. I have been saying for years that the Opposition is again giving us the 1960s show. Senator Stone has put forward a motion which talks about the underlying issues of competitiveness but does not address them once; it merely states the problem. The Government is aware of the problem. It is adopting policies which the Opposition attacks day after day as affecting the living standards of Australians and being hard on home buyers. The Opposition attacks those policies every day but in his speech Senator Stone did not say boo about what the Opposition would do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Stone's colleagues have made pronouncements about interest rates, fiscal policy and similar issues. Opposition leaders make vacuous statements to which I have referred in the course of my remarks, but Senator Stone said nothing about them. That is extremely disappointing. Forgive me if I chastise Senator Stone for naughtiness of that kind. One of the major issues relating to international competitiveness is labour market reform-the importance of award restructuring and reaching industrial agreements on specific projects. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The $1.2 billion current account deficit for April published last week means that Australia's annual external shortfall has blown out to over $16 billion. Obviously, this is a long way from the $9.5 billion forecast by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the 1988-89 Budget Speech. These figures are alarming. They have led the Treasurer to announce the possibility of further interest rate rises so that small business, rural producers and home buyers will be hit again as the financial sector in general and banks in particular respond to the Treasurer's high interest rate approach. The bad balance of payments figures have also caused the Government to reconsider its fiscal policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the last 12 months the Treasurer has assured us that there are no plans to implement further expenditure cuts because, to use his words, fiscal policy is `as tight as a drum'. We are now getting admissions of a possible need for further fiscal restraint. Surely that tight drum is in imminent danger of being torn apart, particularly when one contemplates how the Government may tighten fiscal policy. Will it take back the $2 billion in tax cuts generally given to Australian companies last year when the company tax rate was reduced from 49c in the dollar to 39c in the dollar? I think not, because this would offend the Government's corporate mates. The problem with company tax in Australia is not the rate but the fact that so many companies do not pay it. In many cases they do not pay it because they get a tax break if they contribute to our foreign debt. I will say a bit more about that later. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government may also tighten fiscal policy by increasing tax paid by taxpayers, introducing a consumption tax-which is enamoured by the President of the Liberal Party-or implementing further expenditure cuts in areas which represent a substantial proportion of government spending: areas such as education, health and social security. The Commonwealth Government can either do that directly or do it by shifting that restraint on to the States. Of course the exercise in this Parliament House last week was partly the latter approach. Either way, low income households and average income earners will have less access to education, less access to health and less access to social security. We will have more of what we saw the other night on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's television program Nobody's Children. </PARA>
<PARA> It was the Australian Labor Party that introduced measures to take away income support for low income earners and for young people-measures that were voted into operation with the support of the Liberal- National Party Opposition. Both the Hawke Government and the Liberal-National Party alternative would do the same things but of course provide different window dressing to explain them to the public. In this particular exercise the Opposition has explained the situation in terms of lack of competitiveness. When I heard Senator Stone's address I suspected that it was simply another excuse for a bit of union bashing, as though Australian workers were the ones who determined the price and the quality of our export and import replacement goods and services. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us be clear about the situation. For example, Japanese workers get paid more than Australian workers. Maybe we should look at Australian management to find the problems, particularly those managers who blame absolutely everything on the workers. The unions do not happen to be responsible for the design of our goods and products or for their marketing either here or overseas. At least the workers have taken a decline in real wages over the life of the Hawke Government. That has not been the case with management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Furthermore, this whole notion of international competitiveness makes sense only in theory. Let us look at this notion of competitiveness. One is not competitive in any sense of the term by definition if one does not sell goods against someone else who is selling those goods. That is not our problem. In fact, Australian industries are very competitive on a level playing field. Senator Chaney at least ought to know that. It is not our lack of competitiveness; it is the fact that we have a deficit on our trade account-that is, we are selling overseas less than we import. One can be highly competitive in that context and still not make the figures add up. Senator Chaney shakes his head in opposition to that proposition. Of course, he is not taking into account the incredible anti-competitive practices of the European Community and of our so-called special friend and ally the United States. We have very competitive resource industries and primary production industries, which are the mainstay of our exports. </PARA>
<PARA> In any case, the concentration on these matters misses an extremely important point that is too often overlooked, when the Hawke Labor Government, the Liberal Party and the National Party all discuss these matters: that is, we have a current account deficit because this country is spending more than it earns. But, as has been pointed out by Professor Pitchford, professor of economics at the Australian National University, excess spending is unusual for private households taken as a whole. He has also pointed out, and it is true, that the Government sector is a net lender, not a borrower. Of course, that leaves the private sector companies. But these companies borrow to expand. Each individual borrowing is supposed to be vetted and assessed by the financial sector against the capacity of the borrowing company to produce goods or services. In other words, an assessment is made of whether it is worth while and whether that company can repay the debt that it is entering into. So when the financial sector says we should worry about the current account, it is really saying we should worry about the finance and banking sector's ability to do the job of assessment. The debt problem then, to put it in terms of the matter of urgency, is a problem about companies and their activities. Professor Pitchford put it rather well when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I'd like the Government to tell me precisely why they are worried about that-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the current account deficit-</PARA>
<PARA>Do they feel that firms have too easy an access to debt and to overseas debt in particular, and you know, that raises the case, the issue as to why they deregulated financial markets anyway because of course, that made it easier for private firms to get hold of overseas debts. So the two things seem to be inconsistent, a concern about the current account deficit and a deregulation of the financial markets . . . </PARA>
<PARA>But, of course, the Liberal Party Opposition will pursue the deregulation of financial markets and remove from the Government any ability to engage in any activity in this area. The logical implication of the Government's position is that it should look at debt appraisal, it should look at the creation of debt in the private sector, if it is really worried about the current account. There is substantial evidence to support Professor Pitchford's view. I quote from an article in the Australian Financial Review of 19 May which puts it quite well:</PARA>
<PARA> Only 40 per cent of the current account deficit is accounted for by the economy's trade deficit on goods and services. The remaining 60 per cent-or $10 billion-is taken up by Australia's deficit on income and net transfers. </PARA>
<PARA> This largely reflects interest payments totalling $9.7 billion in 1988 on Australia's $121 billion gross foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA> The economy is now trapped by a vicious cycle of debt accumulation. As the foreign debt has ballooned, the Interest Bill has become a driving force behind the worsening current account deficit-which then adds to the foreign debt and, in turn, to the debt-servicing Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The alternative course of action to borrowing more, the course that is being suggested by the Opposition, is to sell off more of Australia's assets overseas. While this may look like a better solution to the immediate problem, in the long term it converts our foreign debt problem into a foreign ownership problem. Instead of increasing interest payments acting as a drain on our balance of payments, we will have increasing payments on rents and dividends to foreign owners of Australian assets. Of course, the Labor Party and the Liberal Party have formed an alliance to encourage more foreign investment and have kept Australians in the dark as to the extent of that foreign ownership in this country. Indeed, even in this place in March this year they combined to defeat the Australian Democrats' legislation to establish a register of foreign ownership and also voted against our amendment to the Foreign Takeovers Act which would have removed the $3m threshold below which approval does not have to be sought from the Foreign Investment Review Board for foreign purchases of rural properties, farms, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> So we now have the incredible situation where both the Government and the Opposition agree to sell off Australia, having conspired in the first place to give us a foreign debt of banana republic proportions. They go on attacking each other about who can go further in the effort to placate foreign financiers and domestic banks by deregulation, privatisation, cutting expenditure, cutting into the living standards of ordinary Australian workers and giving more and bigger tax concessions to big business. They ignore the real problem of who is responsible for the balance of payments blow-out and our foreign debt burden because the truth would hurt. At the end of last year, the private sector was responsible for 53.23 per cent of our foreign debt but ordinary Australians have to suffer because of that. At that stage, Australia's six largest corporate borrowers between them owed $26 billion or 23 per cent of Australia's gross foreign debt. Six firms owed 23 per cent of our foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party, the Liberal Party and the National Party have exercised their options in this country to sweep those facts under the carpet. There is absolutely no doubt that history will certainly judge them harshly for this blinkered, petty politicking, for being wrong in their prescriptions and for pandering to big business interests and international financiers rather than for doing the job for which they were elected, that is, to represent the ordinary Australian in an ordinary job. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating an urgency motion brought forward by Senator Stone, the Leader of the National Party of Australia, in these terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need for immediate action to address the fundamental lack of competitiveness which underlies Australia's balance of payments and debt crisis. </PARA>
<PARA>The motion has been brought forward by the Opposition because it is our view that Australia faces quite a perilous situation, and it is the duty of the Opposition to raise this matter both here and in the House of Representatives, drawing it again to the attention of the Government and urging appropriate action upon the Government. It is a little disappointing that the response of the Government in this place has been as careless-that is as good a word as any-as the response from Senator Button, who giggled and joked his way through a 20-minute response and simply challenged the Opposition to come up with its solution to Australia's evident problems. In the course of my speech I shall certainly touch on some of the matters that have been detailed by the Opposition as going to providing a permanent solution to the difficulties we face. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me begin by saying that, in the speech from the Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Macklin, which as usual was composed mainly of attacks on the Liberal Party with a few passing attacks on the Australian Labor Party, there was one important point with which I wish to agree. It is important to try to find some points of agreement at a time of what I believe is real national crisis, which is understood in the suburbs, with the 18 per cent interest rates, the 16 to 16 1/2 per cent housing interest rates and the general pressure of living standards, all of which are part of the pattern that is tied up with our growing international indebtedness and declining living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Macklin referred to the vicious cycle of debt accumulation and servicing. Senator Stone pointed out in his contribution to the debate that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has admitted that, just to stand still next year, we will have to find an extra $2 billion-just to meet the additional costs of the increased indebtedness that Australia has incurred this year. So a problem which is already enormous is compounding, and it demands immediate action from the Government and not the sort of buffoonery that we had from the Leader of the Government in this place a few moments ago. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had a number of descriptions from people across the political spectrum and some non-political people who accurately get to the core of Australia's difficulties. In the interests of trying to get some bipartisan analysis, let me begin with what the Treasurer had to say. In a lengthy interview recorded in the Sydney Morning Herald on 8 April he said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is really only one message that can be drawn from our current circumstances . . . It is, simply, that our current account deficit is too high because we are spending more than we can produce. </PARA>
<PARA>The lesson to be drawn from that is that Australia faces two options: it must either reduce spending or produce more, or it must have some combination of the two. A reduction in spending is very easy to talk about. What it means is a further reduction in our standard of living at a time when most Australians feel that their standard of living has already been very heavily squeezed. The only attractive option, the only alternative that the Australian people would wish to see us embracing, is the second alternative-that we look to producing more in Australia so that we can afford both to pay off our debts and to improve our living standards. A great deal of publicity has been given to the prescription on this matter by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr R. A. Johnston, who, in the final weeks before his retirement, expressed himself in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>What is the matter with the Australian economy? Some would say that we live in the `State of Self-Indulgence'. In the present financial year, total spending is growing at about twice the rate at which GDP is growing. Imports and debt service commitments are outstripping exports and other current receipts. Our overseas debt is rising at an increasing pace. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he describes the matter in the same terms as the Opposition has described it and as Mr Keating, in rare moments of honesty, has described it. In the same speech, Mr Johnston went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Tight monetary policy will ultimately slow the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the prescription that the Government is following at the moment-shoving up interest rates on householders, small business and everybody else who has to borrow money. Mr Johnston continued:</PARA>
<PARA>But slowing the economy is not an end in itself. It will only provide conditions in which Australia can get on with constructive policies to improve the balance of payments. This highlights the urgency of shifting resources into export and import-competing industries and improving productivity and cost performance. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, that all sounds like just so much economics, but the simple, understandable point that the Government has refused to acknowledge and has refused to act upon is that both Mr Keating and the Governor of the Reserve Bank are giving the same message-not the sort of message of the populist sort of nonsense that I believe was a good deal of what Senator Macklin had to say, but the simple message that, unless we improve our productivity and performance as a country, we will not solve these pressing, dramatic and difficult problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Again we had some badinage from Senator Button during Question Time. I suppose his basic honesty prevents his answering questions properly in this place, so he indulges in jokes, quips and smart alec remarks to avoid having to answer questions. In the course of his badinage, he was very struck that I should dare to compare his abuse of me with the Treasurer's abuse of Ross Gittins of the Sydney Morning Herald. Let me deal with what Mr Gittins said in the Sydney Morning Herald, in an article on the issue of productivity, the matter which the Opposition has brought before the Senate this afternoon-this basic lack of competitiveness and the need to improve our productivity. In this article, which was quite critical of the Opposition, Mr Gittins said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Opposition is right: we must raise our productivity-and it's a pity to see Paul Keating getting so defensive on the subject. Higher productivity is central to our efforts to achieve a sustained improvement in living standards and, of more pressing importance, higher productivity is a critical ingredient in solving our balance-of-payments crisis. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Gittins was saying to the Australian people through this newspaper article that, if we wish to do something about Australian living standards and about our pressing international debt, we must lift our productivity. At the end of his article he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The way to achieve this . . . is to keep going down the micro-reform route: identify the industries where productivity is lowest, then fix'em and fix'em good. </PARA>
<PARA>That is pretty plain, sensible, unvarnished and understandable advice from an economist-find the areas where productivity is lowest or `identify the industries where productivity is lowest, then fix'em and fix'em good'. We had a challenge from the Leader of the Government in the Senate, who said, `What would you in opposition do?'. I remind the Senate that, in the House of Representatives, John Howard, in responding to the April statement, tabled a whole lot of papers which set out what we would do. They set out what we would do about coastal shipping where there was a $300m-plus loss to the Australian people in waste and inefficiency; about reforming the waterfront, where there is $800m worth of waste-and this is the specific area I wish to address; and about contracting out government services to give people better services at lower cost. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make a very serious offer to the Government. It is an offer which I made publicly in a press release earlier today. I offered the Government the support and assistance of the Opposition with respect to reform of the waterfront. The Government has a report from the Inter-State Commission which says that over $600m can be saved for Australia by reforming the waterfront in ways set out in that report. I say to the Government and to the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, who is at the table reading his newspaper and, no doubt, thinking of higher things, that if it wants to reform the waterfront-and it must be done if we are going to start solving these problems; it is just one of the areas that must be fixed-we will cooperate with it. We will help get the legislation through the Parliament. The Government will get bipartisan support for the reforms which are set out in the Inter-State Commission. We make that offer to break the impasse which it is now quite obvious the Government has fallen into. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a government which is paralysed because it cannot come to grips with the fact that, as we were told by the waterfront unions just two days ago, the unions will never budge on the issues which have been identified by the Inter-State Commission-withdrawal of coverage from small ports and container depots; the inclusion of automatic stand down provisions in awards; compulsory redundancy; contracting out of work; and the use of casuals. In other words, we have a situation where there is notorious waste which is costing Australians dear. In terms of debt and reduced living standards it is costing them $600m to be gained in this area alone. </PARA>

I confirm in this debate what I have said outside the Parliament today: the coalition will assist in the passage of the legislation, including any necessary appropriations. It will commit a future coalition government to continued implementation of the waterfront plan, thus providing a climate of predictability and certainty for those involved in the industry. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the press release of today's date which I issued on that subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>COALITION OFFERS PARALYSED GOVERNMENT ITS SUPPORT FOR GENUINE REFORM OF THE WATERFRONT</PARA>
<PARA>It is now clear that the Government is paralysed on genuine reform of the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> To help break the impasse, the Coalition will offer bipartisan support to the Government if it is willing to implement a genuine program of reform on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> The Coalition will assist in the passage of the legislation, including any necessary appropriations. It will also commit a future Coalition government to continued implementation of the waterfront plan, thus providing a climate of predictability and certainty for those involved in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> However the Coalition's support is conditional on the Government adopting a plan that will lead to fundamental structural reform. The recommendations of the Inter-State Commission report provide a good basis for such a plan. </PARA>
<PARA> The Coalition is not happy with every aspect of the report-however it recognises that as a package it represents a framework for achieving real improvement on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, it reflects the Coalition's emphasis on competition and a more enterprise based approach to employee relations. </PARA>
<PARA> Central to fundamental structural reform must be a move to full enterprise employment. In particular individual employers must be given the freedom to hire and fire employees that exists in industry generally. This should include access to compulsory redundancies as a last resort. It also means being free to hire supplementary labour without having to go through a ``pool''. </PARA>
<PARA> As recommended in the Inter-State Commission report, government contributions to fund redundancy payments should be paid progressively, and be made dependent on progress in implementing the waterfront plan on an enterprise basis. This should include the complete elimination of restrictive work practices and the introduction of multi-skilling. </PARA>
<PARA> The Inter-State Commission recommendations on union coverage and stand downs must also be implemented. These are not peripheral to reform-they form key elements in the Inter-State Commission's strategy of introducing greater competition and improving industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there must be appropriate appointments made to the implementation authority. Members of the authority must be seen as independent of the interests involved in the industry, and as having a background that will ensure a proper appreciation of the need to improve efficiency and productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not believe that these proposals can in any way be characterised as ``confrontationist''. Employees in the waterfront industry would continue to enjoy extremely generous pay and conditions by community standards. They would also be given the opportunity to take early retirement on terms far more favourable than are available to the rest of the community. Unions would continue to play a major role in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> We are extremely concerned at comments by senior Government Ministers which suggest an inclination to back down on a number of crucial issues in the face of union pressure. </PARA>
<PARA> Inefficiencies on the waterfront are costing Australia over $800 million a year. The Coalition is committed to genuine reform of the waterfront. It is now up to the Government to show that it shares this commitment. </PARA>

Again, the Opposition has generously said it will support award restructuring which is genuine. We are desperately concerned at the bureaucratisation of the Australian work force which is taking place at the moment in the name of award restructuring and the attempts by the Australian Council of Trade Unions to limit the way award restructuring is used to improve the efficiency and productivity of our work. We have been critical of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Button said, `Look what the Government is doing in award restructuring'. Let me remind Senator Button of what was shown in a survey issued this week by the National Australia Bank Ltd and the Australian Chamber of Commerce in their quarterly business survey. They said that businesses involved in the restructuring of labour do not believe that as that restructuring is proceeding at present it will add to Australia's productivity. We find in that survey that 11 per cent of respondents anticipated a minor stimulus, 18 per cent expected a minor contraction and 65 per cent expected no change.

<PARA> I say to honourable senators from the Labor side who are taking part in this debate that to deny that there is a real national crisis is a lie; to deny that we need a far faster process of reform, including vital micro-economic reform, is a lie. It is selling out this country to defend the corruption of the labour market which is occurring at the moment in terms of its increasing centralisation and lack of flexibility as being a step in the direction of salvation. It is not. It is a further step down a road which is the road to ruin, the Argentine way.

Australia has always had an overseas deficit except for a few years in the early post-war period. That deficit typically has been funded by a capital inflow because Australia is a developing country, a capital-scarce country. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I was reading a paper by perhaps Australia's greatest ever economist, Professor Trevor Swan, who recently passed away. In 1955, in a major article, Professor Swan diagnosed the balance of payments as the major constraint on growth in the Australian economy. He diagnosed it as the external constraint on economic growth in this country, the real constraint on expansion of our economy. That documentation was done in 1955, over 30 years ago, by Australia's greatest economist. It was a documentation of a balance of payments problem under a Liberal Government, not a Labor Government. This problem existed at the time under the Menzies Liberal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing new at all about balance of payments problems in our nation. This motion is the biggest dollop of Opposition hypocrisy I have seen in the last several weeks in this Parliament. It is the biggest load of hypocrisy I have ever seen on economic questions in this place by this discredited Opposition, this disunited, disorganised rabble which claims to be Her Majesty's Opposition in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the Opposition's record on economic management when it was in government. Let us look at its record of destroying competitiveness in the Australian economy and bringing the Australian economy to its knees in 1982. Look at its record under Senator Stone, who was the first speaker in the debate, the person who initiated the debate. He was the architect of the economic policies of the previous coalition Government in Australia. Under that Government we had a massive wages blow-out, with huge double-digit increases in wage costs in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This morning I was looking at an economic report of the Parliamentary Library. In 1981-82 average weekly earnings grew by 14.6 per cent in this country under the coalition Government. Double-digit wage rises were followed by an increase of 11.4 per cent in 1982-83 under the coalition Government led by Mr Fraser and Mr Howard. Senator Stone was their chief economic adviser. These double-digit wage rises and double-digit cost increases for Australian industry made our industry less competitive overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Look at the broad cost increases. Let us go beyond the wage rises that occurred under the Liberals. Look at the deflator for Australia's gross domestic product, the broadest inflation measure we can find. In 1981-82 there was an 11.6 per cent increase in costs in Australia, followed by 11.4 per cent in 1982-83. There was double-digit inflation under the Liberals. In fact, for the two financial years compounded, Australian costs rose by almost a quarter under the Liberal Government. Senator Stone, who will not cop the replies to his motion, has left the chamber again. When he was at the Treasury and pressing the economic buttons, costs rose by almost a quarter in two financial years-despite the avowed policy of the present Opposition, then in government, to fight inflation first. They were the avowed policies of the Opposition. Look at the record: Australian costs rose by almost a quarter in two financial years. That was the result. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Stone has made great play today of the balance of payments problem. I have already put that into some historical perspective. The point I am making is that Australia has always had one. Senator Stone is now the Leader of the National Party in the Senate. So these points should be raised because, if he gets the chance again, presumably we will see the same policies put into operation. When Senator Stone was at the Treasury, Australia had a balance of payments deficit on current account of $9 billion in 1981-82. The reality was a deficit of $9 billion under the Liberals in their last full financial year in power. These things have to be kept in perspective. Senator Stone today glossed over the reality that economic variables must be seen in many cases in relative terms. They have to be related to the size of the economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said $9 billion. That is the reality. Let us relate that to the size of the economy. It is all very well for the Liberals and the Nationals to run around throwing figures into the air. They have to be related to the size of the capacity of the economy to service things like that. The reality is that in 1981-82 that $9 billion deficit, which Senator Lewis was clearly ignorant of-and I wonder how long he is going to survive in his job if he does not know something like that-was on a gross domestic product, Australia's gross national income, if you like, of $150 billion. That deficit was 6 per cent of gross domestic product in 1981-82. That is the fact; that is the reality; and that is what happened under the Liberals. Those opposite have gone quiet all of a sudden because they know they were wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The gross domestic product for 1988-89 is likely to be in the vicinity of $325 billion. Basically, the size of the economic cake in Australia this financial year will be about $325 billion. If we were to take that 6 per cent figure that applied under the Liberals and apply that to our gross domestic product this year, the equivalent deficit this year, to match the $9 billion deficit in 1981-82, would not be $14 billion or $17 billion but in fact $19.5 billion. In today's dollar values, the balance of payments on current account deficit in that year was $19.5 billion. That is the figure; that is the fact; and that is the reality. Senator Stone today was trying to pull figures out of the air. He was talking about a $17 billion figure. He said it might even get to $17 billion this financial year. Senator Stone was trying to think of the worst possible figure. He was trying to exaggerate it up to $17 billion.

Based on the 1981-82 figures and applied to the cost levels of this financial year, the figure will be $19.5 billion. He said that it might get to $17 billion. That is as far as he could go.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Contrary to this motion, the Hawke Government has acted on the economic matters contained in this motion. It has contained the growth of costs in the Australian economy through the accord with the Australian Council of Trade Unions. It has implemented an incomes policy which has led to a managed economy. It has held down incomes growth despite very strong growth in the economy. That is an unusual result. When there is rapid growth in production and in economic output there tends to be rapid growth in wages. That has not been the case with the accord with the trade union movement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would now like to look at some of the data on the growth of costs in the Australian economy-provided not by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) or by the Treasurer (Mr Keating), and certainly not by me, but by the Department of the Treasury. It is a very interesting concept. This material has been provided by the independent Treasury. It looks at the index of unit labour costs in the non-farm part of the Australian economy from 1973 to 1983. In that period the average indexed number of costs was 107, but by 1987-88, under Labor, the cost level had not gone up but had gone down-and gone down significantly. In the last financial year, 1987-88, the index had fallen from a figure of 107, before we came into power, to 98.5. So there has been a terrific reduction in unit labour costs of production under this Government, something that Senator Stone, when he was at the Treasury, was never able to achieve. When we read that advice which has been put forward by the independent Treasury-not by the Prime Minister or the Treasurer-we see that it says that by 1987-88 there had been a 9 per cent reduction in unit labour costs compared with 1982-83. Of course, we know who was in government in 1982-83 and who was the architect of the economic policies of that Government. It was Senator Stone, who is not in the chamber to debate this matter. There has been this terrific reduction in unit labour costs. The Treasury Department concludes, as a result of its own calculations, that `the unwinding of this fundamental imbalance has contributed importantly to job growth in the last five years'. That is the result of the policies of this Government in effect, while the Opposition claims that there have to be immediate measures to deal with it. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to broad cost measures in the economy. As I mentioned before, the broadest measure is the deflator for gross domestic product in the non-farm sector. In 1982-83, the last year that the Liberals were on the treasury benches, that deflator, that broad measure of inflation, rose by 11.6 per cent. There was double digit inflation in 1982-83 under the Liberals. In 1987-88, the last financial year, we did not have double digit inflation, we did not even have 9 per cent inflation, we had a rate of 7.5 per cent. Despite the carping of the two lawyers across the chamber, who have absolutely no grasp of economic matters, despite the protestations of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Senator Lewis)-who clearly was wrong, as he did not know that the Liberals had a $9 billion balance of payments current account deficit in 1981-82-there has been a 4 percentage point reduction in the broad-based indicator of inflation in the Australian community. They are some of the measures that have been put in place by this Labor Government. That is what we are doing to improve the economic fortunes of Australia. That is the reality, that is how we will boost the economy. Labor's policy on economic matters is responsible, unlike the Opposition's pie in the sky policies. They failed once before, seven years ago, and Australia cannot afford to try them again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the following matter of urgency:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The need for immediate action to address the fundamental lack of competitiveness which underlies Australia's balance of payments and debt crisis. </PARA>
<PARA>Anyone who listened to what Senator Maguire was saying would have thought that this country was on top of the world, that our economy was performing at the present moment as if we were Japan. It is unbelievable the way Senator Maguire fails to address the real underlying problems of this nation. It is fascinating that he does that, notwithstanding the fact that his Treasurer, Mr Keating, is prepared to acknowledge the difficulties of this nation. Senator Maguire was saying that Senator Stone had dreamed up some figure, about a $17 billion deficit. The truth is that on the sixteenth of this month, in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Keating was reported as acknowledging that the trade deficit in 1988-89 could be as high as $17 billion. Mr Keating said that, not Senator Stone. That is almost double the forecast of $9.5 billion. Mr Keating's Budget forecast was $9.5 billion but the actual result will probably be a deficit of about $17 billion. On 17 February this year Mr Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA>I expect and indeed hope that the dollar will fall and certainly the day that starts we will not be standing in the way of stopping it. </PARA>
<PARA>So back in February Mr Keating was of the view that once the dollar started to fall, that would be a good thing. That has to be a disgraceful statement by the Treasurer of this country, because the falling dollar creates enormous problems for this country in meeting its debt payments. We are facing a crisis because of those difficulties. We are now facing that position that Mr Keating referred to, because on the twenty-third of this month the Australian dollar plunged to a 12-month low of US73.70c against a soaring United States dollar. What will be the result? Again let me refer to what the Treasurer himself has said. On 17 May, in an interview with an economic journalist, he referred to the `tyranny of debt' and he admitted that interest payments on foreign debt would increase next year and would keep domestic interest rates high. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The problem is that even after this year's current account, we'll be looking at something like $2 billion worth of interest payments next year just off this year alone, so that trade accounts have got to run $2 billion faster just to stand still. </PARA>
<PARA>So thanks to what is happening in this country at the moment, the Treasurer acknowledges that we have to earn an additional $2 billion overseas just to stand still. Senator Maguire would have the people of Australia believe that this country is not facing a crisis and that there is no need for immediate action to address the fundamentals of the problems of this economy. We say that the fundamentals of this economy relate to competitiveness. That is the underlying crisis, the failure in Australia to establish competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has had to say about interest rates. I take honourable senators back to January of this year when the Prime Minister was electioneering in Western Australia. He was making statements to the people of Australia about certain predictions, and on 27 January of this year he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Home loan interest rates will not rise any further before they fall later this year. </PARA>
<PARA>He denied that these comments were made in the context of the Western Australian election campaign. What is the truth in regard to interest rates? Of course they have risen massively to a stage where interest rates on overdrafts are frequently running at the rate of 23 per cent, which is what some banks are charging their customers, and 16 per cent on home loan interest rates, the highest they have ever been. The Weekend Australian of 20 May states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, confirmed monetary policy would remain tight and there would be no early easing in home loan interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> The people's interests would be devastated if we didn't take steps to restrain demand . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian dollar would collapse, interest rates would go through the roof and the economy would collapse. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the change in attitude of the Prime Minister now that he is away from the Western Australian election. As I mentioned, the fundamental problem is the lack of competitiveness. Let us see what Senator Button is saying about that. On 3 May be described the Australian car manufacturing industry's recent performance as mediocre. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The first message is that . . . there were significant price increases . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The second very important message is that productivity is not comparable with productivity in Japan, which is the major producer of motor vehicles and is, although improving, not good by world standards. </PARA>
<PARA>So notwithstanding the comments Senator Button made in the chamber today in this debate, he indicated that one of our great problems is our lack of productivity. Of course that is brought about by our lack of competitiveness under this Government, which is not prepared to take the very urgent steps which are necessary to bring about competitiveness. The Metal Trades Industry Association Inc. (MTIA) submission to the Full Bench of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in April referred to some of the barriers which are standing in the way of manufacturers in Australia, and to our inflexible and outdated training infrastructure. What is the Government doing about that? It is talking; that is what it is doing. The MTIA submission also referred to union demarcations. What is the Government doing about that? It is talking. It referred to our lack of consultative procedures and to attitudes. It also said, and we thoroughly agree with it, `. . . we are going to need every competitive edge we can get'. We are not going to get competitive edges out of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the question of inflation. Under the Hawke Government inflation is endemic. In the past two years the consumer price index has risen by 16 per cent in Australia compared with 5 per cent in the United States of America, 2 per cent in Japan and 2 per cent in Germany. In the fourth quarter of 1988 the Australian inflation rate was higher than in any industrialised nation with the sole exception of Iceland. The Government blames Australians for spending and not saving. Why would Australians save their money when its value is falling under this Government at the rate of about 1 per cent every two months? That is what is happening to the value of the Australian dollar. In the meantime the Reserve Bank of Australia is printing money at an unprecedented level. Between the fourth quarter of 1986 and the fourth quarter of 1988 the quantity of currency circulating in Australia increased by 40 per cent. Let me try to explain that. In other words, there is about 140 per cent, 40 per cent more money than there had been in the fourth quarter of 1986, to spend on about the same amount of goods and services. Certainly there may be slightly increased goods and services. I am not arguing about that but in general there is about 40 per cent more money to spend on the same goods and services. It automatically increases inflation because there is more money circulating around the economy. That is the Government's fault. The Government is using the printing presses to create inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that, after six years of this Government, Australia has become a more unfair and a less equal society. Thousands of ordinary Australians are being forced into poverty. Let me quote as an example an article in the Daily Mirror of 22 May. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Mrs Beard, a former union official who is married with two young children, said her general household bills have increased from $70 a week to $110 to $120 in the last year. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an increase of $40 to $50 a week in one year. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Now there were the promised tax cuts, but all this was being eroded away by ever-creeping costs. </PARA>
<PARA>The Daily Mirror on the next day in a follow-up article on how to survive gave other examples of families who are struggling to exist on wage packets of $600 a week. An income of $600 a week is necessary just to survive in this country under the Labor Government. The Hawke Government's proposed tax cuts would only compensate for what this Government has ripped off the ordinary people with its taxation bracket creep. The consequence is great pressure for increases in disposable incomes, great pressure for some money increases in order to survive. There is a great danger of a wages blow-out. What is the Government doing about that? Again, it is talking about it. It is not doing anything. This Government has done practically nothing since it was elected in July 1987. One does not have to be an economist to know that a $50 a week tax-wage package would not compensate for the lowering of standards of living inflicted by this Government. In any event any such package appears to be in doubt since Mr Keating said that there is no lingering gratitude in the electorate for tax cuts. There is a desperate need for fundamental reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, let me say what we believe the Government ought to be doing. Let me give an example in relation to the waterfront area. Simply buying out restrictive work practices is not only expensive but also unlikely to work. We have to get rid of the rorts and ensure that there are sufficient competitive pressures on employers and employees to reduce costs and ensure that there is an effective legal framework that prevents abuse of power, for example, the abuse of power which excludes potential new entrants from entering the industry. The monopoly powers on the waterfront, whether they are of operators or unions, must be broken, We want competition, not monopolies. That is what we stand for. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give some examples of what we suggested to the Government and what our policy suggests. In relation to Australian shipping we suggested that the Government negotiate with New Zealand to open trans-Tasman shipping to foreign vessels plying the route on longer voyages, phase out cabotage over five years, deregulate manning levels and provide a tariff of 10 to 15 per cent to allow shipping companies time to adjust. That is what we have suggested the Government do. Our policies clearly indicate what we will do when in government in relation to privatisation. We are not talking about creating opportunities for businesses to become monopoly providers of services which governments provide. We are talking about competition, giving people an opportunity to see the benefits of competition. We are talking about providing funds for Australians to help pay off our overseas debt by selling off some of these assets. We are talking about enabling organisations such as the airlines to provide from investors the funds which they need to survive in this present very difficult world of business. We also indicated to the Government the savings which could be effected by way of contracting out, and we turned to the question of award restructuring. The opportunities for effecting substantial changes to the economy in this country are enormous. We have indicated to the Government how it could go about it. But what is this Government doing? Frankly, it is doing nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to what the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Johnston, on 17 May said when he addressed the National Farmers Federation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>What is the matter with the Australian economy? Some would say that we live in the ``State of Self-Indulgence''. In the present financial year, total spending is growing at about twice the rate at which GDP is growing. </PARA>
<PARA>That is happening because of the economic situation which the people of Australia find themselves in, where it is much better to put their money into assets than into savings. We say to the Government that it is time that it addressed these fundamental issues and brought competitiveness into this economy, so changing the situation so that this country can start to do something about meeting the enormous national debt which it is facing at present. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again we have had a debate today based on a discussion, if I can call it that, about the economy. I am giving it a high sounding name to describe what, in effect, has been a series of prejudices running across the chamber at the Government. Obviously, there is real value in this Parliament year by year becoming much more interested in the whole question of economics. It has not always been so, and I think it is important to look at things in the historical sense from time to time. It is laudable, essential and valuable that this Parliament spend more time debating economics, what can be done, what people ought to be doing and what governments ought to be doing. At the same time, it is easy to fall into the trap, as I have noticed here today-Senator Stone has opened that trap for people to fall into, and I think he has been a victim of that trap himself-of forgetting that economics is basically an art, not a science.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We cannot talk about the economy as if it is some form of well oiled machine that requires an appropriate pressing of the right buttons or a pulling of the right lever to get the right results. In the end we are talking about people. We are talking about the way people spend money, the way they feel about themselves and how confident they feel about their future. We are talking about how they feel about being employed or unemployed. We are talking about their whole view of themselves, not just a question of sums and figures that can be moved one way or another by appropriate government action. What we can do is try to set a pattern or framework within which the economy can move in certain directions and provide certain benefits to Australian society as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, Senator Stone brings to this chamber-he has done so today through his urgency motion-a certain view about the way economies should work. It is a Treasury mandarin's view, honed after years of working in that castle, giving advice to various Prime Ministers, which on many occasions was ignored. Sometimes he was right; on many occasions he was wrong. This is a person who spent his whole life analysing the way economies work and advising the government of the day. For example, his views about the floating of the dollar were not heeded by two Treasurers. They have proved over time to be wrong. His views about restructuring the Australian economy and the removal of protectionism in this country did not cut much ice with at least one Prime Minister that he had to work under. I say all of that by way of introduction, because it is Senator Stone who has raised this issue today. It is important to remind him that this is a Labor Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Good. If the honourable senator remembers that he will remember that we are here for a particular purpose. That purpose is to try to bring forward the principles that underpin Australian Labor Party philosophy. That underpinning of our philosophy is also the underpinning of this economy. For example, we set out to create growth and at the same time to defeat the scourge of unemployment in this country. We do not see the labour force as some cannon fodder to be moved in and out of unemployment to satisfy neat academic views about the way an economy should be run. We as a government tried as realistically as possible, and at a pace that was appropriate or at least acceptable to the Australian population, to make Australia outward-looking and competitive. We sought to do it in a way which caused as little human misery as possible where that restructuring affected people's working lives. I will address those fundamental issues of growth and employment and the restructuring of the economy and of industry in general.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have to look at how things have moved in history. When this Government took over in 1983 the Australian economy had stalled. Senator Stone I think recognises that. Inflation and unemployment stood at more than 11 per cent; the training of our work force, especially our young skilled tradesmen, had virtually stopped; Australian manufacturing had declined and had already shed 250,000 jobs over the previous 10 years; strikes were endemic and damaging to Australia's trading reputation; and wages, especially in the metal trades industry, had blown out to an insupportable level. Again, Senator Stone had looked at that period and he was concerned about the industrial relations policy that was being pursued at the time by Malcolm Fraser. It was a total disaster and it was threatening to blow this economy out of the water. </PARA>
<PARA> I might also add that when we came into government in 1983 borrowing by semi-governmental institutions such as water boards, hydro-electric commissions, energy authorities, and State governments had already been established in such a way that there was going to be an increase in the total debt of this country due, primarily, to Malcolm Fraser's irresponsible false selling of the resources boom that was going to follow upon appropriate infrastructure development. Again, Senator Stone knew that was wrong at the time. He knew that it was political opportunism to win another election. And Malcolm Fraser was certainly good at winning elections; he was not very good, in the long term, at managing the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> So this new Labor Government had a number of goals when it came into power. The first was to fix the economy, especially those outstanding issues which had been sitting around for many years and had never been addressed by previous governments including, I might say, the Whitlam Government. But, of course, very few governments were threatened with the rejection of Supply by the Senate twice in three years. So there was a sense of haste in the Whitlam Government which may appear, in retrospect, to have been a bit unseemly. There is an excuse for it but there certainly is no excuse for the Liberal Party which governed this country for more than 29 years with little fear, except on one occasion, of actually being thrown out of office. First of all this Government had to fix the economy, but not at the expense of ordinary workers. It carried out its own reforms of the social welfare system to make sure that the needy actually got the benefits and that those who were bludging on the system missed out. Brian Howe, in particular, has been very good in that area; he has been better than any other Social Security Minister we have had in this country in the last 20 or 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Our other aim was to restructure the economy-to restructure industry in particular and to make it competitive. Of course the final goal, as part of the process, was to bring the representatives of the Australian work force-that is, the union movement-into genuine consultation with the Labor Government, to set direction for industrial relations and the economy in general. What has been achieved? Inflation has gone down from 11 1/2 per cent under Malcolm Fraser to 6.7 per cent now. In fact, it is lower than the rate in Margaret Thatcher's Britain. I notice that Britain has been taken off the comparative figures list which the Liberal Party passes out to the media. When the United Kingdom inflation rate fell below ours, it was always mentioned in a comparison of the economies of the world. Now that it is at 8 per cent, nearly 1.3 per cent above that which prevails in Australia, the Thatcher comparison has mysteriously disappeared from all the pronunciations about the economy by shadow Treasurers. </PARA>
<PARA> The unemployment rate was 11 per cent under Fraser and it is now down to 7 per cent. If anything makes me proud of being a member of this Government-and all of us have our own criticisms of policies here and there-it is this Government's record of creating employment, of driving unemployment down from 11 per cent to 7 per cent and of being responsible for setting the pattern for the creation of 1.4 million new jobs in this country, the vast majority of which are in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> It is easy to forget, when we talk about economics, that in the long term the effect of unemployment is gross, disturbing, ugly, and damaging to the welfare of all of us, even those who are employed. If the mean duration of unemployment in this community is 26 weeks, it means that those people who are unemployed are, on average, more likely to lose the respect of their families and of people around them, to lose their own self-respect and to suffer from psychoses and psychiatric disorders which do not affect the rest of the community to the same degree. For example, a Commonwealth Employment Service study in Canberra recently showed that in the 16- to 24-year-old age group, 49 per cent of young people looked at had severe psychiatric disorders, three-quarters of those disorders taking the form of severe depression. Seventy per cent of those illnesses followed the onset of unemployment. We have restructured this economy not on the basis of satisfying Treasury mandarins, the high flying young men sitting behind computers in lovely offices in Sydney or smart operators in Tokyo or New York, but on the basis of bringing growth into the economy, creating jobs so that a much larger percentage, 1.4 million people, could get self-respect and a new place in the sun. That is one of the great achievements of the Hawke Labor Government. I will stand here until the cows come home and praise that achievement which has been brought about despite a great deal of criticism from people who have probably never been unemployed in their life. </PARA>
<PARA> The second achievement of this Government relates to training. When this Government came to power it had to overcome the problem of a dearth of trained people in the community, particularly apprentices. In 1982-83 the apprenticeship intake had bottomed out to a mere 35,000 young people. Now, as a result of Labor Government intervention at the macro-economic level of rearrangements and at the industry and training level, the number of apprentices has risen to 54,000-a 60 per cent increase over that which applied when we first took office. If the Fraser Government left us with a shortage of skilled labour, that legacy is on the conscience of everyone who was a member of that Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the restructuring of industry. I have already referred to the run-down of the manufacturing sector and the loss of 250,000 jobs over a decade. Our manufacturing industry, as we all know, was protected by high tariffs, quotas, and an overvalued Australian dollar. It was taking in its own washing. Despite all that, it was declining year by year. Australia is in the middle of a most dynamic region of the world which includes countries such as Taiwan and Japan and South East Asian nations. Over the next 10 years Australia will have available to it markets in such countries as China. Senator Button took on the reorganisation of those industries in an intelligent and long term way that was predictable to both industry and unions. He toughed out criticism from industry and unions and some people within the Labor Party in a way that the previous Government was not able to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fraser Government had 13 car plans in as many years. Senator Button said that there will be one car plan which will be reviewable at the end of four years. He said that we will try to overcome problems such as the invasion of foreign imports, lack of reliability and relative high prices. He said that this will not happen overnight. The actions of Senator Button in relation to the steel industry, the pharmaceutical industry and the textile industry have to be praised. But he is not there to hold the hands of industry. He does not act on behalf of the car industry on the Windsor Road or to tell people on television that he will do a deal for them, that he `will do it right for you' as Tony Packard says. He is not there to jump in the air like a Toyota salesman. He has set the framework and industry and the unions have to respond. That framework is an intelligent one and will bear fruit in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there is the question underpinning most of the reforms of this Government-the reform of industrial relations. When we came to power, this country was beset with strikes and with runaway, wages-caused inflation. Is it wrong to bring unions and the work force into active discussion with government? Is it wrong to wean workers away from an inflationary reliance on ever-increasing wages? Is it wrong to guarantee Australian families support through social welfare system subsidiary payments which make it unnecessary for them to go out into the marketplace and force their wages up? They can do that if they happen to be in a strategically important industry, but if they are not, they lose out. This Government's record on management of the economy and of industry is something that we on this side of the House are proud of. Under no circumstances do we accept the macho view that the value of the dollar is the most important thing in the world or that, somehow or other, the current account deficit, as Senator Macklin said, is the only measure of whether or not we are succeeding. We are succeeding. It will take a long time, and governments, when they are honest enough to say that the road to Argentina takes 30 years, are deluding the public. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-In the few minutes that I have to wind up this debate, I want to pick up very quickly a few of the points that have been deployed by Senator Aulich. He expressed heart felt praise for the Government for the growth in employment. I am not questioning his statistics. I am not saying that there has not been growth of 1.3 million to 1.4 million jobs during the six and a bit years of the present Government's period of office. That is not in question. Let me point out to Senator Aulich, however, that during the same period-not quite the same period, because the debt figures that we have cover only the period up to the end of last year-there has been an increase of approximately $80 billion in our foreign debt. A simple division will show that for every job created in this country during that time we have incurred $65,000 of foreign debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me pick up the remarks of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) last week and point out that on that debt we are going to be paying each year another $7,000 or $8,000 of income. And that says nothing about the growth in foreign ownership in this country during the same six years, all of which has also to be serviced out of the balance of payments. Anybody can create jobs by getting into debt. Anybody can make jobs available on borrowed money. But in the end we have to pay our way in the world, and that is what Australia is not doing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have time to respond to interjections. Senator Aulich has talked about the Government's great record on employment. It is certainly true that during the life of this Government unemployment has come down from the 10.4 or 10.3 per cent of the workforce that he mentioned to about 6.1 per cent, or whatever the figure for last year was. The average unemployment rate for the whole period of the Fraser Government was 6.1 per cent. Under the present Government we have just reached that level. So much for the Government's boasts about its unemployment record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whether Senator Aulich likes it or not, we do have an urgent problem in this country-a problem that needs immediate attention. But, as Senator Lewis said, we have heard nothing from this Government but talk, talk, talk. Especially in the two years since the last election, nothing has been done to address the issues. All we have had is talk. The whole policy of privatisation, which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) originally raised, has fallen on its face. The whole policy of micro-economic reform, about which we have been hearing, has fallen on its face. This afternoon Senator Button has told us what the Government may or may not do about that. We will wait and see. The Government has just over a week to fulfil its promise of last month that there would be a major statement on that matter before this month was out, before the Parliament got up. We will see what it has to say about that, and about the waterfront, as Senator Lewis and others have pointed out. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth of the matter is that we have a situation that requires urgent treatment. We cannot go on talking about it while we head towards what the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia called `that brutal adjustment'. Senator Aulich and others have been talking about their concern for the people of this country. If their concern has led to policies which, in the words of the Reserve Bank Governor, will lead to `a brutal adjustment', I can only say that their concern has been very ill-placed and very ill-directed. I do not wish to detain the Senate any longer. I think that we should proceed to a vote on this matter. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This major report is a significant indictment of the Government and its policies. If one looks at the report one sees an estimate by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission of at least 20,000 to 25,000 homeless children and young people across the country. The Commission stresses that that is a conservative estimate and makes specific reference to Dr Fopp's considered conclusion, based on all the evidence available, that a more likely figure is somewhere between 50,000 and 70,00 children and young people who are homeless or at serious risk. I remind the Senate that this report and that incredible indictment forms the background to the promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) at the last election that by 1990 no child would be living in poverty in this country. It demonstrates the Government's total failure to deliver that policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The report suggests that a major part of the blame has to be attributed to the failure of Government policies to support families and the failure to provide economic support before family breakdowns occur rather than simply trying to provide some remedial action after the event. I refer in particular to page 105 of the report where the Commission makes its point in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>We are prepared to provide economic support when a family breaks down, but not the support services which might have prevented the breakdown. We expect the family to take the lion's share of caring for its dependent members without providing the support necessary for it to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a message that we have been attempting to bring home to the Government for a long time-that the problem is severe. That message is now being reinforced by this respected and independent body; furthermore, remedial action should lie in the area of family support. </PARA>
<PARA> This report should not be a surprise to the Government because it has been receiving similar advice from other organisations. I remind the Senate of the advice that the Government received from the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) in October 1988. In the report entitled Income Support Policies, Taxation and Incentives, it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the evidence suggests that many low income people, especially families with children have to survive on insufficient nutrition, are unable to heat their homes in winter, are often unable to afford medication, and are denied most forms of recreation. In many instances, there may be long-term adverse consequences for the education, health and employment opportunities available to such families. </PARA>
<PARA>That report went on to emphasise that the position has deteriorated during the 1980s. That is the record of this Government: far from meeting its promise it has failed totally to deliver. Evidence would suggest that the position is worsening. What is the Government's answer? The Government came forward with its answer in its April economic statement. I suggest the answer was totally inadequate. It is an answer that is filled with deception. I mention just one example relating to an increase in family allowances. The April statement said that, for the first three children, the allowance would be increased to $9 a week. But the allowance is already $9 a week. For a family with six children, the family allowance has been increased by $11.25 a week. Bearing in mind inflation, interest rates, bracket creep, et cetera, this amount will go nowhere at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has had EPAC's report, this report on homeless youth, and the report of the Australian Institute of Family Studies, which all give the same message. The Government has not listened to that message. It has made promises to the Australian people which it has not kept. It is a critically important area and the Government stands condemned for its record in this area. </PARA>

<PARA>Come on, you elders! Do your share!</PARA>
<PARA>To me, that is a very telling poem indeed. It is one that ought to strike at the hearts of all of us. It is saying that the problem of homeless youth in Australia is massive and it is a problem that we have all, in part, caused. We all have an important role to play in trying to bring about its solution. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as economic issues, there are also great social issues involved. Child homelessness is not a new phenomenon; it has always been with us to some degree. But what is new in our society is its appearance on such a wide scale. The report indicates that between 20,000 and 25,000 children are now living on the streets, many of them following a life of crime, prostitution and drug addiction. That figure is almost certainly highly conservative. These children face a world of despair and uncertainty. It is an appalling indictment of the changes in our society over the past couple of decades or more and something about which we should all feel deeply troubled. I think the most important of the changes that have caused this problem are the dramatic changes to the family and the changes that have led to youth unemployment and support for some of the social dogmas and policies of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. These issues have been compounded very significantly by the policies of the Hawke Government. As Senator Hill said, the pledge by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the 1987 election campaign that by the year 1990 no child will be living in poverty has been proved, by this report alone, to be a quite monstrous deception of those most in need in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> Two factors have led, I believe, to the problems that we face. One is the breakdown of the role of the family in our society and the role of parents in helping to bring up their children and make their children responsible as part of a family unit. This is part of the fundamental reason for the homelessness problem plus many of the other social problems that we now face. The second factor that is of the gravest concern to me is the policies of this Government which have led to a breakdown of the code of volunteerism in our society and the major role that can be played by voluntary associations. Until such time as we change the policies which have made them the poor relations in our community, we will continue to have the problems that this report so dramatically, sadly and compassionately highlights. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too want to add some words in support of this very important and timely report. I was prompted to do so by the words uttered by Senator Short, who preceded me in this debate. Earlier in his contribution to the debate Senator Short said that there is no one side singly responsible for the plight of homeless youth in Australia today. I accept that view. I commend Senator Short for showing a bipartisan attitude to a very grave human problem that besets the youth of Australia in our society today. It would be all too easy for us, as parliamentarians, to shed blame without examining the causes. One of the causes put forward for homeless youth in Australia today has been said to be family breakdown. Certainly that is one contributing factor, a very important contributing factor, but not the only one. If we are to address the problem of homeless children in Australia today we have to look behind the one glib simplistic answer. For that reason I was prompted to get up and commend the words of Senator Short in his excellent contribution here this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also commend an Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) program on this issue which was telecast in two parts last week. Unfortunately, on the first day, on Wednesday of last week, I was in a part of my electorate that does not have access to television. I did not see the first part but it is recorded and it will be looked at at a later time. I did see the second part. It was an excellent further contribution to the examination of a very difficult situation that we have in Australia today. That second part, the only part of the program that I did see, reinforces the view that I put forward earlier in my contribution-that there is no single cause of the problem of our homeless children. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to a negative note. At the conclusion of this program we had the unfortunate experience of a further ABC program on the same theme called Couchman. The program is hosted by an ABC commentator called Peter Couchman and at this time I remind the Senate that the ABC is costing each taxpayer 8c a day. At the very commencement of the program he said that nobody in Australia today is listening to the homeless youth. Just after he finished that sentence he introduced Mr Burdekin, saying that Mr Burdekin had been listening to homeless youth for 17 months. Despite that very poor start, the program just got worse and worse. Mr Couchman, who was supposed to be in charge of the program, lost a great deal of control of what could have been another valuable contribution. I think that people who watched both programs as well as the Couchman report might have ended up with a very negative view of this enormous problem that confronts us today. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a problem that has to be addressed. There is no question about it; it just has to be addressed. In attempting to address that problem it would be better if we could get some degree of bipartisan support from all political parties. Certainly there will be point-scoring in the debate on the way through but hopefully that political point-scoring will not overshadow that problem of some of our youth in Australia today. I certainly hope that is so and I am encouraged by the words of Senator Short in his earlier contribution to the debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report on homeless children has indeed shocked everybody. The Australian Democrats certainly join with Commissioner Brian Burdekin in expressing our deep concern over the issues that have been raised by this inquiry into child homelessness. As Senator Hill stated earlier, the news is not new to us. As long ago as last December, the Age reported on a report of the Australian Institute of Family Studies that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Government policies to aid unsupported, homeless youths need overhauling because they have created confusion and failed to give adequate support . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I agree with Senator McKiernan that it is up to all of us to work together towards correctly putting an end to the dreadful situations highlighted in the report Our Homeless Children. Nonetheless, in doing that, we must look at the situation and what is provided. The article in the Age highlighted the fact that the programs of income support, training and homeless allowances do not appear to be working. It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . recent policy developments placed the responsibility for young people firmly back on the family, leaving many homeless young people in a perilous state, while responsibilities were shuffled between departments. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not helpful to our homeless youth. When Commissioner Burdekin was questioned on his report, he pleaded with governments, the media and the bureaucracy not to let youth homelessness become just another issue. He stressed the enormity of the situation and pleaded that we should all recognise it. He said that if we cannot recognise this:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we face the very real prospect of an already tragic problem becoming something virtually uncontrollable. </PARA>
<PARA>The report estimated that there are between 130,000 and 150,000 homeless Australians, of whom up to 70,000 are aged between 12 and 24 years. Mr Burdekin continued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the number of homeless would rise unless governments and the bureaucracy adopted a revolutionary solution to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA>Of all the recommendations in the report, Commissioner Burdekin highlighted the need for a task force which, although it may be composed of bureaucrats, would spend time talking to people on the ground. The issues that Commissioner Burdekin was referring to are highlighted in a horrendous article in today's West Australian, entitled `What is happening to our children?'. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The dreadful fantasy of the Clockwork Orange in which violent gangs turned on the society that spawned them, does not seem so fantastic these days. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, the danger is that we can look to greater violence on our streets unless we can solve the homelessness problem. Although the young muggers on the streets are not all homeless-and there is no doubt about that because some of them come from very good homes but still resort to violence-the homeless youths on the streets can also be drawn into those sorts of situations. Certainly, social conflict and violence within the home environment remains the major cause of young people leaving home, forcing them to fend for themselves on the streets. </PARA>
<PARA> The report of the National Inquiry into Homeless Children has been awaited with a lot of trepidation, and it is unfortunate that the findings are predictable. It is becoming increasingly obvious that the Federal Government has not been successful in its endeavours to eradicate child poverty, which is one of the major problems. It will not be until all levels of government and, indeed, all of us accept responsibility for the development of a comprehensive and effective youth program that the social difficulties created by child poverty and the subsequent homelessness can be resolved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to make a few comments on the report Our Homeless Children, which has become known as the Burdekin report. I welcome the report because it focuses the eye of the media on this matter. It certainly elevates it in the public debate, to make people aware that we have 25,000 homeless youths in the streets of Australia. This is everyone's responsibility. We cannot pass the buck. The aspect that I find hardest to accept is that we have presided over the emergence of a real subculture made up of a significant number of our children who have deliberately rejected the society that we have built for them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important to differentiate between the youths who opt out and those who are homeless because of a family crisis, abuse or maltreatment. It is the child who is on the run because of the home environment that should be the first objective of our concern. Every government should be leading the way in breaking up the cycle of child abuse and homelessness with sound policies and programs, placing emphasis on the survival of the family. Non-government agencies have contributed a great deal through church and community initiatives. In Logan City, which is one of the more depressed areas in Brisbane, Boys Town has recently set up a crisis accommodation centre which provides professional and non-threatening help and reduces the workload of the police. There are also a number of homes in Brisbane run by local people who provide children in crisis with short term accommodation before referring them to another range of places. These people deserve tremendous support. I know there is such a group in Wynnum, where I live, which does a wonderful job. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred earlier to the difference between the majority that desperately need assistance and the small but growing percentage of homeless children who have made a deliberate choice to be homeless. This is not something that I feel comfortable in saying because it is an admission of failure on the part of all of us, but it would be worse to turn a blind eye, to set up preconceived ideas and stick to them, to find out only what could be coped with and ignore the rest. Some of our youths want to live in these conditions without responsibilities. No matter whether they are provided with hostels or other types of accommodation, they do not want to change from their particular lifestyle. They do not want to work and do not want to have work. They refuse to accept normal limits of their behaviour and they certainly do not tolerate discipline. They do not look after the accommodation and housing which is offered to them. </PARA>
<PARA> This subculture has influence and leadership over the real victims of homelessness, the abused and the mistreated, and sometimes exerts a distorting influence over research and media coverage. It serves no purpose except to enhance the image of the subculture heroes. As I mentioned before, the hardest thing to accept is that some of our youths deliberately choose to reject our society. A very real subculture has emerged which does not accept our offer of housing, foster families, work and life in the Australian mainstream. </PARA>
<PARA> In the short time remaining to me I say that I honestly believe that the only way to provide the best care for children is to support family policies that encourage the home, and acknowledge the family as the basic unit of society. If the family can hold together, we will not have children out on the streets. Every government has to be encouraged to produce policies that will support the family, policies that allow families to have homes without paying massive interest rates and taxation policies that allow people a decent form of living. Unless those policies are forthcoming from any government, we will have homeless children. We cannot develop policies that exert pressures on the family and make a home a battleground rather than a family situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report Our Homeless Children is one of the most serious reports to have come before the Parliament this year. It is quite timely that this report has been tabled when little more than six months remains for the fulfilment of the pledge made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on the eve of the 1987 election that no Australian child would be living in poverty by 1990. I was concerned that Senator McKiernan, the only senator on the Government side who has spoken on this matter, did not mention that promise and how, if the Government was serious, it was going to keep it. I do not necessarily blame this or any other government, which is the point that Senator Short and Senator McKiernan were addressing, for failing to eliminate poverty in two and a half years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australians have every right to blame a politician who makes such a commitment before an election and then tries to renege on it. That to me is the sin. The Prime Minister now says that there is no need for a child to be in poverty and that the problem of homeless youth is due to family breakdown. That was certainly not his story, his line or the method in his madness in making such a scandalous commitment prior to the last election. It really begs the question that the major contributing cause of family breakdown is economic pressure, to which the policies of this Labor Government contribute heavily. </PARA>
<PARA> The most optimistic estimate of the number of Australian children who will be living in poverty after the impact of the family package of this Government is, according to Brownlee and King, 260,800 people. Sadly, this is the pool from which so many homeless adolescents will be drawn. According to a report quoted by a major Western Australian voluntary welfare agency, Anglicare, there are 77,000 children in my State living below the poverty line. This could translate into a potential and actual problem of hundreds of teenagers leaving home. </PARA>
<PARA> Younger Australians remain major victims of unemployment, with 77,600 in the 15-19 age group seeking full time work last month. This unemployment rate of 14.3 per cent is a slight improvement upon the disastrous 21 per cent of only two years ago but is still more than double the overall unemployment rate of 6.2 per cent. This Government is wondering why there is so much homeless youth. It has only to look at its own disastrous results in finding employment for young people. High youth unemployment can mean family dislocation and youth poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the conclusion of the Australian Institute of Family Studies that unemployed 16- and 17-year-olds are more likely to leave home than those who obtain work. An institute survey of unemployed teenagers in these circumstances showed that they receive a median income of $135 per week to be set against the July 1988 poverty line figure of $149 before housing costs. These were not street kids or substance abusers but young Australians caught in a situation of poverty. They need to spend 25 per cent of income even on subsidised accommodation and claim that `you don't cope, you struggle'. These figures do not point to the need for higher welfare payments but for more effective action to tackle the problems of joblessness and family breakdown when overall economic policy places the family under extreme strain. It is true that some children and adolescents from affluent circumstances suffer family breakdown and impairment and may become `voluntary' victims of homelessness and subsequent poverty. But, overwhelmingly, evidence suggests that economic pressure plays a big part in the divorce rate-4,600 a year in Western Australia-and that then causes young Australians to be raised in relative deprivation. </PARA>
<PARA> The actual cost of raising children, particularly teenagers, must be a very real factor in precipitating homelessness where relationships with parents and, more often, step-parents are impaired. The latest information from the Australian Institute of Family Studies shows that low income families really are very badly off in terms of the amount of support they get from welfare. The money they receive does not go anywhere near covering the costs. We have a problem with homeless youth and poverty not because this Government pays insufficient welfare but because the root causes of the problem-the breakdown of families and the pressure of housing costs and living costs-are not being met by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This important report from the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training has been widely publicised throughout the community and is beginning to be publicised in our schools and other youth organisations. There have been helpful responses by State education Ministers and already this is clearly a very successful report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the best decisions made by the Senate Committee was to name the inquiry `active citizenship'. This is a positive concept; it is something that is of importance to every single Australian; and it is a matter that should have been addressed many years ago. There is a certain fragility in any democracy if the citizens of a country are not fully aware of their rights and are not fulfilling the potential for participation in all the decision making processes of the country. Australia should strengthen the foundations for democracy. One of the ways to do that is for the Commonwealth and State governments to take up the findings and recommendations of the Senate inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA> At the outset I would like to commend the professional support that was given to the Committee by various officers of this Parliament. I can only say that they went about their work with total professionalism. I commend Mr Derek Allan, the Secretary of the Committee, and the research staff who assisted us in every aspect of the conduct of the inquiry. They showed full professionalism in the normal pursuits of dealing with our reference, ensuring that interested bodies or potentially interested bodies around Australia were aware of our inquiry and were able to make submissions, organising the way we conducted our hearings throughout Australia and preparing the written report. They applied themselves with considerable imagination. We ensured that a discussion paper was produced before we had most of our hearings. We produced a large print edition of the report so that those with limited eyesight would have access to it. We ensured that a film and an audio tape of comments setting out main points of the report were made available throughout Australia. During the course of the inquiry we arranged for some of the hearings to be videotaped. This was the first time we had taken such a step. This inquiry has set new standards in terms of the way in which the Senate and its committees can communicate with the Australian public and ensure participation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the five minutes that remain, let me say something about some matters of the report that were of particular importance to me. It is important that Australians understand the politics of this country; its Constitution; the three levels of government; the nature of local, State and Federal government; the processes of the Parliament; the methods of election; and the detailed procedures of Australian democracy. They should have some knowledge of the long centuries of the Westminster tradition; the concepts of account- ability; and the nature of decision making, which is wider than government and parliament, and involves writers, the Public Service, the Press, political parties and so on. Not only is it necessary for greater information to be given to the Australian public on all these matters, but it should be available in a way that is not static but dynamic; not just an anatomy lesson of decision making in this country but one that has clear signposts to each individual's ability to be involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The knowledge of Australian citizenship should be an active knowledge. There should be no particular barriers to individuals taking up their interests and participating actively themselves. The curricula for teaching these matters in our schools have been too static and not dynamic enough. One of the reasons for this is that, as soon as one goes from a description of the anatomy of decision making in this country to one that is participatory, active and empowering to those involved in such courses, to some extent controversy arises. </PARA>
<PARA> Parents tend not to trust active teaching about political decision making in this country if they do not have full confidence in the actual views of the teacher. Yet to teach this actively and effectively requires commitment and involvement by those who are teaching or are responsible for courses. One cannot teach active decision making in Australia without some experience of activity. If it is taught in a bland, anatomical way, it will not inspire anyone to action. So there is a call or a need for considerable maturity on the part of those responsible for curricula in schools or at any level of learning given by public institutions. This maturity has sometimes been wanting and has led to controversy. I reinforce the finding of the inquiry that, nevertheless, we press ahead with encouragements to active citizenship through committed people with an active, empowering perspective but one which, of course, must have maturity, fairness and accountability so that this kind of controversy does not arise. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me also refer to the concept of youth parliaments. I believe that one activity that may lead young Australians to be eventually involved at the three levels of government in this country is for them to have mock parliamentary experience. I believe that in each State, in association with each State Parliament, there ought to be an annual parliament involving representative youth with an actual agenda and preliminary discussion and instruction about procedures such as standing orders and the conduct of an actual day's proceedings within the parliament. Linked with that, there should be some helpful information about the real Parliament, of which they would be the guests for that day or two. Then drawn from those assemblies around the States, there ought to be an annual exercise of that kind here in this Parliament. I commend it, and I think it is something that can flow from this inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I briefly refer to the importance of giving added emphasis to the time when a person is added to the Australian electoral roll. We have citizenship ceremonies for those who come as migrants to this country. They are high occasions of enormous importance to the individual-not quite as important perhaps as the marriage ceremony but, nevertheless, a very important ceremony. We do not have anything when someone is added to the electoral roll, and I believe that consideration should be given to that. </PARA>

<PARA> The Committee inspected the existing office accommodation of the Family Court in March 1989 and found it to be unsatisfactory and that it does not facilitate the efficient operation of the Family Court nor meet the needs of the Court. The proposal provides for the Family Court building to be located on the corner of Goulburn and Castlereagh Streets, Sydney, at the southern end of the city centre. The Committee is aware that the building will be located outside the traditional legal precinct in Sydney centred around Queens Square, Macquarie Street. However, the Committee is satisfied that it is a suitable location and noted the advice of the New South Wales Government that a second legal precinct is emerging in the district surrounding the proposed Court site. The erection of the building for the Family Court of Australia is consistent with the Commonwealth's policy to provide purpose-designed Commonwealth law court buildings in each capital city of Australia to accommodate courts and their associated staff. The estimated cost of the building is $42.5m at October 1988 prices and the building is scheduled for completion by late 1992 or early 1993. </PARA>

<PARA> In future, the `notice given' date of questions appearing on the Notice Paper will be the date of receipt of the question by the Senate Table Office, regardless of whether or not it is received on a sitting day. The previous practice of deeming questions to be received only on sitting days, which is not required by the procedures of the Senate, will no longer apply.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the tabling statement for an extension of time for the Aboriginal Development Commission to present its annual report as tabled by the Clerk to the Senate on 23 May 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>This important issue was raised by the Clerk in tabling a request from the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, dated 20 April 1989. I note that the Minister has granted the request for a further extension for the presentation of the annual report of the Aboriginal Development Commission. This matter concerns me greatly because, as honourable senators will recall, the issue was raised extensively both on the previous occasion in November 1988, when an extension was granted for the tabling of the annual report of the Aboriginal Development Commission, and subsequently when it was raised in the Senate Estimates Committee E hearing. During that hearing, I raised a number of questions with officers of the ADC, and I believe they sought to cover up the problems in the extensions of time and the submitting of the annual report. In fact, an officer, Mr Fitzwarryne, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Usually delays by the Audit Office in completing its audit statements. </PARA>
<PARA>The subsequent answers to questions that were taken on notice at Estimates Committee E indicate that that was in fact an incorrect statement. In the eight-year period of the Aboriginal Development Commission, it has been late in submitting its annual reports for each of those years, and the great majority of those delays have been because of the late finalisation of financial statements. </PARA>
<PARA> What is of particular concern with regard to the current request for an extension of time for the annual report is that the excuse given for this current year-it is not yet tabled-is that it is:</PARA>
<PARA>`Anticipated to be presented on 25 May 1989. Delays in financial statements arising, this year, from the diversion of resources to the various parliamentary and audit scrutinies and the development of ATSIC'. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact that the ADC has had to channel its own resources away from the preparation of its own important accountability to the development of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission-which was a matter that of course did not primarily concern the ADC-is a matter of major concern. The Minister has now given this second extension within a period of a few months and the annual report therefore will not be presented until Wednesday, 31 May 1989. The seriousness of this matter cannot be highlighted too strongly, particularly in light of the very unsatisfactory accountability performance of the Aboriginal Development Commission. That is the reason that I have moved the motion to take note of that particular report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the interruption, I was speaking to the appropriations and supplementary appropriations for the parliamentary departments. I was making a fundamental point that this Government, by the determination of the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh), has chosen to provide funding below the minimum level which allows the Senate to fulfil its obligations, notwithstanding the fact that the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing, of which Senator Button, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, is a member, unanimously carried resolutions, accepted by the Senate, re-establishing and restating the fundamental principle that the Senate is the most appropriate body to determine the level of funding that is required. That resolution was reaffirmed on 2 December 1985 by a committee of the Senate, of which Senator Graham Richardson was the Chairman. It restated the provisions of the resolution of the Senate dated 25 March 1982, relating to the responsibilities for the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing with respect to the estimates for the Senate. It was determined that the estimates of expenditure for the Senate to be included in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill shall continue to be those determined by the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing. The resolution then explained the fundamental steps that are necessary in the event that there is some conflict between the views of the Committee, of the Minister for Finance, and of the Government. It is not without significance to note that that resolution of Estimates Committee D, chaired, as I say, by Senator Richardson, was carried unanimously in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The cynical attitude that this Government has towards the Parliament was perhaps best demonstrated by Senator Walsh when I raised that particular matter in a previous debate. I asked Senator Walsh why he had not spoken to or voted against the resolution, and he contemptuously interjected to say that the resolution was as meaningless in 1989 as it was in 1985. As far as he was concerned, it was irrelevant to him and inconsequential in terms of the determinations he was making. So Senator Walsh takes unto himself the exclusive right to make a judgment as to what funding is required to allow the Senate to fulfil its obligations. It was Senator Walsh who said, when the committee examination of a certain matter was raised, `If you insist on proceeding with this committee, I will ensure you have not got the funding to set the committee up'. In other words, as I said prior to lunch, Senator Walsh was acting as the seventeenth century Stuart kings acted and saying, `Your capacity as a parliament to fulfil your responsibilities and your obligations in respect of the scrutiny of government legislation on behalf of the citizens depends entirely upon my benevolence, goodwill and determination'. That is an attitude which he continues to reflect, and it is one which is reflected in his communications and his correspondence with the Appropriations and Staffing Committee. It is well documented, primarily as a result of the indignation and the objections of that Committee, and it is manifested in its correspondence to Senator Walsh. When the Committee last looked at the question of supplementary appropriations, the President wrote to Senator Walsh and noted:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee determined additional appropriations amounting to $944,000, as settled in a preliminary way between officers, but noted that this is the absolute minimum amount that is required for the continued efficient functioning of the Department. </PARA>
<PARA>That set of words was settled upon so that we had a unanimous resolution. It was the view of a significant proportion of those present that the amount of funding made available was below the minimum level. The President went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee considers, moreover, that the appropriation of $56,000 sought for additional equipment purchases, which was deleted at the suggestion of officers of the Department of Finance from the additional appropriations previously determined by the Committee, is needed in the near future and must be included in the forward estimates for 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA>The correspondence concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> You have also raised the matter of establishing a continuing base level of outlays for the Parliamentary Departments. I shall write to you on this matter after I have had the opportunity to consult with Madam Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA>The golden thread that runs through this correspondence and all other correspondence with the Minister for Finance is that the level of funding which is provided by Senator Walsh is less than adequate. As I have said previously, there is a fundamental distinction to be drawn between funding considerations in respect of government departments and the Parliament. The truth is that, the larger the bureaucracy gets, the greater the amount of legislation and the greater the amount of activity generated in the Parliament by the Government, so that the funding levels required by the Parliament are bound to go up. On the one hand we have the Government increasing the workload and responsibility of the Parliament, at least its functional responsibility, but at the same time significantly reducing the capacity of the Parliament to fulfil its obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government looks aghast at the fact that there has been a significant increase in the cost of the functioning of Parliament, having moved as we did after 60 years from the provisional Parliament House to the permanent Parliament House. Even blind Freddy or a drover's dog would understand that the difference between this building and the 1927 building was bound to have caused dramatic increases in expenditure. There are 6,000 pass holders alone in this building, but the Government is shocked to see that outlays for the purpose of the parliamentary departments has gone up. Yet, in its own narrow, parochial, perverted and sectional way, this Government is prepared to allow outlays for its own purposes, its own benefits and its own functioning as a government to go up while those of the Parliament as a whole go down. This is best demonstrated when one looks across the corridor to the Executive wing of this building. But an arm and a limb of the functioning of this Parliament, the ministerial wing is not satisfied simply to have security attendants to protect and service it and fulfil its obligations in the same way as do the attendants who look after the daily needs of other members of parliament. Those in the ministerial wing had to have the Australian Protective Service to look after them. It costs $5m a year to look after 30 Ministers. They must take a lot of caring for. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been put to me by Senator Stone that they need to be in permanent care, not just day care. Perhaps that is the problem. But it is costing taxpayers $5m. The Ministers having established that they need that protection-probably from themselves more than from the public-the security officers are not prepared to carry messages, they are not prepared to shuffle paper, they are not prepared to fulfil the obligations of the ordinary attendants. That is a job for somebody else. Their job is to stroll up and down with their hands behind their backs, their noses in the air and their eyes in every direction protecting these people from the poor peasants they imagine are going to break down the door at any time to attack them. We find a clear distinction between the Government's priorities for itself and for the Parliament as a whole. I am glad to say that the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing to the best of my knowledge is still examining the responsibilities of these Protective Service officers to see why they cannot do the duties that are done by attendants in the other parts of the building.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we look at the use of VIP aircraft and other services available to the Government, do we see any cutbacks? No, we see none. When we look at the number of trips overseas, the cost of hotel accommodation and the high life, do we see the Government saying to its Ministers that they have to cut back? No, of course we do not. It is only the democratic process that the Government slices with the knife; it is certainly not itself. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by touching upon one final matter-the question of the role of committees in this Parliament. As I understand it, it is the Government's intention-Senator Hamer may correct me if I am wrong-that there should be less sitting days so that the Government can get on with what it does outside the Parliament. The Government intends that, to achieve this, more legislation should be shunted off to committees and not debated in the Senate or by the Committee of the Whole. That is going to require a heavier workload for the various standing committees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy President. Legislation is going to come back to the Committee of the Whole after it has been through the filtering processes of the committees. Be that as it may, it is inevitably going to require a greater workload on the part of committees. Already we see Senator Walsh threatening funding because the Senate has dared to set up committees. At the time, the Senate was proposing a taxation measure which ultimately was amended anyway because good sense and proper scrutiny prevailed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are now going to find ourselves in the situation of having more committee work and less funding. Senator Walsh tells us that these committees are an absolute waste of time in his view and ought by and large to be abolished. The tragedy is that this summarises the Government's disdain, contempt and disregard for the democratic process which is articulated and reflected in the parliamentary process. The Government sees itself as having a proprietary interest in the Parliament. It does not see itself as just part of the Parliament, making its contribution in the Parliament in the process of government; it sees the Parliament as its own. I say with respect that, sadly, the Government takes the same attitude to some of the committees of which I am a member that have responsibility for the functioning of the Parliament. We find caucusing and the chairmen of the committees conducting themselves at the behest and the request of the Government and not acting in an impartial way. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that in the future, with the support of the Australian Democrats and the independents, the Senate, if necessary, will reject the appropriations at the levels given to us by the Government and defer them until they provide the appropriate resources necessary for the proper, efficient and effective functioning of the Senate, allowing it to scrutinise government legislation in the way in which it was intended. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating a number of Appropriation Bills which set aside certain amounts of money for the Government to give effect to its Budget and its ongoing expenses. In Australia recently we have witnessed an attitude of disconcertment with the direction being taken by this Federal Government and the suggestion that the whole economic direction needs to be turned around. We have recently seen the Tasmanian election, which resulted in a substantial number of independent green candidates gaining the balance of power in that Parliament. We have had spokespeople such as Professor David Suzuki addressing very large audiences in a number of States and pointing to the inability of the conventional economic model to address the very severe environmental problems which the world currently faces. He indicated that the direction in which we need to go is quite different from that in which this Government and most other governments in the Western world are going. David Suzuki was reflecting on a message which Paul Ehrlich has been giving to the world for quite a number of years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In contrast, earlier today Senator Michael Baume pointed to the possibility of negative growth, something which David Suzuki has called a blessing and a requirement. Senator Michael Baume has said that if we go into negative growth we will really be going down the gurgler and that clearly we need to do certain things to stimulate economic growth because that is a sine qua non of a healthy society. The point of divergence between the Australian Democrats and both of the other parties is that we are not committed to that conventional view about economic growth. We are committed to the idea of a sustainable, steady, stable economy rather than continually attempting to make the economy grow. It is interesting to reflect on the fact that the word `economics' and the word `ecology' have the same origin. But over the years economics has moved away from ecology, and economists seem to have forgotten that the basis of economic activity is the natural environment. They seem to have adopted the view that economics can continue to promote growth without concern for the welfare of the natural environment on which it feeds. In the process, of course, economic growth is destroying the environment-it is destroying the very basis on which human life, all other life and economic activity ultimately depend. </PARA>
<PARA> A few days after the Tasmanian election, Mr Hawke said that within two to three months he would come out with the world's best environment policy. That caused me to write an open letter to him pointing out that if he were genuine about coming out with such a policy he would have to review seriously the whole economic model on which his policies, and those which the Opposition would impose on us, are based. I said that those policies would need to be reversed and that he would need to move away from growth economics towards sustainable economics. I invited Mr Hawke to openly debate that question with me. So far I have not had a reply. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a desperate need to bring economics and ecology together again. In this respect I find that there is no difference at all between the Labor and Liberal policies. Not many journalists seem to have picked this up. However, David Barnett did so in last week's Bulletin. He is one of the first to pick up that what the environmental movement, the green independents and the Democrats are on about is something which cannot be neatly slotted into the vectors on which the Labor and Liberal parties lie. We are really moving in quite a different direction, and the economic policies which we would put in place are quite different. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor and Liberal policies are based on the concept that growth is both desirable and, to some extent, inevitable. They are also based on a belief that the market, the competitive system, will somehow serve the common good and that the free operation of that market will somehow produce a better condition for all who operate in it. We claim that that policy can solve neither the worsening social problems nor the problems of a deteriorating environment. The word `growth' is so loosely used by a number of economists and particularly by politicians that it is necessary to observe what it means. In this context it means growth of gross domestic product (GDP), growth in the dollar value of goods and services consumed year on year. In other words, this year we consumed more than we did last year; next year we will consume more again; and the year after that we will consume more again. This is normally measured as a percentage flow through the economy. There is a attempt to increase exponentially that flow through the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have observed in the past, what has been attempted is an exponential increase in the throughput of resources in a finite world. That simply cannot be accepted as rational; it is to attempt the impossible. In pursuing these models, it follows that any measures that are made to save bits and pieces of the environment-and I stress this very much in the context of Mr Hawke's claim of developing the world's best environment policy-be they forests in Tasmania, heritage areas, wild rivers, clean air, clean water, or access to any natural environment at all, will only be temporary as long as governments attempt to make the economy grow. I say this for the simple reason that if we exponentially seek to increase the throughput of resources, sooner or later we will need to consume those very resources which we have set aside and which we hope to preserve in perpetuity. </PARA>
<PARA> So there is a fundamental conflict between our desire to look after the environment which, after all, is the only environment we have and probably the only environment we ever will have, and the use of the economic models on which this Government and this Opposition predicate their polities and on which these appropriations that we are looking at at the moment are fundamentally based. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the very marked changes which are occurring in the environment, even those areas which have been set aside so as to protect natural species, short of being destroyed by demand on the resources, will, nonetheless, be destroyed by other elements in the growth economy. The consumption of a wide range of resources is changing the composition of the atmosphere which will mean that all those areas that we have sought to protect because of their unique species, ecologies and habitats, will simply be in the wrong place. Over the next half century or so, we face, quite literally, massive species extinctions as a consequence of the pursuit of economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of defects in the model which need to be pointed out if we are to put in its place a different model, if we are seriously attempting to put in place a model of sustainability. For the reason that we are living in a society which is predicated very heavily on economic indicators and measures, we need to use economic tools. Therefore, we need to get the economic indicators right so that they will point us in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary to observe that GDP, which is so vaunted by economists and a number of people who speak loosely in this place about economic growth, measures as benefits the things which ordinary people, and certainly most ecologists and environmentalists, would regard as costs. This is where the concerns about the environment and the solution to the environmental problems meet fairly and squarely the concerns which ordinary everyday people have in regard to the cost of housing, the cost of providing all those goods and services which they regard as essential for a quality life and which, if denied, will lead to a deterioration in their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last year or so I have asked a number of questions in this place, principally of Senator Peter Walsh, in relation to this principal defect in the measure of economic growth. I remind the Senate that on one occasion I asked him a question about the $5.7 billion a year that we have to spend as a result of motor vehicle accidents. I asked where that amount appeared in the gross domestic product. Did it appear as an addition? Senator Walsh agreed that it did appear as an addition. After a bit of obfuscation, he concluded his remarks by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . to exclude medical costs borne by households would require more fundamental changes to the accounts-indeed, to the extent where it could touch off a spiral in which all of the gross domestic product gradually disappeared.</PARA>
<PARA>What those words indicate is that, if we were to start seriously to take out of gross domestic product those things that every normal, rational person recognised as a cost, the gross domestic product might largely, or totally, disappear. That is the point at which people must recognise the link between the fallacies in the economic modelling and what they perceive as being wrong in their ordinary, everyday lives. </PARA>
<PARA> The population of this country is slightly over 16 million. Mr Hawke is on record as having said recently that he would like to see the population increase to 20 million by the year 2000-an increase of 25 per cent in 10 years. As I pointed out previously, 80 per cent of the increase in Australia's population over the last 40 years has accrued in capital cities. What Mr Hawke is attempting is essentially to add an Adelaide to a Sydney within 10 years. It is not surprising that Mr Bob Carr, the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales, has said that Sydney should put up a `house full' sign. Clearly that imposition on an already large and bulging city would produce enormous tensions. </PARA>
<PARA> The economy certainly would grow as a consequence. The costs of providing roads, sewers, electricity, education, law facilities, water, telephones, et cetera, would appear as additions to gross domestic product. It costs a great deal more to put people on the periphery of an already large city. People have to travel further to work. They see those things as costs. They have to spend more on petrol and on vehicle insurance and registration. Then there is the likelihood of accidents, as well as the cost of medical care and vehicle repair. People see all those things as costs, yet they go down as additions to the gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA> It may well be that the costs of growth have exceeded the benefits. That is why we are deceiving ourselves as a country and as a people-a people becoming poorer, not richer. It is also the reason for this paradox of the apparent conflict between what ordinary people perceive as a worsening quality of life and what economists and the Government say about growth in the economy. Precisely because of those measures that are used to put costs down as benefits, what ordinary, everyday people see as a deterioration can be measured by the Government as a benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, this Government's acceptance of the naked operation of a market system ensures that the cost of housing and all those other facilities that city dwellers need escalates. Because money is treated as a marketable commodity, the interest rates that people have to pay also increase. That is the point at which there are clear parallels between what is wrong with our environment and what is wrong with the economy which impacts on people in their ordinary, everyday lives. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, gross domestic product, which is the main indicator of the health, or otherwise, of the economy, is a measure of flow through the economy. Unlike private companies, we do not keep the equivalent of a capital account. There is no national capital account. We do not put any value on trees in situ; we do not put any value on forests before they are cut down. We do not put value on iron ore or lead or copper or zinc in the ground; we give it value only as we take it out. When we do that we are simply liquefying an asset. We are taking it out of the capital account, which we do not keep, and putting it into the cash flow account. Private companies do not do that. Every accountant will tell us that a company could not be run in that way, yet we attempt to run the whole country like that. As Senator Sheil has just pointed out, that is liquidation. We are indeed behaving as though we were a company in liquidation: we are liquefying our assets. That is what is going on, and that is the other thing which gives the lie to this economic process and indicates the direction in which we need to move. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are cashing in the capital item, but we are not replacing it, as a company would do. There is no depreciation allowance against forest destruction. The consequence of both these defects in the growth model is that no value whatsoever is put on those things that nature provides free-clean air, clean water, access to nature, and so on. But as we destroy those things and spend money to replace them, that money goes down as an addition to gross domestic product. Therefore, by destroying those things, we appear to become better off. It really is a crazy system, and it needs to be turned around. Down the growth road there is no solution either to the very significant social and economic problems that face this country or to the very significant environmental problems facing both this country and the rest of the world. We must turn the model round.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Economists use arguments such as `Growth allows us to spend more on looking after the environment'. One has only to observe that what we spend on attempting to repair the environment goes down as an addition to gross domestic product to realise the complete fallacy in that argument. In other words, if we spend more on repairing the damage that we have caused, our gross domestic product grows. If the argument were valid, we could spend more on looking after the environment, and that money also would go down as an addition to GDP. Thus, we would become richer and richer as we repaired the environment, and could spend more and more. Of course, it is a ridiculous argument. What it does is count a cost-the cost of repairing the environment-as a benefit, and and so we think that we can spend it twice or thrice over. As a country-indeed, as a world-we must adopt a sustainable, steady state economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clearly these honourable senators do not understand what a steady state is. A steady state can be a dynamic steady state, one in which there is a flow through the economy, but one in which the inputs and the outputs remain stable. It is qualified by the words `sustainable steady' state. If one imagines that one has a large container of water with a tap pouring water into it and a hole in the bottom of the container, provided the inflow and the outflow are the same the level of water in the container will remain static, but there will be a continuous flow through that container. That is a steady state condition. If one likens that to population, one could have a large input, a large output or the same population-equivalent to a high birth rate, a high death rate and a very short life. One could keep the same level of population by having a very small input and a very small output, which would correspond with a very small birth rate, a small death rate and longevity. I suggest that that latter state is more desirable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to resources we need to maintain a throughput in the economy sufficient to maintain a stock of items which we need for a reasonable quality of life. That stock is obtained by minimising the throughput of resources, not by maximising it, which means attempting to minimise the gross domestic product for the maintenance of that stock. It is the stock that we should value-the stock which at the moment we do not even measure. We should not simply attempt endlessly to increase the throughput of resources, be they material resources or human labour. It makes no sense to increase the throughput of human labour, either. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McGauran says that it is unworkable. I point out to him that we are rapidly destroying this planet at an incredible rate. The economy is not producing the welfare that people are looking for. The present economy is failing. It is not for me to establish that what I am saying is workable in Senator McGauran's eyes because Senator McGauran clearly believes the present system is producing the goods when clearly it is not. He has not even opened his eyes to see what is happening around him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In order to move in this direction, as I have already indicated, because we live in a society which is predicated on economic matters and because it takes account of these economic matters, it is necessary to use economic levers, to establish a number of different economic indicators and to establish qualifiers in those indicators that we already have. It is necessary that we establish a national capital account and that we give value to those resources in situ which we are progressively, as the honourable senator on my right indicated a minute ago, liquidating. When we take resources out of the ground and export them overseas without any value added component, we are simply shifting money from the capital account to the cash flow account. We are not becoming richer. This generation may have generated some cash flow; future generations will be poorer because those resources have been liquidated. </PARA>
<PARA> To draw a parallel, Amory Lovins, an American writer of considerable note who is perhaps not known in this chamber, some years ago remarked, `Whoever heard of developing a bank account by taking money out of it?'. That is precisely what we are doing with our resources. We need to establish a national capital account and to modify very heavily the gross domestic product measure. We need to take the costs out of gross domestic product, put the costs down as costs and the benefits down as benefits. When we do that we might see that the costs of growth are now outweighing the benefits. That would demonstrate to people why they sense they are becoming, and are indeed, poorer. Finally, we need to put beside those measures independent non-economic measures of real human welfare, such as health, morbidity and literacy measures. We need to measure suicide and nutrition rates, access to and quality of education in our society, access to natural areas and per capita pollution. These are all things which could be measured and, when put beside those economic indicators, give us a much better indication of whether society is becoming better off in a broad sense rather than in the very narrow sense in which we now believe we are becoming better off-a simple increase in GDP. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to change direction from mindlessly pursuing growth for growth's sake-a direction which is destroying the environment on which the economy ultimately depends and on which we, as human beings, and all other life on this planet ultimately depend-to a direction which is sustainable in the long run. Nothing short of this fundamental change will ensure that the environment will remain for our children and our children's children. There are very severe problems which most people perceive in their ordinary everyday lives, and there are very severe environmental problems. Those two sets of problems which appear so disparate have exactly the same common cause-the pursuit of growth. That is something that the Government and the Opposition share. It is something which divides the economic policies of the Democrats from the policies of those two parties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with the previous speaker, Senator Coulter, that the growth economy is unsustainable in the long run. The message of sustainability is the single most important message for governments everywhere to understand. A paradigm shift is taking place globally. A redirection is urgently needed. Regrettably, politicians, political parties and governments are often slow to respond to the challenging changes that are required if we are not to damage our environment beyond the point of being able to cope with the exploitative demands made on it. The Earthcare test needs to be applied to our management of resources and to industrial projects-in fact, to our whole lifestyle. Will people in 50, 100 or 200 years look back at the projects which are getting the go ahead now and ask, `How could this have been allowed'? We are already saying that about many projects which were planned far more recently than 100 or 200 years ago. We need to look into the future and consider the sustainability of what we are allowing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Following the recent electoral victory of green independents in Tasmania-I think this must be seen as an irrefutable indicator of the new direction demanded by informed citizens-Senator Richardson made this great observation:</PARA>
<PARA>Because we've done so much to stuff up our world in the past 200 years, the cost of cleaning it up is so great that even the economic argument is becoming environmental. </PARA>
<PARA>I would add that the cost of clean-up and a sustainable investment towards the prevention of further stuff-ups must be reflected in Budget appropriations. An environmentally sound energy strategy is an obvious prerequisite to a sustainable society, an aim which has been endorsed by conservationists, governments and industry alike in the national conservation strategy. How we fuel our growth is central to many of the environmental problems and costs we are faced with. The accelerating greenhouse effect is a case in point. In a nutshell, the Government has failed to allocate the necessary funds to the types of research and development which are most likely to contribute to reducing the environmental costs of development; that is, increased energy efficiency and a transition to renewable energy systems. For example, the Commonwealth energy management program has been scrapped, even though the up-front cost of most of the projects facilitated by it were recouped within three years. We have lost an avenue of active promotion of appropriate energy use in favour of a market approach. </PARA>
<PARA> A study carried out at the Harvard Business School some ten years ago found that, for renewable energy systems to get a fair go in the market place, two-thirds of their supply cost should be subsidised to overcome the years of subsidy accumulated by conventional energy systems. Judging by the ongoing bias in the Government's Budget towards fossil fuel research and development, the subsidy owing to clean energy in Australia would have to be much more than that. Yet, I am told by those scientists still waiting that the first round of the Government's $1m per annum grants for renewable energy research, known as the Sunshine Fund, still has not been awarded, even though the next round of applications for them is closing. </PARA>
<PARA> Of major concern to many scientists involved in energy research is the lack of support for an extension service for promoting the proven technologies. While the importance of extension services has long been recognised in the area of primary industry, the funds are consistently denied to the renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors. There is a critical need for an ongoing formal link between the suppliers, the people on the land, industry, educators and, last but not least, politicians, to promote the application of current knowledge and technology to current needs. Without this liaison, or extension service, all the primary research in the world will not save us. </PARA>
<PARA> In a similar vein, while it is important to contribute to worldwide monitoring of atmospheric changes in order to understand the greenhouse effect, immediate returns in terms of reducing the pollution build-up are possible only from investing in energy efficiency, the adoption of solar and other clean energy sources, and the implementation of much higher pollution standards. A 20 per cent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2000 is possible only if an investment is made now. This is not reflected in the appropriations. New directions in energy and environmental protection policy will incur costs to specific industry sectors in the short term but must be addressed. For example, the phasing out of chlorofluorocarbons by the year 2000 has now gained international support. A total phase-out of ozone-depleting substances is necessary to prevent much greater costs to human health, our food supply and the natural environment in the very near future. Yet the Government is dragging its feet in order not to offend industry. The cost of such consideration for the producers will begin to show up in melanomas and other fatal cancers in the years to come. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the Australian Labor Party's policy platform, clause 79 and the need to implement immediate efforts to increase energy efficiency in buildings, why is the public sector not setting the example? A mere 2 to 3 per cent added to current capital outlays, with a specific requirement for energy efficiency standards to be built into new works, would contribute substantially to this goal and deliver tangible returns in energy savings almost immediately. Other projects which in themselves do not amount to major diversions of funds, but represent the very important changes in direction required to avoid the stuff-ups referred to by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson), are consistently denied the resources needed to function. The multi-disciplinary research and analysis carried out by the Centre for Resource and Environmental Studies of the Australian National University in its fundamental questions program operates on a shoestring budget. This program brings the sciences and humanities together to tackle the very questions that governments are at pains to avoid. Support of such intelligent problem solving could provide the needed answers for how to achieve the change in economic direction, which we all know will result from the growing concern about our environment and quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA> Another example of an excellent community initiative ignored in Government appropriations is the Wisenet science shop which aims to coordinate scientific expertise with community needs. It is a response from women within the scientific community to redirect science research to serve the community. It operated on $15,000 raised totally by voluntary labour last year, and was not even granted a hearing with the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, Mr Jones, before being refused any assistance in the wake of government funding. Without a paid coordinator, this opportunity to take science to the people will be lost-such a small investment with enormous potential for reducing the `stuff-up factor'. </PARA>
<PARA> Other direct costs of ignoring our impacts on the environment include the loss forever of many species of indigenous flora and fauna, and soil degradation. It is estimated that since European settlement 18 species of mammal have become extinct, representing two-thirds of all the mammal species that have become extinct worldwide in historical times. At least 129 species of vascular plants have also become extinct, most disappearing with clearing for farms. The processes of extinction continue, with a further 40 mammal species and 209 vascular plant species currently endangered. In 1987, election promises were made by the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the then Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment, Mr Cohen, to establish an endangered species unit within the Australian National Parks Service. Only in October 1988 was an advisory committee established, and no estimates which would allow the establishment of an endangered species unit are included in the appropriation Bills under scrutiny at the moment. That is a great oversight on the part of the Government not only for unique species facing imminent extermination but also for the Government's own survival. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the advisory committee, for just $2m research and survey work could be initiated, a nationally networked database on endangered species could be established, an education and publicity program could be launched, and a national network of non-government organisations involved with endangered species and an endangered species unit could be established-one of the many cheap but effective public commitments to sustainability available to but resisted by the Government. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! At Question Time today, Senator Reid asked me a question about an article in today's Canberra Times referring to an Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Schools Authority circular about the effects of self-government on the ACT public school system. The circular from the Chief Education Officer stated that all school contact with the Federal Parliament must in future be made through the ACT Legislative Assembly. I was concerned that such a directive could adversely affect not only the parliamentary education programs currently run in Parliament House by the Parliamentary Education Office but also the opportunity for senators to visit ACT public schools and school functions in the usual and time-honoured way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ACT Minister for Industry, Employment and Education, Mr Paul Whalan, has issued a press release to clarify the matter. Mr Whalan has indicated that the circular issued by the Chief Education Officer has been misconstrued. Mr Whalan has said:</PARA>
<PARA>There was no intention to restrict in any way the access of members of the Federal Parliament, particularly of local Members and Senators to ACT schools.</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that all senators welcome this assurance and support the continuation of the usual practice of senators making visits to schools and school functions, particularly where they can advance the cause of parliamentary education. As senators know, the Parliamentary Education Office is involved in devising parliamentary education programs, classes and materials for schools and school visitors to Parliament House and senators and members have an important non-partisan role to play in that education process.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question, based in part on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act 1946, the ABC must broadcast the proceedings of the House of Representatives or the Senate or of joint sittings in the six State capitals and Newcastle, and from any other station prescribed by regulation (currently a Canberra station is so prescribed.) The coverage of both the interim and the permanent parliamentary networks fulfill the legal requirements imposed on the ABC by the Act.</PARA>
<PARA> Audience research has indicated that approximately 6% of listeners in metropolitan centres listen to Radio National. Research has also indicated that the broadcasting of Parliamentary proceedings has not increased the number of Radio National listeners. Based on that total population figure, the number of potential Radio National listeners who will be outside the range of the new Parliamentary broadcasts is estimated to be 50,000 Australia-wide. However, only a small proportion of these Radio National listeners would be Parliamentary broadcasting listeners.</PARA>
<PARA> The following population centres, which were able to pick up Parliamentary broadcasts under previous transmitting arrangements, may no longer receive them on the interim network introduced on ABC stand-by transmitters (ie 2PB Sydney, Canberra and Newcastle, 3PB Melbourne; 4PB Brisbane; 5PB Adelaide, 6PB Perth and 7PB Hobart).</PARA>
<PARA> New South Wales-Nowra, Bomaderry, Jervis Bay, Bundanoon, Lithgow, Wallerawang.</PARA>
<PARA> Queensland-Beaudesert, Rosewood, Laidley, Gatton, Woodford, Lowood.</PARA>
<PARA> South Australia-Port Augusta, Whyalla, Port Lincoln, Port Pirie.</PARA>
<PARA> Australian Capital Territory-Boorowa, Young, Harden.</PARA>

<PARA> Western Australia-Nil.</PARA>
<PARA> Tasmania-Launceston.</PARA>
<PARA> It is important to recognise that most of the people living in these areas would have received a marginal or poor grade of service under the previous transmission arrangements. In most cases the broadcast signal would not have met the Department of Transport and Communications' Planning Guidelines for an adequate service.</PARA>
<PARA> However, there is still a significant degree of fortuitous reception of transmissions on the stand-by network in regional areas, particularly in South Australia. Reception in and around Perth is actually an improvement on the Radio National transmissions.</PARA>
<PARA> The Parliamentary network will transfer to new frequencies on a permanent basis in the context of the AM/FM conversion plan in the mainland state capital cities. This will occur in Sydney, Perth and Adelaide later this year, and in Brisbane, and Melbourne in 1991 and 1992 respectively. Canberra, Hobart and Newcastle will need to be considered separately in the context of AM/FM conversion policy in multi-station regional markets.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Whether and, if so, to what extent information collected by a surveying organisation concerning the videotaping of television programs by survey participants could be used in court proceedings would depend upon the admissability of that information under the applicable rules of evidence. As participants in surveys are understood to participate on a voluntary basis, they would have a full opportunity to negotiate with the surveying organisation regarding the scope of the information to be collected from them and the use to which such information, or any part of it, might or might not be put by that organisation. Moreover, the making of a copy of a television program without the permission of the holder of a copyright in the program is an offence under the Copyright Act only if done for sale or hire of the copy so made. As most home videotaping is presumably undertaken for later viewing in the home or other social context, the possibility of prosecution would be unlikely to arise.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) It is not considered appropriate to undertake a formal review of the Ethnic Schools Program at present since issues such as the relationship of ethnic school after-hours classes, ethnic school insertion classes, and regular school language classes impinge directly upon recently introduced programs under the Government's National Policy on Languages. It would be premature to review the Ethnic Schools Program prior to the impact of these new programs being fully assessed. These views were conveyed to the Ethnic Schools Association of South Australia on 12 December 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I am aware of the study referred to. The Ethnic Schools Program has two objectives:</PARA>
<PARA> to maintain relevant languages and cultures among students of non-English speaking background, and</PARA>
<PARA> to increase the awareness and understanding for all children of the different community languages and cultures within Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that both after-hours and insertion classes meet either of these objectives, they have a legitimate right to funding under current guidelines and the concerns of the 138,000 students now in insertion classes must be given due weight against those in after-hours classes. It should be noted that following the decision to apply a ceiling on funding to ethnic schools authorities at 1986 levels, organisations operating either after-hours or insertion classes cannot claim for additional enrolments.</PARA>
