<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I inform the Senate that yesterday Senator Gietzelt resigned from the Senate. Senator Gietzelt was a long-serving senator, having come to the Senate in 1971. He has had a long, distinguished career, including service as a Minister. On behalf of all honourable senators I pay tribute to his distinguished service and extend to him every good wish for his retirement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I present to the Senate Senator Gietzelt's letter of resignation and a copy of the letter by which, in accordance with section 21 of the Constitution, I have notified the Governor of New South Wales of the vacancy in the representation of that State consequent on Senator Gietzelt's resignation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Senator Gietzelt's letter has been common knowledge for about 24 hours and in the circumstances of his retirement I just wish to say a few brief words. Before entering parliament, Senator Gietzelt was very active in local government-as a shire councillor in Sutherland and as a member of the Executive of the Local Government Association of New South Wales. He was a senator for New South Wales from 1971 and until yesterday remained co-father of the Senate with Senator Durack, who is not here at the moment. He served on many committees of the Senate, including Finance and Government Operations, of which he was Chairman; Trade and Commerce; Foreign Affairs and Defence; and Science and the Environment. He was a delegate to constitutional conventions and also served on other committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Gietzelt was Minister for Veterans' Affairs from 1983 to 1987. As an ex-serviceman and a former member of the Executive of the New South Wales Branch of the Returned Services League, he maintained a strong commitment to the ex-service community. While Minister, he was responsible for implementing the recommendations of the Brand Review of the Repatriation Hospital System, which led to a significant upgrading of facilities in repatriation hospitals. Perhaps most important, however, he was the Minister responsible for the introduction of the Veterans' Entitlements Act in 1986. This Act, which was a landmark in repatriation legislation, consolidated and streamlined what had become a vast, unwieldy and almost impossible to comprehend set of repatriation Acts. It is a great credit to the Senate that it passed that legislation. He also had a great interest in Vietnam veterans and was responsible for setting up the first crisis accommodation centre for those veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> More importantly, from the point of view of this side of the chamber, Senator Gietzelt was a very long-serving member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP). He was a senior vice-president for a number of years and a convener of some national policy committees of the ALP, including the urban affairs committee and the legal and constitutional committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that on a personal level I found, on occasions, Senator Gietzelt a man of some passion. In the course of our respective careers we had a number of disagreements but those disagreements were always very frank. On a number of occasions I recall that he expressed his disagreement in my office in a tone of voice which might, even in this building, have been heard on the House of Representatives side. I think those disagreements were always characterised by a degree of mutual respect and trust and we argued--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said `I think'. The honourable senator, in his eagerness, always interrupts. I was going to say that, for my part, that was certainly the case and I hope it was for Senator Gietzelt too. Certainly, on behalf of all Government senators I wish him well in his retirement. I am sure it will be a very active one in terms of community service, and we all wish him well.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I keep reminding myself that we do not have a condolence motion before us; it is a much happier occasion than that, Senator Gietzelt having opted for voluntary retirement. We would all hope for a very happy and fulfilling retirement period. Indeed, on a day when my father is in the Parliament, I wish for Senator Gietzelt what my father has enjoyed since he left involuntarily nearly 20 years ago, namely, a very fulfilling and cheerful life outside this place. I say that to both Senator Gietzelt and Mrs Gietzelt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was very interested to read in the Sunday Telegraph the account by Kerry-Ann Walsh as to why the senator came back and why he has chosen to leave. We are told:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . quite unabashed about the timing of his departure from the federal Parliamentary scene after 18 years. </PARA>
<PARA> He wanted to make sure his Senate spot would be taken by Mr John Faulkner, one of the few left-wingers operating out of the heavily right-wing dominated New South Wales Labor headquarters. If Gietzelt had retired at the last Federal election, Faulkner would not have secured the seat because of his placement on the ticket. Only a casual vacancy would secure Faulkner's future.</PARA>
<PARA>Given the performance of the New South Wales right wing, and particularly its management of the economy over recent times, I can only say that it is time the left wing had a go in here. We look forward to Mr John Faulkner's contribution in this place to see whether he can improve on the right wing of New South Wales and its abominable performance in this place up to this time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to add to the comments that have been made about our former Senate colleague Arthur Gietzelt, particularly from my position as a vice-chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. Although our politics were widely different I always found Arthur to be a man of honour and total integrity. I was especially pleased when he joined the Joint Committee of Public Accounts after the 1987 election, when he left the Ministry. Often senior parliamentarians, after leaving ministerial office, decide to coast along until their retirement, but that was not Arthur's way. He became a member of the Public Accounts Committee and involved himself energetically with several major inquiries, including one into veterans' issues. Arthur's recent experience in government proved very valuable. He always gave wise counsel to the work of the Committee. He also served as Chairman of Estimates Committee C and as a member of a number of Senate standing committees on community affairs. I place on record my regard for the Hon. Arthur Gietzelt as a parliamentary committee member and offer my very best personal wishes to him in his retirement.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I join with the comments made by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button), the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Chaney) and Senator Watson and associate my colleagues with those remarks. It is always nice to be able to comment on somebody leaving this place alive. I remember particularly working with Arthur Gietzelt on the legislation that Senator Button raised, that is, the Veterans' Entitlements Act, which was a massive piece of work that Senator Gietzelt managed to put through while he was Minister for Veterans' Affairs. It was something with which other Ministers and Senator Messner had been wrestling for a long period. Indeed, it was a herculean task and to have got the legislation through, despite the fact that it sat in the Senate for about nine months all told while the negotiations went on, shows that he had the capacity to stay in there, fight for the legislation and also work very hard when delicate negotiations were required on the finer points with the political parties in this place and in the face of divisions in the veterans community at that time over certain aspects of the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hope that Arthur Gietzelt will have a long retirement. However, knowing him, I am quite sure that it will not be a quiet one and I expect that we will hear from him from time to time. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IF4">Senator CHILDS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(New South Wales)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Arthur Gietzelt has been my closest political associate over a period of 35 years. He is one of the most hardworking people I have ever met. In local government in the Sutherland Shire many of the initiatives with which he was associated have continued to this day. As a member of executive local government he has been an inspiration to many hundreds of people on the Labor side of politics in terms of the local government initiatives with which he was associated. He is currently Senior Vice-President of the Australian Labor Party and has been a longstanding member of the National Executive of the Party, once again concentrating on the national needs of the Party through its executive. From the very first time I met him he has always found time to be involved in the peace and nuclear disarmament movement. He has been very active in that sphere regardless of other responsibilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He surprised other people, but not me, when he became Minister for Veterans' Affairs. The veterans community is traditionally regarded as a conservative constituency. He won the respect of people in the veterans' community for his work, to which Senator Button has referred. He has a characteristic of always looking for the best in people. He has always sought to build bridges with people who do not agree with him. That quality, which he has enjoyed over the years, commends itself to us all. I know that he has always encouraged young people to be active. Furthermore, he has always had a wide number of interests, but he also applies himself to detail. I know of nobody who has been as keen as Arthur to pay attention to detail, and many political opponents have regretted that they have not given such attention to detail. I know that in retirement he will be able to spend more time with his wife, Dawn, and can indulge his only vice, which has been fairly secretive until now: the occasional punt on Saturday afternoon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I have had a very limited acquaintance with Senator Gietzelt, and perhaps on those grounds would not normally seek to speak. However, I would not wish any failure of a National Party speaker to rise to lead to any possible misconstruction. I simply wish to say that on such infrequent occasions as I did have discussions with Senator Gietzelt I always found him a most pleasant, relaxed personality and not in the least the kind of tense, shouting individual in some moods whom Senator Button perhaps portrayed. On the contrary, I always found him a most pleasant person. I wish Senator Gietzelt and his wife a very happy retirement.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to add briefly to the comments made by my colleagues, and particularly to those made by Senator Childs, whose remarks I endorse. I served with Arthur Gietzelt on the National Executive of the Australian Labor Party for 14 years and it is to that aspect of his activities that I wish to refer. Until my retirement as National Secretary he, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and I were the three longest serving members of the executive, having served together continuously for those 14 years. In common with everybody else who has spoken, I have at times strongly disagreed with Arthur about issues on which we have worked together. What was consistent was his commitment to the Labor Party as a national organisation and his preparedness to fight very hard within the Party for those things in which he believed. If he were successful he would go forward with the proposal, but if unsuccessful he would accept the outcome and go forward with the collective decision of the Party and implement it to the best of his ability. In that period he became Junior Vice-President and then Senior Vice-President of the Party. He chaired many important, historic meetings of the Executive. When the history of the Party is written, the role that he played will be recorded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No new, young member of the National Executive, as I was in 1973, or new National Secretary, as I was in 1981, could have asked for more friendship or support than I received from Arthur Gietzelt. I noticed from time to time that, not unlike some boilermakers I used to know in the trade union movement, Arthur's deafness came on very suddenly when he did not want to hear what you were saying, although sometimes it did not fade when you wished that he could not hear what you were saying. Nevertheless, he persevered in the face of this affliction and was a very successful and effective contributor to the Executive. I enjoyed working with him. I wish him and Dawn a very long and happy retirement. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, on 4 January 1989, of Albert George Poke, Senator for the State of Tasmania from 1956 to 1974, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service and tenders its sympathy to his family in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA>The late Senator Poke was born at Somerset, Tasmania, on 16 February 1906 and was an Australian Labor Party senator for the State of Tasmania from 1956 to 1974. As of yesterday only two senators, Senator Arthur Gietzelt and Senator Peter Durack, would have been senators over that period. During his time in the Senate he was a Temporary Chairman of Committees. He served on various parliamentary committees, including the Senate Select Committee on Foreign Ownership and Control. He was also a member of delegations both to Inter-Parliamentary Union and to Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conferences. He was Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate from February 1962 to December 1972, which I suspect must be a record period in that office. </PARA>
<PARA> The late Senator Poke will be remembered with gratitude by the Labor Party for his tireless service. He was a lifetime member of the Party, and was Vice-President of the Tasmanian branch. He served as Treasurer of the State branch in 1974 and 1975. Prior to entering Parliament he was an engine driver and Secretary of the Timber Workers Union of Tasmania from 1946 to 1956. He was President of the Miscellaneous Workers Union of Tasmania from 1958 to 1972. He was a loyal and tireless worker for his Party, a respected member of the Senate and a diligent contributor to the committees of the Senate. On behalf of the Government I extend to his family our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition I join with the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) in expressing support for this condolence motion. I express our sympathy for the family of the late Senator Poke. He was one of the very large number of earlier members of the parliamentary Labor Party who had a lengthy career in the trade union movement. He was an engine driver and, later, the secretary of his union for just under 10 years. He continued his close association with the union movement when he was in this place, combining, as Senator Button has pointed out, the presidency of the Miscellaneous Workers Union of Tasmania with his role as a senator. Some might regret that those traditions have not been kept alive as much as they might have been, but in any event Senator Poke made a good contribution to this place. We express our sorrow at his death.</PARA></TALK.START>

Bob Poke as he was known-I do not think he was ever known as Albert George Poke-was one of those people who are very much the salt of the earth. He had firm views and those views were firmly expressed. I was able to attend his funeral in January. Many Australian Labor Party stalwarts, including the former Deputy Prime Minister, Lance Barnard, were there. The former leader in this place, Ken Wriedt, spoke at the funeral service.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator STONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance. I refer the Minister to his comments on the Face to Face television program last October when, after the then very bad balance of payments figures for July and August, he referred to the need to wait for at least one more month's figures but said that if the trend continued the Government would need to review the economic strategy announced in the August Budget Papers, and that under those circumstances the Government `might have to do something on the expenditure side'. Now that September, October, November, December and, of course, worst of all, January have produced further massive balance of payments deficits producing a cumulative current account deficit for the first seven months of this financial year which is already in excess of the Budget estimate for the year as a whole, does the Minister now believe that the conditions for a review of the Government's economic strategy as announced by the Treasurer last August have been satisfied? In particular, does he now agree that there is a need for an early statement on cuts in this Government's own spending or, to use a more colloquial term, a mini-Budget?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it was in October that I said what I had been quoted as having said. I think it was quoted correctly. That is now four months ago. In that intervening four months there has been, as I am sure Senator Stone well knows, a very significant tightening of monetary policy. It may be less effective in curbing excessive demand than monetary policy was in a regulated financial system-either less effective absolutely, or it has taken, it would appear, a somewhat longer time to bite. That of course is not fully apparent, or the expectation that the tight monetary policy has substantially curbed demand is barely apparent in the published statistics because of the normal time lags, although in the house building industry there are some indications that that has already had an effect on demand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer was making those points 10 or 11 days ago. The Treasurer's view was strongly reinforced by an article written by Don Stammer of Bain and Co. for the Business Review Weekly and published last week, a study of which I commend to members of the Senate. Notwithstanding somewhat slack newspaper comment to the contrary, it was also substantially reinforced by the report prepared by Barry Hughes, or Professor Hughes as he is these days, of Newcastle University, a copy of which I have in front of me. I acknowledge that there are many qualifications in this table. But based on an assumption that the response, demand-wise, to the monetary policy tightening that has happened this year would be similar to that which happened in 1986, Dr Hughes calculated that, on a calendar year basis, the current account deficit for 1989 could come in at less than $10 billion. I stress that there were many qualifications but that is what the table shows. As for expenditure cuts, it is always arguable whether the existing level of expenditure is the appropriate level. I suggest that what is not arguable at this stage is that the country cannot afford the vast array of increased expenditures that the Opposition has been proposing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the Minister for his response and in particular for his reference to the fact that the Government's only response to the increasingly serious position on the balance of payments to date has been-and I think I quote him correctly-a significant tightening of monetary policy. Of course the Minister also said that that significant tightening had not yet had time, however, to be effective, or at any rate that such effectiveness as it had was only barely apparent. In view of the Minister's reference also to the interesting and fascinating report by Professor Hughes, which I have also read, would the Minister agree that that report, while admittedly qualified as he quite rightly described it as being, drew as the alternative to the response of the economy to that monetary tightening, to which the Minister referred-namely, a response rather like the downturn in the economy in 1986-the downturn that occurred in 1982. In any case, will the Minister confirm that the Hughes document indicated that, if we got a response like that in 1986-which I gather was the Minister's preferred interpretation-the bottom of the cyclical response would occur in the September quarter of this year. Is the Minister telling us that we have another seven months to wait before we see the full response to what the Government is alleged to have done to the economy so far?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said just a couple of minutes ago that the effects of the tightening of monetary policy were barely apparent in the published statistics. In all the published statistics there is a significant time lag, and in some there is a time lag of several months. By definition, nobody can be certain of just what the statistics for the period we are going through right now will show when they are ultimately published. In reference to the Hughes article, in which Hughes described 1982 as a crash landing, or something like that, I think I can give one guarantee. Indeed, I will give a personal guarantee of this or I will not be Finance Minister any more. This Government will not produce under any circumstances a Budget as irresponsible as the one John Howard produced in 1982 and which was rightly condemned by Senator Stone.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Either Opposition senators want an answer to this question or they do not. If they do I suggest that they keep quite. Nothing is more disappointing than the degree of hypocrisy that has been shown by the Opposition, both in terms of its track record and of its promise, especially when one compares those with this Government's track record, promise and commitment. This question has been asked this afternoon by Senator Chaney who was a member of the previous Fraser-Howard Government-a regime which, during its term of office, managed to put at least 400,000 children into the poverty bracket. For the first six years of the seven years of conservative rule we had 50,000 children per year added to that bracket. In the last year of conservative rule a massive 150,000 children were added to that bracket. Not only did the previous Government do that, but also at the same time it managed to slash the level of income support for children, especially those of low income earners.

He was asked a perfectly simple question about a clear and apparently unequivocal undertaking by the Prime Minister in 1987 that by 1990 no child would be living in poverty. The answer that has been given so far is entirely irrelevant to the Government's intentions in respect of this promise and whether it is still operative.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it should also be stated that, as the Prime Minister said in the other place just a few minutes ago, the Government is still committed to that promise and believes that it is still very much on track in achieving it. The Prime Minister also made the point-and I wish to make it again in answer to Senator Chaney's question-that when we look at this Government's performance in this area which is precisely what Senator Chaney asked about we should look at the Burdekin report and compare this Government's policies in achieving some redress in these areas mentioned by Mr Brian Burdekin with those of the Opposition. The Burdekin report raises a number of highly complex and sensitive issues involved with child homelessness and child poverty. The basic one is that of, on the one hand, needing to help young people remain with their families and, on the other, ensuring that those people who cannot or should not remain with their families have avenues for leaving. The report also highlights the central role of community organisations and State governments in redressing the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government has already commenced consideration of the report. However, it should be noted that, on an analysis of the report, our policies stand up very well when compared with those of the Opposition. The report emphasises the role of family poverty. There can be no doubt at all about the approach that the Opposition will be taking in this area. Let us look at the Opposition's comment in Future Directions:</PARA>
<PARA>Labor policies have attempted to shield certain groups in the community from the effects of reduced national income. Unless these policies are reversed the current account deficit will continue to grow.</PARA>
<PARA>It is obvious that the Opposition is unambiguous there. The mechanisms which this Government has been concerned to put in place, whether they be family packages, child care places or whatever, are the sorts of mechanisms that find no place at all in the general economic direction that Mr Howard and Dr Hewson put.</PARA>
<PARA> The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission points to exploitation of young people by employers as a major problem of youth homelessness and child poverty. It is the centrepiece of Opposition policy to deregulate the youth labour market in an area which Mr Burdekin highlights as being extremely important. Mr Burdekin also talks at some length about difficulties of access to health services, particularly if young people have to pay up front for those services. It is precisely this sort of policy put by the Opposition, through its spokesperson, Mr Shack, that will aggravate the situation of young people. The Commission points to the devastating effect of youth unemployment. We need look only at the Opposition's history in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA> This Government has been committed, is committed and will be committed to meeting the particular promise made by the Prime Minister in 1987. We are the Government that has put in place mechanisms such as the job search allowance and schemes to assist sole parents, to ensure that people have access to employment in the market-place. It is also this Government that has assisted in terms of providing school places and encouraging the development of appropriate curricula to enable young people to stay at school. Let us remember that over the period of this Government the Year 12 retention rate has increased from 36 per cent under the Government of which the Leader of the Opposition was a member to 65 per cent. That in itself is a major achievement.</PARA>
<PARA> We inherited a situation in 1983 where 266,000 children at least were dependent on the unemployment benefit. We have reduced that number; by 1988 there were only 204,000. Every year since 1983 we have made significant improvements in the level of payments for children-from 11 per cent of married rate pension when we took over to 14 per cent for children up to the age of 13 in 1987 and 17.2 per cent for children over the age of 13. Our commitment is to achieve the benchmarks of 15 per cent of the married rate pension for the under 13s and 20 per cent for older children. In our policy speech the Prime Minister has committed the Government to achieving these benchmarks and we are very much on track in doing that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There might be guffaws on the other side, but when we talk about child poverty we must consider the whole range of measures that this Government has introduced. The family allowance supplement is one extremely important measure and the rent assistance increase is another that will affect and assist 103,000 families. We have also streamlined the operation of the family allowance system. The indictment of the hypocritical criticism from the other side comes from Commissioner Burdekin himself, who pointed out that this Government's reforms alone have lifted 400,000 children out of poverty. I have mentioned only some of the schemes. I have referred to the child support scheme, geared very much to assisting hundreds of thousands of children in sole parent families following marriage separation, stage one of which is in operation, and of which stage 2 will come into operation in the middle of this year. As I have already mentioned, New Start and Jet are two other programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In summing up, it should be noted that the Hawke Labor Government has allocated $1.5 billion by way of family allowance supplements to assist the particular people about whom Senator Chaney is concerned. In terms of our promise, as the Prime Minister said, we will deliver on target to make sure child payments are adequate and we will develop and deliver child support schemes to protect those custodians.

Unambiguous guarantees have been given by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and by the Prime Minister that integration would not proceed until such time as veterans and war widows can be guaranteed priority of access to hospital facilities and the same quality of care as that which is presently available. Ex-service organisations are involved in consultation on integration at the national level and in each State and the national committee will be the major negotiating forum. It will make recommendations to Government on all matters of concern to ex-service organisations and all proposed arrangements for the transfer. The State committees will provide a forum for discussion with State representatives of the ex-service organisations concerning progress with local, Commonwealth and State organisations.</PARA></TALK.START>

However, if satisfactory arrangements cannot be reached with State governments, particularly on the critical issues of priority of access and quality of care, integration will not proceed in that State.</PARA>

I ask the Minister: What is the source of this figure? Has it been checked by any independent economic analysis? If so, by whom, and if not, why not? Does it take into account such factors as economic loss caused by damage to the Tasmanian fishing industry through the chemical pollution of waterways? Has any assessment been made of the damage to Tasmania's export potential in other areas of primary industry if that State's reputation for producing unpolluted foodstuffs is tarnished by the presence of chemical waste from pulp mills? Does the $300m figure take into account the repatriation of Noranda's share of profits received and the writing off against tax of interest payments? Finally, what proportion of the profits derived from the proposed Wesley Vale mill will remain in Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Haines has always taken a general interest in the matter raised in the last part of her question, repatriation of profits and so on, but the burden of her question, of course, relates to the effects on Australia's trade position. The joint venture partners, North Broken Hill Holdings Ltd and Noranda, have claimed that the Wesley Vale mill will have a beneficial effect on Australia's trade position of $300m a year, as reported in the newspapers, or $280m a year, which was the figure given in relation to the environmental impact statement. That claim, as I understand it, was based on the calculation of projected exports times the price of pulp minus woodchip exports forgone and was made before the Canadian joint venture partner, Noranda, became involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was asked whether there has been any independent assessment of this. I am aware of a paper entitled `Economic Implications of an Export Pulp Mill in Northern Tasmania-A Critical Review and Extension' written by Dr Neville Norman of the Department of Economics at the University of Melbourne. He estimated that the effect on the current account would range from a negative impact of up to $165m a year during the construction phase-accounting for imports of plant and equipment, a $1 billion investment in total-to a positive impact on the current account rising from $70m in 1992 to $260m in the late 1990s as the mill becomes operational and improves its efficiency over time. Dr Norman's analysis did account for the fact that Noranda will not be paying for its 50 per cent of the pulp produced, but neither will its borrowings have current account implications because those borrowings will be overseas.</PARA>
<PARA> Other important assumptions were made by Dr Norman in relation to borrowing levels, overseas exposure, interest holidays, currency depreciation, productivity increases and added imports arising from higher Tasmanian gross domestic product. So a range of factors was taken into account in his assessment of the current account implications. In his view these assumptions were on the conservative side. But Dr Norman's analysis did not take into account factors raised in parts two and three of Senator Haines's question. It appears from Dr Norman's analysis that the mill will have a positive effect on trade throughout the 1990s. With regard to what proportion of profits will remain in Australia, that is certainly not something on which the Government could comment as we have no idea as to how and to whom profits will be distributed in the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have here a copy of an information paper put out by the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) on Government non-tax charges. Several pages of the report are devoted to the charging policies of the Governments of New South Wales and, much more particularly, of Queensland for the transport of coal to ports. It points out among other things that the excess freight charged on coal imposed in those two States is variable but for some companies in Queensland it is as high as 11 per cent of the f.o.b. price. This industry, of course, is critical to the nation's export performance. It has been fighting over many years to maintain its competitiveness. It is axiomatic, of course, that if some companies are being overcharged in freight to the extent of 11 per cent of the f.o.b. price in a tight and competitive international market they are finding it extremely hard to cope. I must say that I put on the record my amazement that a free market economist like Senator Stone is implicitly defending the rip-off that the Queensland Government has been practising for many years. The dead hands of the New South Wales and, much more particularly of course, the Queensland Governments on these industries has been exposed by the IAC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> MIM Holdings Ltd, which operates the Collinsville and Newland mines in Queensland, is one of the companies specifically reported upon. That company has shown that the real freight rate and export prices have been moving in opposite directions for the last 10 years. Caltex, which operates the Bayswater colliery in New South Wales, expressed concern about rail freights and also about regulations which restrict road haulage and thereby allow the rail authority to charge more than it would be able to do if it were subject to competition. Most spectacularly of all, probably, CRA, which transports coal from Blair Athol in Queensland to Dalrymple Bay, estimated that its excess freight bill was a massive $40m in 1985. For Queensland generally the IAC estimated that the excess freight rate for new mines was of the order of $7 a tonne. Those sorts of rorts have been going on for a long time. I would hope that Senator Stone, far from supporting them, which he appears to have been doing in the Senate, would use his influence with his National Party colleagues in Queensland-because the Queensland Government has been the main offender in this area-and get them to do something about it.</PARA>

My colleague the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, agrees with me that soil conservation is the foremost conservation issue in Australia at the moment. We congratulate the NFF and the ACF for collaborating on such a comprehensive proposal as the one on soil conservation which they have put forward. Many of the points contained in their submission are points to which I have referred on many occasions. Senator Richardson has also referred to them on many occasions in public speeches and comments on the problem. This Government, in particular, has placed a great deal of emphasis on encouraging community groups of landholders to join together and on a voluntary basis apply particular land care strategies to the area or catchment in which they live so that as landholders they are entrusted with maintaining their land in a proper condition, having regard to ecological or environmental concerns at the same time as keeping it productive.

<PARA>. . . We were at a late stage in an investigation of a market manipulation antic. The Western Australian Government drew our attention to the fact that it was carrying out a rescue which might run onto the rocks if our investigation went public at that time. So what we said was, `We are prepared to settle in the normal way. You give us what we want and we will not say anything publicly about it'. What we wanted was that Mr Connell step down as Chairman; Mr Lucas, who was then Managing Director would be dismissed; several other executives of the company would be dismissed; they would hand in their dealer's licence, which removed the need for us to withdraw it; they would put forward a new business plan and submit it to us for agreement; and a special audit of the accounts would be carried out.</PARA>

It is true that both Senator Collins and the honourable member for the Northern Territory, Mr Snowdon, made a number of representations to me on this question. Since 1 August charges have been in place for permits issued for commercial filming and still photography at both Kakadu and Uluru. An adult entry fee of $3 for admission to the new audiovisual display at Kakadu headquarters was introduced on that date as well. An adult park use fee of $5 was introduced on 1 January this year. That entitles visitors to use the park facilities, remote area camping, ranger guided tours and so on. That is the first entry or park use fee ever at Kakadu. At Uluru it was a bit different because there has been a fee of $1.50 in place there for years and that was increased to $5 last October.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There were a few complaints from some of the operators. The commercial operators of buses are being charged an annual rate of $50 to conduct their tours. The only other difficulty that came about was for residents of Jabiru, the town in the middle of Kakadu. There was a period of a couple of weeks when residents of Jabiru were being charged each time they entered the park. This was creating some difficulties and I am pleased to announce that, as a result of representations I have received from both Senator Collins and Mr Snowdon, the residents of Jabiru have been exempted from those charges and are now charged only when they use park facilities.</PARA>

Does the Minister endorse these comments by a former leading trade union official? Given that the major wages blow-out is a very real prospect, does the Minister agree with the recent comments made by the Treasurer that if there is an unacceptable wage-tax proposal on the part of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) the Government would go to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and argue `that any wage rise must be on a company by company basis'? Further, does the Minister think that a 20 per cent wage rise and a 30 per cent tax cut would be economically responsible in the current circumstances or, indeed, in circumstances where Australia suffered further disastrous balance of payments and inflation results such as those that we have had over the last couple of months?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If a Liberal government were in power, like the Government that was here when Senator Stone was Secretary to the Treasury, we would have a wage blow-out like those of 14 per cent and 16 per cent which occurred in 1981 and 1982 respectively, as I recall it. Mr Thompson's experience very much related to that period. I can understand his saying that because that is the sort of thing that happened under Liberal governments. In terms of the present Government, the Budget predictions in respect of wages and the predictions which have been made by the Treasurer and others in respect of wages since, have been between a 6.5 per cent and a 6.75 per cent increase in average weekly earnings over the year. If we compare that with the sort of performance in Senator Stone's day when Mr Howard was presiding over the Treasury, it is a pretty satisfactory increase. Senator Messner quoted from the alleged comments of the Treasurer about the level of success in negotiations with the ACTU which are still to take place and I accept what he has said. I also accept the Treasurer's view. If an agreed negotiated position cannot be arrived at that produces a result that is a reasonable expectation in the light of past wage restraint, the Treasurer is undoubtedly stating a course which he assumes it would be appropriate to take at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr President, I claim to have been misrepresented. In the House of Representatives on 21 December 1988, which was the last day of sitting of both chambers, in a debate on the suspension of Standing Orders the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) made a speech in which he made a number of references to me and, indeed, made a personal attack on me that was inaccurate in a number of particulars, two of which I would like to deal with today. Firstly, Mr Hand said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Senator Chaney comes to my office and sits there for nearly 2 1/2 hours, congratulates me on certain things that I have carried out that day, and the very next day goes into the Parliament and buckets people that he has told me are doing a great job in their particular functions . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That followed a suggestion that I am a Jekyll and Hyde on Aboriginal affairs and was a rather amusing misstatement, given that I have now had three meetings with Mr Hand at which I have made abundantly clear to him the extent of my concern about his administration of Aboriginal affairs. The meeting to which he referred was one of those three meetings and occurred on the day of his appointment of Mr Bill Gray as Secretary to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. That was an appointment which I welcomed. I tried to telephone Mr Gray to congratulate him at 11 p.m. but he was not at home. I divined, correctly, that he would be in his Minister's office. I rang the Minister's office and asked whether I could go and see them. I went to the office and congratulated Mr Hand on one thing and one thing only, namely, his appointment of Mr Bill Gray. I did that in Mr Gray's presence and I congratulated Mr Gray.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said that we then sat there for nearly 2 1/2 hours, which is longer than I recall, but it was certainly a lengthy discussion. I went through in great detail my concerns about his administration of the portfolio. There is absolutely no truth in the suggestion that I congratulated him on anything other than that single item. I did not proceed, on the next day or at any other time, to drop a bucket or do anything else about Mr Gray, whom I regard as an outstanding public servant and a very good appointment. I say simply that the Minister's statement was incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA> I should also add that the Minister was, I think, somewhat taken aback, or certainly affected, by one of my conversations with him which occurred outside the Senate committee rooms when again I detailed my depth of concern about his portfolio. He then arranged for Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) commissioners to call on me to brief me and offered me a briefing from the Secretary to the Department. In light of his suggestion that I have behaved inconsistently, I should say that on the morning Mr Gray came to my office at 8.30 to give me a briefing which had been arranged by the Minister, I had the night before determined to raise a matter of privilege in the Parliament which affected an official of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. Therefore, I asked Mr Gray not to carry on with the briefing, to return to his Minister's office and advise him of the reason for the cancellation of the briefing. I mention that because, again, it simply underlines that I have attempted to behave in an entirely proper way with respect to my dealings with officials in that Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, in the same speech Mr Hand said that I had walked into the Adelaide Airport and had `publicly abused' an Aboriginal woman because she was on the Aboriginal Development Commission. I spoke with a female commissioner of the ADC at Adelaide Airport. I deny that I abused her. The commissioner concerned has been known to me since 1979, when I first became Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, and there is no person for whom I have higher regard. I regard her as a friend. When I met her in the lounge at Adelaide Airport I spoke with her about what had happened in the ADC with the sacking and replacement of commissioners. I spoke to her, as I have spoken to some others, including members of this chamber, forcefully and with some passion because of my deep concern for what I think is the mess this Government is making in this area. I have spoken with the commissioner since. She told me that I did not abuse her and that she has not said that I abused her. She said to me that she was surprised by the vehemence on the subject. She recalled, and asked me to mention, her contribution to the conversation as being her concerns about the position of Charles Perkins and his being treated fairly. </PARA>
<PARA> After a time that particular conversation with the commissioner was broken off by me. I then introduced her to another transit passenger from Perth. The three of us sat and talked until my plane was called. I have spoken with the third person in that conversation, who recalls it as a friendly conversation which concluded with the commissioner sending her love to my wife. I make no apology for the strength of view I have expressed in this chamber and elsewhere about Labor's administration of Aboriginal affairs. I must say that it is no stronger than the expressions of concern I have heard from both Labor members of this Parliament and Labor supporters elsewhere, many of whom have expressed equally deep concerns about maladministration of Aboriginal affairs under the Hawke Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I should say that reports I have had of increasingly personal attacks by this Minister on me and other critics of his policies and administration-and I stress `critics of his policies and administration'-attacks made, among others, on public servants who have served with me and, indeed, with other people who have been criticised in similar terms by the Minister, suggest an increasingly desperate Minister with whom sensible communication would appear impossible without serious risk of misrepresentation and, to use the Minister's term, `personal abuse'. </PARA>

I did not make any such remark in Tasmania. No doubt Senator Crowley was referring to an article which appeared in the Tasmanian Mercury, presumably supplied to her by the National Media Liaison Service.

In that letter I said to the newspaper:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I want to settle a misunderstanding which is being perpetuated through your letter column. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not regard domestic violence as a soft issue and have never said that I do. I regard domestic violence as an appalling indictment on society and support efforts to isolate and remedy the causes and to support those abused. </PARA>
<PARA> What I have said is that the Federal Government has determined its key priorities in the area of Status of Women to be the role of women in advertising and domestic violence. </PARA>
<PARA> I said that the highest priority of most women's organizations speaking to the Opposition has been economic security and the related challenges of affordable housing, child care, education and re-education and worthwhile employment opportunities. Additionally women have called for a reversal of the trend under Labor of less support for families. </PARA>
<PARA> It might be that in at least some cases, declining family support and economic stress is related to domestic violence. </PARA>

<PARA>I wish to say briefly that I very much welcome the document that you have tabled, Mr President, and the judgment which was given by Mr Justice Woodward. Honourable senators will recall that some doubts were cast in an opinion, an opinion which many of us found extremely unconvincing, as to the capacity of the Senate to disallow certain parts of an order. The judgment of Mr Justice Woodward vindicates our doubts and concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to remember that the extraordinary and quite improper conduct of the Minister at the time, Senator Cook, was not in a sense dependent on that legal opinion of the Attorney-General's Department. That opinion permitted Senator Cook, or appeared to permit him, to do what he did, but no sensible Minister, concerned for the national interest, would have done what Senator Cook did. This is not the time for full debate on the implication of the judgment, but I believe that we should have a debate, perhaps early next week. Therefore, I give the Government notice that if it does not list the matter for hearing, I shall seek the cooperation of the Australian Democrats to have the matter brought on for debate. I seek leave to continue my remarks.</PARA>

I understand, subject to correction, that the application to have that matter put over from December to February was an application made by Thomas Borthwick and Sons (Pacific) Ltd and an order was made to put the matter over to that time. That occurred despite objections by those who wanted the matter to proceed then. The matter is still in a state of uncertainty, and it seems to be premature now to criticise the Minister, particularly as the matter is likely to be debated later. It seems to me that in any event the Minister has acted properly in the light of the advice he had received.

<PARA> (a) the adequacy of arrangements under the legislation relating to agricultural and veterinary chemicals for administration and co-ordination systems for agricultural and veterinary chemicals;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the efficacy of chemical, non-chemical and integrated management systems; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the economic, social and environmental impact on Australia of agricultural and veterinary chemicals and their alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee also may consider and recommend amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988. The Committee's terms of reference require it to present a progress report on the first sitting day in 1989 and a final report on the last sitting day in 1989. The progress report that I have just tabled on behalf of the Select Committee addresses the conduct of the inquiry, committee activities in relation to the reference and the Committee's program of public hearings and inspections. The report also notes some of the issues raised in the submissions already received. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not take up the time of the Senate by reviewing all these topics. There are, however, three matters contained in the report on which I wish to elaborate. Firstly, the Committee decided that submissions to the inquiry should be lodged as soon as possible but by 31 March 1989. Given the broad and complex issues contained in the terms of reference, this period for the preparation of submissions has been welcomed by several organisations and individuals. Even with this closing date for submissions, the Committee has adopted a program that should enable it to present its final report by the end of this year. Secondly, when the establishment of the Select Committee was debated in this chamber late last year, several organisations registered their opposition to such an inquiry. The Committee is pleased to record that it has been assured of the full cooperation of major interested parties. Thirdly, the Committee recognises that the important issues raised in the terms of reference have been the subject of considerable debate in the community and that it is important for an inquiry of this kind to receive as many points of view as possible. The Committee encourages all those wishing to express a view on the reference to lodge a submission with the Committee by 31 March 1989. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>In speaking to the motion I would like to address the essential principles which underlined our task and, in so doing, to restate the terms of reference in a way which I think outlines the essential questions we had to address and our response to them. Firstly, we had before us the question, `Was or is the concept of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) one that should be supported?'. I refer in particular to three aspects of that concept: firstly, the administrative consolidation envisaged within it; secondly, the establishment of a representative national structure; and, thirdly, a representative regional structure-those structures being designed to advise and recommend priorities to the Minister. The majority report's answer to that important question is yes. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, we were asked to consider whether there were clauses in the proposed Bill seeking to implement this concept which should be amended. The answer to that question is also yes. Thirdly, we were asked to consider whether the amendments as proposed were such as to require the Bill to be scrapped. The majority report's answer to that question is clearly no. If the Government's response to the report were to be a proposal for further consultations based upon the amendments proposed by the Committee, I certainly would not have any difficulty with it. It is in no way inconsistent with the thrust of the Committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, we were asked to consider whether the proposed alternative strategy of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) was preferable to the Government's proposal. The majority report, which I support, concluded that it was not. There were two subsidiary and less important questions. I do not regard them as unimportant, but they are less important. We were asked to consider whether the consultation leading up to the Bill was sufficient, and our conclusion can be summarised as follows: it was the best ever, it could have been better, but nothing in the consultation process to date necessitates further delay in dealing with the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we were asked to consider the Government's treatment of the ADC and, in particular, of the dismissed ADC commissioners. I think I can best summarise the majority report's conclusions by saying that the Minister had to act as he did but that nothing in that action or in the Committee's considerations and conclusions should derogate from the good faith in which the dismissed commissioners acted. </PARA>
<PARA> The relative priority given to each of the questions is determined by whether one prefers to look forwards or backwards, whether one is seeking, in presenting and discussing this report, to make a constructive contribution or to conduct some sort of retrospective witch-hunt. I note that there are minority dissenting reports. That is not surprising in such a controversial and complex area. I will refer briefly to them subsequently. </PARA>
<PARA> However, having put those broad principles on the table, and notwithstanding the minority and dissenting reports, I take this opportunity to thank my colleagues for their cooperation and courtesy and the diligence with which they undertook this onerous task which the Senate imposed upon us. In particular, I thank them for their cooperation with me in my first experience of chairing such a select committee; I appreciated their cooperation. There were some very contentious matters before us. In fact an issue of some controversy was involved. From time to time, some honourable senators might be surprised to know, even a little publicity was generated. The way in which the inquiry was handled by my colleagues did credit to the Senate. I take this opportunity, rather than at the conclusion of the report, to thank the Committee staff, Hansard officers and others for facilitating that smooth handling of the matter. I thank them and I thank my colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to detailed consideration of the recommendations. There are too many recommendations for me to give detailed consideration and response to all of them at this stage. I will try to highlight those that are the central ones, that is, those that go to the principal matters before us. For the consideration of other minor but, in some instances, still important recommendations, I recommend to senators and members of the interested public that they examine the report at their leisure. </PARA>
<PARA> The first matter is the general question of the case for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. It is very difficult in a few moments to summarise the evidence presented in a large number of public hearings, through a large amount of reading and in the many written submissions. But I thought in a sense this aspect was well set out in a document presented to the Committee which was incorporated in the report at page 17. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>This scheme presents a challenge to the leadership of the Aboriginal community-to the extent they provide governments with professional, objective advice, they will (i) obtain access to information not otherwise available (and certainly not available to lobby groups) and (ii) obtain the opportunity to influence from inside the public sector the development of Government policy as it affects Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very important statement. It is essentially a statement of the philosophical underpinning which supports the Commission. I shall refer to it later because I believe it is a challenge which I am confident the Aboriginal people, if given the opportunity, will meet. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also an important factor in the support for the concept of ATSIC which goes beyond that national aspect outlined and summarised in that challenge in the role of the proposed regional councils. This area is significantly misunderstood but is a very important aspect of ATSIC. If I had to determine one part of the proposal which I thought was most important, I would refer to the regional council. In the report, we concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>These councils will have responsibility for the development of a regional plan and-</PARA>
<PARA>I am quoting from the Bill-</PARA>
<PARA>for improving the economic, social and cultural status of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander residents of the region. </PARA>
<PARA>The regional councils will also make the proposals to the Commission for expenditure under certain restrictions in each region. In addition, the councils have a general representative and advisory function. Those two elements together are the philosophical underpinnings of ATSIC. They are the reason why the proposal should proceed, provided-I will come to this subsequently-there is a Bill which adequately reflects those principles. </PARA>
<PARA> The third aspect of ATSIC which I referred to in my opening remarks related to the consolidation. Although not every aspect of the proposed consolidation as stated in the Bill at the moment is supported in the majority report, the concept is certainly supported and is worthy of support for reasons of administrative efficiency. More importantly, it is consistent with the challenge outlined in the quotation which I earlier referred to concerning the broad role of the Commission at the national level. For those reasons, the majority of the Committee has supported the ATSIC concept and is continuing to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to go on now to consider some of the recommendations for modification of the Bill which is designed to implement the ATSIC principle. I will firstly refer-I will do it as closely as possible to the sequence in the report to assist those who might be trying to read the report-to the recommendation in clause 2.22 at page 17 of the report which recommends that a separate office of Aboriginal Affairs be retained within the Department of Employment, Education and Training. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The precise structure of the office is a matter to be determined by the Government of the day. The office would be responsible for advising the Minister on all matters relevant to the portfolio, including the administration of legislation and the exercise of delegations for which he or she was responsible. </PARA>
<PARA>The significance of this is that there have been assertions and allegations that somehow there is inherent in ATSIC an irredeemable flaw in that the same people have both a responsibility to a constituency which elects them and administrative accountability to the Government and the Minister as well as a role to advise on legislation. The argument is that these functions are incompatible. It is made clear elsewhere in the report, and it is obvious as a fundamental question of Westminster accountability, that there is nothing which prevents a Minister doing what is proposed in this recommendation at the moment. The legislation certainly, although it is silent on it, in no way prevents the Minister from establishing some separate advisory structure within the Department to which he or she is responsible. Nevertheless, the Committee thought that, to allay those fears and to make the situation clearer, we should make an explicit recommendation that such an office should be established so that no such conflict either exists or can be seen to exist.</PARA>
<PARA> At page 20, the Committee recommends that a greater proportion of the current activities of the ADC should be the responsibility of the proposed Aboriginal Economic Development Corporation (AEDC) as set out in the Bill, that is, a greater proportion than is envisaged in the Bill. This is important in two ways, but principally because we think it gets the balance of responsibilities right. The more appropriate division which we recommend would involve the abolition of the ADC as proposed in the Bill, the transfer of all its housing functions to ATSIC. But the responsibility for enterprise development, enterprise support, land acquisition and investment functions currently proposed for ATSIC in the Bill should be transferred to the AEDC. </PARA>
<PARA> That is an important reorientation. It does not change the fundamental supporting structures of the Commission because the interrelationship between ATSIC and the AEDC would continue. It does separate the economic development functions in a way that, I think, is appropriate. It is more appropriate than what was proposed. On consideration, the Government should, looking at that report, make such an amendment. I also believe that making such a change will make the role of the Commissioners more workable because, although some of them will be on the Board of the AEDC, they will have the capacity there to get extra economic advice from other Commissioners of the AEDC and not all of the ATSIC commissioners will be involved in all the economic decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the Institute of Aboriginal Studies, which is also proposed to be part of the consolidation, the Committee in fact recommends that the Institute retain its own legislation and continue to deal with other Aboriginal Affairs portfolio agencies as it has in the past. In effect, we are accepting the submission from the Institute. Importantly, and consistent with the submission from the Institute, the proposed reforms in the Bill which would have changed the relationship between what is now to be proposed to be ATSIC and the Institute should be implemented by amendment of the Institute for Aboriginal Studies Act. The restructuring of the Council of the Institute to include three commissioners of ATSIC should also be supported. The links that are proposed between ATSIC and the proposed Institute should be retained but we do think that the separateness that is involved in a separate piece of legislation should be retained and sustained. </PARA>
<PARA> The other recommendations that we have made to which I wish to refer go to other but important matters. With regard to questions of accountability there are a number of faces. At the moment, I am talking about the question of the proper dealing with public finances and proper accountability. There have been accusations that the ADC and other Aboriginal bodies responsible for dispersing public funds-not just recently but over a series of years-may have approved substantial expenditures, whether grants, loans or guarantees, without the necessary documentation and without the sort of rigorous analysis that would normally be supplied. Without commenting on past decisions because, to some extent, they are outside our brief, the Committee recommends that boards such as those of ATSIC and AEDC should not be able to approve substantial expenditures without a written assessment of proposals, including reports on viability, costings and alternatives. That would require a couple of minor amendments to the Bill, but I think they are important. They are important in substance; they are important in principle. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the proposals for the implementation of ATSIC in terms of how it would be elected, how the people, particularly and initially at the national level, would be selected. First, we are not talking about an Aboriginal parliament or a black parliament. The attempts to use those sorts of phrases, those colourful, rhetorical flourishes, do proper consideration of this matter no good. They mislead; they are intended to mislead; and they are grossly mistaken. As the majority report says, the Commission is not a parliament. It is very important that that be said from the start. It must be reiterated, because mischievous people could--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Neither is this body given access to that money. Somebody is accountable to the Parliament for that money and that is as it should be. It is taxpayers' money; the expenditure of it should be approved by the Parliament and accountability should be to the Parliament through the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. The Committee quite properly recommends that that should continue to be the case, so people who do not understand the Bill should not try to put about such furphies. The report states quite clearly the principle that the Commission is not to be considered a parliament. Neither do we want those who might be elected to it or those who might be dealing with it to be under any misapprehension. At the national level, Aboriginal and Islander people are, like all other Australian citizens, represented in this Parliament, to which democratic requirements apply and to which ATSIC is properly accountable; this is the parliamentary accountability that ATSIC has. The Commissioners are elected as representatives of the Aboriginal people to make a very important input into that decision making process, but they are not the final decision makers nor, for so long as the funds are taxpayers' funds, can they be, and that principle is stated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, it raises the important question of the electoral system. In the time I have, I can refer to only one of the many aspects of the system. I refer to the variation in voting populations within zones. There are a number of subsidiary questions to do with that concerning the establishment of electoral rolls which I hope to have time to deal with. First, although it is not a parliament in the strict one vote one value principle that I know everybody in the Opposition is so--</PARA>

Therefore, we make a series of recommendations suggesting the ways in which zone boundaries and representation might be changed to reduce the significant disparities that are in the Bill as proposed. They do not go as far as one vote one value. I know that will offend all members of the Opposition who are so sorely committed to that principle!

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support absolutely one vote one value. If the silly Party of the honourable senator had done so, we would be much better off at the moment, as would his Party. A regular review of boundaries is proposed. A panel, including representatives of the Electoral Commission and ATSIC, would undertake that review so that the Aboriginality questions would be dealt with by the elected representatives and the fair electoral boundary aspects would be dealt with by the people recognised by all Australians as the arbiters of such matters-members of the Australian Electoral Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> More complex questions are involved with respect to the setting of the boundaries of the regions. They include historical, cultural, linguistic and other important factors that were raised in discussions with the Minister and with us in the course of our consultations. It is important that an immediate review be undertaken before the first election and that some changes be made, but those changes do not need to be very major. A number of people have made written or oral submissions to us or to the task force. Their views ought to be taken into account and appropriate modifications made. It is important that subsequent regular reviews be undertaken both by the panel and, where appropriate, ATSIC, and recommendations to that effect are made in the report.</PARA>
<PARA> There is a disparity in populations within the regions. That does not matter with regard to most of the functions of the regional councils. It does not matter that there are different populations in each zone for the purpose of their drawing up regional plans, but it matters for their function as the electoral college for the electoral zone commissioners. Therefore, at page 40 we recommend certain modifications to the representative scale to accommodate those variations and make the electoral colleges more equally representative. </PARA>
<PARA> Another key aspect of the electoral process to which I make brief reference is that of compulsory voting. It is a very finely balanced argument as to whether in this matter of elections to ATSIC we should have the standard Australian principle of compulsory voting. In the end, the majority in that debate came down in favour of the introduction of compulsory voting for elections for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, essentially because of the fairly complex argument with respect to a series of points. I refer honourable senators to the report for the detail, but essentially Australians are accustomed to that manner of conducting elections. The argument was so finely balanced that it was felt that the normal electoral process ought to be continued and sustained. I support that. </PARA>
<PARA> We also recommend that there ought to be options for local communities at the regional level to determine alternative methods of selecting their representatives. It was clear from evidence given to us and from the report previously given by Lois O'Donoghue on the possible national structure that there is a strong view among Aboriginal people that electing representatives in accordance with Western parliamentary traditions is not always the most appropriate way of choosing Aboriginal representatives and that they ought to be given the opportunity locally to determine processes and procedures. My colleague Senator Collins has a strong view about that, as do others, but it was neither possible nor appropriate for the Committee to start recommending what that process ought to be. That would contradict the principle that underpins it. We recommend that regions should be able to recommend a preferred method of selecting councillors, subject to final approval by the Minister so that there is some benchmark to check that they are fair and reasonable proposals and that they ought to be able, therefore, to vary their representatives through that process. I reiterate that nothing in the recommendation would permit a regional council to change the system so that they get more representatives voting for a zone commissioner, but they can choose in their own way if that is possible. However, the first election should be conducted under the electoral system currently proposed in the ATSIC Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer to some other amendments. I have to skip over many of them because of the time constraints. I refer first to the very important question of the preamble. More mischief has been spoken about the preamble than about anything else. The Committee concluded-my assessment of the discussion and my recollection of it is confirmed by a brief reading of the minority report-that it was the unanimous view of its members that the legal position, as set out in this preamble, is quite clear. The Acts Interpretation Act, combined with the Minister's statement in his second reading speech, ensures the legal neutrality of the preamble to the ATSIC Bill. It does not have any of the potential legal consequences that some people wish it had and that many other people try to whip up a frenzy of concern that it might have. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, to ensure that as little mischief as possible is engaged in by those who sometimes seek to whip up concern in these matters, the Committee has recommended not that the preamble be changed with regard to one word but that the preamble, as it is currently proposed, should be put to the Parliament as a separate and simultaneous resolution of the Parliament. That is, at the same time that the ATSIC Bill is being considered, we should have a resolution of the Parliament expressed in the clear terms of the currently proposed preamble. I think that is important. It does not change the legal effect of the preamble one bit, but if it makes people happier and achieves the same purpose then I have no difficulty with that. </PARA>
<PARA> One other matter I wish to deal with, before I come to some of the questions of implementation and the supplementary issues before us in the time available, relates to the taxation of the Aboriginal Economic Development Corporation (AEDC). It is proposed in the current legislation that the capital fund of the AEDC and income derived from it should become subject to taxation and the payment of dividends. That is not the case for that money now within the AEDC and I think it is the unanimous view, but certainly the majority view, of the Committee that it should not be the case under the AEDC. The principle should be that there is no detriment to the interests of Aboriginal people arising from any aspect of the ATSIC Bill and that they therefore should not lose that which they currently have. It is therefore proposed that the status quo be retained. </PARA>
<PARA> The concept of the Bill is one that is capable of phased implementation. If the Government were of the view to do that, the three aspects to which I referred initially would be quite severable: we could have a regional council without establishing the national body; we could have a national body without electing, continuing and operating regional councils; and the administrative consolidation could proceed irrespective of the election of commissioners. That is a matter which we commend for the consideration of the Parliament and of the Government, but it is not something which we recommend. The Committee is recommending that the Bill should proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer very briefly to the consultative process. Put in perspective, it is quite clearly the best ever consultative process in Aboriginal affairs and far better than has ever been conducted with affected groups on any other matter, such as industrial relations. I reiterate that there is nothing in the consultative process to date which necessitates further delay. There are some allegations in the minority report concerning the consultative process which, to put them at their best, are merely salacious. Those who signed the minority report list all the most outrageous allegations that came before us-most of them in camera, I might say, with nothing to back them up. They say, `Here they all are. They are very important. Let us drag them through the mud. Maybe we will get a headline. We do not actually have anything to support them but they are very serious indeed'. </PARA>

Both coalition parties disagree violently with the majority report. I recommend that the Bill now before the Parliament, and the whole concept it represents, be withdrawn.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are many reasons for this, but the main one is that the indigenous people of Australia either do not want the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), do not understand the legislation, or want more consultation. We, as part of the Senate Select Committee on Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, took evidence in Queensland, the Northern Territory, Torres Strait, South Australia-all over Australia generally. With very few exceptions-and they were few; I could count them on the fingers of one hand-Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders wanted more time for consultation or did not want ATSIC at any price. Yet this Government is determined to force ATSIC onto the Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population. This is despite the promise made in Parliament by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) to them and the Australian people when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The effective implementation of these proposals ultimately rests on receiving a positive endorsement from the Aboriginal and Island Community. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me say conclusively that that endorsement has never been forthcoming. People out there in the Aboriginal communities do not want it. Earlier, the Minister made this statement in the House when he presented Foundations for the Future:</PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginal people need to decide for themselves what should be done-not just take whatever governments . . . say is best for them. </PARA>
<PARA>I concur wholeheartedly, 100 per cent. Why will the Government not honour its own promises? Why will it not listen to its own rhetoric? Why does this Government want to foist ATSIC on an unwilling Aboriginal community that has very little understanding of the Bill and an even lesser desire to see its passage through this Parliament?</PARA>
<PARA> The Aboriginals and Islanders want more time and this Government will not give it to them. The Government's intended action to force this Bill through Parliament without consent to, or even an understanding of, the legislation by the Aboriginal people is a betrayal of every black person in Australia. It is patronising, it is degrading, it is demeaning to our black brothers and sisters. It shows that this Government has not learned anything about Aboriginals. This Government's determination to go ahead with the legislation, as indicated in the majority report, will not give self-determination. It is white man's legislation, setting up a white man's bureaucracy and thrusting it on the black communities of Australia. That is not self-determination. That is not the Aboriginal way and Senator Collins knows it. This is the same attitude white people had when they took children away from Aboriginals and put them into orphanages because it was good for them, or rounded up blacks and put them on reserves because it was good for them. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is saying, `This ATSIC legislation will give you self-determination and it is good for you. You are going to cop it, whether you like it or not, because Gerry Hand, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the leader of the Socialist Left faction in this Parliament believes it is good for you. It is good Socialist Left doctrine'. I wish there was an honest man or woman in the Australian Labor Party who was prepared to stand up for our 300,000 indigenous people and go to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and say `Look, Bob, let's give Aboriginals more time. Let them make the decisions that are going to affect their lives. Let them understand and let them have more consultation'. Has the Labor Party degenerated to such a low that, because of the cross-factional deals and the need to keep the Socialist Left faction quiet, there is no-one who will speak up for the Aboriginals they represent?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Zakharov can laugh. Look at the Aboriginals up in the gallery. They are not laughing. Let us look at the consultation process undertaken by the Minister. The Minister travelled extensively through Aboriginal communities for about six weeks between late January and early March. He did not have the legislation to discuss in detail. His visits were whistle stop, rushed and inconclusive. He spoke about a concept only, with no detail. There were no maps available to show the Aboriginal people how the boundaries would operate and how regional councils would work. He offered inducements to communities to get their support for the ATSIC concept and he promised more consultation when the Bill was drafted. I have heard from one large community that he came in and did not even talk about ATSIC; he did not even attempt to explain the legislation. He asked them what they wanted. The Chairman told me that Gerry Hand came into the community and said, `What do you want?'. So he hit the Minister for some houses, roads and water. They never discussed ATSIC at all. That is not consultation; there is another name for it. The fact that Gerry Hand flew into communities and spoke to them for two or three hours in large groups is not explaining to the people what ATSIC is all about. During the Committee's travels it became quite clear that there were many people who had not the slightest idea how the legislation would work. Many had never seen the Bill. Those who had, found it extremely difficult to understand. The Minister promised that when the Bill was printed they would have meetings and more discussions. That never happened. Some communities travelled miles to see the Minister, but he was in and out like a fiddler's elbow. I want to read into my contribution a plea from the Anmatjara tribe of Central Australia. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Dear Mr Hand,</PARA>
<PARA> We have heard about this new proposal for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. We went to see Mr Hand at Yuendumu but he was gone. He only stay a short time. That no good. He should stay longer and listen to each group and not just visit big communities. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a meeting at Three Bore near Utopia. We heard Alan Randall talk about ATSIC. We heard about those new zones, voting for the Commission and all those things. We had a big talk about it between ourselves when we came home. We are not happy with ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA> Other mobs we talk to are not happy with ATSIC either. All over Napperby, Alyawarra, Utopia outstations, we don't like to mix everyone up in one big council. </PARA>
<PARA> We got map today from D.A.A. The map shows all those ATSIC regions in different colours. </PARA>
<PARA> Well now we got to tell you, we are not happy about ATSIC and we are not happy about that map. That map is wrong. You can't split our country up. You can't put us with all those other people from different country. That mob from south haven't got skin groups like us. You can't put us with them. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not happy with ATSIC and we don't want it. </PARA>
<PARA> We are going to talk more about this with our own people. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a plea from Aboriginal communities that should make every member of this Senate and this Parliament stop and think before they vote for this legislation. The Anmatjara tribe are not the only ones who could not support the Bill. The Aboriginal Development Commission's (ADC) former acting commissioners advised the Minister that ATSIC was not in the best interests of the Aboriginal people. They genuinely believe that they had the duty to offer the Minister advice on what was in the best interests of the Aboriginal community. Section 8f of the Aboriginal Development Commission Act provides that it is a function of the Commission to further the social and economic development of Aboriginals, to give advice and make recommendations to the Minister with respect to the furtherance of the economic and social development of Aboriginals. These eight ADC commissioners were sacked for having the audacity to tell the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs what they thought was good for their people. Despite the fact that they were required to do so by the Act, they got the chop. The eight acting commissioners were sent back to their communities in disgrace for standing up for their people. </PARA>
<PARA> In evidence we were told by Mrs Helen Williams that when she went back to her community she felt ashamed and disgraced. That is the way she described how she felt when she was sent back. She believed that the people in her community would think that she had committed some offence. We were also told that one of the women commissioners was on the verge of a nervous breakdown because her good name and reputation had been denigrated. One of the commissioners said that he felt like he had been kicked in the guts when he got his marching orders. There is no doubt that all the commissioners felt disgraced and denigrated when the Minister sacked the entire board of acting commissioners because they would not be bullied, threatened or intimidated into accepting ATSIC. They knew that their people did not understand and they knew that they did not even have time for consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> The commissioners were not the only ones who felt this way. At a meeting in Rockhampton, the former secretary of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, Charles Perkins, moved that the meeting request the Minister to immediately set about holding further meetings and further consultation on ATSIC. We know what happened to Mr Perkins-he got thrown off the troika, off the sleigh, and was fed to the wolves. Similarly, the West Australian Labor Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Ernie Bridge, expressed worry and fear about ATSIC. In October 1988 he said that he was worried about the way ATSIC's regional structure would relate to the State's administration of Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me put it on record that every one of the acting commissioners who Mr Hand sacked-I will name them individually: Mr Ossie Cruse, MBE, Mr John Atkinson, AM, Mr Ben Ward, Mr Phillip Yanner, Mrs Helen Williams, Mrs Lena Anaai Passi, Mr Andrew Thomas, and Ms Maria Thompson, as well as the ADC Chairman, Mrs Shirley McPherson, and Commissioner Mrs Zona Martin-acted with integrity, honour, devotion and honesty to the Aboriginal and Islander cause. They refused to betray the Aboriginal people and sell their people out. I wish there were a few honest people on that side of the Parliament who could take a leaf out of their book. On the contrary, the acting commissioners can hold their heads up as people who would not bow to a Minister who wanted to tell Aboriginals and Islanders what was good for them. If this legislation goes through Parliament with the help of the Australian Democrats and causes havoc, disunity and chaos and sets the Aboriginal cause back 40 years, the former commissioners will be held up as role models-as the black heroes who tried to stop the insidious ATSIC Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I now want to put on record the most disgraceful event of the whole sorry saga of ATSIC. This concerns the leaking of a completely fictitious story in the Sydney Morning Herald with the express purpose of denigrating all the dismissed ADC Commissioners. That story ran on 25 May 1988 with the headline `Black group missing $670,000'. The Committee heard evidence that this newspaper report was faxed out to Aboriginals by way of explanation for the dismissal and that some former commissioners had suffered emotional and physical distress because of the leaked story. There is no proof that the Minister's office was aware of who leaked the story, but the story emanated from either his own office or the office of one of the agencies he controls. Either way, he must write a letter of apology acknowledging to each of the dismissed commissioners that the leaked story about financial misrepresentations and misappropriations was untrue and damaging. That is the recommendation of both Senator Peter Baume and myself. It is the least the Minister can do to reinstate the reputations of the dismissed commissioners. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Committee under its terms of reference was asked to investigate the alternative proposals put forward by the ADC commissioners. Both Senator Peter Baume and I believe that that was not performed adequately. The fact that the Minister took absolutely no notice of the alternative strategy proposed by the ADC is further evidence that he was not interested in any point of view other than his own. He was not interested in discussions or consultation with Aboriginal people. During the Minister's consultative visits to Queensland he completely ignored the largest Aboriginal organisation in Queensland, the Aboriginal Co-ordinating Council (ACC). This organisation represents between 15,000 and 20,000 Aboriginals-arguably more than any other Aboriginal organisation in Australia. It has its own office in Cairns and its own executive, and it is authorised to speak for all Aboriginals living on deed of grant in trust-DOGIT-communities. The Minister did not see fit to consult these people. He did not ring them; he did not even make a courtesy call. It is just another instance of the ineffectiveness of the consultation process undertaken by the Minister. To claim, as he has, that the Aboriginal communities want this legislation is misleading to the Parliament and to all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the ACC management committee have come to Canberra-I see them sitting in the gallery and I welcome them here; they are courageous men-to make a last ditch appeal to the Prime Minister, who has fobbed them off and sent them over to Gerry Hand. They did not want to see Mr Hand but they are kind, courteous people so they went to see him yesterday. I believe that, belatedly, the Minister has decided that he will visit them, more out of shame than anything else. The reason the ACC is totally opposed to ATSIC is that it will deprive its 15 communities of self-determination. These communities set their own priorities on how to run things. They decide whether they want to allocate money for roads, housing, seweage or whatever. Now these communities will not have that option. They will have to go to the regional council to argue for the funding. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the smaller shire councils and communities may not get any representation on the regional councils. Some Aboriginal councils, such as Utopia and Umagico, have populations as low as 149. These people in smaller communities will not get representation on regional councils. Who will look after their interests? Members of some of the smaller councils have little understanding of English. How will they be able to put their case to a regional council even if they do get on? They are terrified that they will be swamped by more articulate Aboriginal members. Let us take the Cairns regional council. There is a total of 9,000 black people in the Cairns regional council area. There are 1,800 at Yarrabah, 150 at Mosman Gorge and 300 at Kuranda-Mona Mona. That means there are 6,750 urban Aboriginals left, out of the total of 9,000 Aboriginals who live in the Cairns region. There is no doubt that the Cairns people will control the Cairns regional council. This is not a single case; that will happen all over Australia. The smaller communities will not get a look in; they will not have any representation. These are the problems that the Minister has never considered; they are problems that this Parliament has to consider. </PARA>
<PARA> The DOGIT communities are financed directly by the Department of Community Services-the Queensland Government department responsible for Aboriginals-and the Federal Department of Aboriginal Affairs. With ATSIC, all funding under DAA will cease and be transferred to ATSIC. The smaller councils will not be represented at regional level and it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to have a commissioner elected from Aboriginal communities in Queensland. This will have the effect of establishing two Aboriginal communities in Australia-the articulate haves who can get in and argue their case, the urban Aboriginals who make up the numbers in the big centres, and the smaller communities who will not get a look in. But let there be no misconception and no misunderstanding. Just as many urban Aboriginals are opposed to ATSIC as are community dwellers. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only did the Minister not consult Aboriginals but also he did not consult the States, despite the fact that many joint programs are funded through the State and Commonwealth governments. As I understand it, the majority report recommends that a roll be established and only those on the roll will be allowed to vote. I challenge the Minister to have a referendum to determine whether Aboriginals want ATSIC. I believe that the result would be an overall no. Last week on television the Minister said that Aboriginal people must agree with what he is proposing and that it must be introduced with them, not over them. Again I agree with the Minister, but it is rhetoric because very few Aboriginal people want ATSIC. If he has to establish an electoral roll, if the recommendations in the majority report are carried out, the Aboriginals should decide whether they want ATSIC. Let us put it to a referendum and see what the Aboriginals say. I believe that this is the only chance that this Minister has to extricate himself and his Government from this mess. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government really wants to give Aboriginals self-management let it have a referendum on ATSIC. The Minister has relied on the carrot and stick theory with Aboriginals to get their support for ATSIC. He tracked around the communities like Santa Clause with a grab bag of money-$807,999 worth of inducements-and, when that failed, he used the stick. There has been the sacking of eight commissioners, votes of no confidence in the Chairman of the ADC, and the humiliation of the Manager, Mick O'Brien, by transferring him to a non-job. There is a complete loss of morale amongst the management structure of the ADC and the DAA, and one-third of the upper echelon has resigned. These people know the damage that ATSIC will cause. They cannot stand by and see their life's work go down the drain. They are demoralised and they are getting out. </PARA>
<PARA> The concept of ATSIC is wrong. It is flawed. It will not work, because it will divide the Aboriginal communities. They will have to fight to get representation at elections for Aboriginal councils and commissioners. There will be deals, counter deals and double deals and it will drive a wedge right through the middle of the Aboriginal communities. Culturally, it is not right for Aboriginals to cross community boundaries. They are devoted to their own communities and they are comfortable working in them. Senator Collins knows that everything I say is right. It is wrong for both white and black Australians to set up what is virtually a black extension of this Parliament with 1,200 elected regional councillors and 15 commissioners. We do not want apartheid in Australia, and that is what this Government is offering us. We want both blacks and whites to enjoy the benefits that this country has to offer. This ATSIC proposal will not achieve that. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again this Government has raised the expectations of the Aboriginal people. It has promised them many things which have never been delivered, unlike the Queensland Government and its Minister, Bob Katter, who have given them ownership title to seven million acres of land. That has encouraged Aboriginals to go into their own businesses and develop their own farms and grazing properties. That is self-determination-allowing Aboriginals to run their own enterprises, their own establishments. The ADC that Senator Chaney set up genuinely let Aboriginals develop their own commercial enterprises with no ministerial control-Aboriginals making decisions for Aboriginals. ATSIC will take that all away. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been argued that under ATSIC the Minister will have the final say; the commission may make recommendations but the Minister has the power. After 200 years of white settlement this ATSIC legislation will still provide for a white Minister telling black people what is good for them. I cannot, and I will not, sign the majority report. I ask the Australian Democrats and the Independents in this Senate to support the minority view. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This whole matter is an extremely difficult one. We have heard a great deal of evidence on both sides of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) question and I do not think we will really serve Aboriginal interests-and that is what we should be on about-at all by name calling and attempting to score points off each other. I begin by dealing with the attack which the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) made on Senate committees in general and on the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs in particular because I believe that both the Minister's general attack and his specific attack were entirely uncalled for. His remarks were damaging because they came during the final days of the deliberations of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. They maligned the members of a Committee from both sides of the House who, as far as I can judge, were behaving in an absolutely impeccable manner and were discharging their duties to the best of their abilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would draw the conclusion that this is a symptom of the way in which this Minister has dealt with the legislation from the very beginning. Unfortunately, this has brought the whole matter of restructuring Aboriginal Affairs into an area of debate which has been totally counterproductive to the best interests of Aboriginal people. The Minister has seemed to accept that any criticism of ATSIC, no matter how well-founded, is a personal criticism of him, has attacked those people who have dared even to offer constructive suggestions for modification of the ATSIC proposal and therefore has developed a confrontationist and a polarised view which I can only repeat has been totally counterproductive and very damaging to the whole process of the consideration of this legislation. One could extend that diagnosis of the Minister's handling by mentioning the way in which he dealt with the eight former Aboriginal Development Commission commissioners and, as Senator Boswell has pointed out, his attack on the Chairman of the ADC, Shirley McPherson. Personally I have found her to be a competent person of the highest integrity who is certainly not in any sense attempting to attack the Minister but simply to put up alternative proposals for the betterment of Aboriginal people of whom she is one. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Minister was totally wrong in behaving that way. His actions were counterproductive and, indeed, politically stupid because, had he waited only a few short weeks, the terms of those acting commissioners would have expired anyway and he could quite easily have appointed other people. I have observed much of the hurt which the Minister generated in Aboriginal communities by that action because those people took that not only as a personal slight but also as a slight on their families and their communities. That whole action could have been avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also worth while pointing out in relation to consultation that, I believe the Minister did consult quite widely and quite well on the general principle of ATSIC-the principle of self-determination and self-management. He went around with the document Foundations for the Future and I believe that he achieved an in-principle support for ATSIC. But I also believe many Aboriginal people formed the opinion that the Minister had given an undertaking that when the legislation became available he would go back and further consult with them so that they could make a judgment as to whether the specific clauses of a specific Bill met the outline to which they had assented in those early consultations. The majority report makes it quite clear that that later phase of the consultation did not occur. There was no consultation whatsoever once the legislation was introduced into the House of Representatives on 24 August 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> One can move on from that and draw attention to the fact that from that process the Opposition essentially has adopted several fall-back positions. The Opposition's first position is that the legislation should simply be thrown out. Failing that the next fall-back position is that the legislation should be delayed so that further consultation should occur. The next fall-back position is that if the legislation proceeds then the Opposition has very significantly contributed to those amendments which have been suggested in the report in which there are some 31 recommendations. I have contributed significantly to the recommendations for modi- fication of ATSIC and I would part company with the Opposition at the point where it is calling for the abolition of ATSIC and also at the point--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I understand Senator Baume's position very well. I respect his position and I think he has come to it for good and valid reasons. I happen to disagree with that position and I wish to explain why. I also disagree with the call for further consultation. The reason I do that is that I believe that if the amendments which have been suggested in the report are adopted-and that is a very big if, considering the way in which the Minister has hitherto dealt with this matter-they will constitute an extension of the principle of self-determination and self-management, which is the principle to which those Aboriginal people assented in those early consultations. Moreover, in framing those suggested amendments, the Committee, which has existed for six months, moved around the country. It has considered a number of submissions and has taken on board a number of the suggestions for amendments which have been put before it. I stress again that, provided the Government is prepared to accept those amendments to the legislation which give back to Aboriginal people the ability to modify this legislation with respect to the regional council boundaries, the electorate processes and a number of other things which I will deal with in a moment, then the legislation will give effect to the in-principle support which Aboriginal people had originally assented to back in that period of January to March 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is worth making the point here, as Senator Boswell has stressed and some Aboriginal people as recently as yesterday and today have pointed out to me, that some groups who will be represented in regional councils will have either no voice or a very small voice. It was pointed out to me yesterday that in the case of the Aboriginal Co-ordinating Council (ACC) from Cairns some groups may have only 20 per cent of the representation in a regional council. They fear that it may follow that they will not continue to get the funding which they now get through a white administered system. My comment on that is that if ATSIC is about self-determination and self-management it seems to me to follow that under these regional councils Aboriginal people are the appropriate people to make those judgments. For Aboriginal people to say that they want to continue to have that dispensation of funds in white hands because white hands do it better simply flies in the face of everything that the Australian Democrats, certainly, have been on about in giving the control of these matters-the recognition of Aboriginal self-determination and self-management-back to Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA> I have just met with a number of Aboriginal people outside who pointed out to me, quite rightly, that this is a piece of white legislation and it imposes on Aboriginal people a white system of structuring regional councils and electing, through zones, a white structured organisation, even though it might represent Aboriginal interests. I accept that that is a valid criticism looked at from the Aboriginal point of view, but I am afraid that I do not see a way around that, given 200 years of white occupation. I believe that the best the white people can do is to give back, as far as possible within the existing structures, a mechanism wherein Aboriginal people can make their own decisions regarding welfare, housing, education and legal services. Because we work under a European legislative system, necessarily we must do that under our own law. I recognise that that is a compromise. However, given the history which has preceded the development of Aboriginal and white relationships and the development of the whole legislative process in this country, that is an inevitable mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to some of the recommendations in the report that I think are important to observe. First of all, the report recommends that the preamble be separated from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill. As Senator McMullan pointed out in his opening remarks, it is widely recognised that the preamble, even attached to the Bill, has no force whatsoever in law. Yet many Aboriginal people looking at that preamble believed that it may have had some force in law and they may have been misled into believing that it gave some legal recognition of prior Aboriginal occupation, dispossession and the legal consequences flowing from that. That would have been a completely dishonest impression to give to Aboriginal people. Therefore, it is appropriate that the preamble be separated and dealt with in the Senate as a separate motion of the Senate in a cognate debate. Hopefully, the preamble would be passed. It would be a motion of the Senate and would be seen as such. It would have the force of any other motion of the Senate, but it could never be confused as a document which had some legal force. </PARA>
<PARA> Recognising that the passage of the ATSIC legislation would lead to the abolition of the ADC and the Aboriginal Development Commission Act-at the moment the ADC Act is the only piece of legislation which recognises in law prior Aboriginal occupation of this country and the dispossession of the Aboriginal people-that report recommends that those sections of the ADC Act which would be revoked be carried over and written into the ATSIC legislation. It is important to recognise that, while the Committee recommends the separation of the preamble from the Bill, it actually seeks to strengthen the recognition of the position of Aboriginal people with respect to their prior occupation of this country and their dispossession. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to recognise a number of other sections of the report. The passage of legislation of any sort inevitably imposes on Aboriginal people a white European system. Recognising that and recognising the need for a democratic process, the Committee has accepted the prior construction of rolls on which the election of the regional councils and through that the election of the zones to ATSIC can be carried out. The Bill as it stands does not provide for prior construction of rolls or compulsory voting. It is wide open to abuse. For instance, people could come in from outside an area and vote in an area in which they were not normally resident. Moreover, in the event of the recall provisions, one could have a different population of people responsible for recall from those who voted for the original regional council. I believe that such a situation is quite intolerable. Therefore, it is appropriate that rolls constructed before elections occur and that the placing of one's name on such a roll be voluntary. However, once one's name is on the roll, voting should be compulsory and those who could vote for the regional councils should be residents of that area, so that people outside the area cannot interfere with that electoral process. </PARA>
<PARA> Related to that is a recommendation in my minority report that was not accepted by other Committee members on either side of the House. That recommendation concerns the definition of an Aboriginal person. The Bill as it is at the moment defines an Aboriginal person as a person of the Aboriginal race. It is a tautology. It says absolutely nothing. It leaves the matter wide open for legal challenge. Under the existing Bill rolls would not be constructed prior to an election. People would simply turn up to vote, they would vote and, if their right to vote were challenged, they would have that challenge necessarily heard in a court and the vote would be kept separate until the court challenge had been heard. That would be an enormous impediment to the further progress of the implementation of ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that it is necessary to clarify who is eligible to vote so that challenges are likely to be less frequent. That links necessarily with the idea of prior construction of rolls and compulsory voting. That would tighten up the electoral process and make it properly democratic. The recommendation I have made for the redefinition of an Aboriginal person is exactly in line with the definition that has been used by the courts. It is a two-part definition and it says that an Aboriginal person is a person of Aboriginal descent and, if unable to prove Aboriginal descent, a person who identifies himself or herself as an Aboriginal and is identified as such by the community. That is the working definition which is used by the courts. It seems to me that it is an abdication of our responsibility to put into legislation a definition which requires interpretation by the courts when it is our proper function to write those definitions into law. </PARA>
<PARA> I should mention that the objection that has been made to clarifying the definition is that it may fall foul of the section of the Constitution which was amended in the 1967 referendum. The basis of that argument is that by further clarifying the definition it may be possible to show that an Aboriginal person was excluded from the provisions of this legislation and, therefore, fell foul of the provisions of the Constitution. I point out in defence of my proposal that if the courts have consistently used the working definition I have outlined, it would be necessary for a person challenging this legislation-supposing it included my redefinition-to establish a different definition of an Aboriginal person, to have that accepted by the courts, and then establish that under that new definition that person was excluded. That begs the question rather too far and, therefore, it is appropriate that the matter be clarified so there will be fewer challenges and people will be quite clear as to who is included or excluded from the provisions of the ATSIC legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Another provision to which it is important to draw attention and which, if adopted, would significantly modify the ATSIC Bill relates to the structure and function of the Aboriginal Economic Development Commission (AEDC), the body which will take on the function of accepting capital grants from the Government. I would point out-and Senator Chaney will recognise the importance of this-that the capital fund was set up originally and specifically in recognition of prior Aboriginal occupation of this country and of dispossession. Money was paid into that capital fund by a then Liberal government, but no money has been paid into that fund by the Labor Government since 1983. The AEDC will take on that capital fund and will have the function of investing that in a range of activities-not necessarily even Aboriginal activities-under the existing Bill. If the Committee's recommendations are adopted, the AEDC will take on many of the functions of economic development which up to now have been carried on by the ADC. We believe as a Committee that it was appropriate that in accordance with the ADC's submission to us and to the Minister-but the Minister did not accept it-welfare and economic functions should be kept separate. Moreover-and I think that Senator McMullan has drawn attention to this-in view of the fact that that capital fund was a recognition of dispossession and therefore was a fund, as it were, in compensation for that dispossession, it was very appropriate that, contrary to the Bill as it stands at present, no dividend should be paid to the Government on any profits which flowed from that fund, nor should taxation be paid on the profits from that capital fund. Again, I hope that the Minister will accept that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with the number of submissions which I have received personally and which the Committee received, running the full gamut from asking for ATSIC not to proceed at all to implementing ATSIC forthwith without amendment or further discussion, and recognising that what Aboriginal people assented to in those early consultations was in principle acceptance of the self-determination and self-management principle, I have sought-and I believe the Committee has agreed with this approach-to suggest amendments. When ATSIC is implemented those amendments will give to the Aboriginal people themselves the ability to control the further evolution of that structure so that it meets their real needs. With that in mind, the recommendations go to the matter of boundaries, and there is great concern over boundaries both in the Northern Territory and in Queensland. I cannot stress more strongly that if the Minister accepts the recommendations-and I hope that he does and no longer proceeds with the attitude he has adopted up to now on this legislation-one of the first tasks of these regional councils will be to review their own boundaries. There is also a requirement that before every second election there be a review of boundaries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also heard evidence that some areas would prefer a different election process. What is envisaged in the Bill, rather interestingly in view of the imposition by the Government and Opposition of the d'Hondt system in the Australian Capital Territory, is a Senate type election process for regional councils-a very appropriate quota proportional representational system which could not be more democratic. We heard in some regions that people would prefer to have representation through their existing councils and elected and representative bodies in each region. I see nothing wrong with that at all, and even from a democratic point of view it could easily be accommodated. Again, the report recommends that the regional councils consider that matter and they will be able to make recommendations about change in the electoral process. It is also recommended that the Electoral Commission consider those matters and make a recommendation on any proposals which come forward. It is appropriate that there be an overview so that whatever electoral process is suggested that process will be properly representative and democratic and properly represent the interests of Aboriginal people within that region. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to this report, provided that one goes past the first two fall-back positions of the Opposition, I would point out that Opposition members fully participated in the discussion of the recommendations which were included in the majority report. Therefore, if the legislation proceeds I believe that the Opposition will support those recommendations. I express the hope that the Minister will accept the fact that those six members of the Committee in good faith, and with the best interests of Aboriginal people at heart, carefully considered all the pros and cons and came down with the best recommendations that they possibly could. I hope that the Minister will take those recommendations very seriously. I hope he will either make it clear that if he proceeds with this legislation he will be prepared to allow those amendments to be included, or if he chooses to withdraw the legislation and resubmit it that again he will take those amendments into account. In that way we shall get before the Senate a much better Bill which will more comprehensively fulfil the considerations of self-management and self-determination to which I believe the Aboriginal people are committed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope not to detain the Senate for too long. Indeed, there is no need for me to do so, as the Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, Senator McMullan, has fairly comprehensively outlined the major aspects of the majority report. However, I must touch briefly on some of the comments made by the two previous speakers. One of the most bizarre aspects of this debate for me so far has been the spectacle of the far right wing of this Parliament, a Queensland National Party senator, purporting to act as a champion for blacks. As a person who has been actively involved in the political life of this country for some time, and having seen at first hand the way in which the conservatives have ground Australian Aboriginal people into the dirt for the last 20 years, I regard that as a fairly bizarre performance. The Queensland National Party was responsible directly for dumping the one and only Aboriginal Australian who has ever graced this Parliament, Senator Neville Bonner, in a disgraceful intervention in the preselection processes of the Queensland Liberal Party. It reached the point-a chapter I shall never forget-where a Liberal Party senator, then Senator Kathy Martin, in a gesture which does not happen often in politics, publicly offered to give up her position on the Senate ticket to Senator Bonner because of her outrage at the behaviour of the Queensland Nationals, and in particular the Queensland Premier who wanted to rid himself of that turbulent priest. The turbulent priest embarrassed the Queensland Nationals by his very moderate and conservative support of the position of his own people in Queensland. So it is a little bizarre to hear in this Parliament this afternoon a defence of Aboriginals by a representative of that same party that dumped the only Aboriginal ever to get into this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must also comment on a couple of the more outrageous statements that Senator Boswell made in canvassing the question of the propriety and personal integrity of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand. Senator Boswell accused the Minister of buying support for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission by approving grants to communities that he visited during the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) consultations. He then quoted statements made by Aboriginal people from Queensland that the Minister did not talk to them about ATSIC when he got to their communities. There may be criticisms of and reservations about the consultation process that took place. Indeed, the majority report has expressed them. But, as someone who was part of those consultations, at least in the Northern Territory sector, I suggest it is beyond question that the round of consultations was the most extensive ever undertaken by any Minister for Aboriginal Affairs on anything. I say that in order to address the serious, false and malicious charge levelled against the Minister by Senator Boswell that the Minister bought support for ATSIC by the simple act of approving applications made to him for grants. What nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> The Aboriginal affairs ministry is a difficult portfolio. In order even to attempt to cover the portfolio properly, the most extensive travel around this country is necessary because Aboriginal people in their thousands live in every State of this Commonwealth, many in isolated communities. As I know, at times one has to spend days and days of uncomfortable travel to visit literally a handful of people. Aboriginal people do not have constant access to Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs. It is not a common event-nor could it ever be-for a sole individual ever to visit frequently any Aboriginal communities in this country. Not surprisingly, on the rare opportunities communities have to gain direct personal access to the Minister they wish to canvass matters of concern to their communities. I would have thought that that message, at least, would have got through to Senator Boswell by now. </PARA>
<PARA> As someone who was personally present with the Minister at the meetings in the Northern Territory, where every single community raised these matters of concern, I can say that on each one of those occasions the Minister behaved with the utmost propriety and, I am pleased to say, showed sympathy and understanding. In many cases he made positive responses to the representations made to him at those times by Aboriginal people for toilets, houses, assistance with sporting venues and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> I am certainly not going to stand here and say what a dreadful thing it was for Gerry Hand to have approved a grant of thousands of dollars for the provision of public toilets at Yuendumu because he happened to be there when the ATSIC consultations were on. I say good on him for doing so. To attempt to portray that as misbehaviour on the part of a Minister is disgraceful, and Senator Boswell knows it. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to address the complaint that `the Minister was here but he did not talk to us about ATSIC'. I have worked in Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory for over 20 years. Over 10 years I represented two Aboriginal seats in the Northern Territory Parliament. It did not matter how many times one visited an Aboriginal community, it was never possible to see everyone. On every occasion that I went to an Aboriginal community-I may have visited it only two weeks before-more than one person would say, `Where have you been for the last 12 months?'. I would say to those persons, `Hang on, I was out here only two weeks ago'. They would say, `Well you did not talk to me'. Again, that kind of criticism is not valid criticism of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs who, on each of the occasions that I was personally with him, made himself available to anyone who wanted to see him, no matter how long it took. These personal criticisms of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs are outrageous. As the Chairman of this Committee, Senator McMullan, said, they are salacious in the way in which they have been presented in this report and deserve the utter contempt and rejection of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I get on to the report proper, I must also drop a gentle bucket on my National Party colleague from the Northern Territory, Senator Tambling, who was the genesis of this Committee. It was Senator Tambling's motion that initiated the setting up of the Committee. If my memory does not play me false, Senator Coulter seconded the motion. Senator Coulter at least had the intestinal fortitude to serve on the Committee, and of course Senator Tambling did not. For the benefit of the people of the Northern Territory, the only reason I mention this is that, had Senator Tambling simply moved the motion and then done nothing further, I would not have had any valid criticism to make of him. But since then Senator Tambling has, on numerous occasions during the months that this Committee has been operating, put out public statement after public statement, beating his breast in the Northern Territory saying, `Aren't I a clever boy? It was all my work. I set up the Committee with a motion that I moved in the Senate'. </PARA>
<PARA> As someone who has had the hands on involvement of serving on what has been a difficult and controversial committee, I have to say that it was very frustrating for me to see these statements being put out-although I did not respond to them-by someone who moved a motion to establish the Committee but who did not have the intestinal fortitude to follow it through. As far as Senator Tambling is concerned, it was no care and no responsibility. I hope that Senator Tambling does not have the absolute temerity to contribute to this debate, because he does not deserve to. </PARA>

Senator Coulter made a number of remarks about criticisms of the Committee. My response to those criticisms is slightly softer than Senator Coulter's.

I believe that the Committee dealt with this matter both expeditiously and competently. The application of every senator on the Committee was reflected by their high attendance. I personally gave the Committee precedence over all other committees that I serve on in this Parliament with the sole exception of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, the reason being that I chair that Committee. I have a view that, if one chairs a committee, that committee deserves to have precedence over other committees one serves on. I regret that I was absent from the Queensland sector of the Committee's work-it was the only sector from which I was absent-because of obligations I had as a result of my chairmanship of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. On a second occasion I was not able to attend the Committee's hearings because, although I had come to Canberra for them, unfortunately I had to return to the Northern Territory to attend the funeral of a close friend of mine of 20 years-probably the most prominent cultural leader of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory, Nandjiwarra Amagula, at Groote Eylandt.</PARA></TALK.START>

Aboriginal people from the central desert, Maningrida, the Tiwi Islands and all over the Northern Territory went to that funeral to demonstrate the very high regard in which they held Nandjiwarra. It is a fact, in response to Senator Tambling's interjection, that the very last occasion that I, as a politician, received representation from Nandjiwarra Amagula was in Darwin in my capacity as Acting Chairman of this Senate Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say again that the application of all senators to the work of the Committee was excellent. I understand the Minister's frustrations. As I say, it is something to which I have a softer response than Senator Coulter. One of the first lessons I learnt in my first week in this Parliament was that there is in fact a profound ignorance on the part of members of the House of Representatives, whether they be Ministers or backbenchers, as to how this Senate operates. It is a profound ignorance. I must say that members of the House of Representatives who live in that ignorance do not hesitate to let one know that as far as they are concerned ignorance is bliss because they do not want to know about this place. I suppose the Minister's frustrations stem from the fact that he would like to see the end of the Senate, like a lot of other people in the country. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a profound difference, of course, in the way in which the two chambers operate. That was very largely responsible for the criticisms that were made. In the House of Representatives if one wants to make a conquest there is no seduction. It is a simple case of rape with a bit of S and M involved. There is an application of the gag, a touch around the ears with the guillotine and then it is `wham bam' and not even `thank you, Ma'am'. In the Senate, of course, a different approach is required. In here one needs candlelight and soft music. There are no Democrats in the House of Representatives. That is the significant difference. One needs at last a five-course meal. One has to expect that there is a good chance the menu will be referred to a committee for amendment before the night is over. French champagne is what suffices. I might add that one needs a better and more persuasive line of patter than: `Have you been here very often?'. And again I might add that one stands a very good chance, despite all of that, at the end of the evening, of ending up stuck with the bill and one's conquest of the night disappearing with the head waiter. That is the reality of the Senate. It is something that members of the House of Representatives do not appreciate. In fact, that was principally responsible for the Minister's full and frank comments about the operations of the Committee. I do not place any greater weight on them than that. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in the last 48 hours the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has made a number of statements with which I do concur. The statements in fact have been touched upon already by the chairman of this Committee, Senator McMullan. When the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs said on the Face to Face program on Sunday and, I understand, again in an interview this morning, perhaps even on the AM program, that, having studied the report, if in his view the amendments that have been canvassed by this Committee are of such substance that they require further input from the Aboriginal community-I might add it is a form of operations that this Minister has exercised far more extensively than any other Minister, in my opinion-he will take these recommendations which most directly affect the Aboriginal community back to the Aboriginal community without simply unilaterally making a decision on them himself. That is a course of action which I support. </PARA>
<PARA> I would therefore, without detaining the Senate for too long, wish to restrict the remainder of my remarks to two issues. The first instance relates to the vexed question of the sacking of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) commissioners, which caused me some personal pain as a number of them had been appointed on my recommendation. Secondly, I wish to canvass those particular recommendations which this Committee has made in conclusion that fall into that category of recommendations that would be of considerable significance to the Aboriginal communities that they may wish to have some input on. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as the sacking of the ADC commissioners is concerned, I can do no more than suggest and recommend to members of this chamber that they read page 93 of the report where we canvassed that issue. We said on page 95 of that report, in paragraph 5.17:</PARA>
<PARA>The position of the ADC, its extensive powers and quasi-representative role are essential background to an understanding of the dispute with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>That is correct because there is and always was an inherent conflict between the two roles of the ADC which I believe brought about this dispute. That is canvassed at page 93 of the report, where we say:</PARA>
<PARA>However, the ethos of self-management and self-determination which had developed with the ADC's experience, and was heightened after the Report of the House of Representatives Expenditure Committee in 1985, did not sit easily with the legislative reality of its position. </PARA>
<PARA>We go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>On the one hand the ADC is a quasi-representative Aboriginal body established in acknowledgment of and partial compensation for the injustices inflicted on that community. Its guiding principles are self-management and self-sufficiency of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We then go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>On the other hand are the familiar structures of Ministerial control and direction, and Parliamentary accountability appropriate to any Commonwealth agency administering Government policy and managing public revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>We then go on to quote from the speech of the honourable senator who introduced that legislation into this Parliament, Senator Neville Bonner. In direct response to representations from the National Aboriginal Conference that the ADC should not be accountable in this way, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government believes that the Minister cannot meet his responsibilities as required by the Administrative Arrangements Order . . . without a power of general direction. </PARA>
<PARA>I concur with that opinion of the then Senator Bonner. With the best will in the world, I do not believe one can provide to any statutory body a sum of public money that could be in the vicinity of $600m a year without being able in the ultimate to have a Minister responsible in the elected body, the Federal Parliament. This is simply not on, in my view. I might add that that is precisely the conclusion that the majority report comes to. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is necessary to understand that there is that conflict in the two roles of the ADC, that is, the balance between responding on the one hand to the Aboriginal community of Australia and, on the other hand, accepting the ultimate veto and responsibility of the Federal Parliament which is properly exercised. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the recommendations themselves-as I said before, I will simply touch on those ones which in my view will be of some significance to the Aboriginal community-the obvious one that others will probably seize upon is recommendation 20 which says:</PARA>
<PARA>The preamble in its present form be put to the Parliament as a separate and simultaneous resolution with the ATSIC Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the preamble to the legislation should be removed from the Bill and passed as a separate resolution. The Committee had quite a number of representations on this question of the preamble from non-Aboriginal groups and from the Northern Territory Government, for example, which gave us the benefit of its quite extensive advice on this issue. I must say that I was not personally persuaded by many of those representations which feared that the preamble would be read in some way as affecting the interpretation of the Bill in such a way that legal status that was not intended would be given. I do not believe that that was the case. Nevertheless, I accept the validity of the advice we received. </PARA>
<PARA> However, on the other hand, we also received representations from the Aboriginal community, some of whom did not want the preamble to be put in the Bill simply because of that same non-legal force. They put to us that they were fearful that the preamble could be seen as some second class substitute for the compact that has been announced by the Government between Aboriginal Australians and the Federal Government and that it could be seen in some way as derogating from that. That was a submission which did have some weight with me. </PARA>
<PARA> In the final event the Committee decided-I think rightly-that to satisfy both sides of the argument, to remove any doubt that could have been there and to accommodate the fears that some Aboriginal people expressed by way of the handling of it, it should recommend in the report that the preamble be removed from the legislation itself and passed simultaneously with the passage of the ATSIC legislation as a separate resolution of the Parliament. Obviously, that is a recommendation of some weight. Clearly, Aboriginal people will want to have some input into it. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation No. 1 of the Committee is that a separate office of Aboriginal Affairs be retained within the Employment, Education and Training portfolio, again a matter of some significance to the Aboriginal community. The Committee received representations from Aboriginal people that no separate office of Aboriginal Affairs be retained and that ATSIC should be the sole source of policy advice to the Minister. Clearly, the Aboriginal people who expressed those views to us will not be happy about this particular recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation No. 2 was also canvassed at some length by Senator Coulter. It is one of substance and weight. The recommendation is that a greater proportion of the current activities of the Aboriginal Development Commission should be the responsibility of the proposed AEDC that is envisaged in the Bill. I refer briefly to the section of the report that deals with that because it is an important recommendation. Currently, the legislation proposes that both ATSIC itself and the AEDC have concurrent financial responsibility for funding Aboriginal enterprise. It is not entirely clear where ATSIC leaves off and the AEDC takes over, although the implications is that ATSIC will handle matters of a smaller community based nature, whereas the AEDC will handle the larger investment matters. However, the distinction is not clear. We think that the recommendation has much merit. Simply to transfer more functions is not sufficient. I can do no better than to quote from paragraph 2.36 on page 20 of our report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>A more appropriate division would involve:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) abolition of the ADC;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) transfer all its housing functions to ATSIC; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) responsibility for enterprise development, enterprise support, land acquisition and investment functions currently proposed for ATSIC in the Bill to be transferred to the AEDC. The AEDC's charter should be amended to make explicit the retention of the link between the investment and enterprise functions. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it is recommended that all financial enterprise involvement, with the sole exception of housing which, of course, is a general welfare type provision and therefore a sensible exception, should be transferred to the AEDC. Again, that is a recommendation of some substance on which the Aboriginal community would want to be consulted. The third recommendation is also one of substance. It is that the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies should, in effect, continue to exist as an autonomous and independent body independent of ATSIC. However, ATSIC commissioners would serve on its board. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation No. 10 refers to consultation in respect of regional boundaries. The majority report has come to a sensible conclusion on regional boundaries. They are a vexed question. I have received many representations from Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory who have provided very valid reasons for their unhappiness with the current boundaries. I give the Senate one brief illustration. It is not simply a matter of cultural objection to some of the boundaries. In some cases, there is a very sensible administrative objection to the current boundaries. One such example, which we used in the report, is that of the community of Ngukurr on the Gulf. Ngukurr acts as a resource centre for many outstations in the area. Those outstations rely on Ngukurr financially and for their logistic support. However, Ngukurr is in one region of ATSIC and the outstations are in another. Under the proposed boundaries, the outstations will rely for their funding on a regional council which has nothing whatever to do with them. There is a clear case there for a change to the boundaries. The recommendation that ATSIC itself be responsible for these necessary amendments is a sensible and reasonable one. </PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal people may also wish to be consulted on recommendation No. 11. The Committee recommends that regions with populations of fewer than 1,000 will elect 10 councillors and so on, on a sliding scale. It is a sensible recommendation. It is perfectly true that regional councils do not have a problem with malapportionment in respect of their regions, but there is a problem in respect of the role they play collegiately in electing zone commissioners. To some extent, this would overcome the problem. Recommendation No. 12 proposed voluntary enrolment and compulsory voting, which is precisely the situation that existed in the Northern Territory in relation to general elections for Aboriginal people for many years until both enrolment and voting became compulsory. Again, Aboriginal people may wish to be consulted on that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation No. 14 is an important one in that it suggests that the ATSIC Bill should be amended to allow regions to establish their own systems of elections. The Tiwi people on Bathurst and Melville Islands are particularly keen on this recommendation as it is something they want to do. The Minister, to his credit, made three separate visits to address members of the Tiwi Land Council and is well aware of that. Recommendation No. 17, to remove the requirement that the Minister must transfer any increase in the Torres Strait regional allocation from the other regional allocations, is an important recommendation and one in which Aboriginal people might wish to be involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already covered recommendation No. 20 that the preamble be removed from the legislation and be moved as a separate motion. It is a recommendation of some substance. Should the Minister determine, as he flagged yesterday and again today, that these recommendations are not recommendations on which he can properly make decisions unilaterally but in consultation with the community, I indicate, as did Senator McMullan, that I concur with that situation. I conclude by saying that it is important that the basic principles of ATSIC be adhered to and continued with. Some elements of the conservative parties in this Parliament and other parliaments simply want to see the demolition of ATSIC and the replacement of it with nothing whatever. That is not a motive I ascribe to many people on the Opposition benches because I know that would be a totally unfair criticism, but certainly some members opposite wish to see that happen. I reject that approach utterly and comprehensively. I hope that the Minister will carefully consider the recommendations in this report; I know he will. I assure the Senate that the Committee has laboured over the report with a great deal of application and care, as it is a controversial subject. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If ever the Aboriginal people looked to the Parliament for fair play and protection, it was in the matter of the proposed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, that creature we know by the acronym of ATSIC. If ever a group was betrayed, it was the Aboriginal people with the majority report of the Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. The majority report is a disaster. Faced with a mass of evidence, that report finds not as the evidence demands so clearly, but in a party political way for the Government and in spite of the evidence. Faced with significant questions and doubts about the whole concept of ATSIC, the majority report chooses to give only an historical account of the process by which ATSIC was developed and chooses to say little at all about the threshold issues which are critical to any proper assessment of this radical and complex proposal. The majority report makes no attempt to justify ATSIC, to make a case for it. It presents no case to show why the Government proposal for ATSIC would be in any way superior to the proposal of the former Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) for portfolio restructuring. We do not favour a vacuum. The alternative proposal for portfolio restructuring was a serious one which was not given due consideration. The examination of that argument and the only logical conclusions were left to the minority report and to coalition senators. Faced with allegations of intimidation, coercion, standover tactics, the offering of inducements in the ATSIC process, as we were, the majority report chooses to make only the most minimal of findings to send the allegations off to Mr Andrew Menzies, to see as little as possible, to say as little as possible, to recommend the absolute minimum of action and to fail to offer other logical and necessary recommendations. Yet just this day we had tabled here a statutory declaration from Mr Merv Gibson of Hopevale in which he states on oath that funding for the infrastructure project at Hopevale would have to be reconsidered if he and the Aboriginal coordinating council continued to oppose ATSIC. He says in his statutory declaration that that threat was made by Mr Gayler, the local Labor member of parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Further, faced with the quite disgraceful treatment of eight former acting commissioners of the Aboriginal Development Commission, including the deliberate circulation of untrue and vindictive allegations about the ADC, of which they were then commissioners, the majority report chooses to make only the most minor recommendations. It does not even call on the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) to acknowledge publicly that the stories in the newspapers about financial mismanagement are untruthful and damaging. It does not even go that far. That was left to the minority report. The majority report, in short, is a tribute to the discipline and the priorities of the Australian Labor Party. It is predicated on the needs and priorities of the Labor Party, not on the interests of Aboriginal people or of Aboriginal Australia. For that reason, it is a betrayal of Aboriginal Australia and of the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence before the Select Committee reveals a mess the like of which I have never seen in 15 years in this place. The Department that has emerged before this Select Committee is not the Department I knew in the 1970s, or when I was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in the early years of this decade. The report of the majority details some of the evidence but does not then proceed to the obvious conclusions to which that evidence should have led. For instance, the evidence is eloquent about the failure of Mr Hand to consult adequately, or thoroughly, or as he had promised, or with all those who would be affected by the legislation now before the Senate. He simply did not bother to consult with State governments in the development and promotion of the proposal. He did not bother to consult with mining interests. He did not bother to consult with local government. He did not bother to consult with farming interests. Unless he had been seeking some confrontation deliberately or had considered these interests to be unimportant or irrelevant, such a failure to consult makes no sense and is the one sure way to guarantee that he will meet opposition later from the groups he so assiduously ignored. It was left to the minority report to draw the logical conclusions and to make the logical and necessary recommendations in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that this Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs was proposed, on a motion by Senator Tambling, after an enormous amount of work done by him and by Senator Short, which culminated in the estimates committee hearings and in the revelations which emerged before Senate Estimates Committee E, I think it was, in late 1988. The committee process was long and difficult but it was courteous, and consultation within the Committee was detailed. It was a difficult process for the Committee secretariat, which performed its tasks with diligence and distinction. There was agreement on many matters of drafting, on what was said, on what occurred, on what was written in documents and, finally, on some of the minor conclusions. The disagreements arose when the Committee came to consider what the evidence told us on major matters, or what the evidence told us on any matter that involved any criticism of the Minister. I have to say the Labor senators were determined to allow no hint of criticism of the Minister of any kind to appear in the agreed report. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney has a story about his first select committee in 1975, when he was advised by former senator Sir Reginald Wright to `let the evidence lead you on'. That is what should have happened here: the evidence should have led us on. The evidence was overwhelming in what it revealed. We have set out some of the obvious conclusions in our minority report and we will, I hope, pursue those conclusions here in the Senate at an appropriate time if that is necessary. There is no point in seeking to get amendments, as Senator Coulter would do, after the Bill becomes an Act. Does anyone really think Mr Hand will welcome amendments then? The only time to fix the Bill, if the Government is determined to proceed, is now, before it becomes an Act of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider first the threshold question of the justification of ATSIC. One would imagine that a prudent or sensitive government seeking to overturn all the existing arrangements for administering Aboriginal affairs in Australia would have made a strong, cast-iron case over a period of time for that course of action. One would also have thought that it would have made that case known to the Australian public. The Labor Government has not done so. The course is being followed, it seems, out of prime ministerial ignorance and ministerial prejudice. But honourable senators will realise immediately that neither of those elements, of themselves, can justify ATSIC. Neither relates in any way at all to the well-being or the advancement of Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is proposing that all existing arrangements should be ended arbitrarily; that existing arrangements with the States should be terminated unilaterally; that the successful Aboriginal Development Commission should be subsumed into an untried and uncertain new body; that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs should be made over into the new body; that the Institute of Aboriginal Studies and Aboriginal Hostels Limited should also be included. Such radical rearrangement should be justified by careful and adequate argument, but this proposal is not and never has been so justified. Accordingly, at the threshold, we can say that the proposal should not proceed. It should not proceed now and it should not be brought back until a case has been made and defended adequately in open public debate. </PARA>
<PARA> What is proposed by Labor is a white man's structure, democratic in white man's terms, but irrelevant to traditional Aboriginal culture or practice. Pastor Paul Albrecht, a distinguished observer whose whole life has been spent with and for Aboriginals, had this to say last year, talking about elected organisations:</PARA>
<PARA>These organisations, far from helping Aborigines manage their own affairs, are in fact destructive of what is left of the Aboriginal culture and social organisation because they not only ignore but actively denigrade existing Aboriginal leadership responsibilities and structures. </PARA>
<PARA> A second negative effect of this approach to dialogue and self-management is that none of the Aboriginal organisations is accountable to the people they are meant to represent. They are solely funded by government . . . they are elected and operate on non-traditional lines . . . The only claim to Aboriginality they have is that they employ some people of Aboriginal descent.</PARA>
<PARA>Pastor Albrecht's view is not based on some theory or ideology. He knows, from a lifetime in the field, what he is talking about. But ATSIC proposes the very course that he has criticised. </PARA>
<PARA> Is this what the Government is seeking to do-to destroy what is left of traditional Aboriginal culture and structures? Is this how the Government sees the way to achieving what it wants to achieve? Let me make it quite clear that the responsibility of justifying the Government's course rests with the Government. The pressure for this foolish proposal has come from radical elements in both the white and black communities whose goals relate primarily to the acquisition and use of power. The failure of the Government to make and to sustain its arguments for ATSIC is a fatal flaw in the proposal. For that reason alone, if for no other, the proposal should not proceed. To be in favour of Aboriginal advancement, of greater opportunity, of betterment, of better outcomes, of reduction of disadvantage, does not logically lead to or require any honourable senator here to support ATSIC. To be opposed to the ATSIC proposal does not mean, and should not be so presented, as being against the best interests and the future of Aboriginals. Whether or not the creation of an elected Aboriginal representative body controlling all resources is a good thing, whether or not it will fit better with white perceptions of how things should be done, does not of itself, in any way, promise any benefit to any needy Aboriginal or Islander. These people are, far too often, under educated, unemployed, alienated, deprived, dispossessed and without hope. Any restructuring which fails to deliver better outcomes for these people, the most disadvantaged in Australia, is a restructuring which is not worth pursuing. Labor senators should address this question. They should satisfy themselves before they proceed further that there will be real benefits for all, not just for those who enjoy the ear of the Minister or who might enjoy the spoils of the ATSIC structure. If they cannot see those benefits-and may I say that it is better outcomes that we are seeking, they are the benefits I am talking about and they are the benefits which I believe Senator Coulter is seeking on behalf of the Australian Democrats-then they should withdraw this proposal at least until this most simple and vital threshold question is answered. </PARA>
<PARA> In his important newspaper article on ATSIC on 17 December 1988 Paul Kelly quotes a Labor parliamentarian as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>ATSIC will be either a disaster or a fraud. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to explain:</PARA>
<PARA>A disaster if the Act works as intended and the Minister lets the councils and Commission exercise their powers; a fraud if the Minister violates the spirit of the Act and relies upon its letter, thereby using his power to direct on a routine basis. </PARA>
<PARA>Not only has the Government failed to justify ATSIC, but it has also done something else-this is the second main objection: it has failed to honour one of the few commitments made by Mr Hand on behalf of the Government; that was the commitment to adequate consultations. Oh yes, I know that consultation has been intense; I know that it has been extensive. That does not mean that it was effective and that does not mean that it was adequate. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence before the Committee makes clear that the consultation process was not adequate. Aboriginal community after Aboriginal community, Islander community representatives, and individual people all came to give evidence before us and they told us that the consultations promised had not been carried out, specifically the second round of consultations on the Bill and its details. What they asserted specifically was that there had been some initial consultation, as a result of which agreement for the proposal in principle had been gained. Agreement for an elected representative body was what they had in principle at those early meetings. But it is equally clear from the evidence that they had been promised further consultation on the details of the proposal once those details were available; that had been promised at meeting after meeting. Honourable senators should go to the majority report. We have quotes from the decisions of the meetings. Remember that when the consultations were held there was no Bill for them to see and the Bill now before us is a massive instrument of 103 pages. Further consultations clearly did not occur. They did not occur as promised, or as widely as promised, and, in most circumstances, they did not occur at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Among the roles we discharge here, there is the role of trustees of the public interest, in the honouring of which we might have to take the part of the weak against the strong, of communities against government, of the wronged against what Shakespeare called `the calumny of power'. The failure of the Minister to consult Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities about the details of the legislation, as he had promised he would, creates one of those occasions when the Senate should exercise its trustee function. Even if the Senate were disposed to proceed with the ATSIC proposal in some form, our trustee role, in the light of the mass of evidence given to the Senate Select Committee, requires that we not allow that legislation to proceed until the process of consultation has been carried out adequately and in the detail promised. After all, that would require only a few more months, and what are a few months when we are considering a proposal to alter beyond recognition the administration of Aboriginal affairs in Australia and probably to alter it for a long time? This is not a demand that every Aboriginal and every Torres Strait Islander understand every word of every clause of the Bill. That has never been the demand and it will not assist the debate if any honourable senator so seeks to present our call for fair and adequate consultation. But we all know that Aboriginal people have been sold short by the Minister, the Hon. Gerry Hand, on this matter of consultation which he promised them. He promised it publicly and promised it at meeting after meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> The minority report is derived from the evidence. It can be understood by reading the evidence. It flows from the evidence, and its conclusions, especially in relation to the unredeemed promise of further consultation, its conclusions about the disgraceful treatment of dismissed acting commissioners, its conclusions about the failure to deal fairly, if at all, with the alternative proposal of the ADC and its conclusions about the failure to make a case for ATSIC-all these flow from the evidence we received. The minority report draws together, in a coherent totality, what the report of the majority failed to do. The conclusions reached in the minority report were the obvious conclusions that should have been reached unanimously and quickly by the whole Committee. I commend those conclusions to the Senate and to the country. As far as we are concerned, the ATSIC proposal as it is presented in the Bill on our Notice Paper is unsafe, unnecessary, unjustified by evidence or logic, dangerous, unlikely to work, unable to be implemented without extensive amendment, unfair to many people and, above all, contains no real expectation that Aboriginal and Islander people will be better off if it becomes law. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of such findings, we can only hope that the Government will think again before it asks the Senate to debate and determine the matter. I say to the Minister, `You have the numbers but you haven't got the right of the argument and you will be very unwise to press ahead'. I say to the Senate that fairness, history, and the hopes of a quarter million disadvantaged Australians demand no less than that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support what my colleagues have said but I would like to express my views of what I have seen and what we have heard from many people who have given evidence. On 1 June last year the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs was established. I believe that it was established by the Opposition-unfortunately with the support of the Australian Democrats-in the hope that it would kill off the Government's proposed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). Setting up such a committee meant inevitable delays for the Government. Members of the Opposition did not come into this chamber and state their position. They did not come in here and say, `We don't like the ATSIC proposal and these are our reasons'. They did not come in here and say, `Let's debate the legislation and we will make the reasons for our opposition known'. No; instead they said, `Let's set up a Senate committee and in six months time we will let you know what we think'.

The report is based on allegations and rumour and makes much of evidence that was never able to be substantiated. Opposition senators call them serious allegations but they fail to provide anything concrete to back up their assertions. It is just another example of running with the allegations. It does not matter if they are true or not; it does not matter whose reputations they harm; one thing is for sure-they will give a good headline. And is that not what the Opposition is after these days anyway?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Peter Baume's contribution to this report is most disappointing. It is surprising that someone with his reputation has allowed himself to be part of the Opposition's political campaign against the Aboriginal people. I would like to know what Senator Baume thinks should be the future for Aboriginal affairs administration in this country. His own Party wants to wash its hands of Aboriginal affairs at Commonwealth level. Is that the alternative to the current system, or does the Opposition have a set of options? Perhaps Senator Baume might like to tell us about them today. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition places a great deal of emphasis on consultation. So does the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand). He has spent more time on the ground than any other Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, talking to people and listening to their views. I would suggest that his consultation process on ATSIC was more extensive than any consultation ever undertaken on any piece of legislation, including the Aboriginal Development Commission Act set in place by the Fraser Government. But, of course, that is not good enough. </PARA>

<PARA> As a member of this Committee I must first acknowledge that the Committee's consultations were not in any way as extensive as those undertaken by the Minister. I must also acknowledge that there is a tendency with committees such as this for people who have complaints to come forward rather than those who are happy with what is proposed. I do not think this Committee is any exception. </PARA>
<PARA> There were many parts of the country that we did not visit. We did not travel to Western Australia, the State with the second largest Aboriginal population; nor did we go to New South Wales, Victoria or Tasmania. We must, therefore, accept that there are gaps in the evidence that we have taken and that the evidence of particular individuals does not accurately reflect the majority of views of the Aboriginal community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has made much of allegations of coercion and the offering of enticements. As a member of the Committee, I reject those allegations. Witnesses appearing before the Committee were unable to provide any concrete evidence whatsoever. As a member of the Committee, I hope that all members of the Senate take note of that, especially given the public attention which no doubt will be focused on this institution and the role it performs. Quite clearly, the majority report supports ATSIC. We believe that it is a major step towards Aboriginal and Islander self-determination. It is the only way that governments can proceed and, no matter what sorts of delays are imposed on governments, the demand for change from Aboriginal people will not go away. It is not an issue which can be swept under the carpet or dismissed in a haze of anti-black headlines. </PARA>
<PARA> There is overwhelming support for ATSIC, in principle, amongst Aboriginal people. The total rejection of ATSIC by the Opposition is an indication that it does not want to hear what the Aboriginal people are saying to all of us. Members of the Opposition cannot come into this chamber and say honestly that Aboriginal people do not want the sorts of changes that ATSIC embodies.

<PARA> That the following matters be referred to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry and report on or before the last sitting day of the penultimate week of the 1989 autumn sitting of the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the adequacy and appropriateness of section 72 (ii) of the Constitution as the only basis on which judges can be removed from office;</PARA>

<PARA> (e) whether any charge of misbehaviour or incapacity within the meaning of the Act has been made against Mr Justice Staples, a deputy president of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and if such a charge would be made out to the satisfaction of the Committee;</PARA>
<PARA> (f) the compatibility of the Government's method of removing Mr Justice Staples from office with the existing mechanisms for removing judges from office and with any alternative mechanisms which the committee might propose; and</PARA>
<PARA> (g) whether any action should be taken to appoint Mr Justice Staples to a position on the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>The motion that the Australian Democrats gave notice of this morning came at the end-and very nearly at the bitter end-of a very long and protracted wrangle about two important issues: one about the treatment of Mr Justice Staples and the other the associated principle of the independence of the judiciary. A large number of people in the community perceive the treatment that Mr Justice Staples has received at the hands of successive governments as being no more nor less than a breach of the British tradition that Australia inherited where the judiciary was held to be totally independent from the Crown, totally independent and free from interference by the government of the day. That tradition is well entrenched and very valued. There are certainly other countries that deal with judges in quite a different and much less democratic way than Australia has in the past, until this unsavoury incident occurred to tarnish that record. In other countries judges are murdered if their decisions go against the wishes of the reigning government. That has been true, for example, in Pakistan under the rule of the late President Zia; it has been true in the Philippines and in a number of other countries whose commitment to democratic government and the freedom and independence of the judiciary is non-existent in some cases, and certainly not as established as it is within the traditions of the British system. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the history of the treatment of Mr Justice Staples is well enough known, but I think it is also worth quickly running through some of the things that have occurred. Let us face it, Mr Justice Staples has made a few statements and come down with the occasional judgment in the past 10 years or so that have met with some displeasure on the part of governments, the business community, the unions and others who are involved in the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and the conciliation and arbitration system that we have in this country. At this stage no suggestion of misconduct or misbehaviour or incompetence has been made with regard to Mr Justice Staples, so as a consequence of his somewhat maverick comments over the years, and for no other reason, he was given only Full Bench work and then for the past three years, no work at all. Now, this has meant that no use has been made of a capable judge and of a judge willing to work. He must be a capable judge or the government of the day would have made allegations to the contrary. He must be a capable judge or he would not have been put there in the first place. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Button can speak for himself and leave my supporters to make their own decision. The fact of the matter is that Mr Justice Staples, like other judges, was appointed to this position, presumably because he was considered capable at the time. The fact that he occasionally bucked the system seems to have offended some people mightily and because at that stage nobody could see any way of getting rid of this troublesome judge, they simply gave him no work to do. Then the Government hit upon an expedient which has meant that Mr Justice Staples can be removed absolutely. The history of this man has now culminated in his removal from his position by the device-and it is a device-of getting rid of the old Commission, establishing the Industrial Relations Commission and failing to appoint of all the judges who were on the old Commission, only Mr Justice Staples.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This went without a great deal of clamour from the legal profession, from the ranks of the judiciary until quite recently when we have seen a flood of objections stemming from academics and from those members of the judiciary and the legal profession whose concerns are centred not only on the treatment of Mr Justice Staples but also on the question of the independence of the judiciary because that is the fundamental point at issue here. Disgraceful though the treatment of Mr Justice Staples is, I suggest the real issue is the setting of a very dangerous precedent indeed, and the threat to the independence of the judiciary that comes in the setting of that precedent. Removing Mr Justice Staples by this expedient has threatened a great deal more than his career. It has placed in some jeopardy, in some question and in some confusion the position of judges elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us remember that section 72 (ii) of the Constitution makes it perfectly clear that the only way a judge of the High Court or any other court established by the Federal Parliament can be removed is on an address from both Houses of Parliament which alleges misconduct or misbehaviour or some other form of incapacity. If that is not enough then the relevant sections of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act put into place a very similar requirement. The Act provides that a member of the Commission can only be removed on an address praying for his removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity being presented to the Governor-General by each House of the Parliament. I do not think anything could be clearer than that, more precise or more ignored by this and previous governments. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts are that Mr Justice Staples, as a deputy president of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, had the same rank, status, precedence and title as a judge of the Federal Court of Australia. Recently we have heard arguments about whether a commission is the same as a court, whether a judge on a commission has the same rank as a judge anywhere else, and whether, indeed, he is a judge at all. To his eternal credit, the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button), who is in the chamber, stated quite clearly, in answer to a question from me in November last year, that Mr Justice Staples was indeed a judge. However, some people have attempted to muddy those waters. I would suggest that we apply the duck principle here: if it looks like a duck and sounds like a duck, then it is duck. I suggest that Mr Justice Staples, by nature of his title, is indeed a judge and is entitled to the protection not only of the Constitution in so far as it affects him but also more particularly, of those sections of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act that deal with the removal of a judge. </PARA>
<PARA> Since those two areas-that is, section 72 (ii) of the Constitution and the relevant sections in the old Act-are pretty much equivalent in that they relate to misbehaviour or incapacity proved and accepted by both Houses of Parliament, I suggest that it does not matter at all whether Mr Justice Staples is a judge as far as the Constitution is concerned or only as far as the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is concerned. He is nevertheless a judge with all the status and precedence and rights of a judge, and deserves to be treated as such. Part of that treatment would involve being removed only on the conditions laid down either in section 72 (ii) or in the relevant areas of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. </PARA>
<PARA> That did not happen. To the best of my knowledge, Mr Justice Staples's behaviour has been as impeccable as that of any other judge. He has not been found incapable of hearing cases either on the Full Bench or individually. He has not been charged with anything. No allegations have been made about him.The only problem with Mr Justice Staples is that he is a nuisance, a maverick, a man who does not toe the line, a man who challenges that nice club-like atmosphere we have seen develop in the last 80-odd years within the ranks of the conciliation and arbitration system-a club-like atmosphere in which the business community, the unions, the Government and anybody else cooperate, shall we say, in a little charade. Mr Justice Staples bucked that system. He challenged the system. Occasionally he argued against the system and he got up everybody's nose in the process. So, confronted with what it regarded as an inconvenient person to have on the Bench-that is, somebody who upsets the applecart and irritates people-the Government just chose to ignore the accepted processes and sought to have Mr Justice Staples removed by other means. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this sort of government interference, whether it is done by sleight of hand, as has happened here, or at the point of a gun, as happens in other countries, is intolerable. The present community outcry, late in coming as it has been, indicates that I am not alone in this belief. The Australian section of the International Commission of Jurists spoke out last week in a very long news release on this matter. It said that the Government's treatment of Mr Justice Staples was a dangerous threat to the independence of the judiciary. That is not a group of people to be taken lightly. The news release reported the Secretary-General of the Australian section, Mr David Bitel, as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the treatment of Justice Staples since 1980 raised three fundamental questions about judicial independence. </PARA>
<PARA> The bypassing of proper legal procedures to remove a member of a court or tribunal by the expedient of establishing a new tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>I might ask at this point: If the Government gets away with it here, what else will it restructure in order to get rid of minor irritants of this sort? It continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The misuse of the discretion to allot work to a member of a court or tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The denial of natural justice by the refusal to give any explanation or reasons or to give the person affected an opportunity to answer the allegations against him. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the purposes of the Democrats' motion to refer this whole unsavoury affair to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs was to give Mr Justice Staples and his detractors an opportunity to put their respective cases in public, in full, and with the Parliament-or at least the Senate-being an adjudicator. At the very least there would have been an opportunity for a man who has been grossly mistreated to put his case and to get some sort of judgment, redress and justice. </PARA>
<PARA> The Secretary-General of the Australian Section of the International Commission of Jurists went on to point out that, in fact, the Government has breached the relevant sections of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in treating Mr Justice Staples in this way. The news release pointed out that all of this was contrary to a strong legal tradition and convention that when one new court is created in place of another the status and tenure of the members of the old court are respected. They were in every case except that of Mr Justice Staples. I do not think that the Parliament of this country, bound up as it is in the Westminster tradition and the tradition of a truly independent judiciary, should sit back and do nothing about this. A letter to the editor from a number of signatories from the Faculty of Law at the University of New South Wales took up the same issue. The opening paragraphs of the letter state:</PARA>
<PARA> The measures adopted by the federal government in removing Mr Justice Staples through a reconstitution of its industrial tribunals deserves censure. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not an esoteric wrangle of interest only to lawyers debating the finer points of constitutional law. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Justice Staples was appointed to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, a statutory tribunal, with a statutory tenure which provided for removal only following an address of both Houses of Parliament on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. </PARA>
<PARA>Over the last few months the Opposition has got itself worked up into a right knot over the behaviour of a Minister in this Government, censuring him for all sorts of things, attacking him for a variety of other things, condemning him for still more things; yet it is prepared to sit back and watch the government of the day continue what the Opposition started itself and that is a gross piece of injustice towards a single individual who has no recourse to any other tribunal than the Parliament of this country. The Opposition has indicated that it will not support our proposed reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Yet all we are asking in this reference is that that Committee, the most appropriate body the Senate has, look at the adequacy and the appropriateness of section 72 (ii) of the Constitution with regard to Mr Justice Staples's position. We ask that it look at the adequacy and appropriateness of the matching provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which deal, as I and more learned people than I have pointed out, with the removal from office of presidential members of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> We have asked that the Committee look at the need for and the type of alternative mechanisms for the removal of judges from office, with paramount regard being paid to the need to protect the independence of the judiciary, the rule of law and the role of Parliament in the process. This also involves looking at the workability and effectiveness of courts and the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, or the new Industrial Relations Commission that comes into effect at one minute past midnight tonight, being responsible for the arrangement of their business, with particular regard to the utilisation of all judges on those courts and the role of Parliament, if any, in that arrangement. We went on to ask that Committee to look into whether any charge of misbehaviour or incapacity within the meaning of the Act has been made against Mr Justice Staples, even though we know that the answer is no. We finished with a recommendation that any action that should be taken with regard to Mr Justice Staples be held in abeyance until the Committee had looked at whether he should be appointed to a position on the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Those terms of reference sent to that Committee would have gone a long way indeed to determine whether natural justice had been denied Mr Justice Staples. We know that no charge of misbehaviour or incapacity has been made against Mr Justice Staples. We have Senator Button's authority for the fact that Mr Justice Staples is in fact a judge. We have the condition specifically laid down in the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission with regard to the technique needed to remove a member of that Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Most importantly we have to look at the whole question of whether and how a government can interfere with the judiciary-something which most Australians, and I would have thought most members of this chamber, would have regarded as intolerable in any circumstances unless some charge laid had been proved. None of that has happened. Not only has no charge been laid or proven, but disappointingly very few members of this place appear to be at all concerned either about Mr Justice Staples and what has been done to him or, much more importantly than what happens to any single individual in this community, what is being done to the independence of the judiciary. </PARA>
<PARA> Although it was surprising that it took so long for individuals and groups in the legal profession to speak out, it is not surprising that they have finally done so. What has happened cannot be ignored. Judges of the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, the Australian section of the International Commission of Jurists, the New South Wales Law Society, the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties, 10 judges of the New South Wales District Court, at least one member of the Commission in South Australia, and much earlier, to her eternal credit, Mary Gaudron, have all protested at Mr Justice Staples's treatment and the attack on the independence of the judiciary that is inherent in the treatment of Justice Staples by successive governments. Clearly, an inquiry is imperative but, more importantly, any inquiry that is held has to address the real issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead, we are confronted with a situation that can only be described as collusion between the Opposition and the Government, culminating in a wimpish cop-out, a motion which was foreshadowed by the Opposition early this afternoon and which, after it has finished opposing our motion, it intends to proceed with, with the full support, I understand, of the Government. The Opposition's motion calls for an inquiry, but it is merely a dumping of Mr Justice Staples, and in doing so is a complete rejection of any commitment the Opposition ever had to the principles of natural justice, to say nothing of the independence of the judiciary. But this inquiry with which the Opposition wishes to proceed is only into the principles governing the security of tenure of office of quasi-judicial officials. </PARA>
<PARA> This afternoon Senator Hill moved for an inquiry that would look into and report on the principles that should govern-not even necessarily would govern, but simply should govern-the tenure of office of quasi-judicial and other appointees to Commonwealth tribunals, and in particular whether the provisions of section 24 and 28 of the Industrial Relations Act provide proper and adequate provision for the tenure of office of presidential members and commissioners of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Well, what a big deal! None of that will help Jim Staples. None of that is even necessary. There are provisions in existing legislation and a quite clear statement of principle in our Constitution. The committee that Senator Hill would like to set up will establish nothing except the spinelessness of both the Government and the Opposition-an unpreparedness to look at what they have done not only to an individual judge, but to the whole principle of judicial independence. It is, as I have said, a cop-out, and I would have expected more of the Opposition in this case, given the fact that although Opposition members started this exercise they have not been the ones to finish it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's so-called inquiry into the principles governing the security of tenure of office will lead to nothing. Both parties are aware of that. Any body with any sense is aware of the fact that it will achieve nothing, couched as it is in such vague terms as `should', `maybe' and `perhaps'. It is a pointless exercise that will eventuate at the end of this evening. It is a refusal by the Opposition and the Government to have a real inquiry into the denial of natural justice to an individual and a threat to the independence of the judiciary, and its replacement, instead, with a pathetic excuse of a `maybe' inquiry into the tenure of office of quasi-judicial and other appointees to Commonwealth tribunals. </PARA>
<PARA> This has ducked the issue of how effective and appropriate and adequate the existing system is. It has by default argued and defined that judges on the new Industrial Relations Commission are quasi-judicial. This immediately removes them from any protection laid down in the Constitution, put there for High Court judges and other judges appointed to courts established by the Federal Parliament. It is a cynical exercise by both the major political parties in this place to avoid facing up to their responsibilities, and to avoid acknowledging that a grave injustice has been done to one individual in this country, and untold damage done to the judiciary as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> As a further cynical exercise, the proposal is that the Committee should report during the winter recess, thereby neatly cutting it off from any immediate investigation and debate by the rest of this Parliament. It is a cop-out. I suggest that Mr Justice Staples's growing army of supporters and those concerned with the independence of the judiciary, which, as I said at the beginning of my speech this evening is a vital element of our democratic society, will not be conned by this trick. Both the Government and the Opposition are going to be seen for what they are-powerful groups in the Parliament prepared to deny natural justice to an individual in an attempt to tamper with the independence of the judiciary. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no acknowledgment in the Opposition's motion that judges and those of equivalent status must be protected from government interference. There is no acknowledgment in the Opposition's motion that the whole basis of our three arms of government depends on this independence. It is, I suggest, the end of what has been a disgraceful episode in Australia's political and judicial history and does no credit to either the Government or the Opposition, because the repercussions of the damage that they are doing this evening to an independent judiciary will probably never be corrected. </PARA>

I said that confidence in the judicial system depends on its actual and perceived independence. The Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is not a court for the purposes of the Constitution. I say to Senator Haines and her Australian Democrat colleagues that the fact that somebody is entitled to call himself `Judge' or to be called `Mr Justice' because he has a law degree is not proof of the fact that he is a judge.

To come to the point of Senator Haines's motion, it assumes certain things which are quite wrong-such as that section 72 of the Constitution applies to the Conciliation Commission. It does not. The motion assumes that this question involves the removal of judges from office. It does not. It goes on to the general question of the workability and effectiveness of courts and the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The Liberals at least have a motion which entitles people to address the workability and effectiveness of the courts as questions of principle. It does not bundle the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in with the courts in the one hit, as Senator Haines's motion has done. Paragraph (e) of Senator Haines's motion-this is the really beaut stuff-talks about `whether any charge of misbehaviour or incapacity within the meaning of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act has been made against Mr Justice Staples'. Senator Haines wants that to be a matter of inquiry by a Senate committee and yet tonight she says that the answer to that question is no. She knows the answer before she has the inquiry. The purpose of having paragraph (e) in the terms of reference is to add a bit of emotive content to what is otherwise a bald and unconvincing narrative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Haines's motion goes on to talk about `the compatibility of the Government's method of removing Mr Justice Staples from office with the existing mechanisms for removing judges from office'. Last year this Senate passed legislation containing a clause which entitled the government of the day to remove a person from the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. This chamber debated the legislation for 21 hours. Forty amendments were moved. Was there one reference by Senator Haines to this clause affecting Mr Justice Staples being put in that legislation?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Haines talks about people slowly getting on the bandwagon. The people who slowly got on the bandwagon were people like Senator Haines. There were 40 hours of debate in the House of Representatives and 21 hours in here. Did Senator Haines say anything about Mr Justice Staples and the fact that the legislation provided a clause under which he could be removed? Everybody who knew anything about the legislation knew that. There was not a beep out of Senator Haines. It was not the Government that provided the method of removing Mr Justice Staples; it was the Parliament and Senator Haines was part of it. If Senator Haines was not part of it, she was negligent in her duty as a senator. Senator Haines has come in here tonight with this frothed up stuff and introduced emotive language about whether or not Mr Justice Staples was subject to a charge. Senator Haines knows perfectly well what the answer to that is. The Government cannot support this motion because, as I said, it is silly. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to get one or two other things on the record. Senator Haines talked about the treatment of Mr Justice Staples. I said that one is entitled to have quite personal views about the treatment of Mr Justice Staples over a long period. Before we go to that issue let us be clear about what happened when this industrial relations legislation was passed. I repeat-it was an Act of this Parliament which determined this issue and there was not a word about it out of the Democrats. When talking about the treatment of Mr Justice Staples the fact of the matter is, as Senator Haines would probably agree, that he has had little useful work to do for nearly 10 years. Only on occasions did he sit on a Full Bench between 1980 and 1986. Since 1986 he has been given no work at all. That was a matter for decision by the President of the Arbitration Commission. Two presidents, succeeding each other, Mr Justice Moore and Mr Justice Maddern, between them decided, in allocating work to the Bench, not to give work to Mr Justice Staples. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Haines might disagree with that decision; a lot of us might. Senator Haines might disagree with it because she might think that the President of the Arbitration Commission of the day did not give work to Mr Justice Staples for some sinister reason, such as him being a maverick as she said. But that is a fact. That first fact has nothing to do, if I might say so, with this Government being in office. The decision preceded this Government coming into office for many years. Governments of the day have no role whatever in the internal administration of the Arbitration Commission. The government of the day is responsible for payments of the judges. Mr Justice Staples was paid throughout his career by the government of the day. But he was not, in fact, allocated work by his boss, the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, and no government could interfere in that and no government did interfere. </PARA>
<PARA> Successive Presidents of the Commission have made these decisions. I have dealt with the assumption, of course, that Mr Justice Staples is a member of the judiciary. Let me make the point that, if one goes back over the history of the so-called treatment of Mr Justice Staples, he has been paid all the time. He has been paid close to $100,000 a year. He has not been allocated work as a result of the decision of the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission of the day whose function it is to determine whether a member of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is allocated to particular work. That is his responsibility as President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. It is not the responsibility or function of this Parliament, or any Senate committee appointed on the motion of Senator Haines, to determine whether a deputy president or a judge, so called, of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission should be given work. That would be real interference in the process which Senator Haines said in the course of her remarks that she objected to most strongly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's prime concern, of course, is to ensure that the industrial relations system operates as effectively as possible in this country. It is, as I said on 8 November, to ensure the independence of the judiciary; to ensure, as the Constitution provides, that the judiciary is protected in the way which section 72 provides for. But in terms of dealing with this question, the motion moved by Senator Haines does not give a sound basis for looking at some of the general issues associated with this problem; and it is a problem. I would like to think of him as my friend. Jim Staples is a vocal and noisy person. It is a problem in terms of the public arena. That is a fact of life. The motion which I understand is to be moved by Senator Hill comprehends a serious examination of some of the issues. But it is not debauched right from the beginning. It is not contaminated by all of the silly stuff which implies that Mr Justice Staples ought to be the subject of some charge or something like that-all of that silly stuff which is in the Democrats' motion. For that reason we cannot support Senator Haines's little effort tonight. We will, in fact, support the formation of a joint committee to look at this matter as contained in the Opposition's motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had not especially intended to take part in this debate tonight but I did hear a comment on radio that made me think I should. Having listened to the Democrats' reasons for the motion that they have put forward, I certainly wish to make a few remarks. Although Senator Button has just dealt with the matters I wish to refer to, I think they warrant repeating. Senator Button has referred to the length of time that the Industrial Relations Bill was debated in the Senate last August, and, I think, into September. He referred to the number of amendments that were moved. Most, if not all of them, were moved by Senator Chaney who had the conduct of this Bill for the Opposition. The debate went on for a particularly long time. We have had the Democrats tonight tell us that at last the legal profession and a whole lot of other bodies have sought to speak out on this matter. We have had a very self-righteous presentation of the Democrats' position in relation to Mr Justice Staples. We have been accused of a cop out in relation to the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say to the Democrats that if in fact they were serious about this, they had the opportunity to present a case to the Senate last August when the Bill was being debated. I cannot think of one of the amendments that we put that they were prepared to support seriously enough to hold up the Bill for matters they now say that they believe in. </PARA>
<PARA> Last August Mr Justice Staples did not matter in the slightest to the Democrats. They had the opportunity then to say to the Government, `We will not allow this Bill to go through; we will join with the Opposition and hold it up until you give us a unequivocal assurance as to the future of Mr Justice Staples'. But it did not matter that much last August when they had the opportunity to do something. Now they come into the Senate tonight and start accusing other people and carrying on. </PARA>
<PARA> There are times when I think one can only say it must be very easy to be a Democrat. Tonight has proved that point. They had the opportunity last August to nail their colours to the mast on this matter and actually to do something to pin the Government down. They did not take the opportunity to do so. As I said, I heard the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Haines) on air in Canberra earlier this week speaking about how important it was, about how weak kneed we had been or whatever other adjective she brought to mind at the time. We were very strong on this Bill and our objections to it. No-one in the Senate, but for the Democrats perhaps, could have forgotten the line that we took on it. Now, tonight, we are told that it is so important and that this issue ought to be dealt with in the way that they now propose. I suggest that it is nothing but hypocrisy that it is being given this form of emphasis at this time. They forfeited their opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody in this place had any doubt about what the Government had in mind for Justice Staples when the matter was debated last year. It was perfectly clear that part of the background of the Bill was to deal with him in the way the Government is now dealing with him, but that was not sufficiently important last August for the Australian Democrats to say to the Government, `You will not get this Bill; we will join with the Opposition to hold it up until such time as you give us an unequivocal assurance as to the judge's future'. We are now subjected to this motion. I shall say no more about it, but the people of Australia are entitled to know the way in which the Australian Democrats behave on such matters as this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in support of Senator Haines's motion and fully endorse the comments she has made. I am appalled on two levels by what has happened to Justice Staples, both to him on a personal level and with respect to the principle of the independence of the judiciary. In relation to the latter point, I place on record a letter by Judge Allan of the Industrial Court of South Australia. The letter touches upon this matter of principle. The letter, which is addressed to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Dear Prime Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> I write with respect to the situation of The Honourable Justice Staples; and I do so for the purpose of raising with you a matter of fundamental importance in relation to the independence of the judiciary; a concept which has always been at the heart of the system of government which operates in this country and one which the Advisory Committee on the Australian Judicial System recently stated to be essential within modern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The failure by your Government to appoint Justice Staples to the new Australian Industrial Relations Commission, established pursuant to the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1988, in the absence of consent on the part of Justice Staples or any other lawful reason is, and must be seen to be, an attack on the independence of the judiciary in this country. As I understand the position, all former members of the old Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, with the exception of Justice Staples, have been transferred or appointed to the new Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>The next point made by Judge Allan might be particularly relevant to Senator Button whose casuistry at times surprises me. He described the Commission as not a court for the purposes of the Constitution. If he wants to disregard the Constitution, perhaps he could look at the international conventions. Judge Allan touches on them in his letter, which continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Generally accepted international, minimum standards of judicial independence require that the abolition of a tribunal of which a judge is a member should not be accepted as a reason or an occasion for the removal of a judge. The reasons for that would be obvious to you. I respectfully draw your attention to clause 20 of the `Minimum Standards of Judicial Independence' adopted by the International Bar Association in October 1982:</PARA>
<PARA> `20 (a) Legislation introducing changes in the terms and conditions of judicial services shall not be applied to judges holding office at the time of passing the legislation unless the changes improve the terms of service. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) In case of legislation reorganising courts, judges serving in these courts shall not be affected, except for their transfer to another court of the same status.'</PARA>
<PARA> I also refer you to clause 2.39 of the `Universal Declaration on the Independence of Justice' adopted on 10 June 1983 by the World Conference on the Independence of Justice at Montreal, Canada which provides as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> `2.39: In the event a court is abolished, judges serving on this court shall not be affected, except for their transfer to another court of the same status.'</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I refer you to principles 1, 12 and 18 of the `Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary' unanimously adopted by the United Nations General Assembly which respectively provide as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> `1. The independence of the judiciary shall be guaranteed by the State and enshrined in the Constitution or the law of the country. It is the duty of all governmental and other institutions to respect and observe the independence of the judiciary. </PARA>
<PARA> 12. Judges, whether appointed or elected, shall have guaranteed tenure until a mandatory retirement age or the expiry of their term of office, where such exists. </PARA>
<PARA> 18. Judges shall be subject to suspension or removal only for reasons of incapacity or behaviour that renders them unfit to discharge their duties.'</PARA>
<PARA> The method adopted to remove Justice Staples would seem to be a deliberate attempt to circumvent the law relating to the removal of a judge in the position of Justice Staples, established convention and the principles to which I have above referred. </PARA>
<PARA> All this seems particularly poignant against the background of a history of Australia co-sponsoring and voting in favour of resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Commission on Human Rights relating to the administration of justice and the importance of an independent judiciary. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge your Government to reconsider its position in this matter; and, with the consent of Justice Staples, remedy this wholly undesirable and potentially destructive situation by appointing the learned Judge to the new Australian Industrial Relations Commission. In that way, your Government would be, and be seen to be, maintaining the independence of the judiciary in this country; and would no doubt receive the respect and gratitude of the community therefor. </PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear from what has happened that if any future judge of the Industrial Relations Commission displeases persons outside the Commission, he or she will risk being removed from office and stood in the corner. With respect to the personal effect all this has had on Justice Staples, I quote very briefly from a letter dated 24 November last year that he wrote to the Prime Minister. In part, it reads:</PARA>
<PARA> It is little to ask in the light of the disruption to my life and to my reputation that the reaction to my work in a public office appears to have brought on. It is no idle inquiry. I do not believe I have done wrong. Matters have proceeded secretly so far. It is time now for publicity of reasons. Those jumpy phrases the journalists love to cite against me are no explanation sufficient to throw aside relevant legislation and the conventions, to create a precedent for a step of this magnitude. God help the use of language if they do. We shall all impale ourselves on our pens. </PARA>
<PARA> My removal from office will be an immense act of defamation. It will compound the loss of reputation I have already suffered in the eyes of people unaware of the facts and who give governments credit for their acts in the absence of cause to the contrary. Whether I deserve it or not, my loss of reputation is a fact which is quite inescapable in my life. the courts have always asked for the justification of defamations which damage reputations. The courts will accept many justifications as of course. All these are rules of common justice. I ask you to set down the justification upon which your government relies for what is projected against me. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to go on living in a community which will know I was dismissed. An unexplained dismissal without justification will not reduce the defamation, but rather compound it, for some will sense that my offence was unspeakable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is before the Senate at the moment the motion of the Australian Democrats to refer to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs matters dealing with Mr Justice Staples. I indicate that we will not support the motion, something that I have already indicated to Senator Haines. In view of what the Minister at the table, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, said, the motion will therefore be defeated. I understand that we will then deal with the motion of which I gave notice this morning. That motion proposes to set up a select committee to consider what might be described as some related matters. The committee would look at the principles that should govern the tenure of office of quasi-judicial and other appointees to Commonwealth tribunals. I understand, again from what Senator Button said, that that motion will be carried tonight, although I was also under the impression that the Australian Democrats would support it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems that I should briefly give the reasons why we cannot support the motion of the Australian Democrats and at the same time very briefly say why we prefer the motion that I will move at the conclusion of this debate. That will then save a subsequent speech and presumably will please the Senate in that way. Senator Haines, in her address tonight, said that there had been collusion between the Opposition and the Government on this matter. That is totally untrue, as she would be aware, as she told us in the debate tonight that she reads and believes what is in the press. The issue has been debated with great care by the Opposition and we have reached certain conclusions that I will enunciate in a moment. Our great area of difference with the Australian Democrats is really what Senator Haines said, and I think I am correct in quoting the words she used in debate tonight. When speaking of Justice Staples she said, `By nature of his title he is indeed a judge'. By nature of his title he is not, in fact, a judge. Perhaps I should really start with the basis of protection of tenure of office of judges of courts of the Commonwealth. That, of course, is the constitutional protection included under section 72 of the Constitution, which provides:</PARA>
<PARA>The Justices of the High Court and of the other courts created by the Parliament-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Shall not be removed except by the Governor-General in Council, on an address from both Houses of the Parliament in the same session, praying for such removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity:</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, justices of the High Court-that is not relevant to this debate-or justices of other courts created by the Parliament shall not be removed except by the means I have just expressed. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think anyone is saying that Justice Staples is a justice of a court. He is clearly not a justice of a court. He is a Deputy President-at least until tonight, I think-of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Certain privileges are given to those who hold that office. If they are lawyers they are given the right to use the title `Justice' and they are given that right under section 7 (5) (b), as I read it, of the old Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904, as amended, which says:</PARA>
<PARA>any other Deputy President has the same rank, status and precedence as a Judge of the Court. </PARA>
<PARA>It does not say that he or she is a judge of the court. Rather, what it says is that he or she is given the same rank, status and precedence as a judge of the court. The matter is really as clear as that. On that basis, we cannot see how the constitutional protection relates to Justice Staples and how it can therefore be said that in some way this matter is evidence of an abuse of the principle of independence of judges of the courts, because, as I said, he is not a judge of the court. The protection of his tenure of office comes from the Conciliation and Arbitration Act itself. His protection is by virtue of that same section 7 of the Act, which says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . shall hold office until he resigns or attains the age of 65 years. </PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . shall not be removed from office except in the manner provided by this Act for the removal from office of a Judge of the Court. </PARA>
<PARA>So while the Commission remains in being, certainly the method for removal of a Deputy President is similar to that for removal of a judge of the court. However, if the Commission ceases to be, then that protection would no longer exist. That certainly seems to us to be the law and, if it is not the law, then we would have thought that Justice Staples by now would have gone to the High Court to seek clarification of that matter of law. </PARA>
<PARA> This therefore brings us to the debate about whether any further inquiry is a worthwhile and constructive exercise. We have considered that matter and I want to look briefly at the Australian Democrats' proposed reference to the Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. What the Democrats seeks is in the form of seven clauses. The first matter the Committee is asked to consider states:</PARA>
<PARA>the adequacy and appropriateness of section 72 (ii) of the Constitution as the only basis on which judges can be removed from office;</PARA>
<PARA>As I have just attempted to argue, Justice Staples is not a judge. It seems to us that section 72 (ii) of the Constitution is not in dispute. We have had debate in this place before, and not all that long ago, as to what is meant by the expression `proved misbehaviour or incapacity', but that does not seem to be relevant to this matter. I do not think anyone has suggested `proved misbehaviour or incapacity' in relation to this matter. So what would be the point in a Senate Committee reviewing a provision of the Constitution which does not seem to me to be in dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter the Australian Democrats would wish the Committee to consider is expressed as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>the adequacy and appropriateness of the matching provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 for the removal from office of Presidential members of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission;</PARA>
<PARA>Madam Deputy President, as you are aware, this Parliament has voted that body out of existence. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As of tonight, I understand. So it does not seem to us to serve any constructive purpose to go back and see whether section 7 of that Act, which is about to be repealed, was drawn in adequate terms or whether it should have been drawn in some other terms. It really does not seem to us that that is going to serve any constructive purpose. The Democrats go on in the third paragraph of their motion:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> the need for, and type of, alternative mechanisms for the removal of judges from office with paramount regard being paid to the need to protect the independence of the judiciary, the rule of law and the role of Parliament in the process;</PARA>
<PARA>It is our view that judges of the courts should be protected in the way that they are protected by the Constitution. We did not know that that was in dispute. I do not think it is in dispute. Judges of the court should be, and are, in fact, subject to the protection of section 72 of the Constitution and the provisions that require an address from both Houses, `proved misbehaviour or incapacity', et cetera. Again, as it applies to judges, we cannot see that consideration by a Senate Committee of that particular paragraph could be helpful to this Parliament or to the legislative process in the future. The fourth paragraph of the Australian Democrats' motion states:</PARA>
<PARA> the workability and effectiveness of courts and the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission (or the new Industrial Relations Commission) being responsible for the arrangement of their business with particular regard to the utilisation of all judges on those courts and the role of the Parliament, if any, in that arrangement;</PARA>
<PARA>It seems to us, in that instance, if we talk about the utilisation of judges or the utilisation of presidential officers of these bodies, that that is not a matter for the Parliament and, in fact, it is not a matter for government. In that circumstance, again we have great difficulty in seeing how referring that question to a Senate committee can be helpful in the future in matters relating to this area of the law. The fifth paragraph that the Democrats put in their motion reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Whether any charge of misbehaviour or incapacity within the meaning of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act has been made against Mr Justice Staples, a Deputy President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, and if such a charge would be made out to the satisfaction of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Apart from the question as to whether it is appropriate for the Committee to consider whether there is evidence upon which such a charge could be made out, as I have indicated, as far as I am aware on reading all the papers I can get on this matter, no-one is suggesting a charge in those terms could or should be made out against Mr Justice Staples. So in that circumstance what can be gained from referring such a question to the Senate Committee? Obviously the answer is that no benefit can be gained. The sixth paragraph of Senator Haines's motion reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The compatibility of the Government's method of removing Mr Justice Staples from office with the existing mechanisms for removing judges from office and with any alternative mechanisms which the committee might propose;</PARA>
<PARA>Again, as I have attempted to indicate in this instance, we are not debating what is the appropriate mechanism for removing judges; we are rather debating what, if any, is the appropriate mechanism for removing these persons who have what might be described as a quasi-judicial status. We think in fact that there is some argument for looking at that question, and that is taken up as the specific reference in the motion that we will be moving in a few moments. </PARA>
<PARA> The last paragraph of the Australian Democrats' motion reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Whether any action should be taken to appoint Mr Justice Staples to a position on the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, it is only the Government that can do that. So we cannot see what can be gained. We cannot even see really how a committee can consider the question as to whether action should be taken to appoint him. Obviously the Committee cannot direct the Government to appoint him. </PARA>
<PARA> So, for those reasons it seems to us that although there are very serious matters at issue here, the way in which it is being approached by the Australian Democrats is not the best way to get to the important issues that are involved and, therefore, we propose what we regard as a better way, which is a reference which, as I said at the outset, would look at the principles that should govern the tenure of office of quasi-judicial and other appointees to Commonwealth tribunals and, in particular, whether the provisions of section 24 and section 28 of the Industrial Relations Act provide proper and adequate provision for the tenure of office of presidential members and commissioners of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable senators will be aware, section 24 and section 28 provide provisions in similar terms to that which I mentioned before for removal of a presidential member from office in relation to section 24 and termination of appointment of a commissioner in relation to section 28; that is, proved misbehaviour or incapacity and that being presented to the Governor-General by action of both Houses of this Parliament acting in the same session. </PARA>
<PARA> We think that there is a worthwhile debate for this Senate, a worthwhile matter to be addressed, as to whether that is the appropriate way to deal with those who hold these quasi-judicial offices, not only in relation to the Industrial Relations Commission but also in relation to that whole band of quasi-judicial tribunals that exist under Commonwealth law. Honourable senators would be well aware that the view has been expressed by some that there ought to be some other mechanism short of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. For example, if somebody is appointed under this Act who is clearly incompetent-I am not trying to suggest that that applies to Mr Justice Staples-if government makes a mistake in the appointment, which can occur, and somebody is appointed who is wholly incompetent, should that person in effect be appointed until the age of 65, or should there be some other mechanism that can be taken by government? We would not argue that in relation to a judge because we regard this principle of independence of the judiciary as so paramount to the safeguards of the judicial system of this country that we would be prepared to bear the cost to the community of what might be an incompetent judge. But in tribunals that are not judicial tribunals but are rather quasi-judicial type bodies, should there not be another mechanism? This Committee could consider questions such as that. It could consider whether appointments to such bodies should be for shorter terms so that there would be a reasonable turnover of personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, we believe that there are a number of constructive questions that would be addressed by the Committee in that debate, and it may well use some of the experiences of the Justice Staples matter as food for thought in consideration as to what the law should provide in the future. But as I have indicated, it seems to us that there is nothing that can be gained from a review of a situation that misconceives that Justice Staples was entitled to the protection afforded to a judge under the Constitution. So for those reasons we will be opposing the Australian Democrats' motion and when, as we anticipate, that is defeated, I will be moving the Opposition's motion and seeking support for it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I now move, at the request of Senator Chaney:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the motion of which Senator Crowley gave notice earlier this day, relating to domestic violence, be taken to have been moved and have precedence over all other business this day till determined. </PARA>
<PARA>The matter that we wish to have debated now is this notice of motion given earlier this day by Senator Crowley that sought to malign me, in this instance, by suggesting that I regarded domestic violence as a soft issue. I propose to demonstrate the urgency of that matter and why it should be debated this evening by the Senate. In fact, the matter is regarded by us as so urgent that we would have moved this way earlier in the day but for the months of work that have been put in by honourable senators on a number of important Senate committees, in particular the one relating to Aboriginal affairs. The Senate was to receive those committee reports today, and honourable senators intended and desired to speak to them. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to the Senate, Mr President, that this is a matter of urgency partly because of the terms in which Senator Crowley's motion is expressed. The motion is a personal attack upon another senator that should not be allowed to lie in the Notice Paper, perhaps indefinitely as is often the case in these matters. Clearly, it should be dealt with expeditiously and the most expeditious way in which it can be dealt with is to deal with it tonight. The second reason for urgency, apart from the personal maligning that is included within its contents, is that it is obviously designed to divert attention from what is becoming apparent in this country, and that is, the very serious decline in the economic status of women. From this morning's newspapers we found that the Government in its Caucus yesterday had been debating the serious lowering in the polls of its standing in the eyes of women. The Government, in its usual diversionary way, tried to suggest that this was a result of the uncouth language and behaviour of the Treasurer (Mr Keating), which was an interesting way to divert attention from the somewhat patronising attitude of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to women. In fact, it is apparent to all of those who have been listening to women's organisations in this country, and particularly to individual women, that their real concern is the drop in living standards and the difficulty of economically sustaining themselves and their families which is not being given proper recognition or support by this Government. So we have this diversionary tactic into areas that this Government clearly knows are untrue in order to cover up in some way for this failure and this inadequacy. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter is obviously urgent to Australian women. If the economic concerns were not of such urgency, then we would not find such ridiculous motions being put to the Senate by Senator Crowley this afternoon. I would have thought that Senator Crowley, like most other senators, would not think that I would possibly condone domestic violence which I, as much as anyone else in this chamber, regard as abhorrent. I would not have thought that we would find her attempting to use the forms of this House to divert the debate on status of women to such matters or that we would find the Prime Minister trying to allude that the drop in the standing of the Australian Labor Party in relation to women's affairs was in fact related to the foul language that is used by his Treasurer, although there is no doubt that such foul language is not appreciated by the women of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> When we speak to women's organisations in Australia we find that poverty and lowering of standards of living are their principal concerns and matters of great urgency to them. This becomes relevant to the debate on domestic violence. As Senator Crowley would no doubt know because she has an interest in this area, women's refuges in this country are now being flooded not only by women who are there as a result of some domestic crisis but also by women who are in poverty, who simply cannot afford housing in the city and who are looking for somewhere else to turn or, alternatively, by women who have become part of this process of de-institutionalisation-I think that is the word. These are women who come out of institutions such as prisons, mental hospitals or some other form of hospital, because of government policies-and in some ways these are sensible government policies. Instead of the Government providing half-way houses and appropriate support mechanisms for such women, there is no alternative for them but to turn to women's refuges that were created for an entirely different purpose. We find the refuges flooded. We find that the women who are running these refuges are now coming to the Opposition and saying that the Government is putting them in an impossible position, but it is all related--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose that Senator Crowley might argue that she should speak first because this was her motion. However, I am on my feet and she does not wish to rise. As Senator Crowley decided to take this diversionary tactic earlier in the day, it seems an opportune moment for us to talk about the very real problems being faced by Australian women at the moment. It is also an opportune time to point out the disappointment that Australian women are now showing with this Government. This Labor Government built very high expectations among women's organisations in this country and it did so in the form of identifying a number of areas of difficulty or concern to women, and building these issues through high level publicity campaigns. Now the women's organisations are finding that those expectations are not being met. As they are not being met there is growing disillusionment with this Government among Australian women. We will hear more of this when Senator Walters's Bill comes on relating to the attitude of women's organisations to pornographic videos, the business of which is supported by the Government through its legislative framework in the Australian Capital Territory. The ACT is becoming the headquarters in Australia of the pornographic video industry-an industry which so demeans women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we look at areas such as health, we find the profile of the health issue was raised by Labor's publication, Women's Health: A Framework of Change which sets out the problem areas. However the women's organisations are waiting for a detailed response from the Government. Rural women have been identified as a particularly neglected group and the booklet Life has never been easy was published setting out the issues. But a response to the issues has yet to be forthcoming from this Government. We had the experiences of the Women in Advertising conference, a project which has now been going for some years and what has been disappointing is the lack of--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that the Minister for Local Government has come into the chamber tonight. It is more than she does on the video debate. It will be interesting to see whether she will stand up in that debate when it comes on. The Opposition has supported the raising of the status of women in advertising and the avoidance of the stereotyping that occurs in that area. However, after a great deal of money had been spent and conferences had been held, very few substantive results followed. Let us move to consideration of the National Agenda for Women which followed what was probably the most comprehensive survey ever conducted to identify what women regard as--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the Minister listens for a while she might learn something. The National Agenda for Women followed the most comprehensive survey on identifying what women regard as the key issues. We found that the agenda sets broad and perhaps often bland parameters without the detailed policy prescriptions that Australian women expected. What we have found is that in each of these exercises, as I suggested, there has been a sophisticated public relations campaign emphasising a government that is actually achieving something. What is happening is that Australian women, particularly through their organisations, are now saying, `Where is the performance that matches this rhetoric?'. Expectations have been built but they are not being met in practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One can go on to the area of legislative and award restrictions. I remind Senator Reynolds of the conference in 1986. It seems that only now is the Government again addressing itself to the restraints within awards that disadvantage women, particularly in relation to part time work. There was an expectation that there would be significant and widespread changes in awards that would provide opportunities for part time work for Australian women, but those reforms in the award system simply have not occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Reynolds will know, migrant women were given a high priority in 1985 with the national conference on immigrant women's issues. Until the end of last year, when Senator Reynolds decided to hold another mini-conference, very little occurred in the meantime. Women are disappointed with the lack of response by the Government and are now starting to recognise the initial conference and the lack of progress that followed as simply a confidence trick. We should consider the shameless way in which the Office of the Status of Women is used by this Government to promote its image when the perception is given-with the dismissal of heads who do not totally toe the line-to Australian women that in some ways it is offering independent advice and providing some form of safeguard. Those who work within that Office clearly would like to assume that responsibility, but this Government does not give them that responsibility; rather it uses them to promote its image. </PARA>
<PARA> That Office had chosen for it as its two major current projects the women in advertising project and the domestic violence project. I have said that the Opposition supports the women in advertising project. I said so at the recent Sydney conference, and Senator Reynolds knows that when the project commenced the then Opposition spokesman in this area also joined in supporting the project. We also support any real efforts that are made to reduce domestic violence within our community, which I and everyone in the Opposition would regard as abhorrent. However, we have been somewhat disappointed with progress in that area. I think that is coming through to the women's organisations, which do such magnificent work in this area. What we have seen is a three-phase project. The first phase is to run more surveys to identify the problem; the second phase, which is the one we are in now, is the educative phase. </PARA>
<PARA> We support April being designated as the month of awareness for domestic violence, but when we speak to women's organisations they say that they want more work done on the causes of domestic violence and more effort and resources put into supporting those who are abused by domestic violence. Particularly, they express concern of a linkage between the growing levels of domestic violence and the growing levels of what might be described as family poverty within our community. They say to us and no doubt to the Government, which is turning a blind eye, `The lack of support for families inherent in this Government's policy is placing greater stress on families'. Some feel that that is related in some way to the ever increasing level of domestic violence in our community. They say to us, as they no doubt say to the Government, `Why will this Government not give greater support for families to try to relieve some of that economic stress?'. It is an interesting debate because the first charter of the Office of the Status of Women is, in fact, to improve the financial independence and the financial security of women. But the Government seems to have given that a lower priority. We support the other projects, but what this Government has been able to do is camouflage its lack of progress in the critical area of financial independence and financial security of women by diverting attention to other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> When we talk to women they remind us-and this is in the statistics to which the Government has access-that, although there has been greater access by women to employment opportunities, there is very little evidence of vertical improvements in women's occupations. More women are coming into the work force but their progress up the ladder to higher paid jobs that will give them greater financial security and independence has been disappointing. Perhaps the worst example is within the Government's own bailiwick. When we look at its performance in relation to the Senior Executive Service of its own Commonwealth Public Service, which I think Senator Reynolds tried to explain away at the end of last session, we see that in the last year there was an increase in the number of women at that level of the Public Service of only 0.1 per cent. So there has been near enough to no improvement in that level of the Public Service. Australian women are becoming somewhat irritated by this because expectations had been built and they are not being realised. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as failure in the area of vertical improvement in employment of women, there is also the extremely disappointing factor of so few moving into fields of work beyond the traditional areas of employment. I would be concerned, as Senator Reynolds should be concerned, that when Australian companies provide apprenticeship positions for girls and young women in non-traditional areas and they are not being taken up in areas of extremely high unemployment for women and girls, there is a major problem. What has this Government been able to achieve in that area? It would seem very little. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walters says, `Nothing'. I think she is probably right. Moving to the very high profile of the Affirmative Action Agency, I support efforts to educate business within our community to its responsibilities and, in fact, the material gains that can come to business from giving greater and better opportunities for women, ensuring that they are in an educational position to compete properly and contribute to individual work forces to their maximum capacity. But to get real, hard information as to what improvement there has been, notwithstanding the Affirmative Action Agency, is very difficult. All that the last annual report of the Affirmative Action Agency really demonstrates to those who read it is that large businesses, as it then was-it has now come to the next category of business as well-have cooperated with the forms required under the Act. But are women actually getting to the higher positions of employment within large firms? The evidence is there that movement has been very slow, and women's organisations are expressing their disappointment. If Senator Giles can produce figures to us tonight demonstrating that there are material gains arising from the project, there will be nobody in this place more pleased than I. What it does, in effect, is enable the Government to claim that results are being achieved. All it really proves is that the forms are being complied with. If the Government wanted to achieve something it would start within the province that is totally within its control, which is the Commonwealth Public Service. It has failed totally in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps we can give the Government some indication as to what women's organisations are telling us are the high priorities. They all relate primarily to this area of financial independence and financial security. They are still coming to us expressing concern about failures in child care and lack of access to child care places. The complaint is that such places are too expensive and that this inhibits women's capacity to take employment, particularly more responsible employment. The Government's response in this area is not regarded by those organisations as adequate. </PARA>
<PARA> Women in employment are coming to us and asking why they cannot be given an equal opportunity in relation to other benefits of employment such as superannuation. Clearly they are not being given those benefits. Our superannuation laws have been structured on the basis of someone who remains in employment continually rather than of someone who may come into employment for a significant period, but then leave to meet other responsibilities such as perhaps bringing up children. The women's organisations are asking why this Government will not do something about that situation. Why in relation to disability insurance do women have to pay premiums almost twice as high as those paid by men? What has this Government done in that regard? The answer is that it has done nothing. Women are complaining because the Government built such high expectations. They have come to us complaining about the lack of educational opportunities for training and retraining to enable women to rise to higher paid places of employment rather than simply be employed in the more lowly paid places of employment, which keeps them in the status of economic poverty or near economic poverty. We should tell this Government that one can be employed but still be in poverty-a fact which this Government seems to have forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA> The women's organisations still come to us complaining about a lack of flexibility in employment hours and lack of opportunity in regard to permanent part time work. The women's organisations are particularly coming to us now complaining about a lack of affordable housing. This Government should appreciate the position in which women are now being placed, particularly women who are supporting children but other women, too-under this Government's policies, which have put housing beyond the reach of those people. Interest rate policies immediately come to mind. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area in which women's organisations primarily come to us to complain about is the cost to families who are on one income and as to whether they can afford to bring up children. If this debate serves any purpose tonight, it will do so if it brings home to this Government, during its last few months of office, how families on low incomes are now suffering in trying to bring up children. Families are having to make the decision that they cannot afford to have children because of the incomes they have and the lack of family support given by this Government pursuant to its deliberate policies which leave women in no position to support children. This is the message that is coming through to us and it should be coming through to this Government. I hope that we can get it through to the Government tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Government identified some groups of women who are in particular difficulty they were identifying correctly, but with all the benefits of being in government, that much at least could be achieved. When the Government was prepared with the Country Women's Association to look at the particular problems of rural women, it was tapping into a sector of the community who have been disadvantaged over a long time. </PARA>

It is about time that this Government faced up to those particular difficulties and did something constructive rather than simply talk about the problem. I turn to the next area or grouping of women who could be identified as facing particular problems which has also been overlooked by this Government. </PARA>

Suddenly the Government has become aware of this problem through its surveys, as has happened in the last few days when it has been disclosed that Australian women are rejecting this Government. Suddenly the Government has become aware that the aged are angry at the lack of concern and consideration they have received from this Government. I remind Senator Reynolds of a fact of which she should be aware-namely, that the majority of aged people are women who are particularly suffering from this Government's policies or lack of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to give others the opportunity to participate in this important debate on the failures of this Government in relation to the status of women, particularly the Government's failures in relation to its responsibility. The Government had accepted the responsibility of lifting the financial security and financial independence of women. But it is not just I who stand here this evening saying that Australian women are disappointed in this area. It is being said by Australian women. This Government should be aware that women's organisations, on which not many years ago the Labor Government thought it had a mortgage, are now looking for alternatives. They are tired of the rhetoric, the publicity, the public relations campaigns. What they wanted is real performance in these areas to match the rhetoric, and it has not been forthcoming. My last word is that if this Government did more about family support, that would be the area which would be of greatest benefit to the majority of Australian women. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because the motion does not go to the person, but to his comments. There is a clear distinction that should be drawn. Secondly, although Senator Hill criticised me for not giving him notice, the same might be said of him. However, that is somewhat petty. I heard Senator Hill say that he presumed that I had got the information from the National Media Liaison Service. He is, of course, again quite wrong. It was a good guess, but quite wrong. The matter was drawn to my attention by a constituent who wrote to me enclosing some references, to the best of their recollection, from a radio interview with Senator Hill subsequent to the press comment. I had received a transcript of a radio interview. I concluded from that that Senator Hill had made those remarks and was taking the opportunity to get it straight on radio. If that is not the case, I beg Senator Hill's pardon. I was, as my colleagues were, somewhat surprised that Senator Hill would have been so flippant about domestic violence as I had not understood that to be his attitude. The transcript led me to believe that Senator Hill had made the remarks that were attributed to him in the newspaper. Inasmuch as that has been corrected by Senator Hill, I accept his accounting of how that happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition's conclusion that domestic violence is not a matter of great importance for women is a terrible conclusion to draw. We have had to address seriously the issue of how to manage the question of domestic violence. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, the Opposition has said that. We appreciate that the Opposition has now joined us in understanding how appalling domestic violence is. Senator Hill seems to suggest that we should address the causes of domestic violence as though he understands what the causes of domestic violence are. The Opposition often offers a simplistic solution for the causes when quite clearly there is evidence that the causes are very complex. If anyone knew what the causes of domestic violence were I suppose that we could proceed to address them. But to suggest that household economic constraints are the cause of domestic violence is to be wildly wrong and demonstrates a wildly insufficient analysis. If Senator Hill understood anything about domestic violence he would understand that it occurs both in families that are poor and in families that are very wealthy. It occurs in families that have no economic constraints on them and in families that do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To suggest that economic constraints, if they exist at all, are a cause of domestic violence shows an insufficient analysis. If Senator Hill says that is the case, do we conclude, therefore, that wealthy men commit domestic violence for entirely different reasons? I suggest that the causes of domestic violence are much more complex than indicated in the simply analysis made by Senator Hill. The Government cannot address the causes of domestic violence in a simplistic way because they go to the motives, attitudes and behaviour of people. The Government is addressing the issue seriously by saying to the community, `No longer will this community allow domestic violence to go on'. This Government has gone on the record as saying that. It is taking the issue so seriously that it has set aside a month specifically to address the issue of domestic violence. It has a campaign going. It is taking up the public acknowledgment that domestic violence is not tolerable, that it is not acceptable. The Government will not accept it and it is saying that it will take further steps to address it. Already it is taking steps, but it is now concerned to make quite clear to this community that domestic violence is appalling and is not acceptable to this Government. If the Opposition shares our attitude we would be pleased to accept its contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill also says that addressing the domestic violence problem with a public education campaign is insufficient. That would seem to me to be falsified by his own evidence. Would he say that we should not have an education campaign addressing the question of AIDS? Would he say that the AIDS campaign has done nothing to help the community understand the significance of that problem? Is he not aware that one of the biggest problems associated with domestic violence is that people do not really believe that it happens; people do not really believe that it is as bad as we say; and people do not really believe that women are belted up, smashed up, and delivered with broken noses and arms to the casualty wards of hospitals, where I have served, or take themselves to women's shelters which the Government has funded and which, at last, provide them with a haven and a place to go to. </PARA>
<PARA> We have addressed the problem. The first thing we did was to acknowledge that it existed. We women have brought it to the attention of government. Secondly, the Government has taken any number of steps to address the problem. Senator Hill says that we should do more by way of providing services. This Government has funded shelters. We introduced the supported accommodation assistance program. Funding for shelters has dramatically increased, precisely because this Government takes the issue seriously; precisely because the Government knows the costs down the line, the costs to people of what happens when a family is smashed up-the cost of individual misery, the cost to the children, the cost to a bloke who may be out of work, the cost to the taxpayers of funding shelters. These things are understood and appreciated. These measures are in place. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill's arguments on this issue are spurious in the extreme and very wrong. The Government recognises the problem. It appreciates that much more has to be done in the way of community education to make people in the community aware of the size and significance of domestic violence, of how totally unacceptable it is and how it has to be addressed with all sorts of programs and steps. But we cannot do that if people do not know the problem exists. The steps are already in place in any number of States and Territories. I remind honourable senators of the changes introduced by the domestic violence ordinance in the Australian Capital Territory, which has been in place for six to 12 months already and which, from all accounts, is working very well. That does not stop domestic violence, but it intervenes and addresses the problem much more efficiently, immediately and successfully that has been the case in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> Governments have not been able to deal with domestic violence because there has been confusion between Commonwealth and State. Should the State police interfere? Should the Commonwealth police interfere? Whose jurisdiction is it? Women were advised to take out injunction orders: `You can get an injunction order that might protect you'. We all know how difficult it is for people to get injunction orders. There is a time constraint. There is a possibility that the injunction will be broken, and it is clearly understood by many women who have been beaten, psychologically stood over, had their windows broken and so on that an injunction is not very much protection. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the years women have sought the protection and assistance of the shelter movement. More than 85 per cent of residents in the shelter movement are women who have come because of domestic violence. If one understands, from talking to women working in the shelter movement, the history and pattern of people who come to the shelter movement, one will know that certainly we on the Government side are acutely alert to the pattern of behaviour in domestic violence and to the best ways of dealing with it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Family stress may be a cause, but there are thousands of families in this country that are stressed and whose members do not resort to violence on each other. There are thousands of families who cope with stress in an adult and mature way. We are talking about a selective group of people who choose to commit domestic violence. In my own State of South Australia there are now committees-one emerged out of the community health centre at Clovelly Park where I worked; I know the people involved very well-providing voluntary assistance to the perpetrators of violence, violent men who have come to discover that they can solve problems when they are angry by means other than their fists. That is something that is under way, something that has already been done. Does Senator Hill know about it? It is happening in his own State. If he does not know about it, I refer him to the excellent first piece of research emerging from that domestic violence counselling unit. Mr Reg Branch and his colleagues produced a report the other day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Domestic violence is understood by the Government. The Government is also aware that domestic violence is not understood in the community. That is why the Government has taken this issue so seriously. The other reason the issue is being taken so seriously is that the women of Australia have raised it. The women of Australia have said, `Violence is not acceptable. We do not want to be thumped when we walk down the streets. We do not want to have our handbags stolen. We do not want to have burglars breaking into our houses and committing crime and violence. We do not want to be beaten up in our own homes. We do not want psychological or domestic violence'. It is the women of Australia who have put this issue on the national agenda and asked the Government to take it seriously. It may not be the highest priority economic issue for women but anybody seriously addressing women's issues will listen to what women say. They say domestic violence is abhorrent and appalling. They say, `How come we cannot feel safe in our own homes? Is this not the society that talks about peace and protection? Please, can you let people know the extent of domestic violence and can you let them know the steps that you are already taking and the further steps that have to be taken to address this problem?'. </PARA>
<PARA> Domestic violence is an absolutely appalling problem. Those of us who have been working with victims of domestic violence have seen how women with the protection and support of the shelter movement have emerged through domestic violence. They have come back into the world as sufficient and confident women again and have been able to provide that care and support for children that the Opposition talks about. These are some of the matters in the domestic violence area that we on the Government side know because we have travelled very closely with it. We have campaigned and fought for domestic violence to be on the agenda for at least the last 10 years and probably the last 15 years, since domestic violence emerged as an issue in the original shelter movement. That material is well known to government. That is the sort of funding that the Government has put into the domestic violence area. That is the sort of attention the Government has paid to it. That is why there have been legislative changes under family law. That is why there have been consultations between the Commonwealth and the State law enforcement agencies, which are addressing this issue so seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> Only the other day I had a briefing along with a number of other citizens in South Australia by the South Australian police force. The issue of community services and, in particular, domestic violence is of such great importance that it made the agenda in a three hour briefing by the South Australian police force. The appalling fact is that the majority of women in this country who are murdered are murdered in a domestic violence situation. If one asks the police what is the most hazardous part of police work they will say it is attending domestics, as they are called. We have to acknowledge that and not keep pushing it aside and sweeping it under the carpet. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill, this domestic violence campaign is no soft option. It is now moving forward to a public campaign that must go with the other steps that are being taken so that people will know that domestic violence is not acceptable. They will know that there are places where people can go to seek assistance and help. It would be much better if a man actually sought help before he thumped than after the event. </PARA>
<PARA> I found it quite remarkable that Senator Hill used my notice of motion to run through the latest litany of the women's policy proposed by the Opposition. In fact what Senator Hill said was not bad stuff, I suppose, for a late night political speech. That is about all it is good for. It was fraught with just about every inaccuracy that those of us on this side have had to give the flip to. I say to Senator Hill that for the first time ever on the record, 50 per cent of students completing Year 12 in the secondary schools around Australia are girls. For the first time ever, more than 50 per cent of students in the tertiary institutions in this country are women. Of the more than one million jobs created since this Government came to office, in those six years in which Senator Hill said we have done nothing, 58 per cent of those jobs have been taken by women. What better way to address the poverty of women, the poverty of their lives, than to give them a job so they can get off welfare and get into the work force and can manage for themselves with increased confidence and can better able attend to the needs of their children. They can do this because they are now citizens in an active and alive world. They are not locked out of it by being denied anything more than an ongoing life of perpetual poverty on a pension. </PARA>
<PARA> It is vital that people who do not have the opportunity or, yet, the choice to take that step are supported by the pension. I note that that pension has increased in real terms since we came into government. It is also true that nobody would prefer to live out his or her life confined to the restrictive income of a pension. Many women in the circumstances that I have described have taken the opportunity to take up the jobs that are now available to them. What does Senator Hill mean when he says that we have not had achievements for women? What Senator Hill is saying is extraordinary. He says that we have created expectations. You bet we have! The women of Australia for the last 80 years had no expectations. In seven years of Fraser, what did that Government give them? It gave them no expectations. We are delighted that we have created expectations and we are meeting and fulfilling them. If women are coming back to this Government and saying, `We want further attention', I say, `Thank God we now have in this country a women's movement that is vocal, that is organised, that is coherent, and that can actually speak for itself to government'. That is something that was not available to women in times past. Women did not have educational opportunities in past times. </PARA>

It takes into account many of the points which he raised about the importance of the involvement of all those concerned-in this case, employers and workers-working the situation out together.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am appreciative, Mr Acting Deputy President. Senator Hill with a remarkable sweep of logic wandered around suggesting that women were not in the work force and that was a tragedy. I point out that women are in the work force. Almost in anticipation of that little defence he said, `Ah, yes, but they're not in senior positions. You've got this other thing called the Affirmative Action Agency and women aren't there in the senior positions-have a look at the Public Service'. Indeed, let us look at the Public Service. Let us look at it 10 years ago. In one year there was a 0.1 per cent increase. I might say we are delighted that Senator Hill is concerned about it. Those of us on the Government side have been concerned about that for the whole of the year. In fact, we are very concerned to make sure that the equal opportunity legislation which covers the Public Service is making a difference and having its effect. Senator Hill said that women should be rising in all these positions. We point out that part of our legislation insists on the principle of merit as well as the principle of opportunity. It may well be that there were not enough candidates with the necessary qualifications. It may well be that there were no vacancies. We cannot ask people to create vacancies in the public or private sector just to get the numbers up. I could conclude from what Senator Hill said, but I will not, that the Opposition is after quotas and that it will not be satisfied until it sets quotas and insists on them. The Government in its affirmative action and equal opportunity legislation insists that the legislation and increased opportunities for women be based on the principle of merit. If honourable senators read a number of reports and figures from the private sector, let alone the public sector, they will certainly see that any number of people are delighted with the increased representation of women in senior managerial positions in firms, large organisations, or in their own businesses. I would have thought it was fairly clear that the increased number of women in business, management, consultancies and banking, to name just a few sectors, is clear evidence that what Senator Hill is saying is a nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Hill said that because the Government has a national agenda, which does not say what it will do, it has a lack of commitment to women. He said that we have a health policy but we do not have the final report, that we have consulted with rural women, but that was a talkfest. That is a complete misunderstanding of what the Government is doing in those areas and it is a complete misrepresentation of the achievements of the Government in all those areas. Senator Hill forgets, for example, that in the area of health the first and greatest contribution of the Government was to introduce Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA> The more than one million people who were previously not covered under insurance are now covered and thousands of women with the principal responsibility of taking children or elderly parents or relatives to the doctor now have complete freedom from the anxiety associated with whether they can afford to pay the bill. That is one of the greatest contributions to the benefit of women made by the Government in the area of health. I have mentioned the increased and improved opportunities for women in education, which women and girls have been taking up. We do not have 50 per cent of women in tertiary institutions by default. We have it because women are choosing to undertake tertiary education because they have the opportunity to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Newman may well ask what it has to do with domestic violence, but Senator Hill led it in his case and I am simply running across some of his ground. If it was relevant for Senator Hill, I presume it is as relevant for me. Senator Hill seemed to suggest that people were at home being beaten up because of poverty; then he said that they were apparently being beaten up because they were not getting executive officer positions, a most illogical speech if ever I heard one. Thus licensed to wander, I will so wander, but I do not claim that it has anything to do with domestic violence. However, I thank Senator Newman for her interjection because it allows me to make that point nicely and clearly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the minutes left to me I would like also to pick up on what Senator Hill had to say about how women are not being affected by changes under the awards. He said that the Government was going to fix everything for women through changes to the awards. Was Senator Hill not around when the nurses' award was introduced? Does he not understand the campaign that actually got an award for nurses, got a career path for them, got benefits of increased payments for nurses and the work they have been doing such as have never been there before? That was an extraordinary achievement and an absolutely fantastic effort by nurses on their own behalf, particularly in view of the fact that their union has a composition of something like 96 per cent women. Senator Hill really ought to blush for getting that example wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the enormous restructuring currently being undertaken by the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and already in place in some parts of the Public Service will see considerable increases in opportunities for women who are largely in the same segregation of jobs as they have ever been-in sales, services and clerical positions. Previously in those sections of work force participation, women could expect very little opportunity for advancement. Under the award restructuring, career paths will open to them. That is precisely what we have argued for; that is, increased opportunities and financial return for women in the work force will open up, not only under the benefits of the affirmative action legislation and the agency and the changes that firms, public and private organisations, will be making, but also under the award restructuring changes that are currently being developed within the ACTU and already, as I understand it, within the Commonwealth Public Service. For the edification of Senator Hill, it is my understanding that award restructurings at the lower end of the Commonwealth Public Service have led to something like 100-plus job classifications being reduced to eight, but I will not be held to those figures. Those changes mean that there are now career paths for people in those new classifications. Those career paths allow not only increased work participation and new work opportunities, but also increased remuneration for that work. We thank Senator Hill for drawing that to our attention too. For those women who choose to work, who have to work or who get into the work force for whatever reason, there are very many more opportunities under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Women are most appreciative of the changes put in place for them by the Government and they are also aware of the shortfall because much is still to be done. However, to come in here and say that women reckon we have done nothing is absolutely false in the extreme and extraordinarily simplistic. Women are now saying that they have a voice, that they have a government that listens, a government that has implemented any number of opportunities for them, a government that has provided child care places. The Government has increased the number of child-care places from some 43,000 to 110,000, with another 30,000 promised over the next four years. It has enormously encouraged women and tried to assist them to get into the work force through its specifically targeted programs like the jobs, education and training program (JET), the planning and implementation stage of which is well under way, so as to provide the opportunities and training and back into training and retraining into the work force for women who have been long term unemployed or single parents. The Government's commitment to women is there. If we have failed at all it is because we have still more to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We make no apology about it. That is why we have the Office for the Status of Women. That is why we have a Minister representing the status of women. Quite clearly we do not expect to correct in six years the insufficiencies of years of Liberal opposition. The Liberal Party never gave women opportunities. It still thinks, if I read correctly its new platform dreaming of the past, that women live in the home and enjoy the dependent spouse rebate if they are lucky enough to have it passed across to them. I do not quite understand from reading the Opposition's policy document what it will do for this hypothetical small percentage of women, but I noticed as I read the document that something like two column inches were devoted to child-care. If our policies are insufficient, I would not hold my breath with respect to the Opposition's plans, unless we can expect a future `future' document that will spell out the future `future' directions and we hold our breath and wait for it. In the meantime, we have addressed those problems. We have recognised the importance of women. We have created child-care places. We know so much more is to be done, but the Government has a commitment to 30,000 extra-child care places. It quite clearly appreciates that in a few years we cannot cover the full takeup of child-care requirements. It also appreciates that child care is of critical importance to women whether they are going to use it in the occasional care way or for full term employment. Women have made choices of all sorts about how they will live, about when they will have their families and how they will have them and whether they will go back to work full time or part time or whether for some years they will use child-care only in the occasional care way. There are provisions and a recognition of the diversity of women's lives under our policy.</PARA></TALK.START>

Being present at the press conference, I can assure her that the assertions in her motion were totally untrue. I give her a little advice. In the future, if the honourable senator does not intend to do any research on her own motion, then she should at least have the decency to tell the Senate that she does not know something for sure, that she has heard it from someone else.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have had the Parliamentary Library do a check, and Senator Crowley tells me that is a lie. I would be interested to know on which occasion Senator Crowley claims she has spoken on domestic violence. She has also never asked a question on domestic violence. The only time she has ever used the words in this place was on an urgency motion on videos and she used one sentence only. She has never shown any interest in this Senate in domestic violence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, Senator Reynolds, has also never spoken in this place on domestic violence. Indeed, the only time Senator Reynolds used the word `violence' in this Senate was in regard to the referendum. This is pretty indicative of the Government's concerns, and it seems to me that what we have seen tonight in the completely untrue statements in the motion put by Senator Crowley is nothing more than rank hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem the Government has is that Senator Hill travelled around the country discussing this matter, and at a press conference he said that women were concerned primarily about the economic issues-hard issues such as home interest rates and the drop in living standards. He said that he was surprised domestic violence had not been raised, not that he would call it a soft issue. He said that women were highlighting the causes of domestic violence. Senator Crowley has said tonight that Senator Hill was-I think these were her words-`widely wrong' in saying that the stress of economic issues created domestic violence. Perhaps we ought to look at someone who has a little more expertise in this area than Senator Crowley. Let us turn to the Institute of Family Studies. On 5 January this year, the Institute said:</PARA>
<PARA>Domestic violence is now so widespread police must use all their powers to deal with families in crisis. . . Australia needed a major change in social values, among the public and on the part of State authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Edgar, the Institute's Director, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the removal of poverty, unemployment and poor living conditions which fuelled family stress lay at the base of any attempt to reduce community violence. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Crowley, when Senator Hill comments in that area, says he is `widely wrong'. What absolute rubbish. Is it any wonder the Government is getting nowhere when it is not prepared to listen to people like Dr Edgar and the Institute of Family Studies and is incapable even of attempting to look for the causes of domestic violence? All it is prepared to do is use the bandaid methods. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crowley spoke widely tonight about the shelters the Government has funded, but it has not carried out the basic requirement of looking at the causes of violence. Indeed, it has fuelled the causes. We all know what a dreadful mess the economy is in. We all know living standards have dropped. We all know that families are now worse off by $58 as week. We all know that housing interest rates have gone up to 16 per cent and that the stress on families is quite horrific. Is it any wonder that, as the Institute says, domestic violence is now so widespread that police must use all their powers to deal with families in crisis?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has done nothing. I would just like to go through the Government's approach to domestic violence. On 25 May 1988 Senator Reynolds first said that the Government had set aside $1.6m for a national education campaign to reduce the incidence of domestic violence. She did not say that in this place but in the public arena. That does not come into effect until April this year. We have had a 12-month lapse. Let me go on. On 29 August last year Senator Reynolds put out another news release following the domestic violence survey. She said, `We found in Australia that one in five people think it is all right for a man to give his wife a bit of a bash up in certain circumstances'-one of them being if she does not obey him. That is a horrific figure. She again reiterated her May statement when she said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has allocated $1.6m over three years-</PARA>
<PARA>that is a lot of money-</PARA>
<PARA>to be spent on the domestic violence campaign. The first stage of the campaign will be designed to lift awareness of domestic violence issues. </PARA>
<PARA>So we are getting on through the year; we have not actually done anything yet. On 30 August, Dr Paul Wilson of the Australian Institute of Criminology pleaded with the Government to do something about domestic violence. He pointed out that domestic violence was a major crime in Australia, responsible for many assaults and for between 30 and 40 per cent of all murders. Senator Reynolds again said, `We have got that $1.6m to be spent over three years in this area'. When Mr Shanahan pointed out that there was a great need for education, Senator Reynolds said, `Well, that could be done through such television programs as A Country Practice'. The mind boggles, and the Government still has its $1.6m waiting to be spent. </PARA>
<PARA> That was in August. In November last year, we got another news release from the Office of the Status of Women. Senator Reynolds again talked about her $1.6m. She stated:</PARA>
<PARA>From January 1989, the Government will establish a network of Information Officers in each State and the Northern Territory . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is aiming, we were told, to raise public awareness from January 1989 and a range of public education materials will be prepared. It is now February and I do not think many people have seen them. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is all to be done in April; but the Minister's first announcement was made in May last year. So over a period of 12 months the Minister has been working up to this tremendous $1.6m, to be spent over three years, this vast sum of money. The Minister has been telling the people of Australia about this domestic violence situation for over 12 months-and has been doing absolutely nothing. The Minister stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The National Education Program will include multi-lingual material and give special consideration to the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, and women living in rural and remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA>All that will be done on $1.6m over three years. It will be a good campaign, will it not? Then on 26 November last year we finally had an advertisement in the newspaper. The advertisement was headed `Community Project Grants'. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Grants will be made in amounts between $250 and $5000 . . . Selected projects should be timed to coincide with the Government's Domestic Violence National Awareness Month in April 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>So still no money has been spent, and the Minister started last May. We have been having a running commentary on what the Government was going to do in 12 months time. The $1.6m now depleted by the 7.7 per cent inflation rate is beginning to look a bit small. It has been 12 months since the original announcement. Is it any wonder, as Senator Hill said, that the women and the women's groups are fed up with the Government? Is it any wonder that people such as Eva Cox made such criticisms of the Office of the Status of Women? She stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Labor Government in 1983 moved the unit back to the Prime Minister's portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> The name was changed from the Office of Women's Affairs to the Office of the Status of Women. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Yet five years later, there is considerable disquiet about the office and its effectiveness. References are made to the Office of Women of Status, and expressions of surprise that it still exists are fairly common. </PARA>
<PARA>That is because the people out in the community do not even know that it is in existence. She continued:</PARA>
<PARA> It is now often seen as peripheral. The main function seems to be telling women what the Government has done for them, not vice-versa. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not letting the women tell the Government what they want. She continued:</PARA>
<PARA> If the period had recorded many gains for women, maybe this lack of visability of the office would be acceptable. There have been some gains in the legislative area with the Sex Discrimination Act and the Affirmative Action legislation. We have had five years of child care expansion . . . </PARA>
<PARA> But women are losing in a range of important areas. The only universal payment to women, the Family Allowance, is now income tested; sole parents now lose pensions when their children turn 16; custodial parents may now be compelled to claim maintenance or lose their pensions; introduction of fees and tertiary taxes are reducing female participation in post-school education; childcare programs . . . are still on shaky ground and their expansion has slowed. </PARA>
<PARA> It's on the economic side that the losses are occurring. And it is in this area that the office seems to be least effective. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Under Malcolm Fraser, there was a powerful National Women's Advisory Council which spoke out against government decisions and represented its constituency. The present National Women's Consultative Council certainly does not seem to have the access to the Prime Minister and the media . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Eva Cox has expressed very clearly what the women of Australia feel. Is it any wonder that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has asked the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to moderate his language? Is it any wonder that the Prime Minister has said, `I want you all now to start using language that is acceptable to women because we are losing their vote hand over fist.'? It is an absolute insult to women to be told that the Government will get their votes back if Mr Keating uses pleasant language and does not use the sort of language that we are so used to hearing in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> Did the Federal Government set up a men's health forum as was done in Tasmania? The men's health forum in Tasmania had men, who were the perpetrators of domestic violence, coming and listening to many speeches and entering programs. I think that it would be a good idea if the Federal Government took some sort of similar action, because this forum occurred 12 or 18 months ago now. I am not quite sure when it was, but it was quite some time ago. It is about time that this Federal Government started that sort of forum throughout the country. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crowley said that if we have failed at all, it is just that we have still got more to do. I have never heard such a master understatement, because all this Government has done is give the rhetoric. It has done nothing about the problems, the causes of domestic violence. The only thing it has done is exacerbate them. It has created the stresses and strains within a family that, according to Dr Edgar, are the real reasons for domestic violence. The economy is in a dreadful mess. As Senator Crowley said a little while ago, this year for the first time under Labor we have 50 per cent of women in the work force. What an indictment! Those opposite should speak to many of the women. They say, `The only way I can keep my house is if I put my baby in a child-care centre and get out into the work force because it is impossible under this Government for a one-income family to own a house. So I have to leave my baby in a child-care centre and I have to get out and work to pay the high interest rates that this Government is imposing upon the women'. Senator Crowley has the hide to say what a great plus it is, what a great thing it is, that 50 per cent of the work force are now women. She calls that a great gain for this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Australian Democrats I wish to make a brief contribution to this debate. We consider this to be a debate on domestic violence, however I would say at the outset that we have the greatest difficulty with this motion because we see it as a motion which should not even be being pursued here tonight. There is a question mark over whether Senator Hill made the statements which are attributed to him. Indeed, I understand that he has made a personal explanation to that effect. Nevertheless, this is a motion concerning domestic violence and we did not want to let this debate go past without making a contribution. Although the Government has pursued this motion tonight and the Opposition has successfully negated the adjournment, it is, as I say, a motion which should not really be being dealt with. When it comes to the end of this parliamentary session and we are all sitting here until two o'clock in the morning rushing through important social security legislation which no doubt will be designed to assist the very people who are addressed in this motion, the Democrats will be reminding both the Liberal-National Party Opposition and the Government of this sort of wasting of the time of the Parliament with what tend very often to be mischievous motions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nevertheless, while Senator Hill may have been misquoted-he says he has been misquoted, which is an experience most of us in this chamber have shared with him at one time or another-in essence the sentiments expressed in this motion ring quite true. All too often it is the case with the Liberal-National Party Opposition that the only `real issues' seem to be the solid economic issues, the bottom line, the trade balance or the Budget surplus. This also applies to the Australian Labor Party in government-a matter of great regret and distress to many groups in the community that are still battling for survival in their daily lives. Due attention is not given either by the Government or by the Opposition to the issues of genuine concern to people in their daily lives. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crowley, in her contribution, admitted that women in this community are constantly asking for more. It is true that in many areas this Government has taken some steps, where it can, and I think we should note at this point that the majority of necessary legislation specific to child abuse and to domestic violence falls within the purview of our colleagues at the State level. Nevertheless, in those areas where the Federal Government can affect the daily lives of people, particularly those struggling to get out of poverty and support themselves financially, this Government has taken some action. It has had to be pushed, and amongst the groups pushing it hardest have been the Australian Democrats along with various groups in the welfare sector and in the women's movement. One should acknowledge action where it has been taken-for instance, in relation to refuges and the general shelter movement. On the other hand, we have had the recent report of the Human Rights Commission and Mr Burdekin into child homelessness. Surely nothing could be more violent than a situation in which tens of thousands of young children are out on the streets. Increasing numbers of children are living in poverty. Bringing children into this world and then not being able to support them is a violent act in itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, women are asking for more and they must continue to do so while there is deprivation in our community-and indeed there still is deprivation in our community. One of the things the Government has attempted to do has been to provide employment. The Democrats believe that the claims the Government makes about its success in these areas are wildly exaggerated. One of the things that disturb us most is that the Government and the Opposition and most political and economic commentators in our community seem to have accepted about a 7 per cent to 8 per cent plateau of unemployment as though that were adequate. It is not adequate. It is not much more than 15 years ago that we were horrified to see unemployment beginning to creep up above 2 per cent. In 1970 I recall going to the United States of America to live for a time. I went from a country which had less than 2 per cent unemployment to a country that had 6 per cent unemployment, and I was horrified. Now we cannot get it back below that. Just as an aside, when the latest employment figures came out, closely followed by the latest inflation figures, it was appalling to see most of the economic and political commentators throwing their hands up in the air and saying, `If people get more jobs they will spend more money and there will be more pressure on the economy', almost as if we have to keep people in poverty and out of jobs in order to balance our Budget. I consider that to be an exercise in community violence. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one area that the Democrats would like to draw attention to in this debate. As we all know, the committee on violence came out with its first report during the parliamentary break. That report is very factual and it really should bring us all up to a pretty short and sharp start. It is a slim volume and it is packed with frightful information on domestic assault and child abuse. I wish to refer to one comment at the end of the section on domestic violence, violence in the home. This section tells us that about 25 per cent of all homicides are marital killings; that almost all child homicide victims are killed by fellow family members; that almost 60 per cent of all homicides occur in the home; that almost 40 per cent of family killings involve firearms; that a prior history of domestic assault occurs in almost one half of all marital homicides; and so on. In a little section headed `Australian attitudes to violence in the home' we find:</PARA>
<PARA>The information presented so far suggests that violence in the home is not a rarity. Moreover, attitudinal studies show that such violence is widely tolerated in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that comment more than any other comment in this report is the one that we should really pay close attention to. The committee on violence has given us this information, and we have seen other surveys earlier which have indicated it. We must take it seriously. We must understand, as much as we might find it abhorrent, that violence is to a disturbing degree an accepted part of our social fabric and we must do something about that. We must do all of the things that the Government is attempting to do; we must do all of the things that the Opposition says that it would like to do; we must do all of the things that all of us would like to do. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to mention one point that has not been raised in this debate. We must seriously get into developing and establishing a program of peace education in our community. We must look at non-violent optional means of conflict resolution. Conflict is an integral part of everybody's daily lives. We cannot get rid of conflict but we can work out ways to deal with it which will mean that people do not beat up on each other. That is what peace education is about. I am a Victorian. I can say that Victoria leads the way. I have already said that most of the initiatives that will really address the fundamental issues that are raised in this motion are in the hands of State governments. The State Government in Victoria has developed not only a good policy but also a good program. A peace education resource centre backs up those schools and those teachers who introduce programs of peace education in their schools, supported by their school communities, by parents and by the community at large. Other governments around Australia have policies, such as the Western Australian Government and the South Australian Government, but they are not acting on those policies. The former New South Wales Labor Government developed curriculum material and it was ready to go. That material is now gathering dust on Greiner's bookshelves, or somewhere deep in a cellar. Of course, we need not mention Queensland or Tasmania in this context. We need to think about these kinds of solutions as well as the more traditional approaches which have been part and no doubt will continue to be part of this debate for a long time. Those are the two major points that we would like to make. </PARA>
<PARA> In underlining our concern about the acceptability of what we consider extraordinarily unacceptable rates of unemployment, a couple of other points should be made. One is that the greatest single category in murders-whether victims or perpetrators-is the unemployed, so we must get unemployment down. We would also like to comment on the assertion, by Senator Newman particularly, from the Opposition benches that the only reason that the participation rate of women in employment is rising is that women simply cannot afford not to be employed. I assume that Senator Newman is here because she cannot afford not to be and that her other female colleagues are only here to keep the wolf from the door. There are other reasons why women wish to be in employment, one of those being so that they can be independent, individual human beings upon whom the male members of this society might think twice before perpetrating an act of violence. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Australian Democrats do not accept the shining record of the Government which has been put forward by Senator Crowley. In this past couple of days we have found it very insulting that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) have decided to woo the women's vote by simply watching their language. On the other hand, they cannot find time to go and open the women's tax summit at the weekend, and they have pushed Jenny Acton aside to let Simon Crean in. There are all sorts of similar evidence; it is not a perfect record by any means. Unemployment must be removed and we must get into peace education. Those are perhaps two additional messages that we would like to insert. I quote from the latest newsletter of the Women's Electoral Lobby which has a rather delightful section on its back page entitled `Pig Pen'. Here is a quote from Justice John Gallop in the Australian Capital Territory on a custody case which was reported in the Canberra Times last Christmas Eve. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Despite some serious errors of judgement in the past-such as taking the children to peace rallies and demonstrations-she had emerged as the parent who was more emotionally mature . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Until we can get rid of attitudes like that, until we can take seriously a different approach, we will never get rid of this problem of domestic violence. The Australian Democrats feel it is unfortunate that this debate did not take place in the context of something less opportunistic than this motion. However, we wish to indicate our serious concern about this most vital issue in our community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief. This campaign will run for three years. The first year related to research. It is vitally important that we know what we are working with. It is pointless just to say that we will have a domestic violence awareness campaign if we do not know the attitudes in the community. So, yes, we did spend over 12 months on our research. But we believe that that research is the vital foundation on which to build the next stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are now in the second stage, which will culminate in the domestic violence awareness month in April. There are projects all around Australia. We are working with local government, police, doctors and community health centres. We are working with a wide range of community organisations and representatives of women's organisations to try to get the Australian community to appreciate that this is a community concern. It is not an issue for political point scoring; it is not an issue for narrowly saying that this is the cause or that is the cause. A number of issues lead to domestic violence, but it is the acceptance of domestic violence in the Australian community that we as a government and as a parliament have a responsibility to address. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot accept a situation in which many women can be threatened in their own homes. We cannot turn around and say that that is acceptable. Our research showed that one in five believe that it is acceptable. People believe that domestic violence is a private matter. This is all related to attitudes-attitudes to women and attitudes to the relationship between men and women. </PARA>
<PARA> The important thing about our domestic violence awareness campaign, which will start in April and have a focus for the month, is that we will then go on to other programs. I am prepared to put on the public record that I want to see a higher budgetary commitment for the domestic violence awareness campaign. Domestic violence is an enormous problem. It is a problem that is greater than we imagined when former Senator Susan Ryan first argued for $1.6m to be put aside in the 1987-88 Budget. The important thing to understand tonight is that we might have started to turn around what began as a debate that, frankly, I did not find particularly edifying-not because it was a political debate and things were said critical of the Government but because I believe that the issues involved in domestic violence go way beyond the Government and Opposition arguing about what we have done and what the Opposition might do in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today in Question Time Senator Collins asked a question of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) regarding the imposition of fees in the Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory. Both the question and the answer were very simplistic. They did not cover the very real issue that has been current in the Northern Territory for quite some time. The levying of entry fees in the Kakadu National Park has caused a great deal of community concern throughout the Northern Territory. It has had impositions in a whole number of areas. From the way in which the question was phrased and the answer was given anyone would think that the players in the game this year had been Senator Collins, Mr Snowdon from the House of Representatives and Senator Richardson. That is not the case. There are hundreds of Territorians who felt vitally affected and who made representations. The industry groups, particularly from the tourist industry, were very vocal and certainly made many representations to Senator Richardson. The fact that the matter was quite widely discussed throughout the community, the fact that the Northern Territory Government and various Ministers also became involved, certainly showed that the issue required urgent and prominent attention by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Anyone who looked carefully at Senator Richardson's reply today would think that the issue rested only on permits for commercial filming and still photography, adult entry fees for the use of the park, and the fact that, to quote Senator Richardson, `there were a few complaints from some of the operators'. The controversy relating to the fee was such that it was initiated by the Minister and the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS). The debate was over the level of fees and the imposition and the types of fees. Senator Richardson implied that a park use fee of $5 was put in place at the last minute. That fee was struck after much more onerous fees had been suggested and looked at. Of course, there are now also user pays fees for camping and other facilities that are used. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that the traditional owners of the area, who are largely represented through the Gagudju Association, recently posted a letter on noticeboards in the Jabiru township. The letter was addressed to the Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service in Canberra. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Gagudju is opposed to the imposition of the new park fee on Jabiru people and other people resident within the external park boundaries for most day use activities. </PARA>
<PARA>Gagudju believes these people should be able to undertake day sightseeing, picnic and fishing trips free of charge. </PARA>
<PARA>Beyond the question of whether the fees are appropriate or not other questions should be considered. </PARA>
<PARA>Will aboriginal staff of the N.L.C. and other non-local aboriginal residents be expected to pay?</PARA>
<PARA>Will off-duty park staff pay?</PARA>
<PARA>Gagudju feels not only are the fees unfair for most day use activities but the inevitable discrimination in application has dangerous implications for A.N.P.W.S. staff and general town harmony. </PARA>
<PARA>Please reconsider urgently. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA>JESSIE ALDERSON</PARA>
<PARA>Chairman. </PARA>
<PARA>Mrs Alderson, the Chairman of the Association, has posted this notice on noticeboards around Jabiru and has added the words `For the information of Jabiru people', and a further signature `Jessie Alderson'. It is quite clear that the ANPWS did not consult as widely as it ought, or as properly as it ought, with the Aboriginal local residents of the community, the Jabiru people or the Northern Territory commercial and residential community. </PARA>
<PARA> The controversy was profound. It is still going on. Whilst there have now been certain exceptions put in place for residents of the township of Jabiru, that now makes two classes of Territory citizens. Other Territorians throughout the Northern Territory regularly use the facilities of the Kakadu National Park for many recreational and other reasons; yet, because they might live a short distance away down the Arnhem Highway, different sets of fees are to be imposed for the use of the Kakadu National Park. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly want Jabiru residents excluded, just as I would like all Territory residents excluded. There are many other situations throughout Australia in which national park fees also need to be carefully addressed. I think it iniquitous that Labor Government members find that they can accept these fees for imposition across the whole situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the Minister did not cover all of the fees that had been put. As I said, his reply was simplistic in that he left out many. Another fee which has recently been imposed through the ANPWS is an additional fee on visitors to the Kakadu National Park who go on commercial water cruises. Additional fees and imposts are now being put in place and are causing concern not only to the tourists who have already paid the upfront adult fee and who are now required to pay an additional fee, but also to tour operators, who have had to plan and commercially set their tariffs and structures well in advance. This state of affairs has been imposed. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish to comment on the point that other representations have been made largely through the Northern Territory Minister for Primary Industry and Fisheries, Mr Mike Reed, to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, regarding compensation for fishermen now displaced in the rivers of the Kakadu National Park. This again is a serious matter which the Minister has chosen to wipe aside. He has attempted to transfer the responsibility back to the Northern Territory Government when the executive action rests with the Minister himself, his Department and the ANPWS. The Federal Government obviously is acting outside its moral obligations. It is attempting to buck-pass all these situations. It is obvious that the recent moves by Senator Richardson are such that he should come to the Territory and face the people who are making these strong, urgent representations that need to be considered. But no, the Australian Labor Party is determined to raise whatever funds it can, wherever it sees an increase in something that is profitable or successful. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) Did the Attorney-General's Office receive on 2 July 1987, from John Doohan of 21 Bartlett Street, Willagee, Western Australia, an Australia Post registered letter, with relevant documentation requesting the Attorney-General to inquire into serious allegations, by John Doohan, of illegal, improper actions by the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO) and other Australian Commonwealth agencies?</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Did the Attorney-General receive, from Senator Jo Vallentine, 2 letters dated 14 August and 8 September 1987, respectively, requesting the Attorney-General to urgently inquire into John Doohan's allegations referred to in (1) above?</PARA>
<PARA> (3) If answers to (1) and (2) above are yes, will the Attorney-General explain why he has not answered the above referred to requests by John Doohan and Senator Vallentine?</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Did the Attorney-General on or about 9 July, decline to accede to a request by the Director of Public Prosecutions, for copies of John Doohan's letter of request for inquiry and relevant documentation, on the Attorney-General's stated grounds that his office was not aware of any correspondence received from John Doohan; if so, for what reasons did the Attorney-General deny receipt of John Doohan's letter of request for inquiry into serious allegations against ASIO and other named agencies?</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Did John Doohan's letter and relevant material allege that, for many years, ASIO and other named Australian Commonwealth agencies have been covertly compiling and maintaining, on himself, medically unqualified untruthful detrimental psychiatric and `personal defect' assessment and opinion records; if so, will the Attorney-General confirm or deny, (a) whether any mental assessments or opinions about John Doohan are contained in any report or record held now, or at any time, within ASIO, Australian Federal Police or any other Commonwealth agency or Department, including his own Department; and (b) if the answer to (a) is yes, (i) was such assessment or opinion obtained from an appropriately qualified medical authority, and (ii) when, how and by whom was it obtained?</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Did John Doohan's letter to the Attorney-General contain a copy of a medical examination report by a registered professionally practising Australian psychiatrist, certifying that in the psychiatrist's opinion and contrary to Commonwealth covert records, John Doohan in no way suffers from any type of mental illness, disorder or abnormality?</PARA>
<PARA> (7) If the answer to (6) above is yes, then; (a) has the Attorney-General any valid reason to disagree with the medical opinion expressed in the medical report referred to in (6), above; and (b) if the Attorney-General's answer to (a) is yes, will he explain why?</PARA>

<PARA> (9) Will the Attorney-General explain why Commonwealth Police and succeeding Federal Police forces, also maintained such false detrimental records, about John Doohan, in the covert files of `C' Division, Criminal Investigation Bureau, when he rightfully should have no criminal record of any description?</PARA>
<PARA> (10) Will the Attorney-General advise whether, John Doohan is regarded by his office, or by any Australian law enforcement or security force or agency, as a national security risk or subject?</PARA>
<PARA> (11) Does the Attorney-General intend to inquire into the allegations presented to him, or those which may subsequently be presented to him by John Doohan; if not, will the Attorney-General explain his reasons for refusing to make the inquiry?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator Tate</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I replied to Mr Doohan and to Senator Vallentine on 24 December 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions wrote to the Attorney-General's Department on 9 July 1987 seeking copies of attachments to Mr Doohan's letter to the Attorney-General after the Director had received from Mr Doohan a copy of that letter. The Director's Office was initially informed that no representations had been received from Mr Doohan because the Director's letter and Mr Doohan's letter had been referred to different Divisions of the Department for attention. The reason for this was that Mr Doohan's letter and attachments mainly related to alleged infringements of human rights whereas the Director's letter related to alleged infringements of the criminal law. When this was discovered the Director's Office was supplied with relevant documents on 10 August 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Mr Doohan's letter does allege that Commonwealth agencies have been covertly compiling false psychiatric/psychological reports and opinions and some of the documents attached to Mr Doohan's letter contain opinions about his mental state. These appear to have been based on the personal views of persons who were not medical practitioners. I am not aware of the existence of documents containing medical opinions as to Mr Doohan's mental condition.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) I am not in a position to express any view on the medical opinion furnished by Mr Doohan.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) and (10) In accordance with the practice followed by successive governments I will not comment on Mr Doohan's allegations concerning ASIO, or whether an individual is or is not a national security risk.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) The police documents referred to by Mr Doohan and attached to his letter were prepared in response to his inquiries and allegations of telephone tapping. They are not criminal records.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) Mr Doohan's allegations have been examined by the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The Director of Public Prosecutions advised Mr Doohan that the material provided by him did not disclose anything upon which that Office could base a prosecution. The Attorney-General subsequently informed Mr Doohan that he had been advised by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission that the material forwarded to it by the Department, which comprised copies of the documents forwarded to the Attorney-General by Mr Doohan, did not substantiate a breach of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and, consequently, that the Commission was unable to conduct any formal inquiry into his allegations.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Community Services and Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) 17; (a) 5; (b) 1; (c) 9; (d) $54, 154 was the mean value of the severance payments made to the individuals concerned; (e) Ages ranged from 53 to 57.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Unattachment of staff can occur for a variety of reasons other than becoming surplus to requirements (e.g. maternity leave, staff development programs, extended leave without pay) and a consolidated record of such staff is not readily available, particularly as staffing is now controlled by salary allocations and Average Staffing Levels (ASL) and not by position occupancy. However, no officers have been placed below their substantive level since July 1987. Eight officers have been offered early retirement packages, with a mean value of $33,284 in severance payments. Ages of the officers ranged from 54 to 60.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) All officers have been and are gainfully employed and, because of this, specific retraining programs have not been developed.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Department was required to effect total staff savings of 335 as a result of the amalgamation of the former Departments of Health and Community Services, together with elements of the former Department of Housing and Construction.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) Federal assistance to the States for hospital services in 1987-88 was provided under a number of Commonwealth programs. Some funding was specifically identified with public hospital services. In addition, an unspecified but significant amount was included in the financial assistance grants.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal funding readily identified for public hospital services in Queensland in 1987-88 was:</PARA>
<PARA>$</PARA>
<PARA> Identified Health Grants...139,316,000</PARA>
<PARA> Medicare Compensation Grants...84,695,000</PARA>

<PARA>234,102,000</PARA>
<PARA> In addition Queensland received, by way of subvention to its State budget, a financial assistance grant of $2,414.3 million in 1987-88 to assist in financing State outlays including expenditure on hospital services.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Most of the money provided by the Commonwealth to the States for their public hospital systems is in the form of untied general support grants, and in that sense, the Commonwealth cannot be prescriptive about its detailed application. This principal applied to the Medicare Compensation Grants and the Identified Health Grants. Funding under specific purpose hospital grants, such as the Waiting List Assistance Program or the Teaching Hospitals Capital Equipment Program, were subject to States meeting certain requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> The information required by the Commonwealth from the States in relation to such programs generally included details of the project or activities to be undertaken to ensure compliance with program objectives; outcome data to assess the impact; periodic acquittal of grants and certification that the money has been used for the purposes for which it was given.</PARA>
<PARA> The same conditions and evaluation requirements will apply to the Waiting List Assistance Program in 1988-89, the Hospital Enhancement Program over the next three years and the Incentive Package components in the new Medicare Hospital Funding arrangements with the States and Territories.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) to (4) In 1978 when the Government approved the Iwasaki tourist development at Yeppoon, foreign investment policy requirements were more restrictive than those applying now.</PARA>
<PARA> Development of the resort has progressed, albeit slowly, and for a time the developers reported annually to the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) on its progress, consistent with a condition of the foreign investment approval for the project.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 24 August 1988:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Will the Minister confirm that, according to Mr Barry Coulter, `Cumulative uncommitted demand for uranium enrichment over the next 10 years is estimated at 37 million separate work units. The United States Department of Energy has lost half of the world's enrichment capacity since 1975 . . . The door is wide open for Australia to develop competitive enrichment'; if so, can that assessment be reconciled with a statement in the Nuclear Engineering International December 1987 (page 42):</PARA>
<PARA> `Production capacity will be more than sufficient to meet requirements until 1995. By the end of the century, the projected capacity will be some 8 percent lower than expected demand. Whilst it might appear that new facilities might therefore be needed before the end of the next decade, the mothballed diffusion capacity in the United States would be sufficient to cover the excess demand.'; and if not, which statement is correct.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The form of words used by Mr Coulter are his own, particularly with respect to ``competitive enrichment''. However, the two statements to which the honourable senator refers are not necessarily inconsistent. As the Nuclear Engineering article points out, world enrichment capacity exceeds projected demand at least into the late 1990's. The Northern Territory statement, however, refers to uncommitted or uncontracted demand, inferring that some of this demand might be secured by new entrants to the enrichment industry at the expense of existing enrichment plants.</PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that in a situation of substantial overcapacity the establishment of a new enrichment plant would involve major financial risk. The overcapacity situation led to the decision of the US Department of Energy earlier this year to permanently close its Oak Ridge enrichment plant which had been maintained in a standby mode since 1985. There are of course other uncertainties in the enrichment market discouraging new investment including the fact that the economics of established enrichment technologies may well be affected by the development of new technology which is the subject of research in a number of countries.</PARA>

<PARA> This assistance is usually `in kind', rather than in direct financial assistance. Examples of the type of assistance given are:</PARA>
<PARA> In January 1987 $100 cash was donated to Rawlinna Primary School to assist with purchase of greenhouse equipment. The school had been awarded the greenhouse as a prize from `Greening Australia (WA)'.</PARA>
<PARA> Assistance with electricity is provided to the `Cook Basketball Association'-no charge is made for the first 200 units each four weeks.</PARA>
<PARA> In December 1986 free freight was granted to the Alice Springs Rotary Club which staged `Henley-On-Todd' activities in Fremantle during the course of the America's Cup Challenge to assist with fundraising for `Polio Plus', an international project. Free freight involved the transportation of `Battleships' to Perth and return with the AN proportion being to the value of approximately $3,000. (The West Australian Government Railway agreed to a 50% discount on its leg).</PARA>
<PARA> In May 1986 the Commission agreed to support the Tarcoola Community Development Council's community swimming pool project with a subsidy of $5,000.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Has the Australian Government sought assistance, advice or formal evidence from a former Conservative Member of the British House of Commons, Mr Monte Woodhouse, concerning the fate of an Australian-born army captain `Bunny' Warren, alleged by newspaper reports to have been shot in May 1944 during the course of duty.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Does that evidence show a prima facie involvement in the death of Captain Warren and about 12 others by the now President of Austria and former United Nations Secretary-General, Dr Kurt Waldheim.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) No. Mr Woodhouse's article was largely based on documents already known to the Australian Government.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The available information suggests that while there is no direct evidence implicating Dr Waldheim in the interrogation of Captain Warren he was nevertheless possibly aware of the decision to execute Captain Warren and may in fact have contributed to this decision through written comments he is alleged to have made on the interrogation report.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Australian Government is awaiting the results of the enquiry by the British Ministry of Defence before considering any further action.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Collins Radio Constructors Incorporated is contracted to the Government of the United States of America at the Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap (JDFPG). The Company has no contract with the Department of Defence.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Company employees who need access to JDFPG require clearance to the appropriate security level in accordance with the requirements contained in the Defence Personnel Security Manual from which the relevant provisions of the Defence Industrial Security Manual derive. The provisions of the Standard Request for Tender Manual are not applicable.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The level of security clearance is determined by the nature of the work undertaken and the requirement to have access to classified material and information.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Yes. Security clearance requirements for access to the JDFPG secure area contribute to Australia's national security. They are determined in accordance with government policy and are consistent with the Government's view of the value of Australian citizenship. In addition, for a security check to be meaningful the persons being cleared must have spent a reasonable period of their lives in circumstances that are checkable. In relation to JDFPG, which is a joint Australian/US facility, a security clearance is a prerequisite, by international agreement, for all employed within the facility, including staff engaged by private contractors, such as Collins. I might add that provisions exists to waive the citizenship requirement should it be considered in the national interest to do so.</PARA>

<PARA> Is the Minister aware of the inconsistency in his Government's policy whereby this country now has an exemplary position on the conservation of our own tropical moist forests, by the proclamation of the ``Wet Tropics'' as World Heritage, but still continues to allow the importation of timber and timber products which are derived from the unsustainable exploitation of primary tropical forests and cause the ethnocide of tribal people like the Penan of Sarawak; if so, what is the Government's position on these imports and what is it doing to stop them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia does not impose special conditions on the importation of rainforest timbers including those sourced from Malaysia referred to in the honourable senator's question.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia, along with the major consuming and producing nations of tropical timbers, is a member of the International Tropical Timbers Organisation (ITTO). This Organisation provides an effective framework for co-operation and consultation for the development of national policies directed, among other things, at:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the sustainable utilisation and conservation of tropical forests and their genetic resources; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the maintenance of the ecological balance in the regions concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> Since becoming a member of the ITTO and its Council, Australia has argued strongly for the development of responsible forest management policies and practices and has encouraged producing nations to pay greater attention to the environmental values of their tropical forests.</PARA>
<PARA> Among the many initiatives taken by the ITTO, at its most recent meeting in November 1988, the Permanent Committee on Reforestation and Forest Management earmarked funds for major research projects to investigate:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) the conservation status of tropical timbers in trade, and;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) conservation concerns related to the diversification of timber species extracted from tropical forests.</PARA>
<PARA> The high priority that the ITTO is placing on conservation of tropical forests establishes a strong framework for further international action to be taken to reduce the unsustainable exploitation of these forests.</PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with the strong actions taken by the Commonwealth Government to protect our national rainforests I will be looking carefully, through our involvement in the ITTO and through other avenues, at practical steps that Australia can take to ensure that effective measures are put in place to conserve rainforests on a global scale.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator Button</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The principle objective of the Australian Wool Corporation is to increase the commercial returns to Australia's woolgrowers. This is achieved by a number of means including the facilitation of wool marketing. The marketing powers of the Corporation include to process or arrange for the processing of wool.</PARA>
<PARA> As such, the Corporation has recently become involved in a joint venture at Laverton, Victoria to scour Australian wools. The plant is utilising advanced scouring technology developed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and equipment manufactured in Australia. Market access for around half of the plant's output has been secured through one of the joint venture partners.</PARA>
<PARA> Through such participation in the processing sector the Corporation seeks to position woolgrowers in the manufacturing pipeline in order to protect their long term interests and to enhance the long term viability of Australian woolgrowing. The Corporation also provides advice to potential investors in the area of further value added processing.</PARA>
<PARA> Hence, the Corporation's approach is in line with the Government's stated policy of encouraging further processing activity in the wool sector provided there is sound economic potential.</PARA>
<PARA> Areas of activity such as further value added processing of Australia's rural raw materials are essential in generating employment and export earnings for Australia's future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. Shifts will be restructured so that accredited reactor engineers will not be on rostered duty as ``Reactor Shift Managers''. They will, however, be involved in a duty officer arrangement covering the period 5 p.m. to 8 a.m. with accommodation provided on site.</PARA>
<PARA> A duty officer is an officer or employee, located at the Lucas Heights site outside normal working hours, held in readiness to perform duties as required.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Staffing on shifts varies to meet workload requirements. Under the proposed arrangements, engineers will perform other day work of higher priority and higher engineering content, including planning and management of reactor operations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) It is assumed that Senator Archer's question refers to the first voyage of the current season rather than the maiden voyage of the vessel. The position is that the vessel reached her planned destination to:</PARA>
<PARA> deploy 33 expeditioners at Macquarie Island including the changeover wintering party and summer expeditioners;</PARA>

<PARA> the area of the South Magnetic Pole; and</PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth Bay(the Lady Franklin reached a position 130 nautical miles short of Commonwealth Bay).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The total estimated cost of the ship and fuel for the voyage, including a proportion of the deployment costs of the vessel to Australia, is approximately $421,000.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Helicopters are not used by all Antarctic voyages as the cost of using helicopters must be weighed against the benefit helicopters can provide on a particular voyage. The Lady Franklin does, however, have the capacity to carry helicopters and is approved by the Civil Aviation Authority for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The inability of the Lady Franklin to reach Commonwealth Bay meant that Mawson's hut could not be inspected, that reproduction of historical photographs could not be made and that additions to a field hut could not be completed. Ice conditions also prevented the conduct of an experiment designed to determine the exact current position of the South Magnetic Pole.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Firstly, your assertion that NASA is militarised is not accepted by this Government. NASA is a civilian space agency. Our Agreement with the US Government calls for ``a cooperative program facilitating space flight operations for the advancement and application of mutal scientific knowledge of man's spatial environment for the benefit of man and the development of advanced space vehicles.'' This intent remains unchanged and NASA's installations in Australia are limited to that goal.</PARA>
<PARA> Satisfied that our agreement with the US is intact, I fail to see what role this Government has in any NASA/ESA Agreements.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex (CDSCC) monitors NASA missions. It does not monitor military missions. In fact, our policy prevents the involvement of CDSCC in any military activities. Therefore, no support is provided to Space Shuttles carrying military satellites.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (4) Because of the real time nature of the activity, data acquired from NASA's scientific satellites and Shuttle missions is relayed directly to the relevant NASA operational control centres in the US. Records are kept of what satellites/missions are tracked and the number of tracks undertaken by each antenna.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yes, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel did rule out any establishment for new wage guidelines for Defence Force personnel outside national guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA> No, the Government does not intend to revise this stance. It is Government policy that the national wage guidelines be applied consistently and fully to all sectors of the workforce which are within the jurisdiction of industrial tribunals, including the Defence Force. To obtain the recent national wage case increases, the Australian Defence Force was required, and did give, a commitment not to pursue any claims outside the national wage case principles.</PARA>
<PARA> The Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal is an independent body and therefore the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel would be acting ultra vires to `direct' the Tribunal to undertake any task.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Defence Force already has in place a Work Value Project which is designed to conduct an empirical investigation and analysis of employment classifications and their relationships. This will facilitate the appropriate placement of employment classifications within the salary hierarchy in its present form. The application of the national wage case guidelines is not an issue relevant to these investigations. They become relevant only if the results are used as the basis for submissions to the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) A National Defence College is one of several options canvassed in a number of reports on Senior Officer Development produced in recent years within the ADF and by outside consultants.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) General Gration's comments were in the context of ADF Senior Officer Development options. A departmental study in 1986 made recommendations on higher level training and education for senior officers which included a concept for a National Defence College type institution. The Chiefs of Staff Committee endorsed the training and education requirement but agreed that the resources needed to establish an additional facility or major course of study could not be made available in the foreseeable future. A Steering Group was established to keep Senior Officer Development under review and this has led a change in focus of the Joint Services Staff College Course as well as consideration of a proposal for a short Joint Senior Officer Study Period, which would complement attendance at overseas Defence and War Colleges, single-Service Study Periods and overseas study visits. These changes notwithstanding, the advantages of a National Defence College for Australian self-reliant Defence remain, and the proposal will be re-examined when resources permit.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) As with all military equipment, the principal military advantage of the acquisition of larger numbers of submarines, ships or fighters is that the resulting force has a greater capability. The priority for acquiring a particular number of a specific type of equipment is assessed against the background of Australia's strategic and geographic circumstances and the policies that derive from them, including the equipment's potential role in the kind of military operation that an Australian Government could credibly direct the Australian Defence Force to perform, and competing priorities both within the Defence portfolio and more broadly within the areas of Government spending.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The earlier answer to this question, which was published in Hansard on 19 December 1988, pages 4561-66, inadvertently contained incorrect information for certain of the scrutinies. The answer was based on information supplied by the departments which undertook the scrutinies. The correct information for the scrutinies concerned is outlined below. The following summary information reflects these changes:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The total estimated net full-year staff saving for all scrutinies was 1 971.5 staff years; the total estimated net full-year financial saving was $135.1 million. The actual net full-year staff saving to date is 1 367 staff years; the actual net full-year financial saving to date is $88.8 million.</PARA>
<PARA>Commonwealth Reporting Service (CRS) (Attorney-General's Department)</PARA>
<PARA> The scrutiny identified an additional staff requirement of nine ASL, costing $198 000 per annum. The financial savings identified were of two types:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a saving of $500 000 in the funds required by portfolios for reporting services. This is a 10 per cent saving of the notional cost to portfolios before charges were introduced; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a saving of $1.3 million in CRS expenditure because of reduced demand flowing from the contraction in funds available.</PARA>
<PARA> No additional staff resources were provided and the additional workload has been absorbed, along with other implementation costs, into CRS operations.</PARA>
<PARA> The actual financial savings have been:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) $560 000; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the charges were introduced from 1 July 1988 and their effect on demand for services has not yet been felt. Any savings will be difficult to ascertain because of the effect of other efficiencies within CRS such as improved technology, efficiencies from the second tier salary negotiations, and improved management practices.</PARA>
<PARA>Service Personnel-direct credit of salaries (Department of Defence)</PARA>
<PARA>The scrutiny report estimated staff savings at 13 in 1987-88 and 49 in 1988-89. Implementation was expected to cost $0.194 million in 1986-87 and $0.708 million in 1987-88, with savings of $2.692 million in 1988-89 and $3.065 million in subsequent years.</PARA>
<PARA> The outcome is estimated to be staff savings of 17 in 1987-88 and 35 in 1988-89, a cost of $0.510 million in 1987-88, and savings of $1.341 million in 1988-89.</PARA>
<PARA> The reasons for the variations from estimated savings include the cost of additional computer hardware, higher than expected costs to develop software, slower than expected implementation for Navy personnel, and likely overestimates in the scrutiny report of cash delivery savings.</PARA>
<PARA>Pharmpay-(Department of Community Services and Health)</PARA>
<PARA>The scrutiny estimated that savings would amount to 293 staff by 1988-89. Gross savings were estimated at $8.4 million in a full year, with a cost of $2.0 million per annum for cash incentives to pharmacies. The staff savings achieved to date are indicated in the table below:</PARA>

<PARA>Design Work-Australian Construction Services (ACS) (Department of Administrative Services)</PARA>
<PARA>No staff savings were identified.</PARA>
<PARA>The scrutiny estimated that the additional return to revenue as a result of the introduction of revised fee scales for the non-budget sector would be $3 million.</PARA>
<PARA>The actual return to revenue in 1987-88 was $3.8 million more than the estimate of revenue prior to the introduction of the new fee scales.</PARA>
<PARA>First Home Owners Scheme (FHOS) (Department of Community Services and Health)</PARA>
<PARA>The Scrutiny recommended changes-which were subsequently introduced-estimated to save 44 staff in 1987-88 and a further 56 in 1988-89; in total a staff saving of approximately 25 per cent. The financial savings in salaries (including on-costs) and program outlays were estimated to be $1.35 million in 1987-88 and $6.0 million in the following two years.</PARA>
<PARA>The scrutiny recommendations were introduced in accordance with the approved timetable and the above savings for 1987-88 were achieved. Average staffing level and salary allocations for the administration of PHOS in 1988-89 have been reduced in accordance with the recommendations and the nominated savings are expected to be achieved this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA>Diesel Fuel Debate, Scheme (DFRS) (Australian Customs Service)</PARA>
<PARA>The scrutiny identified staff savings of 61 ASL. Financial savings were estimated at $12.77 million, broken down into $10.17 million for payments under the scheme and $2.60 million administrative costs.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government did not accept the recommendation to reduce payments under the scheme. This reduced the scope for savings to 45 ASL and $1.4 million.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1987-88 the actual impact was 33.3 ASL ($1.24 million). In 1988-89 the full saving of 45 ASL will be realised.</PARA>
<PARA>Corporate Services Division (Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet)</PARA>
<PARA>The scrutiny report identified scope for possible savings of up to 1.5 ASL in establishment record-keeping and accounts processing.</PARA>
<PARA>However, the machinery of government changes in July 1987 increased substantially the portfolio-wide responsibilities of the Corporate Services Division.</PARA>
<PARA>The scale of these changes and associated ASL adjustments meant that the resource implications of the scrutiny report were overtaken by events.</PARA>
<PARA>Technological Opportunities (Department of Social Security)</PARA>
<PARA>There are two components to this scrutiny. The office automation component includes the use of electronic mail. No staff savings were identified. The net financial estimates were a cost of $0.25 million in the first year, savings of $0.87 million in year two and savings of $1.15 million in the third and subsequent years. These savings will first apply in 1988-89.</PARA>
<PARA>The second component concerns use of Optical Character Recognition equipment to enable the automatic scanning of returned Continuation of Unemployment Benefit forms.</PARA>
<PARA>Implementation is now scheduled to commence on a progressive basis from March 1989, instead of the recommended date of July 1988.</PARA>
<PARA>Realisation of savings has consequently been delayed. The estimated staff savings are 15 positions in the first year, 40 positions in the second year, 30 positions in the third year and 20 positions in the fourth year. The net estimated financial effect of the proposal was a cost of $0.225 million in the first year and savings of $0.22 million in year two, $0.46 million in year three and $0.35 million in the fourth and subsequent years.</PARA>
<PARA>Each of the savings above has been identified as a contribution to the Department's commitment to achieve an efficiency dividend and savings due to the STRATPLAN re-equipment program. The figures quoted do not represent additional savings in the Department's forward estimates.</PARA>
<PARA>Overpayments-(Department of Veterans' Affairs)</PARA>
<PARA>The scrutiny report estimated savings of $3.3 million in 1987-88, after implementation costs and efficiency dividends; and $4.9 million in a full year thereafter.</PARA>
<PARA>The 1987-88 figure was subsequently increased to $4.0 million because the Government did not allow the efficiency dividend.</PARA>
<PARA>Improvement in overpayment processing procedures saved the Department of Veterans' Affairs $4 million in 1987-88 and is expected to result in a saving of $4 million in 1988-89. These savings are largely achieved by reducing the time taken to process pensioner initiated reviews which result in reductions.</PARA>
<PARA>Travel (Cross-department)</PARA>
<PARA>The scrutiny originally estimated that more than $40 million could be saved in a full year. This estimate was revised substantially prior to implementation because some recommendations were not taken up. Refinement of the original savings calculations reduced the estimates further.</PARA>
<PARA>Department's running costs budgets have been reduced by $5.4 million in 1987-88 and by $15 million in 1988-89 to reflect savings generated by this scrutiny. Savings are anticipated to rise to $17.5 million in 1989-90 and subsequent years. Apart from the recommendations which were not implemented the differences reflect that fact that the budgets for some agencies, such as the ACT Administration and some quasi-commercial authorities, have not been reduced because, for reasons of principle, funding for these agencies is subject to different budgeting disciplines. Although departments are required to implement the new travel procedures, they are not otherwise bound as to the internal operational arrangements they apply nor does the Department of Finance monitor this sort of detail. This is in accord with the general approach now taken to controlling departmental staffing and other running costs by pegging each agency's total funding for these purposes and leaving it to departmental managers to find the most efficient and effective use of these administrative resource funds now that they are thus limited.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) There are no general shortages of graduates in the field of medicine. Medical workforce requirements were examined by the Committee of Review into Medical Education and the Medical Workforce, which presented its report to the Government in April this year. It found that compared to other western countries, Australia was well supplied with medical practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) As general science graduates are employed across a wide spectrum of industries and occupations, it is not possible to make a generalised assessment of labour market shortages. However, these graduates are highly employable in the labour market generally, as evidenced by their unemployment rate of less than 4%. Graduates in all fields of study find jobs more easily than do non-graduates, particularly those in scientific, technical and commercial disciplines. Because of the high levels of employability of these graduates, the Government has given high priority to these fields of study in allocating additional higher education places.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Shortages have emerged in the past 2-3 years in the fields of electronic and industrial engineering. Maintaining an adequate supply of engineers is clearly vital if the impetus of economic restructuring is to be maintained. In recognition of these concerns, the Government has been increasing the number of higher education places available in these fields.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The low level of apprenticeship intakes in the early 1980's prior to the Hawke Government coming to office resulted in historically low numbers of apprentices completing their four-year training and entering the workforce. However, since 1982-83, apprentice intakes have increased by almost 60% and have been at record levels during the last few years.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Commonwealth Government has allocated a total of $142 million to the trade training system in 1988/89. This represents an increase of 17% over expenditure in the previous year. Incentives and support are provided to employers and apprentices through the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice full-time training (CRAFT) and the Special Apprentice Training (SAT) programs. The Government's aim in providing this funding is to assist in meeting the long-term needs of the economy for trade skills by improving the efficiency, flexibility and equity of the trade training system.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Commonwealth consults with State/ Territory governments on skills training issues on an on-going basis through the Commonwealth-State Training Advisory Committee (COSTAC).</PARA>
<PARA> COSTAC is a national forum for consultation and coordination in relation to the operations of the vocational training system. It has played a key role in facilitating changes to the apprenticeship system and in establishing the Australian Traineeship System (ATS).</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am aware of the statements to which the honourable senator refers.</PARA>
<PARA> As a general observation it is true that drawdown of uranium inventories will be a major factor in the next few years in balancing the overall demand supplysituation.</PARA>
<PARA> The most recent publication of the OECD/NEA and the IAEA on production demand summaries the outlook to year 2000 in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> Reactor related uranium requirements are expected to continue to rise from their current (1986) level of 39,200 tonnes U to about 52,400 tonnes U per year by the year 2000. Because uranium inventories are, in general, still above desired levels, some utilities will meet part of their requirements by a drawdown of inventories. Therefore, while production capability will exceed reactor requirements until the early 1990s, actual production of uranium is expected to remain below reactor requirements until desired levels of stocks are reached.</PARA>
<PARA> In arriving at projections of Australia's market opportunities, it is more relevant to consider estimates of uncommitted demand rather than overall demand and supply.</PARA>
<PARA> In the short term, given the oversupply situation in the market, there are few opportunities for sales at realistic prices. At present the uranium buyers and the utilities most certainly hold the upper-hand and the market is characterised by sellers who are prepared to continually undercut each other on prices to secure the limited opportunities available.</PARA>
<PARA> Looking further ahead, however, projections for demand not yet under contract show a substantial expected increase in the latter half of the next decade. Uncommitted demand is expected to rise from 14,720 tonnes U in 1992, to 36,127 tonnes U in the year 2000. On current projections there will also be a corresponding dramatic decline in inventory levels by the end of the century. While a good deal of this uncommitted demand could be met through existing operations, some of which could readily be expanded, there are likely to be, on strict economic criteria, opportunities for some new uranium operations selling into a tighter market, in the medium term.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the overall expansion of the nuclear industry, nuclear power capacity in the Western World countries is projected by the OECD/NEA to increase from its current level of around 266,700 MWe to around 341,800 MWe in the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that many factors can change estimates of demand and that past projections have generally overstated potential demand.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes. The relevant News Release (no 149/87) included: ``Although no firm timetable had been set, it was hoped that the replacement aircraft would be available no later than mid-1988''.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes. the Government has decided to lease five 15 passenger Falcon 900s due to enter service in September to December 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) A Cabinet Subcommittee consisting of the Prime Minister, Minister for Defence and the Minister for Finance determined the aircraft type and numbers to be acquired. This decision was made following detailed contractual negotiations with three of the companies that had tendered.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The main selection criteria for evaluating the aircraft proposals were:</PARA>
<PARA> aircraft operational capability and performance; cost, including life cycle costs; support arrangements; Australian industry involvement; and compliance with contractual and other requirements in the RFT.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) VIP Flights which require seating for more than 15 passengers will be provided by the use of the RAAF B707 aircraft, two more of which were acquired last year bringing the total to six, or by the use of charter aircraft or by the use of two or more Falcons together, depending on the task.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) No. Comparisons of aircraft size, range, utility for current and prospective tasks, along with prices and contract terms and conditions for operations and maintenance, and Australian industry involvement, resulting from the negotiations, were placed before the Cabinet sub-committee by the Department, without a specific recommendation. Cost-capability consideration of these factors determined the number and type of the aircraft. Strong Operator preference was expressed by the RAAF for a single aircraft type fleet and the larger of the two medium aircraft was considered a more flexible and cost-effective way of meeting future requirements, noting the availability of the B-707s.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Basic fees of $5 per adult and $2.50 per child were recommended by Peat Marwick Hungerford in a detailed market and financial assessment of the National Science and Technology Centre commissioned jointly by my Department and the Department of Finance. Subsequently a surcharge of $1 per adult and 50 cents per child was added by the Centre to support the ``Dinosaurs alive'' Exhibition during the period of its display in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Peat Marwick Hungerford's study considered potential visitor market segments and provided visitor forecasts based on similar studies carried out by the Australian War Memorial, Parliament House, the Australian National Gallery, the High Court and Questacon. In determining its suggested pricing policy the consultants agreed that young families would form an important element of the Centre's market, and recommended a charge which they considered would not act as a disincentive to the objective of attracting students to the Centre.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Centre has recently introduced a family admission and a student concession rate and is developing a membership scheme which will provide, amongst other things, reduced fees or free entry for persons wishing to make frequent visits to the Centre.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="140" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Firstly, I should make it clear that the Federal Government's policy is that the VFT project is a private sector venture and the Government has no plans to be involved in the financing or operations of the railway.</PARA>
<PARA>A project of this magnitude does of course encompass a wide range of complex issues, including environment/social, technical, economic and financial aspects, all of which will need to be thoroughly dealt with by the VFT Joint Venture if the proposal is to proceed. The Joint Venture has therefore commenced a 2 year feasibility study, to cost some $19m, which will examine in detail the matters mentioned above. (The first stage of the feasibility study, a Concept Report which outlines the proposal and lists many of the issues that require detailed study, has recently been published by the Joint Venture).</PARA>
<PARA>A major element in the feasibility study will be an environmental impact study which will be an integrated exercise to ensure that the requirements of the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victorian Governments are met. This should ensure that all the environmental and social issues relevant to the proposal are thoroughly canvassed-with opportunity for public input.</PARA>
<PARA>It is too early in the feasibility study process to make decisions on the need for (or desirability of) including formal public hearings in the process, especially as there is as yet no detailed information (in the form of a draft environmental impact statement or equivalent document) available on all the issues on which questions could be raised.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The normal environmental assessment requirements of the Commonwealth, Victoria and New South Wales require that consideration be given to alternatives including, in this case, the question of alternative routes. The VFT Joint Venture has acknowledged this and, in its Concept Report, has clearly stated that it will be making a detailed examination of alternative route options in the Albury corridor.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The ACT Administration has no view upon and has not expressed support for the VFT Joint Venture. The Administration is involved in the Commonwealth's participation in the Intergovernmental Group on the VFT, which is a co-ordinating body of officials monitoring the project. The formation of this body was proposed in August 1987 by the then NSW Government. As indicated by the Prime Minister when approving Commonwealth participation in the Intergovernmental group, such participation does not imply support for the VFT project and is on the understanding that the project develops entirely as a private sector initiative.</PARA>
<PARA>The Canberra Development Board, which is a ministerially appointed, independent advisory body, has expressed public support for the VFT proposal.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. For many years foreign flag ships have been chartered for Antarctic work because of a lack of local ships with ice breaking capability. Without these specialist ships Australia's Antarctic program would not have been possible. For this reason the Coasting Trade Provisions of the Navigation Act 1912, which require ships engaged in State-State or State-Territory trade to be licensed, have never been strictly enforced for Antarctic supply operations.</PARA>
<PARA>The Aurora Australis, which will be operated to support Australia's Antarctic activities from the 1989/90 season, will be crewed with Australian seafarers trained in ice conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Nella Dan did not sail in December 1985. It is presumed that the question refers to an allegation made in a submission to the Joint Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee Inquiry into the Management of the Antarctic Division. The voyage which was referred to in the submission departed Hobart in December 1986, not December 1985.</PARA>
<PARA>Such an allegation was made to an officer of the Antarctic Division after Nella Dan returned from the voyage in question. The officer discussed the allegation with the Nella Dan's officers. He was satisfied that the allegation was without foundation and no further action was taken.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no known basis to the allegation that the Nella Dan departed Hobart in an unseaworthy condition or with its engine damaged, or that any officer of the Division had any prior knowledge of any such condition or damage.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Some scientific cargo was not transported to the Lady Franklin for shipment on its first visit to Macquarie Island this season. The cargo was later air-dropped to the Island by the RAAF. The air-drop was used as an alternative training exercise to provide valuable tactical crew training and was funded by the Department of Defence from existing training funds. It therefore did not result in additional expenditure other than for aircrew accommodation expenses in Hobart totalling $927.50.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) 218</PARA>
<PARA>(b) 180</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The maximum amount of explosive permitted to be carried by road under the Commonwealth Explosives Regulations and associated Ministerial Orders, issued by the Minister for Transport and Communications, is 16,000 lbs (7,557 kg). The maximum amount usually transported between RANADs Newington and Kingswood is 1,200 kg because of truck capacity limitations and current Net Explosive Quantity limitation in force at the Newington Wharf.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In the 105 years that Sydney Harbour has been declared a Naval Ammunitioning area, there has never been an accident involving explosives which has caused damage to public property or injury to members of the public. The probability of an accident is very low and although there is no single numeric quantification of risk, assessment of the risk takes into account:-</PARA>
<PARA> a. technical fault;</PARA>
<PARA> b. handling error;</PARA>
<PARA> c. traffic accident on road or water;</PARA>
<PARA> d. effects of radio frequency transmission;</PARA>
<PARA> e. natural disaster;</PARA>
<PARA> f. structural collapse of bridge, building, etc;</PARA>
<PARA> g. sympathetic detonation;</PARA>
<PARA> h. political or social activities; and</PARA>
<PARA> i. criminal activities.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) RANAD Kingswood is not proposed to be wholly relocated to facilities currently planned to be provided at the Jervis Bay Armament Depot (JBAD). On present planning, guided weapons storage and maintenance facilities will be retained at RANAD Kingswood for some time. It is not possible to provide a separate figure for the cost of the transfer of those activities which will move from RANAD Kingswood as the JBAD is also proposed to replace RANAD Newington.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. The Australian honours system was established on 14 February 1975 with the intention that it should replace the use of British honours and awards in Australia. Service that would previously have rendered a person eligible for the award of the Air Efficiency Award may attract the award of one of the Defence Force Service awards and, where appropriate, the National Medal.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the Air Force Cross and the Queen's Commendation for Valuable Service in the Air, exceptional devotion to duty may receive recognition in the Order of Australia; bravery in carrying out peace-time air defence and rescue work may be recognised by the award of a Bravery Decoration.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, The Queen has given approval in principle for the institution of the Conspicuous Service Cross and the Conspicuous Service Medal in the Australian honours system. When formally instituted, these decorations may be awarded to recognise outstanding or meritorious achievement or devotion to duty by members of the Defence Force in non-warlike situations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 24 November 1988 (Hansard, page 2759) Senator Hamer asked a question without notice concerning the setting up of a Commonwealth Government inquiry into research policies. He asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Will the inquiry be able to recommend the reversal of the proposals for centralisation of higher education research?</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA>There are no proposals for the centralisation of research. The thrust of the White Paper is for devolution of responsibilities to institutions for higher education research. Components of the operating grant are not separately identified, so institutions will be free to determine the most efficient allocation of funding amongst the various categories of expenditure, including research.</PARA>
<PARA>The Smith Committee is being asked to provide an assessment of the implications of the transfer of a small proportion of funds from the universities operating grants to the Australian Research Council (ARC).</PARA>
<PARA>Advice is also being sought about ``a process whereby the amount of operating grants subject to transfer in respect of the medical schools, can be reallocated through the NH&amp;MRC'' (Terms of Reference 6).</PARA>
<PARA>He also asked: Will the inquiry be able to point out that even though the White Paper refers to deregulation it in fact goes in the opposite direction? The Minister has provided the following answer:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's intention, through the White Paper, is to provide institutions with enhanced autonomy within a framework of accountability. Institutions are being asked to manage their scientific research, to think more strategically about their future directions and develop research management plans which set out their objectives, strategies and targets for research.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not an unreasonable request, considering the enormous contribution from the Commonwealth Government to the development and maintenance of the research enterprise in higher education.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed it is pleasing to see how quickly and positively many institutions have responded to this request.</PARA>
<PARA>The thrust of the White Paper is also for selectivity and concentration of research with a continuing commitment to a strong basic research capability.</PARA>
<PARA>He asked: Is not the centralisation of educational activities totally discredited around the world? The Minister has provided the following answer:</PARA>
<PARA>All countries are looking to a number of key elements from their higher education research including:</PARA>
<PARA> selectivity and concentration;</PARA>
<PARA> development of highly skilled and trained people;</PARA>
<PARA> development of more interdisciplinary areas of research;</PARA>
<PARA> concentration of part of the research effort into designated priority areas;</PARA>
<PARA> encouraging interaction/links between higher education research and industry.</PARA>
<PARA>The Smith Committee is addressing many of these issues in its Terms of Reference.</PARA>
<PARA>He asked: Will this not lead to universities ranging from very good to mediocre? The Minister has provided the following answer:</PARA>
<PARA>Universities with a strong performance record in research will be enhanced further in their proven areas of expertise and in their ability to attract competitive research funds.</PARA>
<PARA>Other institutions will be encouraged also to attain excellence through concentrating their research effort into a smaller number of areas.</PARA>
<PARA>This would result in a more effective utilisation of scarce resources (manpower and funding).</PARA>
<PARA>He asked: Will the inquiry be able to recommend measures to prevent a de facto research quota for mediocre institutions? The Minister has provided the following answer:</PARA>
<PARA>The notion is at odds with the thrust of the Smith Committee's Terms of Reference.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee is to provide advice on the scale and nature of the research effort that could be supported through higher education institutions.</PARA>
<PARA>He asked: Will the inquiry be able to recommend that the Minister should tear up the White Paper? The Minister has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA>A copy of the Committee's terms of reference is available for Senator Hamer's consideration.</PARA>
