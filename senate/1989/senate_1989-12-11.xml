<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth, that:</PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned about the increase in violent television programmes for children and particularly those programmes promoting violent toys that are available for sale in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray:</PARA>
<PARA> That you support the Broadcasting (Prohibition of Violent Programmes for Children) Act 1988 which has been presented by WA Independent Senator for Nuclear Disarmament, Jo Vallentine. This act aims to prohibit the broadcasting of children's TV programmes that are violent and that promote toys modelled on characters, weapons or other war accessories which are also available for sale in Australia.</PARA>

<TITLE>Company Tax Collection System</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's Budget decision to change the company tax collection system will be a crippling blow to many small businesses, already suffering as a direct result of the Hawke Labor Government's high interest rate policy.</PARA>
<PARA> The earlier remittance of company tax payments to the Government will substantially reduce the cash-flow position of thousands of small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA> Many small businesses will be driven under as a result of the Government's decision-unable to find funds for both tax commitments and new stock, only able to borrow at record high interest rates and unable to claim any tax relief on such borrowings to meet their tax commitment.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's proposed changes to the company tax collection system has only been introduced as a greedy grab for more tax revenue.</PARA>
<PARA> The small business community would prefer the Government to completely abandon the proposal rather than make only minor alterations to the original Budget decision, which are not likely to alleviate the situation to any significant extent.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA> We the undersigned Australian petitioners call on the Australian Government to take real steps to prevent the abuse of human rights of Aboriginals in prison and police custody.</PARA>
<PARA> A Royal Commission was set up to find out in general terms why so many Aborigines die in custody and the circumstances surrounding each death before the Commission. We the petitioners, would like to express the following concerns:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Aboriginal families and organisations have not received adequate funding from the Federal Government to ensure adequate representation. Yet the Commission faces constant challenge from the powerful police and prison officers' unions in their efforts to shut down the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The Royal Commission's interim report includes recommendations for changes in custodial practices. Yet only some of the recommendations have been implemented and only in some places-no government body is monitoring the implementation and the deaths continue.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The occurrence of racist attacks, ie: David Gundy was killed in his home by the Police SWOS. The Coroner's Court verdict on his killing was `death by accident'.</PARA>
<PARA> We call for a just inquiry into Aboriginal deaths in custody.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do have an answer for Senator Colston. Essentially I am informed that radon occurs naturally in the environment and that the decay of radon contributes to the natural background of radiation to which people are generally exposed. The Department of Community Services and Health has been unable to obtain details of the particular claim referred to in the honourable senator's question. However, the National Radiological Protection Board of the United Kingdom has estimated that in that country up to 1,500 lung cancer deaths per annum might be attributed to radon. To put that figure into perspective, there are over 34,000 lung cancer deaths per annum in the United Kingdom and most of these are caused by smoking. I am informed that the existence of basements and well-sealed homes in the United Kingdom is likely to lead to higher levels of exposure to radon in that country than would occur in Australia. However, a survey of radon levels in Australian homes is being carried out by the Australian Radiation Laboratory. We anticipate that that survey will be completed by mid-1990. In conclusion, preliminary results show that average Australian indoor radon levels are below world average standards.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister representing the Prime Minister concerned that the Prime Minister's comments on Friday, about the prospect of an easing in monetary policy leading to lower interest rates, may encourage many Australians to believe that the worst is over? Would the Minister agree that it would be totally counterproductive if such comments sparked a renewed bout of consumption?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All the indicators relating to consumption and consumption intentions suggest that there is no new bout of excessive consumption expenditure in the offing, particularly in relation to figures on retail trade and so on. The Prime Minister made no comments about interest rates as such. He referred to the conditions which may exist for a lowering of interest rates and the need to watch the various economic indicators and to be sure that the economy is slowing sufficiently before there can be an easing in monetary policy. He did say that anecdotal evidence-and I stress `anecdotal evidence'-suggests that the economy is gradually slowing. As I said last week, I think all that indicates is that there is a potential for a reduction in interest rates at the appropriate time, and that is not inconsistent with what the Prime Minister said. I think anybody who based wild anticipations of indulging in an orgy of consumption on the basis of that sort of comment would be, to say the least, not prudent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations. Is the Minister aware of an article in the Australian Financial Review of Thursday, 7 December indicating that the Greiner Government has decided to delay the introduction of its radical industrial relations policy because of strong opposition from employer organisations? What is the nature of the opposition from these employer organisations? Are there any implications in this widespread rejection of the proposals for the Federal Government's industrial relations policy and for those proposed by the Federal Opposition?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4190" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand it, the Greiner Government has delayed the introduction of its industrial relations legislation, which was heralded a month or so ago as the major initiative of that Government in the last quarter of 1989. There has, I think, been some opposition to that proposed legislation from the trade union movement. There has also been somewhat strident opposition from the New South Wales Employers Federation, the Metal Trades Industry Association Inc. (MTIA), the New South Wales division of the Chamber of Manufactures, and the Law Society of New South Wales, which has also expressed serious reservations about the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not know what that means in terms of New South Wales politics and what the Greiner Government proposes to do about that. A lot of the opposition has already been indicated in the Federal sphere by organisations such as the MTIA. I guess the implications of all of this are that it is very difficult to take a leap in the dark with changes like this and to try to anticipate what the consequences will be. A variety of organisations of the kind which I have mentioned are very cautious about the likely consequences. For example, while there may be agreement about some sort of shift in focus in moving the industrial relations scene closer to the enterprise over time, there are quite competing views as to how that should be done and how quickly it might be achieved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that Senator Stone's interjection will be recorded in Hansard. He said, `You would not pay any attention to the MTIA, would you?'. I want to make it quite clear that I would, and the implication of his interjection is that he would not. That should be made quite clear for the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The MTIA, which is one of the organisations in New South Wales referred to, is keen on shifting slowly to a more industry-based approach, but within the parameters of the existing centralised wage fixing system. That organisation has a more national focus than the Chamber of Manufactures of New South Wales, the Law Society of New South Wales and organisations such as those have. It is much more involved in the national debate and has cautioned a great deal about the sudden approach to these issues which, I believe, is inherent in the Opposition's policies. The relevance of the New South Wales experience is that, while it might have provided a useful test bed for a particular point of view about changes to the industrial relations system, that test bed seems to have been abandoned for the time being, and we cannot draw any practical conclusions from it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the first part of the question is: a lot of weight, given the qualifications which the Prime Minister put on his comments. I repeat that he said that signs are emerging that conditions will exist for a lowering of interest rates; anecdotal evidence suggests that the economy is gradually slowing; and we have to be certain that the economy is slowing sufficiently before monetary policy can be eased.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Finance. I draw the Minister's attention to recent comments made by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Peacock, about a Liberal government's ability to lower interest rates and still manage Australia's foreign debt. Among other things, Mr Peacock stated that the Opposition's fiscal policy would restrain demand and, hence, interest rates could be lowered. In light of Mr Peacock's optimism, in contrast to the view of some of his colleagues, does the Government now intend to adopt the approach to fiscal policy proposed by the Opposition? If not, why not?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Foreman's question referred to Mr Peacock's statement that the Opposition's fiscal policy would restrain demand. If one believes the estimates made by the Opposition, the surplus would be increased by about $150m. However, one could not and should not believe one of the major components of the Opposition's economic statement, which was made a couple of weeks ago, because the savings on long term unemployed special benefits are grossly overestimated. The more likely effect of the Opposition's fiscal policy would be to reduce the Budget surplus by a few hundred million dollars. I do not want to quibble unduly about that because the plain fact is that a couple of hundred million dollars in either direction represents such a small change in fiscal policy that it would have a negligible effect on macro-economic outcomes or on the need for changes in other policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore, there is no possibility of the Opposition's fiscal policy producing an outcome significantly different from the Government's fiscal policy. We have Opposition spokespeople running around all over the place promising to spend more money and giving additional expenditure commitments that are not allowed for in the economic policy statement. If one ignores all that pork-barrelling and deception and just looks at the Opposition's official document, one sees that it represents, so far as fiscal policy aggregates are concerned, no substantial compositional differences, but I do not want to go into them just now. I might discuss them a little in the debate on the matter of public importance.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Peacock is always saying something or other, and with increasing frequency he is then contradicted by Senator Stone or Mr Howard, or even by Senator Hill, who had to explain to Mr Peacock a couple of months ago what a `trading bloc' actually meant. Apparently, Mr Peacock was as ignorant of that term, which refers to people dealing in international trade, as he is, on his own admission, ignorant of the principles of accountancy. I do not know whether anybody really takes much notice of what Mr Peacock says about anything these days. His own words could be used as a response to any question at all arising from anything he has said-`Who knows'.</PARA>

The Swedes may be able to do this without adding to carbon dioxide emissions because they use quite a lot of nuclear energy as well as hydro-energy. Indeed, when I was in Sweden a few years ago I found that the Swedes get very annoyed and angry when they are sanctimoniously preached at by the Danes, just as those of us who were opposing the Vietnam War got rather annoyed when we were sanctimoniously preached at by latter-day peaceniks. The Swedes get very angry because they export nuclear-generated electricity to Denmark and import acid rain from Denmark caused by the burning of sulphurous coal. The Swedes reckon that it is really a bit rough when the Danes preach to them about the evils of generating nuclear electricity, which the Swedes export to Denmark, while importing acid rain in return. In regard to the first part of the question, I understand that the Treasurer has not yet considered advice on the matter. Despite the usual plethora of conceptual and logic flaws, misconceptions and sloppy thinking in the question, I am pleased to see that at last people like Senator Vallentine have begun to realise that there might be a role for economic principles in dealing with environmental policies.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not gone through the report comprehensively, but I understand that the link between poverty and other social problems forms the basis of the core point made in the report. It, of course, mentions the questions of domestic violence, and drug and alcohol abuse. The core point of the report is that poverty, as the Government acknowledges, is a multidimensional problem. It should be recognised that the report acknowledges the fact that income support is one of a number of critical factors in attacking family poverty. However, it makes the point that it is not the only important factor. The provision of services is one area that cannot and should not be ignored.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the first point, the question of income support measures, it should be noted and recognised that the Government's record in this area is one that we will build on. It is also recognised as being outstanding. We have introduced family allowance supplements (FAS), which are targeted very much to the areas of poverty. We have achieved the family allowance supplement benchmarks. The April family package reformed and increased the family allowance, and the inflation adjustment system of the entire family income support system is, for the first time in Australia's history, recognised as being vital to the maintenance of income support.</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the effect of these measures, it should be recognised that over 3.7 million children in two million families are now receiving the new family allowance rates. As importantly, over 1.2 million children in half a million families now receive FAS or its equivalent. Bishop Peter Hollingworth said:</PARA>
<PARA> For the first time in this country's history, we have a system of guaranteed minimum income for children.</PARA>
<PARA>This historic achievement has been widely acknowledged. The Government also acknowledges the core point of the report; that is, that the causes and symptoms of poverty are far wider than pure economics. The Minister for Social Security has said this time and time again. As recognised, the provision of services by Commonwealth, State and local governments is crucial, as is the provision of services by community organisations. The Economic Planning and Advisory Council recognises this as well. In its most recent report it states:</PARA>
<PARA>Income support measures alone are not sufficient to deal with the broader aspects of poverty that exist in the Australian community. A broader range of other social policies will also be necessary.</PARA>
<PARA>This link between poverty and the need for adequate services-has also been recognised by the Government. Elements of the social wage are obviously crucial in meeting the problems that have been highlighted by the report. Aspects such as Medicare, schools, increasing retention rates in schools, employment policies, and new child-care places all have a role to play. There is also a role for especially targeted multi-dimensional initiatives of government such as the jobs, education and training program, Newstart and the youth social justice strategy.</PARA>
<PARA> In summary, as I have said, the report makes a very strong point of the need for all levels of government and the community to recognise that poverty is very much a multi-dimensional problem and to give adequate attention to it. The Government's bottom line is that the attack on poverty is no easy task to undertake. But we have demonstrated that we do have the courage, the commitment and the record--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously, it is not possible to replace the Medicare system with a tax rebate for people whose tax liability is either negligible or less than the rebate which would be provided for health insurance. It is obviously not possible for a tax rebate to replace the Medicare levy for everybody. It is possible, although I would suggest at total higher cost to the community, to neutralise the financial consequences for people in a certain income band of transfer from a Medicare levy to a rebate on tax paid for private health insurance. That still leaves to be determined the question of how large, what percentage of the dollar, the rebate would have to be. I do not have any information on that now for any particular income group.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Jones referred to the effective health cover of low and middle income families and the present affordability of same. I had read some press reports on the matter, but only today I was shown a transcript of Mr Peacock's comments on this matter on 30 November last. Frankly, I was astounded. I know that over his political career Mr Peacock has made a number of loose statements and recently has made a very large number of loose statements which have required correction by other more rigorous and better informed members of the Opposition front bench, people like Mr Howard and Senator Stone. With respect to the Liberal Party health policy, Mr Peacock said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is affordable, it assists the low to middle income earner because the rebate will be greater for them, the rebate will be greater for them than for the top income earner and people will have a much more affordable health scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>He asserted that the rebate would be greater for lower and middle income earners than for high income earners. I am not surprised that Senator Messner looks incredulous, but that is what he said. Some time ago Mr Peacock publicly confessed to not bringing an accountant's approach to matters of Budget preparation; obviously he does not bring an accountant's approach to this either. Mr Shack was reported in today's Melbourne Herald as contradicting Mr Peacock. Mr Shack has now joined Mr Howard, Senator Stone and Senator Hill in contradicting statements that his Leader has made. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Although the Opposition Leader, Mr Peacock, said at a press conference recently that low to middle income earners would get a greater rebate under the policy than top income earners, this would not be the case.</PARA>
<PARA>The report further states:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Shack has said that he does not have the resources to provide comprehensive financial details . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Given a leader who obviously does not understand the principles of the policy, I do not think the comprehensive financial details are all that important. One might say: why bother getting comprehensive financial details when the premises on which they are based are demonstrably false? Mr Shack was also reported as having said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . precise information on the cost of basic private hospital and medical insurance premiums was unavailable because insurers did not provide such insurance under Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA>In spite of all that, we are expected to believe that a comprehensive and credible Opposition health policy will come out, in a couple of months.</PARA>
<PARA> I want to make two final points. I recognise that Mr Shack operates under a handicap of a leader who has not the faintest idea of what the policy is about, but his response is also of the calibre that might lead one to suggest that it might be better if Senator Peter Baume were brought back into that job. The last point I want to make-overall one that is more important than that about the undisciplined ramblings and rantings of assorted members of the Opposition-is that under the Medicare system Australia has a health system which delivers a service consuming more than three percentage points of gross domestic product less than does the health service in the United States of America. I do not think anybody who knows anything about it would argue that the health service delivered in the United States is any better than that in Australia and few would argue that it is as good, in spite of its costing some three or four percentage points of GDP more.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The maintenance of high interest rates has never been the principal strategy of the Labor Government. If Senator Peter Baume or Senator Puplick cannot understand that, I make the point that there have been a number of arms of Government economic policy, including tight monetary policy and a record tight fiscal policy-the tightest fiscal policy in this country since Federation-leading to an enormous surplus. There has also been a tight wages policy, which would be abandoned by the Opposition if it were ever elected to government. So a number of arms of government policy have been operating, of which monetary policy is only one. If any honourable senators opposite want a private tutorial on these issues later, I will give it to them.</PARA></TALK.START>

Has an environmental impact statement (EIS) been prepared for the proposed runway at Casey; if not, why not? Does the construction of a runway in Australian administered Antarctica come under the Commonwealth's Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974; if not, why not? Can the Minister justify the increased incursion of human beings, machinery and resultant degradation of the Antarctic environment with his Government's stated support for the preservation of the Antarctic wilderness? In the annual report of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, which was tabled on 6 December, it is stated at page 167 that environmental `assessment work extended to comments on a proposed British airstrip at Rothera Point . . .' In view of the Hawke Government's support for the preservation of Antarctica, what advice did the Department give Her Majesty's Government of Great Britain?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Taking the second part of Senator Sanders's question first, and putting it in context, certainly our activities in Antarctica do come within the Act. However, from the information that has been given to me, I would have no intention of asking for an EIS for this project. Senator Sanders's statement about increased incursion of human beings, machinery and resultant degradation of the Antarctic environment really is a huge exaggeration of the activity planned for this trial. It should be remembered that the proposed runway in the Antarctic is to be a compressed ice and snow runway which involves no construction; nothing will be built. All it involves is some work with graders and rollers. As there will be no construction I do not believe that there will be a huge degradation of the Antarctic environment. Indeed, I do not believe there will be any degradation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> More importantly, we have to find ways and means of increasing our scientific effort in Antarctica. That is absolutely necessary, and we believe that an air transport capability will give us a much better chance of doing so. Unfortunately, a number of scientists who carry out important projects in the Antarctic every year cannot get there because of the lack of space on ships. Even with the Aurora Australis in operation the following year, there is no way that we will completely mend that problem. So the only thing I can do in that sense is look at an alternative, and I do not know of one bar the one that we are now attempting. But if I thought it was going to lead, as Senator Sanders said, to degradation of the Antarctic environment, I would not be associated with it. Obviously, there has not been an EIS, and I do not propose that there will be one. Nonetheless, an environmental investigation has been carried out by the Antarctic Division under the terms of a memorandum of understanding that it has with my Department centrally.</PARA>
<PARA> I was not given a great deal of notice of this question. I am glad that I was given a couple of minutes because the first part of that question I can answer; the last part, concerning the British airstrip at Rothera Point, I could not have answered but I now can. I am advised that we had a look at the British proposal and we have some reservations about the strength of the assessment that has been made of it. We have not advised Her Majesty's Government of those reservations, although we intend to do so at the next Antarctic Treaty meeting.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bishop really asked two questions. The first asked why it would take a particular time for the Australian Embassy to process a visa compared with the time taken by the United States Embassy. I point out that most of the visas for students coming to Australia are for short term, non-formal courses-a type of course for which the United States does not grant visas. It grants visas for full time students. Given that the problem of overstay rates on short term, non-formal courses is becoming more and more apparent, we will be checking immigration bona fides. We will do extensive checking-not that that always turns up the particular information one would want, but that checking has to be done. Also, the processing time is somewhat extended by the number of staff we have overseas, not the least of the problem being the backlog of 40,000 people in the People's Republic of China which has required our resources to be directed there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other part of Senator Bishop's question was a quite specific one. It might surprise her that, of the two million people visiting Australia and the two million visas that are issued, I am not familiar with the circumstances of every one of them, nor do I intend ever to go generally into the individual merits of those cases at Question Time. I will not put that part of the question on notice, but I will write to Senator Bishop about it. However, I make this point: the automatic assumption that if one has a visa one can gain entry into Australia is not true. A visa enables a person to travel to Australia but that person then requires an entry permit. The Government and my Department still retain the power not to issue an entry permit. Sometimes that is a result of circumstances changing between the issue of a visa and a person arriving. At the moment, we would not normally get notice of that person's arrival until he arrived at the airport. It is true that in the long term, with pre-clearance of flights-and this will happen within the year in some circumstances-we will have such advance notice; but at the moment we do not. Someone arriving in Australia with a visa is not guaranteed entry into this country until we issue that person with an entry permit.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question that Senator Giles raises goes to an industry which has a weekly consumption value of $31m and an annual consumption value of $1.6 billion, covering cosmetics and toiletries. As I have indicated, it is a large industry and, as such, it affects quite a number of people. Consumers of all ages and both sexes are interested in the degree of information that is made available to them when they buy cosmetics or toiletries. There are three reasons that come to mind immediately for the need for ingredient labelling of these products. At this stage we do not have compulsory ingredient labelling or even a voluntary agreement, but, succinctly put, the reasons for having labelling are, firstly, consumers need to know what is in the product they purchase in order to compare products; secondly, they need to know what is in the product so that they can compare the price of products; and, thirdly, a growing concern amongst a number of people that quite often there are allergic reactions to ingredients in cosmetics and toiletries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For those reasons, the Government has for some time been consulting with community, industry and consumer groups on how we can respond to this problem. We are assessing in one arm of government the question of allergies. In another there has been discussion on ingredient labelling. The Trade Practices Commission has also been discussing with industry a code of conduct to ensure coverage of advertising, in-store promotion, packaging and product recall of cosmetics. I have been able to announce today that under section 65d of the Trade Practices Act we will be developing a standard to ensure full ingredient labelling of cosmetic products. The standard will also cover a requirement for a manufactured on or use by date, and will ensure that there will be adequate information about the manufacturer or supplier of the product involved. This degree of information should address the problems that have been faced by a community which has been shopping in the dark in this area. I anticipate that the standard will be developed by early 1990 and will have effect thereafter.</PARA>
<PARA> The vital consideration is to ensure that a suitable lead-in period is made available to industry to adjust to this standard. It should be noted-and I think Senator Giles's question mentioned this-that other countries, in particular the United States, already have standards in place to ensure that there is full ingredient labelling in this area. The same product may be packaged differently in the United States-in one way for domestic purposes and in another for export to Australia, the product for export to Australia not having anywhere near the degree of information that is available to United States consumers. Consultations will continue as to the form of the standard. There are some questions as to the ambit and the form of listing of the products involved. One question we have to resolve is whether we go by recognisable ingredient names or code numbers. But those problems will be addressed in the next few weeks. We anticipate that in February-March next year a defined standard will be made available for the community which consumers can see as the benchmark for their rights to information in this area in the future.</PARA>

I have obtained an answer to that question. As it is somewhat long, I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Honourable Senator's question appears to stem from a report in the Australian Financial Review, dated 4 December 1989, in which it quotes Mr Justice Davies of the Federal Court of Australia as saying that the decision not to immediately repay money to LNC Limited, an importer recently involved with litigation with the ACS, was a `dirty' and `shabby' act.</PARA>
<PARA> The newspaper in fact misquoted his Honour. The Judge did not in fact say that the ACS was `dirty' and `shabby' in not repaying the money to the applicant but rather was quoting a statement made by Lord Bridge of the House of Lords, delivering a judgment in the case of Tower Hamlets Borough Council v. Chetnik Developments Pty. Ltd appearing in volume 1 of the All England Law Reports at page 969. That case dealt with whether or not government officials had an obligation to repay monies paid to a Government agency as a result of errors of law-a question that was only one small part of the LNC litigation.</PARA>
<PARA> In the ten years or so that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has had jurisdiction over disputes involving amounts or rates of duty Customs has never refused to repay monies that have been paid under protest when an applicant has been finally successful before the Tribunal or, on appeal, before the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA> With regards to the particular queries of the Honourable Senator, I advise that LNC actually paid an amount of $7551.80 in cash under protest; this amount will be repaid to the applicant during the course of this week. LNC also lodged an amount of $54,000 as documentary security to cover the full amount of duty paid under protest for the cars imported by LNC. Not all this security is required to be repaid because of Justice Davies' judgment. The level of security that is to be discharged because of LNC's partially successful action is now being assessed and will be determined at the earliest possible time.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the second question, I should like to inform the Senate that every time the ACS passes an entry of goods for home consumption into Australia it is making, to use the terminology of the Honourable Senator, a `ruling'.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1988-1989 alone, throughout Australia there were 1,540,507 entries for home consumption lodged-about 6500 per working day. Of these decisions, a mere 48 have been referred to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or a Court during 1989. So far 26 decisions have been handed down-13 were set aside and 13 affirmed. A further 22 decisions have been settled by consent of the parties or are yet to be decided. I believe that this is clear evidence that the Government is living within its own customs legislation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to refer to some questions asked of me by Senator Boswell on the maintenance contract for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) C130 aircraft fleet. In looking at the answer to these questions, it is necessary to go through the sequential nature of the contracting, and I propose to do so. The request for tender was issued on 2 February 1989. Tenders were submitted to the Department of Defence on 27 April 1989. The tender evaluation was then undertaken and a recommendation made on 19 September. Negotiations commenced with the preferred tenderer on 18 October. The last negotiation was held in Melbourne on 27 November. The Minister for Defence announced the decision on 7 December. Following the negotiations, the contract has been completed and, after the Minister's announcement, it is expected to be sent to the winning company on or about 13 December 1989. The delay of a few days is due to some word processing difficulties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Throughout these processes, tenderers are kept informed of progress, within the bounds of competition and probity, to enable them to plan their own activities and avoid potentially nugatory costs. In this case, the sequence of advice to Hawker de Havilland included: On 6 October it was advised that negotiations would be commencing shortly with Air New Zealand Ltd. On 24 October it was advised that `no contract has yet been arranged, and accordingly all tenders are still being considered. It is therefore not proposed to conduct any debriefings until successful tenderer has been selected'. There was debriefing in response to questions from the company on 4 December 1989 and a formal letter declining the company's offer will be sent at about the same time as the contract is sent to the winning company.</PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile, Air New Zealand was advised on 17 November 1989 that its tender would be accepted `subject to the terms and conditions of . . . Contract PN 8002, which will be despatched shortly'. Negotiations on those terms and conditions were continuing on 27 November, as mentioned above.</PARA>
<PARA> The practice of informing companies that negotiations are to commence with another company-in this case, on 6 October-clearly tells them that they are not preferred. But they are given to understand-in this case, this was done formally on 24 October-that, should negotiations with the preferred tenderer not result in a satisfactory contract, they may be invited to negotiate. It is then for them to judge whether it is worth keeping people standing by. Obviously, their likelihood of being reconsidered changes as the various processes are progressed, and this influences their judgments.</PARA>
<PARA> The announcement of the winner or likely winner can occur at different stages in this process, depending on such things as the likelihood of a successful contract being concluded and any wider considerations such as levels of funding or relations with other countries. On some occasions the intention to negotiate with a particular company is announced; on others, no announcement is made until all contractual and other details are completely resolved. This is one of the latter cases. The final decision and announcement were not made until matters had been fully resolved because of the importance of our relationship with New Zealand and the strategic importance of the task.</PARA>
<PARA> Turning briefly to the outcome, one might note the substantial price difference of more than 10 per cent and the preference listed by the Minister on technical and contractual grounds. One might also note that, despite the distance, Air New Zealand offered a quicker turn around of aircraft sent for maintenance, which is of obvious benefit to the operations of the RAAF through increased aircraft availability.</PARA>

<PARA> For the past six to eight weeks the Government's disinformation machine has been hard at work in its usual manner trying to sell the lie-I make no apology for using that word-that the coalition's proposed speculative gains tax will benefit only the rich. It is high time we took that piece of disinformation head on and showed it for the lie that it is. At the same time, the Australian Labor Party wants people to believe that its capital gain tax is equitable and fair. In fact, the opposite is the case: Labor's capital gains tax will adversely affect millions of Australians who in no way can be classed as rich while the coalition's proposal to replace that tax with a speculative gains tax will encourage more productive investment, thereby benefiting all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad to see that there are at least three-I hesitate to say respectable-speakers from the Government side on the speakers list today who are worthy to be included in a matter of public importance debate. This is rather different from the Government's normal performance on these matters when it trots out speakers, whom I will not name as it would be invidious to do so, but who, to say the least, are not up to the job. I am glad that Senator Walsh is responding today. We will also hear from Senator McMullan and Senator Beahan. In view of the fact that five speakers on the list are either Western Australians or ex-Western Australians, there seems to be an almost Western Australian benefit. I do not quite know what conclusion I should draw from that. I expect to receive from Senator Walsh a more intellectually rigorous defence of an admittedly indefensible position on the Government's part than we would get from his shameless colleague the Treasurer on the same topic. Mr Keating, in the aftermath of the Opposition's Economic Action Plan, was in a state of great frustration, unable to attack any details of the plan. Indeed, he was silent for a whole week after it was brought down. He finally made a rather weak attempt to attack some of the figuring in the plan-a matter to which Senator Walsh fleetingly referred today. This, of course, once again dashed the Government's hopes of an early election, thereby forcing it to govern for another three or four months or perhaps longer while the economy slides out from underneath it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is perhaps because of that sense of increasing rage and frustration on Mr Keating's part that we had his notorious and totally defamatory attack in the other House upon Mr John Elliott. That attack was based upon no evidence whatsoever. It was merely an assertion that the Opposition's policy to repeal the capital gains tax was in some way for the purpose of benefiting Mr Elliott. It was inherently unbelievable because the facts are that the Opposition's policy was announced on 10 May last year by the then Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong, Mr Howard, and the then shadow Treasurer, Mr Peacock, and it was reconfirmed in exactly the same words in the Future Directions document in December last year. The share transactions, to which I have no doubt Senator Walsh will probably once again refer today, did not even come into the picture until the middle of this year. The Treasurer's attack was not only shameful in the sense of being totally unsubstantiated by any evidence but also inherently unbelievable because of the sequence of events. Subsequently Mr Keating has never seen fit to apologise for that. It would not occur to him. It is not within his nature. He is not man enough to stand up in the other place and apologise for something as shameful as that. He does not have the guts. Having been bested in that regard, Mr Keating was subsequently reduced to making the lame claim that, because of Mr Elliott's pressure, the Opposition had not abandoned its previously announced proposal. What a joke! It is ludicrous. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the capital gains tax, which is, as many others have said, a form of death duty. This is a fact that the Government continues to deny but it is incontrovertibly true-it is a form of death duty. At the time of announcing the capital gains tax, Mr Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA>Liability for tax in the case of death will be rolled over to successors, and will only be assessed on any subsequent disposal. Therefore-</PARA>
<PARA>note that non sequitur-</PARA>
<PARA>the capital gains tax will not apply in the case of death. </PARA>
<PARA>That gives a totally misleading impression. The fact is that if, after the death of the person leaving the estate, the estate has to be split up between more than one beneficiary, it is often essential to sell the assets. That is fine if there is a single beneficiary and he or she wants the particular assets concerned, is prepared to carry on working the farm, wants the particular shares, or whatever. But if there is a need to divide the assets or if for some reason the person is not able to manage the farm-if that should be the nature of the asset-then it has to be sold, converted to cash and distributed. That process immediately results in the application of a capital gains tax. So in those circumstances, which are the most common-not uncommon-circumstances the tax does operate as a de facto death duty. The Government can go around this country saying that it does not until it is black in the face but the people know that it does. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a claim that the capital gains tax does not apply to the principal private residence. The Government said it was careful to exclude the principal private residence from the application of the tax. But the fact is that there are many cases, again not uncommon, where the tax does apply. I have a whole list of such cases which, with the Minister's permission, I would like to have incorporated in Hansard. Let me just mention a couple. For example, taxpayers can claim only one property as their principal place of residence although two dwellings are permissible for up to three months where a taxpayer changes homes. Many thousands of Australians will be caught up in the situation where it takes longer than three months to sell their property. In that case, the capital gains tax comes into play on a pro rata basis. Here is another example: a home owner acquires a home to be used as a sole or a principal residence and places the first home on the market. In order to defray the high cost of bridging finance, perhaps, the first home is rented out. The ability to own two homes for up to three months is thereby denied under the law and the home becomes subject to the capital gains tax. I can go on quoting examples of that kind but I seek leave to incorporate all of them in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Circumstances where the Family Home may attract liability for the Capital Gains Tax. </PARA>
<PARA> (1) The capital gains tax exemption is based on the qualification that the family home be not used for income-producing purposes. If a member of the family pays rent or board, the family home will partially lose its exemption. Similarly, if the family home has a study used for work then a liability may be incurred. Ref: Sub-section 21. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) The sale of the family garden shed, storeroom or other structure, will be subject to capital gains tax. This includes the case where a father gives his son the portable tool shed from the garden. Ref: Sub-section 1, 3 and 4. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Capital gains tax will apply to a new family home purchased by a young couple whilst still living with their parents before their marriage. </PARA>
<PARA> It will also apply to a young couple who are renting and who purchase a block for their family home. The young couple will find that the block is subject to capital gains tax. Ref: Sub-section (5e) and (f). This could occur as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The exemption is only available if upon completion of the new house it is occupied for at least 12 months. If for example, the young couple have to move (for work reasons) within 12 months then the exemption is lost. </PARA>
<PARA> (5) The maximum exemption-free time allowed under Sub-section 5 (f) is 4 years. If because they are building themselves, or they are not saving fast enough and the time lapse between acquisition and occupation exceeds 4 years, then the young couple will have to pay capital gains tax on a pro rata basis. </PARA>
<PARA> (6) If the block is purchased by the young couple prior to their marriage and if one or both of them are, during that time, dependent on a parent then for that period the block will not be exempt. </PARA>
<PARA> (7) If the family home is on more than 2 hectares, then the excess over 2 hectares is subject to capital gains tax. Many people will be caught up by this provision, particularly in outer metropolitan areas where blocks in excess of 2 hectares are very popular. The Assets Test fiasco showed how difficult questions of valuation become, particularly where stringent town planning controls are in force. </PARA>
<PARA> (8) If the family home is in excess of 2 hectares and you allow a neighbour to put in a drain at the back of your property, then you are liable for capital gains tax even though you receive no payment from your neighbour. The creation of de facto de jure easements is very common and this particular provision will cause many headaches. </PARA>
<PARA> (9) Where the family home is on a block less than 2 hectares but which is still big enough to subdivide, then any land subdivided off will be subject to capital gains tax. Ref: Sub-session 4. </PARA>
<PARA> (10) To claim the tax exemption for land that is adjacent to the family home even where the home is on less than 2 hectares, the land must be used primarily for private or domestic purposes. If this is not the case the land will be taxable regardless of its size. Ref: Sub-section 3. </PARA>
<PARA> (11) The family home of a couple which is a unit or flat in a retirement village may not be exempt from capital gains tax unless the owners have a title, a lease or shares in the title holding. Ref: Sub-section 2. </PARA>
<PARA> (12) Taxpayers can claim only one property as their principal place of residence, although two dwellings are permissible for up to three months where a taxpayer changes homes. Many thousand of Australians will be caught up in the situation where it takes longer to sell property than they had realised. Ref: Sub-section 8. </PARA>
<PARA> (13) A home owner acquires a home to be used as a sole or principal residence and places the first home on the market. In order to defray the high costs of bridging finance the first home is rented out. The ability to own 2 homes for up to 3 months is thereby denied and the home will be subject to the capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA> (14) A capital gains tax is payable where the family home is owned by a discretionary trust. Ref: Sub-section 160zz8 and Sub-section 12. </PARA>
<PARA> (15) If you purchase a property and undertake renovations before taking up residence then the property will for that period be subject to capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA> (16) If you purchase a vacant block, construct a home on it and move in within 4 years then the land will be exempt from capital gains tax. But if you purchase a block with an old house on it, with the intent of demolishing the old house and building a new home on it then you will pay tax on the land until you occupy the new house. </PARA>
<PARA> (17) It is common in some states, e.g. Western Australia for display homes to be purchased as a principal residence. Often the builder will require a lease-back for up to 18 months. The capital gains tax will apply during this period. </PARA>
<PARA> (18) If a beneficiary of an estate inherits a dwelling that was the principal residence of a deceased no capital gains tax will be payable if the property is disposed of within 12 months. Tax will be payable if the sale is delayed beyond this time limit. Legal difficulties and red tape can often delay the finalization of an estate. </PARA>
<PARA> (19) Under the capital gains tax a home remains exempt in cases of temporary absences of up to 4 years. The exemption is only available if upon resuming residence the taxpayer notified the Commissioner ``in writing not later than the date of lodgement of the taxpayer's return of income for the year of income in which the dwelling again became the sole or principal residence of the taxpayer . . .''</PARA>
<PARA> If you are elderly and do not understand the complexities of the tax, or you simply forget you will pay the tax. </PARA>
<PARA> (20) If part of your property is compulsorily acquired for road widening purposes then the compensation will be subject to the tax. Ref: Sub-section 4 (a). </PARA>
<PARA> Note: Exemptions for principal residences are all contained in Section 160zzq. All references are to the relevant Sub-section. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is worth while looking a little further at the effects of this exclusion of the principal private residence from capital gains tax. While obviously there are many sound reasons, not least political reasons, why that should be so, the fact is that that exclusion does create a preferred class of asset, namely, principal private residences. That has certain inexorable economic effects. The most important of these effects is that more and more people want to tie up a higher proportion of their assets in the principal private residence because they know that that will be one way of protecting them from the ravages of Mr Keating. Ever since this tax was introduced that has been going on with increasing force. We are seeing it in two ways: first, in the bidding up of housing prices; and, secondly, in the very sharp rise in the level of alterations and additions being made to houses. People are putting a second storey on their houses, adding another room, putting on a second garage-anything to tie up a higher proportion of their assets, in many cases, limited assets, in this form so that they will not be subject to Mr Keating's depredations. It is no good for the Government to say this is not happening, because it is. Anybody who asks people in the community about this will find out that it is happening.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator STONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is totally distorting the investment arrangements and the capital market, as Senator Lewis quite rightly says. The most notorious example of this is, of course, Sydney, where a first home buyer today needs a salary-this has been calculated recently by the Real Estate Institution of Australia-of over $65,000 a year in order to meet the monthly requirements of a medium priced house financed by an average home loan. Only about 15 per cent of families in Australia would satisfy that test. Only four years ago, in September 1985 when the capital gains tax was introduced, the income needed for that same purpose was only $23,700, which was just above average weekly earnings at that time, whereas now it is about 2 1/4 times average weekly earnings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> How does one avoid this problem which the Government has created by its own tax? There are only two ways of avoiding it: either the Government includes the principal private residence within the ambit of the tax-in other words, it reverses the exclusion that it has made-or it abolishes the tax. The Opposition is promising to do the latter. The question is: Will the Government do the former? Will the Government, in fact, abolish the exclusion? The Government is set upon maintaining the capital gains tax. In order to get rid of this distortion from the capital market-the kind of thing which I would expect Senator Walsh to care about, for example, because he is an intellectually rigorous person in these matters-and in order to achieve that degree of rigour, will it therefore abolish the exclusion? Will it include the principal private residence within the ambit of the tax?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kelty of the Australian Council of Trade Unions has said recently that the ACTU wants to include any dwellings worth more than $1m within the ambit of the capital gains tax. One might say that that is a very small proportion of dwellings-although these days I suppose it is an increasingly large proportion, given the inflation in the cost of dwellings. But it is a foot in the door. I might say that, when the ACTU wants something from this Government, the ACTU usually gets it. </PARA>
<PARA> Who is affected by the capital gains tax? What did Mr Keating say about the capital gains tax originally? In a statement on 19 September 1985 he said:</PARA>
<PARA> As an illustration of the fact that this tax will affect only a tiny section of the population, its expected revenue yield in the fifth year of operation-</PARA>
<PARA>that is 1990-91, I think-</PARA>
<PARA>is estimated to be only $25m. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, it is important to note that since that time there have been two major changes in the capital gains tax. The one we have today is not the same as that which was introduced by the Treasurer over four years ago. This is the death of a thousand cuts process, with which we are familiar from this Government. Firstly, on 20 May 1988 the Government decided to repeal section 26aaa of the Income Tax Assessment Act. That was the section which taxed, as short term speculative gain, transactions which took place within 12 months of each other. In other words, when an asset was sold within 12 months of its having been bought, any gain was taxed as income. On 25 May 1988 the Government repealed that and included such transactions within the ambit of the capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, and more importantly, from 1988-89 superannuation funds, which were not originally subject to the capital gains tax, were brought within its ambit-and, I might say, brought within its ambit in a much more extensive manner than they were in the original announcement for assets covered by it. At the time of the original announcement the Government excluded from the tax assets which had been purchased before 19 September 1985. But when the Government imposed the capital gains tax on the assets of superannuation funds it made no such `grandfather' exclusion. Therefore, all assets, whenever acquired, held by superannuation funds are subject to the capital gains tax whenever they are disposed of. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, that is an enormous addition to the ambit of the tax because those funds hold a very high proportion of the total share and property assets held by all Australians. So we have a totally different animal today from that which we had in 1985. That is one reason why these estimates, which the Treasurer has been running around the country spouting, are totally ludicrous. They have no relevance to the situation today. The Treasurer has been quoting some estimates from the income year 1987-88. At that time the tax had been in operation for only just over two years anyway and a relatively small number of transactions had taken place. People were locked in. Again, that is one of the charges that the Government is making against our proposals, but in fact the Government's own tax was locking people in. People who held pre-1985 assets were not selling them and people who held post-1985 acquired assets were also reluctant to sell them. All of the Treasurer's criticisms in terms of favouring the rich and things like that are based upon these figures, which have no relevance to the situation today. They were relevant before the repeal of section 26aaa and before the inclusion of superannuation funds. No valid conclusions whatsoever can be drawn from these figures. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators know the old statement about how to lie with statistics; Mr Keating is carrying that to its usual fine art. Yet Mr Keating says that only rich people are affected. That is simply untrue. The fact is that there are 750,000 to 800,000 small businesses in this country. They are terribly affected by this tax, for reasons which my colleagues will develop. There are one million individual shareholders, most of whom are not rich; by definition, we do not have anything like one million rich people in this country. There are four million beneficiaries of superannuation funds. Certainly most of them are not rich, and indeed the number is increasing almost daily as a result of the Government's own policies to give more and more people in the work force access to the benefits of superannuation, a policy which, I may say, is thoroughly supported by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> What a lot of piffle to suggest that the capital gains tax is not affecting little people. Of course, it is affecting little people. It is affecting them much more than it is affecting anybody else. As always, of course, ways can be found around some of these taxes; and the people who will find them will generally be big people, not little people. In the final analysis, companies too are simply agglomerations of shareholders. In the end, even applying the capital gains tax to companies impacts, at the final analysis, upon their shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA> Small business, of course, is the heartland of this economy. Roughly 50 per cent of non-rural private sector employment is provided by small business. About 2.1 million people are employed in those businesses. The construction industry is 70 per cent or more made up of small business; the retail sector is about 60 per cent made up of small business; the transport sector and the personal services sector are about 60 per cent small business. Employment in those businesses is growing much faster than employment in big business. Over 100,000 farmers are in this category. </PARA>

One has only to look at its attack upon the pharmacists and upon the tourism industry, by way of prolonging the pilots dispute through the inflamation of the dispute by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). One has only to look at the recent tax proposal which we were dealing with in this Senate only a few days ago in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1989, to bring forward, as originally proposed on 15 August, the tax payment by all small business people to make them pay 85 per cent of their tax liability within 15 days of the end of the financial year. That is what this Government thinks about small businesses. It has backed off from that as a result of Opposition pressure. We are very glad that it has-but that is its attitude.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that the capital gains tax is just another impost on small business. Peter Boyle, the National Director of the Australian Small Business Association, has said:</PARA>
<PARA>Keating's Capital Gains Tax is like a brick wall in front of business investment. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Rick Farley of the National Farmers Federation has said:</PARA>
<PARA>Taxing capital gains also discourages entrepreneurial development and the adjustment of asset portfolios which are crucial to improving Australia's productivity. </PARA>
<PARA>The capital gains tax is terribly complex. Mr Eric Risstrom, the Executive Director of the Australian Taxpayers Association, recently said:</PARA>
<PARA>Even Treasurer Keating must concede that the law (on Capital Gains Tax) is almost too complex to continue as now. </PARA>
<PARA>The dreadful record keeping requirements that the tax imposes upon small business will be one of the reasons why, when in government, we will remove it from the date on which the Government introduced it. There is the whole scare tactic concerning avoidance. The Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) knows perfectly well that that is all rubbish. The tax law has been amended since all of those rorts of the late 1970s occurred, and it was amended by the conservative Government at the time. The Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980, and part IVa of the Income Tax Assessment Act dealt with those matters. We do not want them raked up again at this time. </PARA>

He has obviously been spending too much time with Joh and the white shoe and brown paper bag brigade in Queensland. I will not leave that charge hanging in the air. Senator Stone asserted that the exclusion of the principal residence from the provisions of the capital gains tax law has caused a boom in house prices, an increase in house sizes and an increase in the amount of renovations, extensions and additions which have been done. He said that one has only to look around the streets to see what has been happening. In other words, that is impressionistic evidence. He should have looked at the figures put out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)-something I would have expected him to do when he was Treasury Secretary, and before he mingled with the white shoe and brown paper bag brigade in Queensland. If he had looked at the ABS figures he would have seen that in 1982-83 the percentage of spending on extensions and alterations within the total private sector building expenditure was 13.7 per cent. The next year it was 12.6 per cent. For 1984-85 it was 12.7 per cent. It did go up in the next year to 14.9 per cent, but the capital gains tax was introduced during that financial year and is unlikely to have had any significant effect on it. The figure went up to above 17 per cent for the next two years but for the most recent year-1988-89-it fell to 15 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to new housing. The percentage of total private sector residential building expenditure is the same as it was for the financial year 1985-86. It is well known that I am on record several times as saying that Australians spend more on houses than the country can afford. I believe that is the truth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the size of houses, as Senator Chaney said. Between 1970 and 1986 the average size of completed new dwellings in Australia increased by 34 per cent. The exclusion of the principal residence from capital gains tax had no effect on that-and could have no effect on it. That figure has increased a little further since then, I believe. Concerning house prices in Sydney, I will seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table of ABS figures. I believe, as the note at the bottom of the table states, that it relates to the prices of newly completed houses and not necessarily old houses. As we all know, there has been a house price boom in Sydney recently. When one looks at this table one finds that it was not until the third quarter of the calendar year 1988 that, in real terms, house prices reached the level that they had been at during the third quarter of 1981. Of course, since 1988 they have come down considerably. This shows that house price booms are cyclical, and that the increase in size of newly completed housing and the increase in proportion of total building expenditure on alterations and additions since the introduction of the capital gains tax have not changed appreciably. I suggest to Senator Stone that it would have been better if he had looked at the ABS figures instead of giving the impressions he picks up on the Sunshine Coast and when he is travelling around with the white shoe and brown paper bag brigade, because those people are probably not-indeed, I know they are not-representative of ordinary Australians. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should say by way of explanation that there was a handwritten comment on the bottom of the document, which was put on by somebody in my office, and which I have deleted from the incorporation, which explained that we believe the table refers only to newly completed houses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other remarkable thing about Senator Stone's speech is that he said hardly anything about investment. We heard a great deal about the alleged shortcomings of the Government's policy on capital gains taxation; we heard very little about investment until the last couple of minutes of his speech. The general rationale of the Opposition's policy is that it will change investment behaviour, and change it in the desirable way-that is, that investment will be directed towards productive enterprises, particularly those that produce internationally tradable goods or services, rather than as happens under the existing rules. I will deal with that in some detail later. </PARA>
<PARA> Even if one makes the heroic assumption that it is correct that the Opposition's policy will change behaviour in a desirable way, how will it change behaviour retrospectively? Even making that massive concession, how can anyone justify the fact that this proposal from the Opposition will apply retrospectively to September 1985? That cannot change. It could be read into Senator Stone's earlier comments about movements in house sizes and prices that he believes in retrospective causation-that is, that the capital gains tax had some retrospective effect on behaviour-but that was just a bit of slothful preparation, if I may say so. There is no way that the Opposition's proposal can change investment decisions that have already been made and put into operation. </PARA>
<PARA> What possible justification is there for providing enormous windfall gains to a few people who have already made investment decisions? I know that the Opposition does not like anybody mentioning this, but it happens to be a matter of public record that one of those people-that is, the Federal President of the Liberal Party of Australia-stands to gain $18m because of his one cent paid shares alone. If the Opposition's policy were to be enacted, $18m would go to Mr Elliott, alone, for investment decisions-if one can call them that-that he made many years ago. Even if there is something to be said about this policy in its totality-I do not believe there is, and I will get on to that in a moment-nobody can argue that there is any case whatsoever for giving it retrospective application. </PARA>
<PARA> If one were really desperate, and I suspect that sooner or later the Opposition will become really desperate, one could argue that there is a case to go back to 10 March 1988 because it was on that date that the Opposition first announced this component of its policy. That is a pretty desperate argument, but at least it is something. But the Opposition has absolutely no argument at all to go beyond that point. Under a proposed tax change, the rationale for which is a change in a desirable way in investment patterns and savings and investment decisions, there is no justification for providing massive hand-outs to John Elliott et al for investment decisions that have already been made. All the verbosity in the world from Senator Stone will not change that fundamental fact. </PARA>
<PARA> I predict that, because that is such a simple issue, everybody will understand that the Opposition proposal is to give $18m for just part of Mr Elliott's portfolio, which will have no effect on investment decisions of the past. The public can easily understand the windfall gain of $18m to Mr Elliott. The other flaws in the Opposition's proposal are more complex; but the public will understand that flaw so easily that I predict that the Opposition, some time between now and its policy speech, will back away from that proposal. I certainly hope it does because there is absolutely no justification for it. </PARA>
<PARA> I also mention in passing that among the recent property acquisitions of the shadow Treasurer is a $900,000 property at Bowral-an investment decision that has already been made. In the absence of any assurance from the Opposition that there would be any change to its proposed capital gains taxation provisions, the shadow Treasurer would also be a beneficiary of the Opposition's policy sooner or later, should it be enacted. I refer briefly to a very good speech by Senator Hill on the subject of taxation. It was his maiden speech in the Senate on 9 September 1981. Quoting Professor Mathews, Senator Hill said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the taxation system `has been thoroughly discredited as a policy instrument for achieving the redistribution of wealth'. </PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is inequitable in that it taxes some wealth increments and not others. It taxes income to the extent that it increases wealth but not capital gains or windfall gains and results in a heavy bias towards the taxation of income. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Hill was, of course, quoting Professor Mathews with approval. Again approvingly, Senator Hill quoted Professor Mathews as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is plausible to argue that the taxation system has become a major instrument for redistributing incomes and wealth in favour of the rich. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Hill went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> On the objective of economic growth one need look only at the double taxation of dividends and earnings which is an obvious disincentive for savings and investment. The failure to meet reasonable objectives derives from the hotchpotch way in which the system has developed. </PARA>
<PARA>Since Professor Mathews and Senator Hill made those statements, this Government has cleaned up the system. In the face of almost total opposition from the Liberal Party and the National Party of Australia, the Government got rid of the double taxation of dividends. The Government has also cleaned up the system with a fringe benefits tax, the non-deductability of entertainment expenses-no more boozy lunches at taxpayers' expense-substantiation, capital gains tax, and by applying the same rules to goldmining as apply to every other industry. On all of those clean-ups of the taxation system, the Opposition resolutely opposed the Government. I note with some satisfaction and gratitude that on all but one of those matters, the Opposition has dropped its resistance to the changes that the Government made. The Opposition either has been educated about the intrinsic merit of the changes that were made or has decided that there is no point in continuing futile opposition to them. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that stands out is this question of capital gains tax. When we add that anomaly to the fact that the specific Opposition proposal is one that provides massive windfall gains-this is a matter of public record-to the Federal President of the Liberal Party, we are entitled to be suspicious. There is not much point in Senator Stone saying that we should not point our finger in this matter. That sort of response implicitly suggests that we should shoot the messenger for pointing out that something very peculiar has been going on. I challenge Senator Chaney, Senator Stone, Dr Hewson-I would not bother challenging Mr Peacock-and any other speaker to produce any rationale whatsoever for the proposed retrospective application of the Opposition's proposal for the delivery of literally tens of millions of dollars in windfall gains to people who have already made investment decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I intended to quote a bit more of Senator Hill's speech but let me just say this: tax experts such as Senator Hill, Mr Asprey, Professor Mathews and, more recently, Sir William Cole have been unanimous about one thing: there is a need for a capital gains tax to maintain the integrity of the whole taxation system. One of the reasons that all those people came to that conclusion was that they knew very well that at the base of the massive tax avoidance and evasion schemes of the late 1970s and the early 1980s was the synthetic conversion of income to capital gain for taxation purposes. The Opposition is inviting the reopening of all those scandals from which it ultimately suffered politically, and rightly so. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Stone referred to statements by Mr Peter Boyle of the Australian Small Business Association wherein he said that the capital gains tax is a brick wall in front of business investment. If that is so, I wonder whether Mr Boyle can explain why right now business investment is running at the highest level ever recorded. It would seem that Mr Boyle has fallen for the same sort of intellectual sloth that Senator Stone has fallen for: their conclusions are predetermined and they do not bother to look at the evidence. So much for Mr Boyle. </PARA>
<PARA> To go a bit beyond that, since the capital gains tax was introduced, business investment has grown at an average rate of over 10 per cent in real terms. For the five years prior to the introduction of the capital gains tax the rate was 1.6 per cent. I know that other factors were involved, particularly the very deep recession of 1982-83, but nobody who actually looks at the statistics can honestly come to the conclusion that the existence of the capital gains tax has been a deterrent to business investment because it has been running at very much higher levels since the Government's introduction of the capital gains tax than in the preceding period. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point that I will probably have time to make concerns the question of housing. Just imagine what would happen to house prices, other things being equal, if the Opposition's proposal were introduced. People's anticipation of considerable and totally untaxed capital gains on residential property would set off a surge in demand for that residential property assisted-I am sure Senator Haines will mention this-by negative gearing. People will not necessarily save for this so-called investment. They will go out and borrow for this so-called investment. There will be such a rush to do that that the expectation of capital gains in the short term will be fulfilled. Literally tens of thousands of people will be going into the home market-not to buy a house for themselves but negatively gearing to buy a house. Because of that addition on the demand side with no short term change in supply, no doubt the price of houses will take off unless we are in the midst of a very deep recession. As I said, ceteris paribus, there is no reasonable doubt that that will happen. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be some winners-a point which the Democrats have never understood. Under those circumstances housing rents are likely to fall. The minority of people who rent houses will probably get lower rents after a short period because many more people will be buying residential property for that purpose. For people who want to buy houses it is very bad news. Interest rates are also likely to be higher because of the change. But what will happen in the end? We will have yet another boom, fed by a tax policy change; massive escalation in the price of real estate and residential property, feeding on itself after a period because the original expectations in the short term will be fulfilled-self-fulfilling prophecies-until the whole market comes crashing down as the house of cards of the Bond empire is doing right now. In the end, the Opposition's proposal will do considerable damage to the economy as well as proving its fundamental inequity and illogicality. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had not intended to mention negative gearing but since Senator Walsh has brought it to my attention, I think it is probably worth while pointing out that our concern is not so much that negative gearing applies for people who want to buy homes to rent out to other people but that no benefit applies to people who are buying a home for themselves, as exists, for example, in the United States and the United Kingdom, where not only do investors get the right to write off all of the interest that they pay on borrowings to buy a home that they are going to let somebody else live in, but so do families who are buying their own home get that sort of tax break. Both the United Kingdom and the United States governments are far more generous to families buying their own home than this Government. I thank the Minister for reminding me of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I begin by referring to one paragraph in the excellent editorial in the Australian Financial Review of 25 November which mentions some of the political issues and investment issues surrounding the speculative gains tax which the Opposition is discussing today. The second point raised in that editorial was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the proposed change could affect revenue even if the coalition does not gain government. Over the next six months a ``lock-in effect'' will take place as investors respond to the incentive to avoid realising their assets until the future tax situation is clarified by the outcome of the election. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me clarify the situation for those people who are worried about whether there will be a lock-in effect. For the record, the coalition's plans to remove the capital gains tax, in any way, are doomed to failure. Such a measure will not get through the Senate because the Senate will not be in the hands of the coalition after the next election regardless of whether it gets the numbers in the House of Representatives and is able to form government. No piece of legislation becomes law in Australia until it has been passed by both Houses of Parliament in an identical form. That is what the Senate is here for-to operate as a House of review to ensure that we do not have the dictatorship that occurs when one party has the majority in both Houses, or as happens in Queensland, where there is only one House of Parliament in any event. </PARA>
<PARA> Having supported the introduction of the capital gains tax on economic and tax equity grounds in the first place in 1985, the Australian Democrats will certainly not be party to watering it down simply because a coalition government is in power. To do that would take us back to the old days, when people who worked hard to earn money were forced to pay tax and people who got a capital gain, either speculatively, through some quirk of inflation or through something else, were able to get away scot-free. We all know that the people who are in a position to risk their money, to speculate, and to take up the investments that are likely to produce a capital gain are those on the higher incomes. I for one have never been able to understand the back-bench comments that I heard during some of the tax debates last week: that when one takes a risk with money one ought to be entitled to have any gain made from that risk tax-free. Nobody makes that argument in relation to income that is earned by people in high risk occupations. They are still expected to pay their fair share of income tax. To put a capital investment in a separate box is a little bizarre. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia we have a highly inequitable economic system. Incomes, assets and wealth are very inequitably distributed. As a report from the University of New South Wales, released a couple of months ago, indicates, the top 20 per cent of families in Australia receive about 44 per cent of gross income. That is, of all families in Australia in receipt of income-that is most of them-20 per cent receive almost half. The bottom 20 per cent, on the other hand, receive about 4.6 per cent of the income in this country. As a consequence of that, poverty is a continuing problem in Australia. It is not just child poverty that is still with us, despite the Prime Minister's promise that no child would be living in poverty by 1990; it is general poverty. That sort of thing will not be helped by the Opposition's Economic Action Plan-for two reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> That plan proposes two major changes that are designed to distribute wealth and income even more inequitably than is currently the case. Consequently, this would increase the number of Australian adults and children living in poverty. The first proposal that the Opposition is putting forward in its Economic Action Plan is designed to reduce the incomes of those people living in poverty and to push more Australians into poverty by cutting out unemployment benefits after nine months. This is the proposal that produced the famous John Elliott line-namely, that the Opposition was intending to take from the bludgers to give to the workers. I suggest that somebody wave under his nose an Australian Bureau of Statistics sheet or any other analysis of exactly which groups in the community make up the long term unemployed. Despite a lot of the mythology in this country, that group does not consist of layabout 18-year-olds. </PARA>
<PARA> In the main, people who have been unemployed for nine months or longer are people in their mid-forties, men and women. In particular, they are men who have been made redundant because of some changes in their workplace, and women who are in their forties whose children have left home, and who are trying to join the work force, perhaps because they have been widowed or divorced or simply because they feel able to do it. Those are the women who are not able to find the employment that they want. Those are the ones that the Opposition helped the Government push further into poverty by saying that once the youngest child was 16 years old, the mother would no longer receive the class B widow's pension and would have to get a job or go onto unemployment benefit. The Opposition's proposal is not a solution to the teenage, unemployment level. It is an attack on mature aged men and women, many of whom still have families. </PARA>
<PARA> The second coalition proposal which would make Australian society more and more inequitable is the one that we are debating primarily today-that is, to virtually make a capital gains tax payment optional. The so-called speculative gains tax that the Opposition would have in its place would drop the proportion of taxable gains by 20 per cent a year so that if an asset is held for over five years, essentially, no capital gains tax would be payable. As a result, those people who have access to corporate lawyers and clever accountants, and who have the money through their income or other investments in order to further invest, will be able to benefit and, in fact, will stop paying capital gains tax at the end of five years. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth while having a closer look at the editorial in the Australian Financial Review of 25 October this year. It began by outlining the proposal and said:</PARA>
<PARA> The speculative gain tax would progressively phase out over five years . . . </PARA>
<PARA>These are the sorts of comments that I have just made. It went on to point out:</PARA>
<PARA> The coalition proposal would also tax gains made on assets held for up to one year in real, rather than nominal, terms, softening the present treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> With virtually no analysis of its proposal, the coalition suggests that the replacement of Labor's capital gain tax with its speculative gain tax would provide . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . And it quoted, presumably from the Liberal Party policy, `an incentive to save and invest'. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition is not keen enough to encourage people to save and to provide savings for other people's investment areas by removing some of the tax on interest that people earn on savings. We keep talking about how other nationalities have moved ahead in leaps and bounds while we have remained stagnant. Many of those countries which have a far better developed industrial and technological base have been able to achieve it because 30, 40 or more years ago their governments took the deliberate step of not taxing the interest on savings that ordinary people were putting into banks and other savings institutions. Japan, for example, has only very recently imposed a tax-even then it is a small one in comparison to Australia's-on the interest that people earn on their savings. There are a number of other countries-Canada is one; Italy and France are others-where a certain amount of interest earnings is quarantined from tax. If one earns, say, $800 or $1,000 in interest, that money is tax free. What one earns after that in interest on savings is taxed, but the first part of it is not. That is a significant and genuine incentive to save across the income spectrum that is certainly not provided by abolishing the capital gains tax. The editorial went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> But according to even modest calculations, a speculative gain tax would cause a wave of reactions that would see billions of dollars lost in unrealised tax liabilities, further distort the tax system's treatment of investment and direct a lot of private-sector energy into arranging affairs to exploit the arbitrary phase-out schedule. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stone says that the calculations by the Australian Financial Review were wrong. Perhaps they were. I have no knowledge of who is right-Senator Stone or the editorial writer in the Financial Review. But I do know that there is a much lesser likelihood of incentives to save and invest coming through an abolition of the capital gains tax than if the Government-either coalition, Labor or anybody else-took direct moves to encourage people to put their money in the bank, instead of spending it, at a specified interest rate that is lower than market values. This would mean that people who wanted to borrow to invest in, say, new export products for new export markets or import replacement items so that we were not as reliant on bringing goods into the country could get cheaper money and would therefore be far more prepared to put their time, energies and efforts into those sorts of areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Instead of talking about a silly abolition of a capital gains tax policy, we ought to be looking at helping home buyers in this country and small businesses which are currently facing crippling interest rates by ensuring that more money is put in those lending institutions, in sufficient volumes for banks and other lending institutions to be able to lend out at lower interest rates than we are currently seeing, so that that money can be applied to developing new products and new markets and thereby reducing the reliance on imported goods. If we are serious about increasing equity, domestic savings and our export markets and maintaining the high levels of high ownership that have become the norm in Australia, whilst at the same time reducing imports, our foreign debt, and the sale of Australian assets to foreigners-something which the Opposition's Economic Action Plan would lift the lid off completely, by the way-we have to look at re-regulating, not further deregulating, the economy so that the Australian Government can retain control of it and so that we can directly assist Australian exporters; those many small businesses out there that are currently struggling to the point of going under with high interest rates, and our home buyers who are watching the people investing in the housing market get a massive tax break while they are forced to sell their homes out from underneath themselves and their children because they can no longer afford the mortgage rates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Liberal-National Party initiatives in limiting the impact of a capital gains tax to five years have been enthusiastically received and acknowledged right across this country. In the words of the Australian Small Business Association, Keating's capital gains tax is like a brick wall in front of business incentives. More importantly, the Association states that the coalition policy will entice investors to look to the longer term. In fact, the Small Business Association is very well aware of the impact the capital gains tax will have on the goodwill of small businesses-a goodwill which is taxed but which is earned after successive years of hard work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the rural side, the National Farmers Federation said that the taxing of capital gains discourages entrepreneurial development and the adjustment of asset portfolios which are crucial to improving Australia's productivity. Capital gains tax is seen by many, at a sad time of their lives, as a de facto death duty in circumstances where families are forced to sell assets to meet estate settlements. This is despite Keating's earlier assurances that a capital gains tax would not apply in the case of death. </PARA>
<PARA> Superannuation investment people have welcomed our policy as it will limit the amount of paperwork and, at the same time, increase the return to superannuants. One may well ask: Why has there been this sudden reaction, this sudden enthusiasm for the Liberal Party's approach? Members of the Australian Labor Party and its various Treasurers are constantly using every opportunity available to them to introduce new taxes and to rearrange the collective powers to bring forward revenue. There have been recent government decisions to bring forward the payment of pay-as-you-earn tax instalments and to increase the frequency of payments from once a month to twice a month. Superannuation adjustments brought forward payments and collected new taxes amounting to over $1 billion. Last week the Senate debated Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) which effectively and dramatically brings forward the collection period of taxation for companies. </PARA>
<PARA> What will the Liberal-National Party do? We will abolish Labor's capital gains tax, but we will introduce a new speculative gains tax which will apply to shortterm speculative gains. Such gains will be taxable on a sliding scale over five years and after five years there will be no tax on capital gains. Labor's capital gains tax is producing the wrong sort of investment for Australia. While consumer spending is causing massive problems for the balance of payments, insufficient productive investment expenditure is taking place. The contrast is that the Liberal-National Party looks to the longterm and the Labor Party looks to shortterm political expedience. Here in Australia we have an overvalued dollar, and 20 to 24 per cent interest rates are impeding longterm investment. Labor's capital gains tax is causing a high overinvestment in expensive private housing and real estate. These are hardly initiatives one would expect from a traditional Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> Since Australia derives its export income predominantly from primary industries and mining, it is a sad commentary on Labor's priorities that taxes tend to discriminate very heavily against miners, and also farmers. After all, farmers generally reside in less expensive housing than their city counterparts. If we use Senator Walsh's argument that the price of land is directly related to the market return off that land, there is not a lot of incentive for farmers to put very much money into expensive houses as there is for their counterparts in the city. </PARA>
<PARA> The capital gains tax under Labor harbours inefficiencies and, unfortunately, it is discriminatory. The cost of record keeping is quite horrendous, particularly for small investors who have perhaps $1,000 to invest in a number of market-listed securities. This is the result of the disproportionate amount of accountancy costs in preparing returns for the component on capital gains vis-a-vis other income. Unfortunately, this Labor Party has tended, where possible, to load taxpayers with obligations and, at the same time, take away their rights. The Australian Taxation Office could do well to publish information on the nature and extent of record keeping of the horrendous implications of the capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal-National Party's speculative gains tax is the first signal of a lower tax regime for Australia. It is innovative with a special five-year write-down on speculative profits. Not unnaturally, Mr Keating is a little worried about the general reaction, particularly from the business community. The business community is worried about the ever-extending tentacles of the capital gains tax. At a recent meeting of the Business Council of Australia Mr Keating took the opportunity of chastening Council members because of their concerns about the impact of the capital gains tax. At the same time, he urged them to go out and openly support Labor's capital gains tax measures. Not surprisingly, most people in the audience at the venue, the Sydney Hilton, saw it as a slur on their independence. But I ask: What is new?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Keating is not alone in abolishing independent bodies that are evaluators of public policy and replacing them with government advisory lap-dogs. Why should businesses continually accept without question government impositions without so much as a whimper? Businesses of late have been subjected to a tirade of attacks on their so-called poor management. Regrettably, many of these attacks have been quite personal, affecting such respected figures as Sir Arvi Parbo of the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, who had a confrontation with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in respect of Kakadu. The chemists and the pilots have also been subject to invective because they are not automatic bag carriers for the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The capital gains tax has had serious ramifications for the Australian economy. It has been a disincentive to savings and investment, making Australia more and more dependent on overseas funds. Experience elsewhere has shown that when the rates on capital gain are reduced there is a significant increase in economic activity. Countries similar to Australia which have previously introduced capital gains tax have done so before the onset of high inflation levels. At a time when the Government should be encouraging the restructuring of enterprises, the capital gains tax has effectively locked up investment in low return enterprises and has led to a misuse of resources and to an underuse of assets. People have been discouraged from converting their funds into assets because they fear that their capital profits will be taxed. Rather then internal management action being taken to move enterprises to new areas of investment, nothing has happened, leaving the door open for unscrupulous take over merchants to raid companies. Australia must restore the incentives to work and save by reducing taxes. At the same time, we must achieve a proper balance between direct and indirect taxes, but not in a regressive manner as is the case with the capital gains tax. One commentator on the capital gains tax said:</PARA>
<PARA> Legislation has been drafted on the premise that anything that remotely looks like a gain is taxable unless it is specifically exempt and that complexity often creates its own inequities. </PARA>
<PARA>Governments all too frequently have been required, under the force of public pressure, to make subsequent announcements of intended changes to remove unintended consequences. This is known as government by press release. Unfortunately, the changes can take up to three years to be debated and passed through the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week during Question Time I raised a question concerning the anomaly of options which have lapsed being taxed in circumstances where the market value of the shares has collapsed. This is a harsh imposition since, normally, options when taken up become part of the capital structure of a company. Not surprisingly, an immediate answer was not forthcoming. Rather, the only offering was a tirade of insult and abuse directed at a prominent business individual. All too often in this place honest answers are lacking. This evasiveness is part and parcel of the present Government's attitude, since every action and every statement is made for local public consumption and is directed at maximising short term voter appeal. After all, options are really capital raised from the market and their subsequent non-conversion in the case of a share market collapse does not and should not alter their character in the long term. It will be interesting to see the Government's response. The proper course of action would be to amend the Act. However, it would not be surprising to find the Australian Taxation Office chasing after some unusual company resolutions using as its weapon the anti-avoidance provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The real question before us today is whether the capital gains tax in its present form is good for Australia. The tax has been shown to be no reward for savings and productive investment. That is the key. Australia needs a high level of domestic savings together with productive investment. However, under Labor's mismanagement with its capital gains tax and other taxes, we have lived in an era of greed and extravagance, of paper profits and a public adoration for the wealth gains of the speculative company entrepreneurs. Soundly-based enterprises with minimum debt structures are daily looking over their shoulders as takeover merchants are lurking in the wings. No wonder investment in manufacturing is weak and the importation of consumer items increased in volume by 20 per cent last year. Under this Labor Party Administration, the universities find difficulty in training a sufficient number of accountants and actuaries to cope with the demand from the financial markets. Today, money is not to be made through improving efficiencies and expanding into new markets but through money manipulation and merchant banking. Therefore, all these conditions not unnaturally lead to an increasing foreign debt, a debt that we owe to overseas individuals and organisations amounting to $110 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Equity, efficiency and simplicity are essential features of any taxation system. How well does the capital gains tax measure up to the three universally recognised criteria? Firstly, equity means that people in similar or equivalent circumstances pay the same amount of tax and also that the tax paid is appropriate to their ability to pay that tax. The second criteria, that of efficiency, means that taxes should not hinder but rather promote economic growth and that tax should be assessed on its impact as to whether it encourages or discourages people to work, to save, to take risks and to invest. Thirdly, simplicity means that the tax should be easily understood and not inconvenient or costly to collect. How does Labor's capital gains tax measure up to the criteria of equity, efficiency and simplicity or, to put it in modern day parlance, to the creation of a level playing field?</PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, there are a number of arbitrary and politically expedient anomalies which lead to distortion. Section 160z (8) and section 23f of the Income Tax Assessment Act exclude the union movement from such taxes. Residential owner-occupied residences are exempt from capital gains tax. This causes distortions. Vertical equity relates to an ability to pay. Farmers often have high asset values and low incomes-living like paupers and dying as millionaires. They also have to put up with some unusual capital gains treatment. For example, one farmer putting a drainage easement through his neighbour's land gives rise to the imposition of a capital gains tax. The capital gains tax fails to acknowledge that the ability of a capital gain to earn involves a withholding or a passing up of an earlier consumption pattern and that, prior to investment, savings must take place. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to the efficiency of the capital gains tax. The United States experience has shown that a capital gains tax is a disincentive to saving. Australia has a poor record of raising capital. We remain very dependent on foreign investment. Given our parlous international financial position, which has been reflected in two recent financial downgradings, can we afford any further disincentive to savings and investment? The capital gains tax is a disincentive to investment. As such, it is a disincentive to farmers and others to move to more productive investments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact that we are having this matter of public importance debate today and that it is about a proposal in the Liberal Party's so-called Economic Action Plan says some interesting things about the priorities of the Opposition. First, it is proposing in its so-called economic action plan to take $450m of money contributed by ordinary Australians and give it to the richest minority of Australians who pay the overwhelming majority of capital gains tax. Secondly, it has chosen to initiate a matter of public importance on this matter, amongst the myriad of issues confronting the Australian people today. I think ordinary Australians would be fascinated by this statement of the Opposition's priorities, and they would be entitled to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, Senator Stone made it quite clear that the reason for the matter of public importance has nothing to do with the fact that this is considered to be the most important issue on the Opposition agenda but that the attacks that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) have been making have obviously been hurting politically. The Opposition's market research must be telling the same story as ours. I am grateful for that because it means that this issue of equity is on the political agenda for the forthcoming election, and that is a very good thing. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to come back in this reasonably short contribution if time permits to the ostensible reasons for the benefits of the so-called speculative gains tax against the capital gains tax, about small business, long term investment and savings. They are important issues to have raised and I will endeavour to return to them. </PARA>
<PARA> I want first to deal with what is really being proposed by the Opposition and the consequences of the transfer from the capital gains tax to the speculative gains tax. There have been a large number of contributions to public debate since the economic action plan was released, and I intend to refer to four. The first is by Ross Gittins in the Sydney Morning Herald of 8= November. His is the latest, not the first. I would normally quote in time sequence, but it has a rather pithy summary with which I would like to start before I quote the others. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>Here is an idea for a special, upper-class-only tax cut . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is not a bad summary of what we are talking about-an `upper-class-only tax cut'. One can understand why it would appeal to a party which has a large majority of its support from the disproportionately wealthy in our society. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . $450m a year divided between a comparative handful of higher income-earners. </PARA>
<PARA> On present indications, about 10,000 taxpayers, each earning more than $50,000 a year, stand to make tax savings averaging $150 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> When Mr Peacock became Leader of the Opposition, he said he stood for a fairer, more compassionate Australia. This, apparently, is what he meant. It's a great trick. There are you and I telling ourselves that its really quite fair-</PARA>
<PARA>I must admit that I was not doing that but apparently Mr Gittins was-</PARA>
<PARA>because most of the people on welfare are bludgers-</PARA>
<PARA>so cutting out on welfare was apparently a good idea-</PARA>
<PARA>while Andrew slips half a bill to the Libs business constituency. </PARA>
<PARA>He is there quite succinctly attacking the equity base of the plan. Some paragraphs later he goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> But if the plan to abandon capital gains tax shows a strange idea of fairness-</PARA>
<PARA>and indeed it does-</PARA>
<PARA>it also shows a strange idea of what is needed to fix the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>I think this is the more important point:</PARA>
<PARA> Andrew and his mates preach loud and long about the need for greater efficiency, for increased investment in the more productive parts of the economy and for business to be given the ubiquitous `level playing-field'. Abolishing capital gains would be a step back from all those things. </PARA>
<PARA>To which I say, `Hear, hear!'. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA> If you don't tax all forms of incomes equally, you favour some taxpayers over others, depending on the sources of their income. That's unfair whether the people with income from exempt sources have a lot of income or a little. </PARA>
<PARA> But if you exempt income derived from the sale of assets, you tend to favour higher-income earners-those most able to bear their share of the cost of government-because they're the ones who can afford to buy assets. </PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no clearer indication of how concentrated the burden of capital gains tax is on higher-income-earners, or of who would benefit from its abolition. </PARA>
<PARA>Disproportionately that is true, but not exclusively. I do not pretend that the only people who pay are the wealthy people, but disproportionately they are. It is a redistributive measure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Which the Opposition would not change. As the honourable senator knows, the top tax rate cut is about 1 1/2 times the average weekly earnings and a lot of ordinary Australian workers are paying it. I wish that was not so, but that is the case at the moment. The Weekend Australian of 4 and 5 November makes a lot of scathing comments. I do not have time to read all of its criticisms, so I will concentrate on those which are relevant to the alleged benefits as outlined in the matter of public importance. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Coalition claims this as a reform providing an `incentive to save and invest'. The result would in fact be to return Australia to the days when tax avoidance was rife as everybody and his dog rushed into schemes to make income smell like capital. </PARA>
<PARA>That is undoubtedly true, and perhaps one of the reasons underlying the support from some of those people quoted by Senator Stone. More importantly, it goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Far from boosting savings the policy would do the opposite by encouraging debt. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not have time to go into why that is so but Senator Walsh outlined that quite explicitly. The article goes on to say that this policy:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . would exacerbate Australia's fundamental economic problems by tempting people into debt in pursuit of a tax rip-off. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Age there is a whole editorial criticising this badly flawed proposal. In summary-and I make only two points here-it says:</PARA>
<PARA> The promised change would distort tax equity and resource allocation, and, unless qualified, would be open to rorts by the financially sophisticated. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> The abolition of capital gains tax and its replacement by a short term gains tax would, apart from providing almost immediate windfall profits for the rich, again open the tax system to abuses by the tax avoidance industry. It would increase the incentive to pour money into negatively geared property and shares instead of productive investment . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on about both the equity and the efficiency points at some length. What it is saying in both areas is correct: it is neither equitable nor efficient. The last quote I wish to make in these introductory remarks relates to an input by Terry McCrann on 29 October calling for the proposal for the speculative tax to be junked. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Peacock proposes to turn back the clock and once again unleash the assembled might of the legal, accounting and financial professions in the drive to turn otherwise taxable income into tax-free capital gains of five year's standing. </PARA>
<PARA> That is unacceptable-not only on equity grounds, but in terms of promoting the very changes necessary to make Australia more competitive and more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA> We don't want our best brains and available resources devoted to shuffling bits of paper for tax and financial reasons. Better they be directed to investing in and building real businesses. </PARA>
<PARA>Those people have summarised the Opposition's proposal as both inequitable in its redistributive aspects and economically inefficient in terms of its impact on the likely investment and savings patterns in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn briefly to the alleged benefits of the transfer to speculative gains tax with regard to small business, investment and savings. Everybody trumpets small business when they want to try to appeal to a special target group in debate about nebulous economic concepts because small business is so hard to define. The last thing I would do in trying to gain an assessment of benefits for small business is quote that front group for the Liberal Party, the Australian Small Business Association, for which Mr Peter Boyle is the spokesman, who really only uses it as a forum for his own perverse, ideological views. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, only a very small proportion of capital gains tax proceeds comes from small business. Less than 2 1/2 per cent of corporate taxpayers paid any capital gains tax in 1987-88 and 68 per cent of capital gains tax came from the 1.4 per cent of companies with the highest taxable incomes. That is a very inequitable way of providing assistance to small business. There would be a problem if either the inflation benefit or the goodwill benefit in business were directly taxed. Both of these things I think would be a significant cause for concern. But we all know that capital gains tax applies only to the real benefit and that the design of the capital gains tax provides a deliberate concession for small business in the form of targeted goodwill exemption. It has been structured in such a way that it is equitable across types of taxpayers, that is, pay as you earn taxpayers and corporate taxpayers, and between corporate taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> The most fascinating assertion of all is that the Opposition's proposal would encourage investment. Firstly, in the five years before capital gains tax we had an annual investment growth of 1.6 per cent. In the five years since its introduction, we have had an annual investment growth of 10.8 per cent. I am not making the logically flawed argument that one has caused the other; I am not saying that the imposition of a capital gains tax has led to that change. I am simply saying that the overwhelming weight of evidence disproves the assertion that in some way the introduction of a capital gains tax will reduce investment. It quite clearly has not done so around the world. In Australia we tend to examine these things in isolation, and act as though Australia were breaking new ground, when we all know that a capital gains tax is a feature of all Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. There is no correlation between those who have low or different types of capital gains tax and the level of investment or economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA> If the capital gains tax were replaced with a speculative gains tax we would see a disincentive to productive investment because people would get an extra benefit if they invested in a manner which generated a capital gain after five years rather than made a continuing productive investment which provided only profits which were taxable year by year. We want to encourage that sort of investment, not discourage it. </PARA>
<PARA> On the savings front, the first direct effect of the proposed change would be an immediate reduction of $450m in public sector savings, without the slightest bit of evidence that there would be a more than 100 per cent corresponding increase in private sector savings. The Opposition has made no attempt to prove such assertions. It would do much more to increase our indebtedness than our savings. The evidence indicates that public sector savings would fall by more than private sector savings would increase. It is hard to understand why, if the Opposition's aim is to encourage investment and savings, the proposed tax has been made retrospective. My colleague Senator Walsh made certain challenges about why the proposed tax is to be retrospective. If the assertion is that it will encourage investment or savings, it is impossible to understand how the retrospective element can possibly achieve that. It cannot conceivably have a retrospective effect on investment or savings decisions. The speakers who are to follow me have a responsibility to look at that question and try to answer it. How on earth can the Opposition justify the retrospective aspect, other than to say that it is a backdoor way to try to encourage people to make donations to the Liberal Party?</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I am concerned about the price that Australia would pay if the Opposition's policy were introduced. In electoral terms, I am happy about it because it is working to the advantage of my Party. If the Opposition's tax policy is imposed on Australia, it will pay a substantial price in terms of distortion of investment, which I referred to earlier, and the undermining of the tax principle which Dr Hewson so accurately described when he said that all forms of income should be taxed in the same way. In addition, a large number of people who have gained benefits from the funding that has flowed from capital gains tax would lose that benefit or, as outlined in the Economic Action Plan, a large number of organisations would have their funding cut in order to fund this unfair cut in the capital gains tax. The tax cuts for Mr Elliott alone would make unnecessary the cuts that are proposed in the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service or the abolition of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. It would be fascinating to hear from ordinary Australians whether they would prefer that Mr Elliott received an $18m tax cut or that the Quarantine and Inspection Service be retained. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a debate on an element of the Opposition's Economic Action Plan and, as one would expect, the contributions from the Australian Labor Party senators have focused mainly on what I would call the politics of envy with perhaps a little bit of fact thrown in here and there to try to give it credibility. In answer to some of the comments made by Senator McMullan, who made what I could regard only as inaccurate and crude attacks on the Opposition in terms of its priorities, I respond that the Economic Action Plan comes to grips with a range of Australian problems. One of the problems is that we have people in immediate and severe economic difficulty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As recently as last week, reports indicated that the people who have been put under the greatest difficulty by the Labor Party-by the Labor Government of Mr Hawke and Mr Keating which has the support of Senator McMullan-are those people who have dependent children. It is an extraordinary measure of the social and economic priorities of the Hawke Labor Government that virtually throughout its term the people against whom the tax and welfare systems have moved most heavily are all those families other than very low income families. I acknowledge that the Government has been prepared to make some provision for very low income families, but the most recent analyses of income and the impacts of government policies make it quite clear that the Australians who are trying to bring up children are those who have seen the roughest end of a very rough stick from this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> After seven years of declining real incomes for wage and salary earners and after seven years which have culminated in increased interest rates which have borne most heavily upon that same vulnerable group of families as well as the small business groups that are the possible and major beneficiaries of the capital gains tax provision that is the focus of this debate, after seven years of treating the families of Australia like dirt, a Labor senator has come in here and talked about the social priorities of the Liberal and National parties. I reject with contempt the contribution to the debate made by Senator McMullan because I have never heard him say a word in defence of Australian families. I have never heard him say a thing about the pressure which has been imposed upon the heartland of Australia, those people who choose to marry and bear children and to bring those children up. The redistributive policies of this Government condemn the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), who is in the chamber, and everybody who supports the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> What we set out to do with the Economic Action Plan was summarised by Andrew Peacock in a sentence at the beginning of the document which talks about a fairer and more productive Australia. Yes, we set out to reduce government expenditure by about $2.7 billion-not an easy task, but one which involved our reassessing the priorities of government, and we published a detailed list of cuts totalling $2.7 billion. Why did we do that? We did it because we believe there is immediate hardship in this community and something over $2 billion of that $2.7 billion would go straight to the group that I identified earlier in my comments, namely, families with dependent children. We would have $1,000m in child tax rebates going squarely to the pockets of those people who have responsibilities for children. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. A reduction in their tax would enable them to meet their pressing obligations. We propose an easing of the income test for the dependent spouse rebate at a cost of about $200m and assistance for working mothers with child-care expenses in the form of tax rebates at a total cost of about $820m. Why do we want that novel form of assistance to working mothers? The answer is quite simple: the pressures which are upon families in Australia today require families, whether the mother is a career woman or not, in a great majority of cases to seek additional income. It is an essential part of the cost of earning that income that provision be made for the children, so we are offering some tax justice to a group which has been pressed upon very heavily.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some $450m of the $2.7 billion is directed to the removal of the capital gains tax and its replacement with what we call a speculative gains tax. This is a decision that was taken by us a long time ago. We have had to revise some of our tax decisions taken a long time ago because we accept that we must fund any tax relief that is offered by reducing government expenditure. But we said early in 1988 that we would abolish the capital gains tax. We said that the tax discourages longer term savings and investment which are so desperately needed if Australia is to reduce her dependence on foreign capital. We said that shorter term gains will, however, be taxable on a sliding scale over five years and that after five years there will be no tax on capital gains. I repeat what we said last year-was it May? I forget the precise date--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Stone. We said that these provisions will apply to assets acquired after 19 September 1985 and disposed of after the date of election of a Liberal-National Party government. That is not a new decision but an old decision, repeated on our behalf by John Howard when he published Future Directions in December of last year; it is precisely the same proposal. We put it forward as something which would encourage savings and investment. It is brought forward in this chamber by the Australian Labor Party as something which is there to benefit one main person-John Elliott, the President of the Liberal Party. It is a splendid example of trying to focus the political debate on a personality, to use and ride the politics of envy to the ultimate extent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So who does benefit from the removal of capital gains tax? The potential beneficiaries include some 700,000 small businessmen, including farmers. I will come back to small business, because I think that one of the great conceptual problems of the Labor Party is that it has no understanding of what motivates small business and how it works. There are about 700,000 Australians in that category. About one million Australians own shares, and when our privatisation program is completed a lot more than one million people will own shares because we will be encouraging the people who work in the great public enterprises to become part owners of their enterprise through share ownership. Most importantly for the future, the Government has now imposed capital gains tax on a universal basis-not just on post-September 1985 assets but on all assets held by superannuation funds. Four million Australians are involved there, and with the policies which are being pursued to expand superannuation, referred to by Senator Stone in his contribution to the debate, that number will grow. We have heard from the Treasurer, Mr Keating, estimates of huge sums of money-I think, $60 billion. </PARA>

These are the assets of the wage and salary earners of Australia which this Government is seeking to tax in a whole diversity of ways. This is a country which requires savings and investment. We say that these assets are being overtaxed and that the relief and other things which we are offering, not to Mr John Elliott but to millions of Australians, are right for the future of Australia, a country which badly needs additional savings and investment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Labor Party is really saying, `To hell with the commitments you made last year and repeated in May and December in your Economic Action Plan, because we have found one man who is going to make a big profit out of this, who has made some arrangements which, provided he sells his shares at some time, could give rise to a future capital gains tax liability'. I simply say to the Labor Party that that is an absurd proposition. What needs to be examined is how this will impact upon the people of Australia, very few of whom are as entrepreneurial and as involved in large businesses as Mr Elliott but many of whom are engaged in securing their future through superannuation or establishing a small business. </PARA>
<PARA> I happen to regard my own involvement in the small business of a solicitor's practice, which I ran as the business manager for some years, as probably the most valuable training I had for this Parliament, because I learned some very simple but important truths. One of those truths is that it is not easy to create and provide new jobs. It is not easy to make enough money week by week to employ the people that need to be employed and to make sure that they are paid and provided with their holiday pay, long service leave and all the other benefits which they are entitled to as employees. I discovered a mysterious thing: when one is actually running a small business and trying to expand it, one actually winds up with virtually no money in one's own pocket. That is not understood by people who have never been self-employed. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that as a business is expanded more working capital is required and it is found that one's own funds are required to put into the business so that salaries, rent and that sort of thing can be paid. But it is also found that tax is paid not on the money that goes into one's pocket but on the paper profits of the firm or business. The Commissioner of Taxation requires a technical assessment to be made not of the money that is taken away but of the measured profit, much of which has had to be ploughed back into the business. A man might make $40,000 and find that he has to put $20,000 of that back into his business, leaving him with $20,000; but he will pay tax on $40,000. The Labor Party does not understand-because too few of them have the experience-that the whole process of creating the great bulk of jobs in Australia, which are jobs in small business, involves people working very hard over a long period of their lives often for very little return. In fact, a key part of the incentive and, indeed, a key part of the returns is when one finally sells a business, usually or very often on retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that the Labor Party's capital gains tax takes from small business one of the great potential comforts, the pot of gold at the end of a hard-work rainbow. It does not make sense to people who have been bureaucrats all their lives, working for a salary in the trade union movement or the Labor Party. It often does not make sense to public servants or to people who have been employees all their lives. But the truth is that that is a key part of the economy which provides the growth in jobs. Look at Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, a magnificent Australian company, which in cooperation with this Government has just halved its work force in the steel industry because that is the way that big business and manufacturing have to go to survive. The new jobs are largely created by people who put their own money on the line, sweat it out and get very little in return. </PARA>

<PARA> We got from Senator McMullan-I refer to him more because he was the last speaker, so his speech is fresh in my memory-a reference to Ross Gittins, who was roundly abused by Mr Keating recently as being a twit because he dared to criticise the Government. On this occasion, because Mr Gittins is saying something favourable to the Labor Party, Senator McMullan quotes him with approval and refers to his `upper-class only tax cut'. That is a gibe that could have been directed at Senator McMullan's Government when it reduced the top marginal rate from 60c to 49c in the dollar which, as Senator McMullan says, eases the plight of many average earners whose overtime takes them into that tax bracket. But, as he knows, his Government delivered very large tax cuts to high income earners in Australia, and the truth is that that is one of the things which the Labor Party did to try to increase the economic efficiency and growth of wealth in this country. Therefore, I reject what has been said by Senator McMullan as simply a cheap gibe. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, I have very little time left to give the answer that I would like to give to Senator Haines's contribution. She made a similar point about people with high incomes, so I pass over that. She talked about the people who worked hard and paid their tax and others who did not. In defence of small business, I simply say that that is a part of Australia that works very hard, often for little reward, and I believe that they as a group will greatly welcome the changes that we put forward. If the Australian Democrats take the view that that will not be allowed through let it be upon the Democrats' head.</PARA>
<PARA> I think that this debate involves more rhetoric and politics than substance on the part of the Labor Party. I believe that our policy is an important part of making Australia a more productive society. I thank my colleagues for their contributions to the debate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand Senator Chaney's wish to obscure the issue by referring to families when this debate is about capital gains tax. The capital gains tax has nothing whatever to do with ordinary Australian families. It may have something to do with the sorts of families Senator Chaney mixes with but it has nothing to do with the mass of families that he says are hurting. It certainly has nothing to do with the sorts of families with whom I mix on a regular basis. The brutal unfairness of the Opposition's proposal to abolish the capital gains tax has been well addressed by previous speakers. Nevertheless, I will restate some of those arguments and summarise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Capital gains tax was introduced in 1985 as a vital part of an attempt to make the tax system fairer and more equitable. The tax system prior to this was strangling the productive capacity of the nation. It was unfair, inequitable and widely criticised. It was a system in which smart accountants and lawyers earned fortunes advising business people on how to convert taxable income into tax free capital gains. It was a system characterised by the notorious bottom of the harbour schemes. It was a system that rewarded unproductive effort and undermined the equity of the system. It needs noting, in respect of this question of equity, that the distribution of ownership of capital is heavily concentrated among the wealthy groups in the community. The absence of a capital gains tax severely weakened the progressivity of the tax system as a result. It is interesting that the only other reference in the so-called Economic Action Plan, or what I prefer to call, the Fosters family package, is a reference to a reduction in the top marginal rate of tax from 49c to 39c, thus making the tax system even less progressive and even less fair. So much for the fairness and concern that the Opposition is always talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to introduce the capital gains tax brought us into line with most other civilised Western industrialised economies. We were the only member of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), as I am aware, without a capital gains tax. If the Opposition is able to abolish it, and it will do that with difficulty, as Senator Haines has already indicated, we will again be the only member country of the OECD without a capital gains tax. The capital gains tax then is a useful means of redistributing income in a fair and equitable way. Its necessity is widely recognised, not only out of consideration for the equity of the system but also because of the distortions experienced in an economy which rewards unproductive effort. </PARA>
<PARA> Since its inception in 1985, capital gains tax has yielded $500m directly and billions of dollars indirectly through those funds which, instead of being able to be placed in tax-free capital gains, have to accrue tax in more productive uses. This year it is expected that another $500m will be earned from the tax, and more will be earned in ensuing years as assets acquired after 19 September 1985 are realised. It is nonsense to claim that capital gains tax affects, in the words of Mr Peacock, `countless millions of taxpayers'. In fact, it is paid by a very small minority of taxpayers. Sixty-two per cent has come from taxpayers with taxable incomes in excess of $50,000. Taxpayers above this level comprise 3 per cent of the population. That is hardly millions of taxpayers and it is hardly the mass of families that Senator Chaney referred to. It is worthy of note that while this top 3 per cent of taxpayers pay 62 per cent of capital gains tax, they pay just 17 per cent of total personal income tax. Less than one per cent of individual taxpayers paid capital gains tax in 1987-88. This gives some idea of the equity of the system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is suggesting, by its proposed abolition of the capital gains tax, that one per cent of the population should have its tax liability reduced or abolished, and that the 99 per cent of remaining taxpayers should pick up the burden in making up that shortfall of revenue which is needed to do the many things that governments need to do. The Opposition plans to abolish this eminently fair tax, which on the one hand gets rid of distortions and, as I have said, on the other hand brings greater equity into the system. Further, it affects only the wealthy minority, who are most able to afford it. The Opposition also plans to make the application of the abolition of the capital gains tax retrospective to September 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been interesting to note in past debates on taxation the cries of anguish of certain Opposition members, particularly those from Western Australia, around the question of retrospectivity of taxation. The Opposition seems to be opposed to it where it involves taking money from the wealthy few who were rorting the system; but it is in favour of retrospectivity when it involves giving that money back in windfall gains to the same people. Senator Walsh expressed bewilderment at his incapacity to find a rationale behind this element of the Opposition's plan. I can understand his bewilderment. It cannot be an attempt to buy votes, although certainly the motivation in the rest of the Economic Action Plan is a cynical attempt to do just that. Capital gains tax is not an unpopular tax. It affects only a small minority, who I imagine already vote for the conservatives. There is no widespread opposition to the tax. One is left with the inescapable conclusion that either John Elliott and others who stand to gain have applied pressure, or that it seemed a good way, as Senator McMullan has already indicated, of funding increasingly expensive campaigns. Perhaps Tony Eggleton will be expecting brown paper bags on his desk in anticipation of the pot of gold that the Opposition plans to give John Elliott and the others in the one per cent of the population who are affected.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh issued a challenge to which, I note, no-one has responded. He asked why the Opposition has chosen to apply the abolition of the capital gains tax retrospectively to September 1985. I repeat that challenge in a more direct and specific way: Why is the Opposition giving John Elliott a windfall gain of $18m? I would be very interested in ensuing debates to hear an answer to that question because I have heard no answer so far. The only justification thrown up by the Opposition-in what I believe, despite Senator Stone's plaudits for the quality of the debaters, has been a pretty lack lustre debate-is that it will help small business. Senator Chaney glibly assumes that nobody on this side of the House has any experience in small business. There are a number of people on this side of the House that do, and I happen to be one of them, albeit some time ago. I was involved in small business-successfully. I chose to get out of it; I was not bankrupted. I do understand the difficulty of small business. I have a great deal of respect for the service that small business provides to this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is little evidence in the Opposition's comments on how the abolition of the capital gains tax and the introduction of a speculative gains tax can in any way help small business. Only a small proportion of the proceeds of capital gains tax is paid by small business in the first place. Less than 2.5 per cent of corporate taxpayers paid any capital gains tax in 1987-88. Sixty-eight per cent of capital gains tax came from the 1.4 per cent of companies with the highest taxable incomes. The design of the capital gains tax provides a deliberate concession, to which Senator McMullan has already alluded, for small businesses in the form of a targeted goodwill exemption. In any case, Labor has done more for small business in the last six years than successive conservative governments have done in 30 of the last 40 years. I refer specifically to quite radical changes but changes which are very supportive of small business, such as the company tax imputation system, which has reduced the tax on distributed company income from a maximum of 78 per cent, under the Liberals, to an estimated level of 47 per cent now. I refer also to the cut in the marginal company tax rate, from 49c to 39c in the dollar, and to the cut in personal income tax from 60c to 49c in the dollar and, at the lower end of the scale, from 30c to 21c in the dollar. There has been an increase in the threshold for wholesale tax from $12,000 to $50,000, which is double the rate of increase of the consumer price index. </PARA>
<PARA> Even more important than these specifically targeted concessions for small business is the sustained economic growth which has been experienced over this period. We have sustained economic growth at a rate higher than the average rate for all Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries over that period. There has been a reduction since 1982-83, which small business has gained from, in the real unit cost of labour of 14.2 per cent. There has been a massive increase in the profit share, which I do not hear anybody complaining about. This has resulted in probably the biggest investment boom this country has ever known, certainly in the last 40 years. Kenneth Davidson, in an article in the Age on 2 November 1989 headed `Liberal policy's real winners', talks of retrospectivity in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> Their present policy of retrospective tax cuts, which is in complete violation of the letter and spirit of the tax legislation as it stands, shows that the principle the coalition is defending is the right of the rich to pay taxes only if they so choose. This principle is clearly obnoxious to even the roughest notions of tax equity. </PARA>
<PARA>So what is the justification not only for retrospectivity but also for the abolition of the capital gains tax? What is the justification for its dressed up version-its replacement-the speculative gains tax, which gives massive windfall gains to the Liberal Party's wealthy mates, including the President of the Liberal Party, John Elliott? There seems to be very little justification; it is widely acknowledged. A number of quotations have already been read out to the Senate and I will not repeat them. I simply add the following: The Wednesday, 25 October editorial of the Australian Financial Review stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The coalition has provided no rationale for departing from the principle of a comprehensive income tax base in the case of capital gains-nor has it shown that applying some arbitrary time element will somehow favour `productive' over `speculative' investments. </PARA>
<PARA>The last paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA> By putting it on the agenda, the Opposition has created a political issue by proposing a weak and philosophically unconvincing proposition. Its policy response, instead of showing some fiscal spine, lacks any philosophic coherence and will harm revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>An article by Ross Gittins in the Sydney Morning Herald of 8 November stated:</PARA>
<PARA> If capital gains tax is replaced with a speculative gains tax it should take only a matter of months for the tax lawyers to adapt the old lease premium trick to the new rules. Similar stunts can be performed using licences and covenants. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite apart from the questions of fairness and tax avoidance, there is another justification for a tax on capital gains: it makes the system more neutral in its effect on the decisions made by businesses and investors. </PARA>
<PARA> If some forms of income are taxed, whereas other forms of incomes are tax-exempt, people will be encouraged to invest in those assets which produce tax-exempt income rather than those which produce taxable income. </PARA>
<PARA>That aptly sums up the Liberal Party's very shallow attempt at redistributing income from the poor to the wealthy and specifically to individuals who are closely associated with the Liberal Party. One can only guess at the motivation. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>On page 20 of its annual report for 1988-89 the Australian Film Commission draws attention to the fact that in January 1989 the Commission engaged a management consultant firm, namely Peat Marwick Hungerfords, to assist in a review of the processes and operations of the Australian Film Commission and to carry out consultations with staff, industry and government. It is a matter of some considerable regret, and I think not some little scandal, that the Commission itself has been sitting on this review report and has declined to make it available for the industry and people interested in the film business actually to undertake any study. Apparently the Film Commission has had a look at this matter. An article which appeared in the 11-24 May 1989 edition of the film industry magazine Encore indicated that the Commission had endorsed the basic thrust of the major review which had been undertaken. Nevertheless, we found at a later stage that by the time we had got to August the Film Commission people had decided that there was something in the report they did not like and that they were either going to ignore it or send it back to be rewritten more in accordance with their own prejudices. </PARA>
<PARA> So here we are, approaching now the end of the year, a considerable period of time having lapsed since this review was undertaken. It was commissioned almost 12 months ago. It has been in the hands of the Commission itself for a considerable time. Under the continuing unsatisfactory administration of Mr Adams, the Chairman of the Australian Film Commission, who has just been reappointed to that position for another 12-month period, we have a situation in which the Film Commission itself, having undertaken a review, has not made public its views about the review or communicated to the Government or anybody else what the situation is. </PARA>
<PARA> During this year we have had a saga. Mr Rowland, who was much heralded when he took up the position of Chief Executive of the Australian Film Commission, resigned during the last few months. We have not had a satisfactory explanation as to why he resigned-whether he jumped or whether he was pushed. All we are told that he has left the Commission in order to pursue his career elsewhere. The Australian film industry is in a general state of malaise. When I was discussing the report of the Australian Film Finance Corporation a few days ago. I drew attention to the fact that we had a situation of uncertainty. That uncertainty has been compounded by the continuing incompetence of the Film Commission in the current form in which it operates. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that some people on the board-for instance, the part time Deputy Chairman, Carol Austin-are making a very significant contribution and trying to get some sense and rationality back into the Commission. But as long as Mr Adams persists in sitting on this report or, indeed, not exposing it for public comment, we will be none the wiser despite the fact that public money has been spent on this. It is not good enough for Mr Adams to crawl obsequiously to the Treasurer (Mr Keating), which he does in the Chairman's introductory letter to this report. The Parliament, including the Senate, and the film industry are entitled to see the consultant's report, have it openly and publicly debated and stop the situation where the Film Commission is deliberately not making this report available for public scrutiny, is hiding criticisms of its own incompetent performance in the last 12 months or so and is doing no great service to the film industry in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA>Our film industry, for all its faults, remains a remarkable almost miraculous development in Australia's recent history.

Of course, the Australian Film Commission hopes to develop to a stage where it will need to rely less on appropriations from government revenue and obtain more revenue from its own productions. </PARA>
<PARA> We also see in the report film facts for 1988-89. The Australian Film Commission produced 22 feature films, eight telemovies and 15 mini-series. It is also very interesting to note that it won 18 feature film awards, nine Australian movie awards, seven mini-series awards, 25 documentary awards and 16 Australian short film awards. Also of note is the number of drama programs not only on Australian prime time television but also on North American pay television and United Kingdom television. Our film industry can well provide an increase in exports. As well as being of value to Australia from the cultural and tourism point of view, it can be of export value to Australia. </PARA>

<PARA>This interesting annual report of the Australian Children's Television Foundation opens with an essay by Tony Morphett headed `The Storyteller'. I will read a couple of paragraphs. Mr Morphett says:</PARA>
<PARA> All cultures must retell these universal stories for themselves, they must explain them in their own terms. . . or cease to be cultures. </PARA>
<PARA> If you do not tell your own tribal stories, you become detribalized. The tribe does not own its dreams and dies as a tribe. </PARA>
<PARA> Cultural disaster. National disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> Because cultural integrity equals national integrity equals national survival. </PARA>
<PARA>Elsewhere he says:</PARA>
<PARA> In this part of the 20th century, the great storytelling medium is film, whether shown in cinemas, or on television sets either as broadcast or played from VCRs. </PARA>
<PARA>He concludes his essay be saying:</PARA>
<PARA> This century began with our ceasing to be a colony. It could end with our becoming a colony again, this time a cultural one. </PARA>
<PARA>It is an interesting essay but, of course, it does not tell us what we are supposed to be trying to say by way of what constitutes cultural integrity. It does not address the question of whether we need a regulatory framework in order to support that cultural integrity or whether the process of government regulation-that is, the government of today determining what cultural identity is-in any sense is actually compatible with the very idea of cultural integrity. Mr Morphett is part of the regulatory approach as far as children's television is concerned. Let me tell you, Mr Acting Deputy President, what somebody who is actually in the business of producing children's television had to say. This person was reported in the Australian of 29 November 1989 as saying that the new standards being promulgated by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal were ridiculous and stupid, particularly when the resources of the networks were already strapped for cash. He said that children's drama aimed at the 6- to 13-year-old age group was a dismal failure and that nobody remembers the names of the things that were done. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Our children don't need it and they don't watch it, for the simple reason that they are too sophisticated for that namby pamby nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA>The speaker was Simon Townsend, who probably has a record as commercially the most successful producer of children's television in Australia. He has come to the point of simply saying that there really comes a time when two things should be allowed to occur; first, what children watch on television should be primarily a choice made by the children, not by some superannuated adult who thinks that he or she knows considerably better what is good for children in terms of cultural television product. Children do not watch it simply because they are bored rigid by most of the stuff fed to them by the regulators of children's television. Secondly, he says that there ought to be a clearer view on the part of the regulators about what it is that constitutes the sort of cultural identity that they say they wish to protect. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition parties have taken the view that the Children's Television Foundation is a body that ought to have a continuing and ongoing life; that, indeed, there ought to be proper standards and there ought to be the provision of some quota protection for children's television. But it seems that the Children's Television Foundation has long ceased asking questions such as: what is to be produced; what points are to be awarded; how much of it there is to be; and how much of it is to be `genuinely Australian'? It is a matter of very great regret that while we have the rhetoric about cultural identity, we have none of the intellectual substance about what that means. This ought to have been forthcoming in the annual report of an important and significant part of the cultural and television industry in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The 1988-89 annual report of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy is important for all Australians. Primary industry is the important industry in Australia. It gives us all a wonderful standard of living because of the income it produces. It also encompasses the minerals and energy area, which produces a great deal of income for our country. Any government should give consideration, support and incentive to both of those areas. We need in those portfolios a Minister who takes a good arguing position on their behalf. It interests me that Minister Kerin has recently come out in favour of development in different areas, but I am very sad that he has been overseas or not able to argue strongly enough in Cabinet for developments such as Coronation Hill to go ahead that would have given Australia an extra source of income and given us all the good standard of living that would ensue. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the big problems that are killing primary industry is interest rates. It is alluded to in the report that interest rates are one of the factors causing most concern to every primary producer. We talk of the consumer price index increase of 7.7 per cent, and the input costs in primary industry at the moment are well in excess of 10 per cent-in fact, as high as 15 per cent in some areas. Therefore, I ask both the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) to do something to help those industries, to make sure that they are on a level playing field and that they can compete with countries in the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Primary industries in Australia are having horrific problems competing with the highly subsidised primary industries of the United States and the European Economic Community, which are having their own fights. The Australian farmers are gathered up on the sideline with their industry jeopardised because our Government is not looking after our industries. I do not mean that it should give hand-outs or subsidies or things like that, but it should make sure that we can compete on a level playing field. When one looks at the cost of borrowed money one can see that it is very difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other concerns such a fire blight. With the importation of pears into Australia from New Zealand, there is the possibility of fire blight getting into our country. I know that that is an area that Minister Cook has looked at, but I remind him again that it is an area where Australia will be jeopardised if we allow those imports to come in without the certainty that there is no chance of fire blight coming in also. Canadian pork is another area of concern. With transmissible gastroenteritis and with carbodex additives being in the feed in Canada, that meat coming into Australia could cause us many problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend Senator Cook for his interest in soil conservation and land degradation. Action in that area has been very good. I say to both him and Minister Kerin that if we are to have sustainable agriculture in Australia it will depend upon the efforts of government. I would imagine that this can be achieved only if we change government and have a Liberal-National Party government. Then we will definitely be able to get the primary industry and resources sector back to where it belongs, producing export income for Australia and giving every Australian a good standard of living. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Higher Education Council is important because it is a report on higher education planning for 1992. I, together with Senator Colston, represent the Senate on the Council of the Australian National University (ANU). I have not been asked by the university to say anything, but it is important that we report to the Senate on some highly unsatisfactory features of the Government's arrangements for this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is now 11 December and as of last week the university Council on which we serve had not received any formal communication from the Government as to the amount of money with which it is to develop its budget for 1990. The budget is to operate from 1= January 1990 and it is quite outrageous to ask a university to draw up a budget without any reliable idea of its revenue. It is not enough for someone to have told the university by telephone what the revenue figure might be. It is not enough that, because we have a very talented treasurer and very talented officials at the ANU, they were able to work out and estimate almost exactly what the revenue might be. We want to know what that figure is. We believe the Government has the capacity to alter that revenue figure at any stage up to the time that it is officially notified to us. </PARA>
<PARA> At the ANU we are faced with the situation whereby the Government has been seeking what it calls productivity dividends. In any event, the Government has been reducing the amount of money available to institutions such as the ANU. The Government, with its restructuring of tertiary education, has ended the binary system so that there is a redistribution of moneys going on within tertiary education away from universities towards colleges. I am not criticising that, but it adds to the uncertainty. The Government has decreed that there will be a clawback each year from university funds to go to the Australian Research Council for redistribution and competition. I am not objecting to that, but it adds to the uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise that universities are entitled to information about their funds for 1990 in adequate time to allow them to plan. That has not happened with the Australian National University. It is all very well having a report on higher education planning for 1990-92 in a paper, but if one looks at that report one can see that it discusses some of the elements of planning for 1990. It is quite disgraceful that here we are on 11 December looking at budgets which have to start operation on 1 January and having institutions which still do not know how much money will be available to them.

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate my second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> On 15 March 1962, President John F. Kennedy of the United States inaugurated World Consumer Rights Day. In doing so, he spelt out seven rights to which consumers should be entitled:</PARA>
<PARA>The right to safety</PARA>
<PARA>The right to be informed</PARA>
<PARA>The right to choose</PARA>
<PARA>The right to be heard</PARA>
<PARA>The right to redress</PARA>
<PARA>The right to consumer education</PARA>
<PARA>The right to a healthy environment. </PARA>
<PARA>The grouped proceedings Bill which I am bringing forward today will enhance enormously Australian consumers' right to redress. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of whether there is a need to introduce a new form of representative or class procedure to deal with multiple wrongs has been examined many times over the years-most recently by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its 1988 report `Grouped proceedings in the Federal Court'. </PARA>
<PARA> As that report notes, in an age of mass production and distribution of goods and services, the potential for loss or damage to be caused on a mass scale is high. While the overall damage may be great, the amount of damage incurred by an individual may be relatively small in proportion to the cost of legal services and court proceedings. Quite clearly, if cost factors preclude individual enforcement of rights, justice is being denied to any individual so affected. </PARA>
<PARA> Cost and other barriers inhibiting people's access to the courts must be lowered so that people can receive the compensation to which the law says they are entitled. The costs of litigation in this country are prohibitive except for the very rich and those who qualify for legal aid. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee is currently conducting an inquiry into the cost of legal services and litigation in Australia-an inquiry first raised in this place by the Australian Democrats. The Democrats were motivated to propose both that inquiry and this Bill because, for a lot of ordinary Australians the option of legal redress is not available in practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The legal system itself is quite antiquated in many respects, despite the efforts of some tireless individuals. Some useful reforms have been made. The creation of administrative forums, such as small claims courts and residential tenancies tribunals to deal more informally, expeditiously and inexpensively with disputes has proven very worthwhile. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the procedures used in our legal system have advanced very little since the passage of the United Kingdom Judicature Act in 1873. An English court of appeal ruling in 1910 effectively closed off the common law opportunity to sue for damages in a representative capacity. Although representative procedures apply in most Australian jurisdictions, they cannot be used in actions claiming damages with the exception of South Australia, and, in certain circumstances, Victoria. Apart from some State and Commonwealth Acts which allow representative procedures, the procedure itself has not been developed to nearly the same extent as it has in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> In the United States, of course, a quite robust system of class actions has emerged. Quite deservedly in many respects, the class actions system there has earned a bad name. In the USA, class actions appear to typify many of the worst characteristics of an over-litigious society. The phenomenon conjures up images of ``ambulance-chasing'' lawyers signing up people injured by poor quality products and issuing units for vast sums of money which would bankrupt companies and benefit only the lawyers. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Australian Law Reform Commission proposals, and this Bill which is based on those proposals, avoid these problems. The proposed grouping procedure differs in a number of significant ways from US-style class actions and does not contain the scope for abuse or potential for high costs which exist there. </PARA>
<PARA> To return to the need for grouped proceedings, I want to canvass briefly the deficiencies in the present system. What is missing, is a procedure enabling private action to be taken in case of alleged multiple wrongdoing to secure a binding decision in respect of all those affected. </PARA>
<PARA> As I noted earlier, the amount involved in individual claims may not warrant the cost of legal proceedings, and in any event, where claims arise from multiple wrongdoing, individual litigation is not an efficient use of resources. Alternative, less expensive means of resolving small claims are not available in all cases and, again, alternative means require individual action which is an inappropriate way to deal efficiently with multiple wrongdoing. </PARA>
<PARA> The advantages of grouping claims for damages from multiple wrongdoing are clear. Common issues can be dealt with at the same time, the cost of litigation to the individual is reduced and a multiplicity of proceedings is avoided. The object of the new procedures is to reduce costs where it is necessary and to promote efficiency in the administration of justice, not to encourage abuse or the pursuit of trivial claims. </PARA>
<PARA> The ALRC cites many obvious examples of problems that could have been dealt with by the courts more satisfactorily in grouped proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> Among the problems mentioned are: complaints about misleading advertising by a credit union, which led borrowers to believe they would be insured if they were unable to meet their payments due to illness; asbestos cases, where more than 300 workers have claimed damages arising from their contracting mesothelioma; bushfire cases, in which people have made claims against electricity authorities over fires which allegedly began due to faulty power lines. </PARA>
<PARA> Other consumer complaints which could have been dealt with by grouped proceedings include: the case of a camera manufacturer which stopped producing film needed to allow the cameras it had sold to function; a situation where toxic chemicals damaged oyster beds; and where building work had damaged adjacent premises. </PARA>
<PARA> The procedures provided for in this Bill, which reflect the ALRC recommendations, amount to a detailed cost-effective scheme for the grouping of claims in the Federal Court, balance the interests of all parties and achieve the goals of access and court efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this Bill, the use of the procedure is confined in the first instance to the Federal Court. This has been done because the Federal Court has developed particular techniques which will be useful in implementing grouped proceedings. After some experience and assessment, the procedure could be given wider application. </PARA>
<PARA> There are several important features of the Bill to which I want to draw attention. First, it should be noted that the procedure is a group of proceedings being conducted together, not a representative procedure. To use the Commission's terminology, the proceedings relating to each member of the group are `bundled together' and conducted by one of the group-the principal applicant. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the consent of group members is not necessary for the commencement of the proceeding, but a group member can choose to opt out and pursue an individual action. This approach ensures that those who did not know they were entitled to a legal remedy are not excluded from that legal remedy and also retains freedom of choice. </PARA>
<PARA> Certain criteria exist for the commencement of group proceedings, including a minimum of seven group members (plus the principal applicant) and at least one question of law or fact that is common to the proceedings of each member of the group. Even if the circumstances giving rise to relief are the same, the relief claimed may differ. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the arguments frequently raised against this sort of proposal is the potential for abuse. This scheme has a number of provisions which ensure that the procedure will be cost-effective and that there will be little, if any, scope for trivial claims or blackmail suits. In cost-effectiveness terms, proceedings can be separated by the court if it is unable to deal with grouped claims economically compared with individual proceedings. Further, there is little scope for principal applicants to commence proceedings which have no merit in the hope of forcing a settlement. The court can dismiss the proceedings if they are frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process. Secondly, the general rule that the loser pays the winner's costs, which the Commission recommends not be changed, means that the principal applicant will be liable for costs if the case fails. This provides a strong disincentive to the commencement of blackmail suits. </PARA>
<PARA> Any fair-minded assessment of this proposal would conclude that it is worthwhile, free of problems which beset the US system and long overdue. The reference on this issue was given to the ALRC in 1977. The Commission's examination of the issues has been exhaustive, culminating in its 1988 report. That report makes clear the desirability and urgency of reform in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> By introducing this Bill, I am giving both members of parliament and the general community the opportunity to scrutinise and comment on the grouped proceedings proposal. Consumers have waited a very long time for reform in this area and they deserve the best legislation we can devise. I urge honourable senators and members of the public to give the Bill proper attention before it is debated. Support for the objectives of this Bill is a real opportunity for the Parliament to show that it cares about justice in Australia, the cost of that justice and the effectiveness of the avenue that leads to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise with some concern today because consideration of the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1989 was delayed from last week. On Thursday night the Minister dealing with it, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), clearly had no knowledge of the Bill and was unable to answer questions from senators on this side of the chamber with regard to the reasons for the Government rejecting, in the House of Representatives, the amendment that was moved by the coalition and supported by the Australian Democrats with regard to twice monthly payments required of organisations such as public hospitals, tertiary institutions and certain benevolent institutions. When we asked the Minister on duty that night what was the reason for rejecting this amendment he read from a prepared speech which stated, among other things, as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendment previously moved by the Opposition would effectively condone the backdoor financing of public institutions with Commonwealth funds through the use of extended retention of tax instalment deductions made from the salary and wages of their employees. </PARA>
<PARA>A large number of our tax laws effectively condone the backdoor financing of one group or another, and the capacity that so many businesses have to negatively gear is a classic example of the Australian taxation system condoning and, in fact, encouraging, various activities which, in some cases, means a serious loss of revenue for no appreciable productive gain. That is particularly true in the case of negative gearing which applies to money that is borrowed offshore for use by so-called investors onshore. The Minister went on to say, after questioning by another senator, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>I have nothing more to add to what I said. </PARA>
<PARA>Then, typical of the Minister concerned, he went on to say a few more things, including the following:</PARA>
<PARA> The strategy is aimed at eventually reducing the administrative deduction system by moving small employers to a system that would require less frequent remittances than at present. I have nothing more to add. </PARA>
<PARA>He was again pressed for just a tad more information on this new, and wondrous scheme that most of us were, until then, unaware of. He claimed as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is partly foreshadowed in the second reading speech or elsewhere publicly that smaller employers may be moved to quarterly remittance instead of monthly remittance. </PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA> That is about 200,000 employers, or half the number of remitters. That is the order of magnitude we are talking about. The change in question is part of the redevelopment of computer systems and it may occur within the next couple of years. That is as precise as we can be. </PARA>
<PARA> Not surprisingly at that point, while Senator Watson said that he thought the coalition would need time to consider the proposition but thought it was not unattractive, I was a little less enthusiastic on the grounds that it was not a terribly meaningful statement. Senator Evans had departed from the script. I guess, at that point, there was not much else he could do because the major adviser-who, I see, is present today-was not present and the heavy word was not being applied to Senator Evans's left ear. He waffled on about this new and wondrous procedure for 200,000 small businesses possibly occurring in the next couple of years. Senator Walsh has just come into the chamber, so we will finally get advice from a Minister who knows something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think it is a particularly attractive proposal when we are given something as vague as this. Neither do I continually like to see in this place a perpetration of the practice of making one worthy group benefit at the expense of another. We are told that public hospitals, tertiary institutions and benevolent organisations of one sort or another-groups that are either deficit financed or need to raise money in order to keep going-are going to have their tax payments brought forward from monthly to fortnightly in order that some time down the track-in a couple of years, according to Minister Evans-the Government may change the timing of the payment of tax by several hundred thousand small businesses from monthly to quarterly. I just do not find that satisfactory. We are being asked to buy a pig in a poke. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the chamber are being asked to abandon an amendment which had considerable merit at the time it was moved-or we would not have supported it-on the ground that at some time, somewhere down the track, some other people might benefit from the fact that another group of people are having their tax payments brought forward. In other words, groups such as public hospitals and tertiary institutions will be penalised so that 200,000 other businesses might at some time get a benefit. It rather makes a mockery of what Senator Evans said in the first place, namely that the Government does not like effectively condoning the backdoor financing of public institutions. The Government is, apparently, quite happy to condone the backdoor financing of private institutions. I want to know just exactly where we are at with all of this now that Minister Walsh is in the chamber. I understand that he was not here last Thursday night because he was ill. I have some sympathy for him in that regard. Nevertheless, the Committee reported progress so that we could have a better, perhaps even more coherent, explanation than Senator Gareth Evans offered. I am not minded on the ground of the comments from Senator Evans to abandon our support for Senator Watson's amendment. </PARA>

On that occasion we had a totally inadequate performance from first one and then another Minister. I am not quite sure which one of them was the more incompetent. Senator Walsh is now in the chamber, I am glad to see. Rather than take further time, I will let him respond to what has been said. Like Senator Haines, I think that our position at the moment is that we have yet to receive from the Government anything by way of convincing argumentation that would persuade us to abandon our amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that the amendment was last before the Senate on 27 November, although it may have been raised last Thursday night as well. The reasons for the Government's attitude were given then, but I will restate them because it will not take long. The pay as you earn (PAYE) tax deductions at no stage belong to the employer. Leaving aside employers who use the tax stamps system, the employer deducts the taxation contribution from employees' wages. At some later time the employer remits the deductions to the Australian Taxation Office. The appropriate length of time within which that remittance should occur should consider administrative convenience on both sides. In principle, at no stage does that money belong to the employer. For whatever the length of time between the deduction from the employee's wage or salary and the remittance of the funds to the Tax Office, the employer is using employees' money for working capital. The Government has made a decision to change that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true that employers using tax stamps are, in fact, paying the employee's liability in advance to some extent because the employer buys the tax stamps before the deduction from the employee's wage is made. But that is now what is being discussed here. There is, in principle, no reason why any employer should be allowed to retain those employees' funds for any period at all. Of course, administrative convenience and cost come into this. I am not sure who was the Minister representing the Government in the chamber on 27 November but that person gave some indication-I think there have been indications given in published material before this-that, for administrative convenience reasons, not in principle reasons, the Government was considering reducing the number of occasions on which small employers are required to remit the money. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not sure whether these figures were given. About 200,000 employers are estimated to remit less than $10,000 in PAYE deductions per annum. The Government is considering a proposal that those remittances should be required only on a quarterly basis. These things are under consideration but no decisions have yet been made. As to the question of employers using the tax stamps system, which also involves about 200,000 employers, the Tax Office is trying to devise ways-I do not know what those ways would be; I find it difficult to see what could be done-to substantially get rid of the tax stamps system and to replace it with something else. Only those employers using the tax stamps system have any legitimate complaint whatsoever. We propose to address that. It is being done in consultation with the Tax Office and with an advisory panel comprising representatives of the small business associations around the country, the Metal Trades Industry Association and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I let the Minister have his say; he should now let me have a go. His argument was that the employers have no right to that money; that they are holding it for longer than they need to; they are therefore using it and, perhaps, getting some unfair benefit from it. I would like to point out that in many cases the Government does not own this money either. That is why so many people fill out tax returns at the end of the year and actually get some of this money back. In the meantime the Government has had up to a year to play around with this money. It is then using the money to its advantage before it returns it to its rightful owner: the original taxpayer from whom too much was taken for a variety of reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To make matters worse, having just told honourable senators that he does not think that public hospitals, tertiary institutions and charitable organisations should be able to use this money-although it apparently is okay for the Government to do so-the Minister then said that at some time down the track the Government will allow some private sector employers to have the use of this money not only for a month but for a quarter. So it is apparently all right for some employers to `own' the money for long enough to make some use of it but it is not all right for the people that are picked up under this amendment to do so, that is, public hospitals, tertiary institutions and benevolent organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister cannot have it both ways. He cannot say, on the one hand, that one group of people does not owe the money, and therefore it is not going to be able to have it for four weeks, it is only allowed to have it for two weeks; and then, on the other hand, cheerfully admit that at some time when the Government has finally made a decision about it-and it is not quite sure when that will be-it will allow some other employers to have access to this money, not for a month but for a full quarter. As far as I am concerned, we will not be put into the position of deciding to abandon the amendment that would provide some additional benefit to hospitals, universities and so on, on the ground that at some time the Government might make a decision about benefiting somebody else. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason that I gave some account of that was that Senator Watson had shown some interest in it when it was debated, I think at the end of November. As I think the Senate knows, I do not believe in pursuing trivia in perpetuity. But in principle, Senator Haines, the Government's argument, which I firmly endorse because it is the only sensible argument, is that no employer has any in-principle or moral entitlement to keep that money for any time at all. But for very small employers, who have a very limited liability, as a matter of administrative convenience and common sense both for the Australian Taxation Office and the people concerned, there is a case to be put for remitting the money at less frequent intervals. But in principle, the same applies to them. In principle, they have no moral claim on the funds; but it is a question of administrative convenience and efficiency.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we were considering the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2) last week, Senator Reynolds responded on behalf of the Government. She mentioned a number of reasons why the Government did not find the amendment that I had moved acceptable. Honourable senators will remember that the amendment states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Page 4, after paragraph 3 (d), add the following new paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(e) by inserting after item 123a the following item:</PARA>
<PARA> `123aa. (1) Goods, not covered by any other item in this Schedule, for use as special aids, and not for sale for that purpose, by persons with physical or intellectual disabilities, in respect of whom a medical practitioner or a qualified or registered occupational therapist has certified that the use of the goods as special aids is necessary . . . </PARA>
<PARA>On that occasion Senator Reynolds quoted from a document which was at least two years old-it was not used last year-stating the reason that this amendment was not accepted. I had hoped that the Government would have kept up with the reasons it would not accept it. Perhaps the Government could produce new reasons each year. The Minister said that there would be problems with the administration of this proposal and that it left the way open to abuse. I have already indicated-obviously it has not got through, but I will try again-that that is not the case. For the purposes of proving that it is not the case, I will quote from those parts of the Act that are drafted and are currently in the Act in identical terms to the amendment which I have moved. Item 123a, which is in the first schedule, provides for exemption for interactive and broadcast videotex systems, broadcast teletext decoding devices, and similar decoding devices of a kind used in or in connection with television receivers where the system or device is for use and not for sale by profoundly deaf persons or persons taken to be profoundly deaf. Exemption for this equipment is on a restricted basis and available only to persons to whom a certificate as to the extent of their hearing disability has been furnished. Clearly, the mechanisms are already in place within the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at another item, item 135a of the schedule, which requires evidence of a disability before sales tax exemptions are offered to persons seeking them. Under this item motor vehicles, and parts thereof, for use in the transportation to and from the gainful employment of a person in respect of whom the Director-General of Social Services, or an officer appointed by him for that purpose, has certified that he has lost the use of one or both legs to such an extent that he might be permanently unable to use public transport are also exempt. In other words, we go through the mechanism to deal with these issues. There is not an administrative difficulty. If there were an administrative difficulty, I presume that some time in the last number of years that I have moved this particular amendment the Government would have moved to take those items out of the schedule. It has not done so in the past, and it has not done so today. The Government is not doing that for very good and proper reasons; that is, that it is administratively simple and necessary. It is administratively simple because the mechanism is already in place, and it is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned in my previous speech, item 42 (17) refers to wigs and hairpieces for people who are clinically bald, provided there is certification that the person has lost his or her hair due to sickness or disease. I do not want to go through all of these items. I have done so in the past and I have no intention of doing so again and detaining the Committee. It is utter bunkum to suggest that it is administratively difficult. We have had that argument out in the past. Let us drop it and come up with the real reasons that the Government does not accept this amendment. It cannot refuse to accept the amendment on that rather outmoded, antiquated and certainly discredited excuse. If the Government wishes to press ahead with that particular excuse, I will ask it to explain why it has not removed the other items. We can go through them one by one if the Minister wishes. I would like to hear the real reason that the Government proposes not to accept this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quite aware of that, Mr Chairman. I am also aware of the fact that I have on my desk two Government amendments, which have just been circulated in this place, one of which Senator Walsh quite rightly points out is to clause 3 and relates to recycled paper. You, Mr Chairman, equally rightly, have pointed out that we are not even discussing it yet. However, the other amendment is to the clause we are discussing and it is, in fact, to the same item; that is, whether or not the Government will remove a quite iniquitous 20 per cent sales tax on certain goods used by children with disabilities in the interests of their education. The particular item that Senator Macklin was referring to was computers that have been adapted in some way, specifically for the use of a child with a disability. We have been having this fight in this place for I think the last four years. Each time the Government says `No, it is not the appropriate way of helping people with disabilities-despite the fact that we take the sales tax off all sorts of other goods used by people with disabilities', it turns around and says, `this is a bit of ad hockery', or `It could be used by somebody else in the family'. My major response to that comment is, `So what, if it is going to help somebody'. If the Government forgoes a sales tax of 20 per cent, which would amount all up to about $100,000 a year-and that is a lot less than it gives to many less worthy groups-so be it. The Senate was told last week that this time the Government will not agree to the amendment because it is currently before the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC)-soon to become the Industry Commission (IC).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When Senator Macklin and I took this particular cudgel to the ears of the Opposition last year, the solution produced was that it would refer the matter to a committee because it was too hard to deal with the third time round. The irony of all that was that it sent this particular sales tax removal amendment to a committee just after it supported the Government removing the sales tax on private planes. In any event I have been informed that the matter is now before the IAC. Its inquiry will incorporate submissions from the public. Those submissions are due by 15 December. I find this extraordinary. That amendment last year was knocked back by the Senate on, I think, 2 November. At that stage the coalition recommended that it go to a committee. We now find over a year later that it will be calling for public submissions by 15 November. I would like to know whether the IAC, or any other organisation, conducted an inquiry of similar length also calling for public submissions when the Government decided to take the sales tax off private planes. I bet it did not. Apparently, hearings further to the one on 15 December will be held. They will be followed by the release of a draft report in about March next year, following which I think there are likely to be more public hearings so that people can talk about the draft report that has come out of what people have been talking about on the inquiry reference-and we in this place have been talking about it for about the last four years. A final report is expected to be forwarded to the Government in July 1990. That is almost two years after this place made a simple request that the 20 per cent sales tax be removed from certain equipment used to help children with disabilities achieve the maximum from their education, hence offering them the maximum choices in life. </PARA>
<PARA> It also worries me just a bit that the Government will take its decision following the report from the IAC, since governments past and present have been notorious in ignoring IAC recommendations. I doubt very much whether it will be any more accommodating with regard to the IAC recommendations this time if it does not like them. Why it should be so churlish about a simple amendment to protect the educational and work prospects of a few children with disabilities in this country I cannot understand. The point I am making is that that is the history of what we are currently debating-whether or not the Opposition will support our amendment or whether or not the Government will take our amendment on board. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of all this honourable senators can imagine how surprised-not to say delighted-I was to have put in front of me two amendments, one of which is a Government amendment with regard to recycled paper, to which not only we but also I understand Senator Vallentine have an amendment, and the other, much more importantly, is a long and detailed three-page amendment that includes a provision--</PARA>

There are now five different amendments, some to the same clause. I put to the Committee that after the dinner break when we have disposed of the amendment moved by Senator Macklin we take it clause by clause in the order in which the amendments are relevant.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the dinner break I was going through the history of this amendment and I will reiterate what I was saying. This is at least the fourth time that Senator Macklin has moved this amendment on behalf of the Australian Democrats. It is an amendment that would remove the 20 per cent sales tax on computer items that have been purchased for use by somebody with a disability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter was originally drawn to our attention several years ago when a family in Queensland were looking for a way of making access to education easier for their disabled son. He had been born with truncated arms-his hands were joined virtually at the shoulder-as a consequence of his mother taking thalidomide during her pregnancy. The family had decided that if a computer could be adapted so that he could reach the keyboard-that of course, required fairly significant modification of the unit-he would be better able to do his schoolwork and, as a consequence, better able to deal with his work opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> We had no luck on the first two occasions when we moved this amendment-both the Government and the coalition opposed it. Last year on 2 November when we moved the amendment we had a slight improvement on that. The Opposition, for whatever reason, decided that it would oppose the amendment but would refer the matter to a committee. As I said, I have no idea why it changed its mind even to that extent last year. It may well have been the fact we moved the amendment last year immediately after the Opposition had supported a Government amendment to take the sales tax off private planes. We made the rather obvious point that if the Government and the Opposition were prepared to take the sales tax off private planes they could at least consider taking it off electronic equipment used by children with disabilities. So off the amendment went to a committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter finished up as it turns out in the hands of the IAC, which is about to become the IC, and has taken something like 13 months to get there. I understand that the IAC, as it still is, will be seeking submissions from the public on this matter, due on 15 December. Public hearings will be conducted around that time in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra and, following those hearings, a draft report on the matter will be issued in March 1990. A final report is expected to be forwarded to the Government in July 1990. That is almost two years after the issue was sent off for committee inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> What rather astonished me was that some 20 minutes before we were due to adjourn for dinner a number of amendments were circulated. This is not an abnormal sort of practice-we have amendments circulated in this place all the time, either for the Bill that we happen to be dealing with or a subsequent Bill-nor is it unusual for us to discuss amendments that are foreshadowed. We do not have to wait until an amendment is formally moved; if we know that somebody has foreshadowed an amendment. It is perfectly acceptable for us to have a discussion on it. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the amendments that the Government circulated had to do with another clause of the Bill-that dealing with the sales tax on recycled paper. As I said before dinner, we have an amendment on it. I think Senator Vallentine also has an amendment on it and the Government has finally decided to do something about that as well. But that had nothing to do with me. That issue will be taken up by my colleague, Senator Coulter. I was concerned with the amendment that Senator Macklin moved on the 20 per cent tax applying to computers. </PARA>
<PARA> I was therefore amazed but delighted when I looked through the three-page amendment that came with the one-page amendment on recycled paper to discover under the heading `Amendments to be moved on behalf of the Government' something to take the sales tax off certain items used by persons with disabilities for the purposes of gaining or producing income or in connection with a course of education undertaken by the person at a school, college, university or other place and required wholly or principally because of the disablement. </PARA>
<PARA> Delighted as I was to see this, I was a little puzzled since I had not been given any indication that the Government was going to go down this route. Subsequent inquiries revealed what not even I, with my tendency to look for cosmic conspiracies, would have dreamed up. It is this: the Government thought there was a chance that the Opposition would support the Democrats' amendment and just in case it did, it thought it better have up its sleeve an amendment of its own so that it could say, `Gee whiz, we really do think there are some flaws in your amendment; why don't you try ours instead?'. However, had the Opposition done what it has done so often in the past and not supported the amendment, no more would have been seen of this piece of paper. It would not have been circulated; it would not have been given to all senators and we would have heard nothing more about it. </PARA>

<PARA> I now turn to the Opposition for assistance since I understand that even the passage of this amendment is contingent upon the Opposition's supporting the original amendment, in which case the Government will use whatever blandishments, bribes or bullying available to it to make us accept its amendment instead of the one from this side of the chamber. </PARA>

The reason, quite clearly, is that, notwithstanding the fact that in the past the Government has been prepared to take the sales tax off the private planes, it has not been prepared to take it off this sort of equipment. I, frankly, do not find the amendment as satisfactory as ours. I do not think it goes as far as ours. It is wider to the extent that it picks up air conditioners, which ours did not, but Senator Macklin tonight and on other occasions raised the question of that being something that we were looking to down the track. We believe in beating one drum at a time, and this is the particular one that we have been beating for quite a while.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to prolong the debate indefinitely, but the Government will not accept this amendment, for a number of reasons. It was suggested-I think it might even have been carried-a year ago that this matter be referred to a Senate committee and nothing has happened about that. There has since been a reference to the Industries Assistance Commission which encompasses this matter. I do not intend to say any more about it. The amendment of the Australian Democrats is open-ended. The amendment is not confined to goods that are needed for any particular purpose and could apply to all goods used by a disabled person that a medical practitioner believes, or can be persuaded to believe, is for a disabled person's needs. The amendment is not confined to goods for use by a disabled person who earns income or pursues education and, for example, would not be available for goods used for leisure. The term `special aids' contained in the amendment is very vague and has no special meaning under the sales tax law.</PARA></TALK.START>

All I am aware of is that the two amendments were circulated. I was told subsequently that the amendment to the sales tax Bill in this area was inadvertently circulated. I thought I had made it clear that I was aware that it was inadvertently circulated. I thought I had also made it clear that I knew why it was circulated, if only inadvertently, and that was in case the Opposition suddenly saw fit to support our original amendment. Because it did not and because this amendment was supposed to be produced only as a flourish in that eventuality and not otherwise, I will now move the amendment that was circulated and attributed to the Government. Whether it should have been attributed to the Government or not I have no idea; nevertheless, it was circulated before dinner. Mr Chairman, you should be satisfied that you have in front of you, and that other members of the Committee have in front of them, the correct form of words for this three-page amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The substantive amendment does not go as far as we would have liked but it is at least an acknowledgment by somebody that there is a disincentive at the moment for families with children with disabilities to go to considerable expense to try to even out, if you like, the playing field. That is a term we have heard a lot about today. In other sections of this legislation there has been talk about evening playing fields for a variety of businesses, employers and so on. If it is good enough to do that then I think it is good enough to even out the playing field for children who are born with a disability and need some form of assistance in order to mount the hurdles that would otherwise impede their progress through a normal life, perhaps stopping them from having full access to a wide range of employment opportunities and so on. At least this amendment, which was circulated before dinner and has now been moved by the Australian Democrats, goes some way to correcting that imbalance, to providing parents with some sort of incentive so that if the equipment is used in connection with a course of education or a special education program for people with disabilities being undertaken by the person, either by attendance or by correspondence, at a school, college, university or other place of education and the goods are required wholly or principally because of the sickness, disease or disablement of the person and the goods are not for sale, they will at least be able to qualify for a sales tax exemption. It will make the item cheaper and access to the goods easier and hence go some way to helping those people get the education they need in order to get the employment they want. </PARA>

Concerning clause 3 I will put, firstly, Government amendments Nos. 1 and 2-which are consequential-and the Government's substitute for the Australian Democrats' amendment No. 1 and Senator Vallentine's amendment No. 1. If they fail, I will give the opportunity to move the Democrats' amendment No. 1 or Senator Vallentine's amendment No. 1, then the Democrats' amendment No. 2 and Senator Vallentine's amendment No. 2.

I would like to know exactly what the security is for pieces of paper that we all leave on our desks. Looking around, the chamber looks like a paper chase gone wrong, as it frequently does. If we cannot leave our pinks and parts of speeches here and cannot be sure our desks will be in the same shambles as we left them when we went out, then I am very concerned about what is going on. Who authorises people to remove pieces of paper that are put on our desks?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know we are getting into Alice in Wonderland stuff here because we have been told that the circulation was not authorised; that although this document states it contains an amendment to be moved by the Government, it was not really being moved by the Government, and therefore, it is a piece of paper which should never have been circulated in the first place. Since something was circulated that was not authorised to be circulated, I want to know who authorised it, or did not authorise it, to be uncirculated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Haines, the situation is that the mover of an amendment-in this case it was Senator Walsh-is entitled to have amendments circulated. If amendments he has not authorised to be circulated are circulated-apparently in his name-they may be withdrawn. It is a matter of discretion on the part of the attendants, having put papers on honourable senators' desks, to remove them from the desks. Obviously, it would be unacceptable for the attendants to search through a senator's papers to see whether documents had been filed away, but if they are obviously lying on the desks it is commonsense for the attendants to be permitted to remove them as they had not been circulated by authority. In this particular case, when you gave me notice that you intended to move Senator Walsh's amendment, it was important that what you proposed to move should be in the hands of senators, and I gave directions that the documents that had been collected should be recirculated. The amendment is in the hands of the mover and he is entitled to withdraw it if he does not want to pursue it. I want to make it quite clear that that does not authorise any form of searching of senators' personal documents. If it was lying on a desk, I think it was quite reasonable for the attendant to remove it.</PARA></TALK.START>

If that is the case, I am pleased to hear it. I think it would place attendants in an intolerable position were they to be reprimanded in any way for not taking off a senator's desk a piece of paper that had earlier been put there, whether it was authorised or not. I am assuming from what you say, Mr Chairman, that the instruction was given from somebody in authority to remove those copies of the unauthorised amendment that could be seen.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Walsh was the person who was presumed, because the amendment was to be moved on behalf of the Government, to be the one to move the amendment. I understand that he found that an amendment which he had not authorised had inadvertently been circulated. He asked for those copies to be withdrawn. I hope that I have made it clear that the attendants, acting in the interests of all senators, would remove copies from the desks but they would certainly have no authority to go riffling through the papers of individual senators. If they were lying on the desk they could take them away. It is quite obvious that some copies remained.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator STONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, debate on this bizarre matter, as I am prompted by Senator Haines to describe it. I think we have had two episodes which do not reflect a great deal of credit on those concerned. First of all, we had the circulation of an amendment which the Government had up its sleeve, so to speak, but which it had not intended to circulate unless certain circumstances occurred. Incidentally, I do not blame the attendants for that; I do not think Senator Haines does either. I simply blame a certain sloppiness on the part of the Government for not having made its intentions clear to the staff of this place. That is what I might call boo-boo number one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although I do not want to prolong discussion on the matter, I think Senator Haines has raised a legitimate point. Once a piece of paper, whether authorised or unauthorised by a Minister, has been placed on the desks of senators I do not believe that there is any authority on the part of any Minister in this place to remove it from the desks of senators. I think the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) was quite improper in giving such an instruction although I, in no way, blame the attendants for carrying out the instruction. As I say, I think we have had a double comedy of errors. I do not think that Rome will fall as a consequence. I do not think we should prolong debate any further on what I see as a couple of unhappy accidents on the Government's part this evening. I think we have an accident prone government now and it will get increasingly so. It will just have to get accustomed to that until it finally falls over in a few months time. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendments make it clear that the proposed exemption for certain paper products applies to goods only if all the paper in the goods is recycled paper. The Government remains of the view that the Bill as originally drafted gives effect to the Government's announcement of an exemption for certain paper products made wholly from recycled paper. We do not accept the criticisms made of the Bill that it would grant exemption to goods made from a combination of recycled paper and new material. However, it has become clear that because of other views, the exemption in its original form may have resulted in unnecessary litigation that is costly and time consuming for all. I commend the amendments to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) is, in fact, wrong in relation to the proposed amendments and in his interpretation of them. There are really three issues involved in these amendments. The one which the Government has addressed relates to the words `has been manufactured from' and the very slight possibility that that could have been interpreted in such a way that paper which was not made from recycled paper could have been judged to fall within this amending Bill and therefore might have been eligible for no sales tax. The Government has taken out the words and replaced them with `is'. We have no problem with that at all. However, the other two amendments really go to the heart of a much more important matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The object of this whole exercise of removing the sales tax from paper made from recycled fibre is to encourage, as far as possible, the use of fibre which has already been used to achieve the maximum degree of recycling, so as to reduce the impact which paper manufacture will have on forests, water supplies, water pollution and so on, and generally to encourage the ethic of recycling to get the maximum amount of use out of material. </PARA>
<PARA> As somebody who is not overly familiar with the technology in this area, I sought advice from a number of sources. I am reliably informed, from quite independent sources who know things about paper manufacture, that in the process of recycling fibre, the fibre tends to lose strength and length and to become rather more furry-that is the way it is described. Therefore the quality of the paper which is made on each recycling diminishes. It is therefore appropriate that one considers recycling in the form of a cascade whereby one starts off with virgin fibre which is then recycled to make it into high quality paper. That is then recycled to make a lesser quality paper. If one wants to keep up the quality of the paper one has to mix a certain proportion of virgin paper with the recycled paper. Progressively, as the fibre is recycled, the quality of the product being manufactured becomes less and less until eventually it finishes up a low grade cardboard, flower pots that are used for potting plants and put into the ground, or egg cartons and the like. Under those circumstances it seems clear that to maintain that level of recycling one does need some virgin fibre going in at the top end. The level to which the Australian industry is geared to recycle fibre is, to some extent, constrained. One is led to believe that the manufacturers in Europe are further advanced than we are here and they are able to make better quality paper from 100 per cent recycled fibre, whereas in Australia our technology is still not quite up to that standard. Given the present technology, it is therefore appropriate, bearing in mind the purpose of this legislation, which is to achieve the maximum degree of recycling, to seek to amend the Government's Bill to remove the sales tax from paper or goods which are manufactured from fibre of which at least 80 per cent by weight is recycled. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the first point. Indeed, in support of that I draw attention to the report dated 2 November which has been circulated by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) Who has been carrying out a study on the use of recycled paper by Parliament and various government offices. On page 1 of that report the Minister for Administrative Services states:</PARA>
<PARA> The applications for recycled paper made from between 50% to 80% recycled content are likely to be greater than for 100% recycled paper. </PARA>
<PARA>In the same vein, the last page of that report refers to permanent paper, high quality paper for archival purposes and so on, identified recycled paper which is made of a high proportion of recycled fibre with a small proportion of virgin fibre and then 100 per cent recycled. It clearly identifies that the paper or other products which include a proportion of virgin fibre allows one to manufacture a wider range of products. If that means-I believe it does-that one can achieve a greater degree of recycling, that is the purpose of the Bill, and that purpose is better served by taking the figure of 80 per cent rather than 100 per cent which, while it is not stated in clause 3, is clearly implicit in the words. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendment which the Minister apparently was not aware of when he was speaking is that we are seeking to replace the word `paper' with `fibre'. The reason for that goes to another matter; that is that paper can be manufactured from a whole range of sources of cellulose fibre. Indeed, throughout probably most of the history of paper making, wood was not used at all; hemp was used for centuries, probably for thousands of years. Indeed, one could suggest that Australia would be better off if it went back to growing hemp for paper making rather than cutting down forests. One can produce more fibre per unit of area over time from that source--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and one could make very good tobacco paper. I understand that there are genetic variants which have very low levels of THC, so that the paper manufacturers could make the paper without getting high on smoking the paper. Certainly, cotton waste is used a great deal in the manufacture of paper. If any honourable senators are interested, I have samples of paper made from cotton waste. Again, if one is intent on achieving the maximum degree of recycling, one should be concerned about recycled fibre rather than recycled paper. In relation to clause 3, the suggested amendments are really in three categories and not two, as the Minister was saying. I have no difficulty at all with taking out the words `has been manufactured from' and replacing them with `is' which clarifies the situation. I foreshadowed that, should this amendment be passed, I will then move an amendment relating to the 80 per cent figure and seek to replace the word `paper' at the end of the first sentence with `fibre'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Bearing in mind what I have just said about a cascade of recycling use, at each step of which the quality of the product, in terms of the length of fibre and so on, is diminished, the other amendment which has been circulated goes to that matter and seeks to allow the products which will appear right at the end of that process also to attract the abolition of the sales tax. Therefore, I will be moving that personal products for women-paper fibre is used quite a lot in various sanitary napkins and such items-egg cartons and seed planters be exempt from sales tax. Those products often are the final use to which the fibre is put before finally being discarded. Knowing what Senator Vallentine is wishing to do in that regard, I have no difficulty in accepting the addition of insulation in that general area because that is another use to which the fibre can be put virtually at the end of its life with a great deal of usefulness. If we are serious about achieving the maximum degree of recycling, we should be supporting all of these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also want to signal to the Government that I think it is a mistake to believe that amendment No. 1, which is circulated in my name, is in line with the amendment moved by the Government. That is not so, although I have no argument with the first part of it. I am also trying to change the word `paper' to `fibre'. It is important to make that distinction. Before we get on to those amendments, it is important to note that the introduction of this Bill will see the recycling of wastepaper, which many people in the community have been lobbying for for a long time. It is a very important step in the right direction. It is long overdue. A similar Bill presented by Senator Coulter should have been passed in June. At least we can give the Government credit for the fact that this is finally happening. I applaud it for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With the introduction of the sales tax exemption on recycled paper, the incentive will be there for industry to seriously consider using this wastepaper which has previously been considered as an uneconomical and a difficult resource. Therefore, it has usually been disregarded by most pulp and paper manufacturing industries for the more easily accessible and less costly virgin pulp. Finally, we are heading in the right direction. Not only will incentives be provided for industry, but also the general public will have the choice to use either recycled or non-recycled paper products. Until now that choice has not been possible, with only a limited range and quantity of recycled paper products to choose from and at a much higher price. So although I agree with the majority of the Bill, I will be putting forward two amendments, the first of which will be to expand the category for tax exemption and to cover recycled fibres other than paper. This amendment should be included in the legislation as there are industries which are already making paper products, including writing paper and envelopes, from waste such as cotton, straw, petals and other fibres. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had some examples of this very artistic and attractive paper material which has been distributed by a company called Nature Paper Pty Ltd. It is very keen to point out that it manufactures and sells papers made from recycled rag which would still be taxed at 20 per cent under the Government's present legislation. This seems to discriminate against papers made from recycled fibre other than wood pulp, which is against the intention of the Bill. Surely the intention of the Bill is to protect our environment by supporting all recycled paper manufacturers. Nature Paper aims to provide an alternative to wood pulp by promoting the use of papers made from other recycled fibres. Such industries should be encouraged rather than being priced out of the market because they do not qualify for this particular sales tax exemption. So although the majority of recycled paper will be made from paper, we should not discourage other industries which are recycling other types of waste. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These Government amendments, presented for the first time this evening, are a testimony to Australia's having the Senate as a House of review, to give a second opinion and to re-examine in a thorough manner the meaning of words and the impact of those words on members of the Australian community. A lesson to be learnt is that the Senate should not rush legislation through with undue haste. Regrettably all too infrequently, the Government listens to Opposition senators' speeches from time to time and seeks to correct loopholes in legislation drawn to the attention of the Senate by those senators who read legislation and attempt to evaluate the ramifications. I think these Government amendments are an indication of the practicality of the Senate and that, as a result of compromise and commonsense, meaningful and correct legislation can get through.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I must say that the Minister who was previously in charge of this Bill had a most unusual way of saying that the Government had originally got it wrong. He went on to state that the corrections, the amendments, were designed, amongst other things, to prevent some perhaps unnecessary and expensive legislation. For the purpose of the record I will explain that last Thursday during the debate on the second reading I drew the Government's attention to certain drafting deficiencies in the Bill that would have enabled certain groups, including pulp and paper manufacturing enterprises, some unintended benefits or advantages-not consequences in this case-as far as the Government was concerned. Furthermore, and more seriously for the Government, I went on to explain that in two very significant areas the Bill did not fulfil the philosophy or the undertakings of the Government's own environmental statement of 20 July 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Gareth Evans, in response to those remarks, said that the Government would give due consideration at a later date. I had not expected that later date to come quite so quickly. Obviously, the Government was embarrassed as a result of this conflict with its environmental statement. I congratulate it on its speedy action to correct that. Obviously it was going to be corrected in time; it was best to avoid the litigation; it was best to avoid embarrassment over time; and it was best for the Senate to get it right in the first place. The Government now has it right, and I say congratulations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support briefly what my colleague Senator Watson has just said and to say, therefore, that we will be supporting the Government's amendments on this matter. In respect of the further matter which has been advised by Senator Coulter, I have a degree of sympathy with some of the comments he uttered in relation to the 80 per cent qualification which he was seeking to insert in the Bill. I have to say that this is another of those occasions when it is not appropriate for this chamber to take these sorts of things on the run. That, I think, was the second principle to which Senator Watson quite appropriately referred. He referred first of all to the value of the Senate as a chamber of review and, secondly, to the undesirability of taking things on the run. I agree with both points. I think we have seen in these amendments from the Government tonight the value of the first principle. I must insist, I hope without disappointing Senator Coulter too much, upon the second principle as well in not supporting the amendment that he has now put.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But there is a case to be argued, and I think Senator Coulter began to argue it in the case of this whole matter of sales tax to be applied to recycled paper, which we are now, in effect, approving. After all, that began also in kind of iterative process some months ago and further and better thoughts perhaps have intervened meanwhile. I would not want to speculate but when we are in government in a few months' time we may very well want to look more kindly upon the amendment that Senator Coulter has moved this evening. But at the moment I cannot support that. </PARA>

Because egg cartons are the container for a product which is exempt from sales tax, they are already exempt, as are some of the other things referred to in Senator Coulter's amendment. It is a bit more complicated with respect to seed and seedling planters designed for horticultural use. They are exempt if they are for horticultural use.

<PARA> ``(h) insulation material.';''. </PARA>
<PARA>Insulation material is being made at the moment in Western Australia from 100 per cent recycled paper. That is also being done in Victoria and New South Wales. Waste paper used ranges from newspapers, cardboard and glossy magazines. Currently, no other industry can recycle glossy magazines. In Western Australia the industry uses approximately 40 tonnes of waste paper per week. The waste paper is chopped and impregnated with borax, which makes the insulation fireproof to 1,500 degrees centigrade. The product is guaranteed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the Department of Consumer Affairs and the Australian Standards Association. The cost of insulating an average Australian house is approximately $800 to $900. This price is competitive with non-environmentally friendly insulation, and I think that we should be providing incentives for Australians to insulate their homes with environmentally friendly products. We could assist in that matter by giving tax exemption within the parameters of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2) to insulation material. </PARA>

We are not willing to accept the amendment at this stage, but at some time in the future the Government will very likely be coming back with a list of further exemptions which we believe do not have any great definitional problems.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to hear that the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) does not have any problem with de-inking of paper in roofs, as he did with the amendments I attempted to move a moment ago. One difficulty in recycling paper is the blockage in the whole recycling program caused by the failure of newspaper companies to use any recycled paper at all, given that the large amount of paper which goes into newsprint is not balanced by the relatively small amount which goes into all other uses. Until there is substantial recycling of paper into newsprint, there is going to be great difficulty in achieving very high levels of recycling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not appropriate in this legislation, for reasons which the Minister for Finance would be well aware of, to attempt to do anything in relation to newsprint. Because newspapers are manufactured items, I understand, the newspaper manufacturers do not pay any tax on the newsprint when they buy it. So this is irrelevant. However, we do have very large stacks of newspapers lying around every capital city in Australia. Very often these newspapers are sent to dumps, burnt and so on because we are not recycling that paper back into newsprint. One area where newspaper can be recycled is in the area of insulation. There is difficulty in recycling newspaper into other products because of the ink problem that the Minister has drawn our attention to, and also because the quality of the paper is not particularly good. Unless one has a source of virgin fibre, it is difficult to make high quality paper from recycled newsprint. </PARA>
<PARA> I am disappointed that the Minister is not prepared to accept Senator Vallentine's amendment and seek one area where a great deal of this fibre could go into a permanent long term use as insulation in buildings, with enormous savings in the use of other resources. It seems to be an excellent use for this material. I am extremely disappointed that the Government is not prepared to accept Senator Vallentine's amendment. </PARA>

<PARA> `19. Rolls of sensitised, unexposed, instant print film.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>At this hour in this debate I do not wish to open up the issue of Kodak. The problem here is with one of Kodak's competitors, Polaroid, which for the past six years has experienced considerable inequities with regard to the application of sales tax whereby a higher incidence of sales tax is incurred on instant photographic film compared to conventional photography. This distortion in the marketplace is really not desirable between products which essentially are identical in all other ways. For conventional photographic film, the price of film is $1.98. With sales tax of 20 per cent, or 40c, developing charge and developing sales tax charge of 20 per cent, and print charge and print sales charge of 20 per cent, the total is $10.99. If that is added to the price of the film, we get $13.37. That gives a cost per frame of $1.11. For instant photographic film, or 10 prints, the film price to the wholesaler is $12.44 and the developing charge, developing sales tax charge and so forth is $2.49, giving a total of $14.93, or a cost per frame of $1.49.</PARA>
<PARA> The sales tax on instant film, included in the wholesaler's resale price, is 16.7 per cent, whereas the sales tax for the conventional photographic film is 9.3 per cent. I can explain the latter because there is a complication in the calculations. In respect of the printing tax paid by laboratories on photographic reprints or enlargements which they manufacture and then sell, the incidence of tax is 9.3 per cent compared to the wholesale rate of 30 per cent. The sales tax rate of 9.3 per cent has been derived by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) based on a notional sales value. Previously the rate was arbitrarily established at 10.8 per cent. The ATO has argued that the difference arises because of the different wholesale rates. Yet the rate of 9.3 per cent is an arbitrary figure established without reference to the wholesale value and presumably can best be described as expedient for the various parties concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that the Government would be interested in ensuring that the sales tax on comparable products was comparable. Indeed, the Government's thrust over the last few years has been an attempt, in a number of amendments to this legislation, to get comparable items taxed comparably, so that one does not favour one product or technology over another. In this legislation we have differentiated rates, which is not desirable and certainly not in the current context, where support will be provided by the Government to one competitor in the area. We must make sure that under these types of arrangements there is equity in regard to comparable items. I urge the Senate to support this amendment to bring about that comparability. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition, apparently with the support of the Australian Democrats, had submitted an amendment. The Government does not like the amendment very much, but it was pretty futile to oppose it when we did not have the numbers to defeat it. Therefore, I move the Government amendment circulated in my name:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Page 2, Clause 4, at the end of the clause, add the following new subclause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(2) Section 3 of the Principal Act is amended by adding at the end the following subsections:</PARA>
<PARA> `(13) A reference in this Act to a computer program embodied in a microchip does not include a computer program in a microchip in a cartridge where:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the program is marketed as being exclusively for educational or entertainment use; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the cartridge is marketed as being exclusively for use with a personal computer or a home electronic device that includes or is for use with a visual display unit. </PARA>
<PARA> `(14) In subsection (13), ``home electronic device'' does not include:</PARA>

<PARA> (d) a television video cassette player; or</PARA>
<PARA> (e) a television video cassette recorder; or</PARA>

<PARA>The Government believes that our amendment is superior on technical grounds-that is, the opinion we received from the Australian Taxation Office was that the Opposition's amendment could open up an exemption for a much wider range of goods than the Opposition had intended. The Government's amendment, by explicitly not including the items listed at the bottom of the amendment-that is, compact disc players, televisions, video cameras, video cassette players, and so on-we believe, on technical grounds, meets the Opposition's objective without running the risk of opening up the exemption for products which the Opposition did not intend to open up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not detain the Committee for long. The Opposition had proposed an amendment to clause 4. I was rather sorry to hear the Minister say that the Government did not like it much. I think that that was a slightly grudging position for the Minister to take. If I was not in a kindly mood this evening, I would say that it was churlish. The Opposition, however, is in a charitable mood and is disposed to the view that the Government has improved, technically speaking, upon our amendment. It accomplishes the objective which we set out to obtain. Therefore, we are happy to withdraw our amendment, to accept the Government's amendment and to get on with it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is withdrawing the amendment which was to be put forward by my colleague Senator Messner who, unfortunately, is indisposed this evening. The Opposition will accept the Government's suggested changes to the thrust of the amendment to be put forward by the Opposition. While we detected a weakness and an anomaly in the original legislation-not to allow for cartridges, et cetera, to be installed in the port of a computer for certain purposes-we were at the same time concerned that a possible amendment did not widen the ramifications of the legislation further than what was originally intended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For that reason we submitted an amendment to the Government for consideration by the Australian Taxation Office. This was done on two occasions. Originally we used the term `marketed' which may have been offensive. The Government, on advice, felt that that was too wide and provided an ambit claim. On drafting advice we moved it back to `design'. On a change of mind, the Government now feels that the word `marketed' should be reinstated. The only other significant change is a list of exclusions in proposed subsection 3 (14). The list of exclusions is not unreasonable. Therefore we will not only withdraw our amendment but also agree to the Government amendment put forward in recognition of the anomalies raised by the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it the National Health Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989. This debate will be mercifully short. The Bill before the Senate is to amend the National Health Act as it relates to membership of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. This is a body which we have all come, not so much to love and respect, but to know and have quite mixed feelings about. It increases to four the additional members that can be appointed to the Tribunal by the Minister. The significant part, however, is not simply the increased numbers of those members to be appointed to the Tribunal but rather the specific qualifications. Clause 3 of the Bill inserts in section 98a of the principal Act a requirement that, first, the Minister must appoint as an additional member to the Tribunal at least one person who has been but is no longer engaged directly or indirectly in community pharmacy. Second, in making that appointment the Minister must consult with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On behalf of the Opposition, I would like to say that we support this Bill. It makes the point that we have been making for some time about the need for bodies such as the Tribunal-any such tribunal-to have available to it the expertise of somebody who has actually been involved in practising the profession which is being regulated or judged by a government based tribunal. However, it should be understood that this is not a guarantee that outcomes will necessarily be any better for a number of reasons. First, in purely precedential sense, one might say that the appointment of nominees of the Royal College of Pathologists has not necessarily meant that the recommendations of the Pathology Services Advisory Committee are automatically accepted all round or by the profession or, indeed, are not subject to potential moves in the Senate for the disallowance of the particular determinations. Nevertheless, I believe that the Tribunal will be strengthened by having somebody who has some practical experience, although he or she is not a continuing direct practitioner and therefore a potential beneficiary of the determinations that the Tribunal will make. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I welcome the recognition in the legislation that the Minister must consult with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. The Guild is specified as such in the legislation. The new section (2a) (b) makes it clear that it is the Pharmacy Guild of Australia which is the appropriate body to be consulted on this particular matter. When we come to debate the next item on the Notice Paper, namely, the National Health Amendment Bill 1989 and the consideration in the Committee of the Whole of the message from the House of Representatives, we will have more of an opportunity to discuss the central role which the Guild itself plays in the making of these determinations. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Government is taking this opportunity to respond to what has been a very unsatisfactory situation as far as the Tribunal is concerned. It recognises the criticisms which have been made and it recognises the legitimate concerns which have been expressed that bodies like the Tribunal should be composed of people who have no particular expertise in the area concerned. For example, if one looks at the Tribunal's notorious 28 August determination and at who the participants were, one will see that the Chairman is a judge of the Industrial Relations Commission whose background is in industrial relations and certainly not pharmacy, one other member is a person with some training as an economist and accountant, and another is a distinguished lawyer who has previously served in the role of Commonwealth Ombudsman. The Tribunal does not have on it a person who is intimately familiar with the profession of a pharmacist, and we believe this amendment substantially improves the Tribunal in whatever role it will play in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> A much more significant debate will take place immediately after this one on the National Health Amendment Bill and pharmacy pricing in general. Therefore, I will not detain the Senate any longer on this matter. I will simply say that we should not be carried away by the fact that this representation is to be given. The person concerned is to be only one of four potential members. He is just as capable of being outvoted as any minority group within the area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the first occasion on which I have had to deal with a message coming back from the House of Representatives insisting on disagreeing with an amendment that the Senate has previously insisted upon insisting upon. If I find the technicalities of this a little obtuse, I am sure I can rely on your guidance, Madam Temporary Chairman. As I understand the situation, it is as follows: When the Senate last debated the National Health Amendment Bill 1989 it passed an amendment which sought to strike down the determination of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal (PBRT) of 28 August 1989. That was passed by the Senate on the combined votes of the Liberal and National parties and the Australian Democrats. It went back to the House of Representatives, which then disagreed with the Senate amendment but made a further amendment to the National Health Bill changing the date on which the provisions of the Bill relating to the maximum patient contribution were to commence. The Senate accepted the House of Representatives amendment dealing with the commencement date but insisted upon the amendment that the Senate had previously made striking down the PBRT determination. The House of Representatives now sends us back the Bill, saying that it wishes to press the Senate again on the question of the striking down of the PBRT determination. The Minister has now moved a motion asking us, in effect, not to insist upon our amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On behalf of the Opposition I wish to say that we propose to insist on the amendment so that the effect will be to strike down the PBRT determination of 28 August 1989. This Bill does two things. First, it increases from $11 to $12 the maximum patient contribution that can be required under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. This is to be effective from 1 January as a result of the previous amendments to which I have referred. That part of the Bill is supported by the Opposition. Secondly, it deals with the issue of the notorious PBRT determination of 28 August. It does not require a lengthy debate, but I propose to say just a few words about it. As I said, we will insist on the Senate amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the Tribunal, having now made the determination that it will set aside by administrative action its own determination and go back to a negotiating situation-although a negotiating situation buttressed with terms and conditions which are set out in the statement which the Minister for Housing and Aged Care, Mr Staples, issued on 4 December 1989, does not recreate a level playing field upon which the competing claims of the industry and the Tribunal and the Government may be fairly adjudicated. It leaves in place the Tribunal's determination of 28 August in a way which would allow the Tribunal simply to reassert the determination without having to take any further actions or without being subject to further scrutiny by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The conditions which Mr Staples mentioned in his press statement for the basis on ongoing discussions between the Government and the pharmacists were three in number. The first is that each of the principal organisations and associations of pharmacists undertake to advise each of their members in writing to fully cooperate in any such survey. That refers to a survey of pharmaceutical prices which in many respects was at the nub of the argument about the validity of the data which the Tribunal had used as the base for its 28 August determination. </PARA>
<PARA> The second condition was that each of the parties undertakes such steps as are necessary to allow the survey and subsequent consequential review to be taken free of duress and in a calm and proper atmosphere. I interpolate to say that it is that lack of freedom from duress which persuades the Opposition to continue to insist upon our amendment. The third condition was that there be general agreement to return to the status quo existing prior to the 28 August 1989 determination by the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> In the limited time that we have in committee, I want, firstly, to make a comment about the capacity to strike down the Tribunal's determination. Madam Temporary Chairman, you will recall that on a number of occasions Mr Staples has insisted that the determination of the Tribunal was not capable of being struck down. In answering a question in the House of Representatives on 5 September 1989, Mr Staples said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government recognises that the PBRT's decision cannot be overthrown by either the Government, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia or any other body. </PARA>
<PARA>That clearly also means by the Parliament. However, his senior Minister, Dr Blewett, was interviewed on 12 November 1989 on the Sunday program. The interviewer put to him:</PARA>
<PARA>You decided to support it?-</PARA>
<PARA>namely, the Tribunal determination. </PARA>
<PARA>You could have decided differently. You could have, in fact, done what Andrew Peacock's now promising to do. </PARA>
<PARA>That is to say, to strike down the determination. Dr Blewett said:</PARA>
<PARA>It would have been difficult, but no doubt the Government could simply have rejected an independent umpire's tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Mr Staples having been saying for some time that there was no capacity to strike down the determination, Dr Blewett nevertheless admits that there is that capacity to strike down the determination. That is something which we have asserted for some considerable period, which we assert again this evening, and which we press this evening during the debate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is to be said that the fact that this matter is to go back to the discussion does not mean that there will necessarily be a satisfactory outcome. For example, in the Sydney Morning Herald of 9 December, there is an article under the heading `Pharmacists may reject tribunal's peace offer' in which it describes the additional problems which the pharmacists are now likely to face. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> They complained about the lack of input to the new survey proposed by tribunal-</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate there that the validity of the survey is quite central to this whole matter-</PARA>
<PARA>and about new pharmacy measures to come into force next year which prevent the dispensing of a repeat prescription within three days of the original. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me just pause on that for a moment and give a practical example drawn from my own health experience about why that sort of thing is a nonsense. I happen to be one of the very large number of people in this country who suffer from asthma. As a result I have a prescription which provides for me one of those small pressure packs, an inhaler, which I use. The fact of the matter is that I am allowed to get one of those on each occasion. For my own peace of mind I keep more than one around the place. I keep one at home, one in the office, one in the car, whatever it happens to be. When I need additional inhalers I am only allowed to get one on each prescription despite the fact that they are written for one, plus five repeats. So what I have to do is go back to my pharmacist each day and pick up another inhaler to have available to me in the different locations where I want to keep them. The idea that I would have to wait three days between filling a repeat prescription is the sort of nonsense that this Government just does not understand. The bureaucrats simply do not understand what it is to manage people's health on an individual basis. It does not fit their programs, it does not fit their narrow mentalities, and it is good enough for the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a perceptive editorial in the Australian newspaper on Friday, 8 December, which started off in this fashion:</PARA>
<PARA> If a court made a decision, aroused loud opposition and then changed its mind, people would be entitled to worry. </PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely what the Tribunal has done. Finley Peter Dunne, in a wonderful book entitled The Supreme Court's Decision 1901, had this to say about the American Supreme Court:</PARA>
<PARA>No matter whether the Constitution follows the flag or not, the Supreme Court follows the election returns. </PARA>
<PARA>You can bet your life that the Tribunal-the alleged independent Tribunal-having had the blowtorch applied well and truly to its belly, decided that it was about time to back off. It is no wonder, therefore, that the editorial in the Australian concludes in this fashion:</PARA>
<PARA>The tribunal came to its decision independently. But the subsequent flap indicates where the real responsibility lies. It is the Government that has the responsibility. It is the Government that should be seen to have it. It is the Government that should set dispensing fees, and it is the tribunal that needs to be dispensed with. </PARA>
<PARA>The Tribunal is not being dispensed with. But we propose, in terms of tonight's amendment, to insist that it pay proper attention to starting again in terms of a level playing field. The Australian Journal of Pharmacy in October 1989 ran an editorial under the heading `Government and Tribunal have to go'. The pharmacists of Australia know that is true. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> It is becoming clear that the survival of the present system of Australian community pharmacy is dependent upon the Hawke Government losing the next federal election. . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely correct for the people of Australia and for Australian pharmacists. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by drawing attention to the fact that on 10 November Andrew Peacock wrote to some 5,600 community pharmacies around Australia. Mr Peacock set out in his letter the role of the community pharmacy as it is perceived under the incoming Liberal and National party administration. He indicated the belief that we have in the importance of community pharmacy and he indicated that it was our intention to pursue the striking down of this determination. We have consistently said that we want to revoke the determination of the Tribunal. We have the opportunity provided to us this evening. </PARA>
<PARA> I will foreshorten my remarks at this stage and, unless unduly provoked by the Minister, I will not have to respond again in committee. I believe that Senator Coulter will be in a position to indicate the view of the Australian Democrats on the matter. The Minister will have the opportunity to respond. I hope that by the conclusion of the proceedings at 10.30 this evening we will be able to determine this matter and insist upon the Senate amendment. We will send it back to the House of Representatives saying that we have no objection to the increase in the maximum patient contribution to take effect as of 1 January but that in defence of community pharmacy in Australia and in defence of the best health care for Australian citizens, we insist upon our amendment and insist that on this occasion the House of Representatives gives way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The way the Government has dealt with this whole sorry saga of the remuneration for pharmacists is quite amazing. It is incredible that now, after so long, it is still insisting, as Senator Puplick has indicated, on terms which are simply designed to maintain the ire of pharmacists and not really to settle this very vexatious matter which I believe must be worrying the Government a great deal as it rolls towards an imminent election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The determination of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal is based on insufficient data. It was flawed in a number of respects. It did not take account of such matters as the mark up and the different types of activities in which pharmacists are involved, namely the dispensing of pharmaceutical benefits scheme prescriptions,the dispensing of non-PBS prescriptions, and the front of shop operations-the selling of cosmetics and toiletries and so on. I think we have debated at some length the way in which the Government clearly expected pharmacists essentially to subsidise their PBS activities out of those activities. Together with the Opposition, the Australian Democrats have maintained that that is an indefensible position and that the pharmacists are entitled to an adequate and appropriate remuneration for each part of the operation which they carry out in their shops. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Health Amendment Bill, in essence, was a very simple piece of legislation when it was rolled up to us. It aimed to increase the maximum patient contribution from $11 to $12. Neither the Opposition nor the Australian Democrats has any difficulty with that, but the Opposition sought to append to that legislation the rejection, or the `striking down' as Senator Puplick put it, of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal's determination of 28 August. Since that time it is clear that the Government has become even more embarrassed by the continuing upset of the pharmacists and the way in which they are reacting very strongly, vociferously and effectively against the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In moving around the country I have seen a number of pharmacists' shops festooned with placards and signs very strongly critical of the Government's action in this area. It is not surprising, therefore, that the Government eventually sought to modify the structure of the Tribunal and sought that the Tribunal should bring forward a different determination. Senator Puplick has outlined certain conditions that have been set. Both the Government and the pharmacists have expressed the hope that eventually there will be some rapprochement which will result in a fairer scale of remuneration and a fairer system of remuneration for pharmacists in relation to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. However, the Government apparently is intent on keeping in place the previous determination, to hold it like a sword of Damocles over the head of the pharmacists, and to say to them, `If you're naughty boys and girls and you don't behave yourselves and provide the data and do various other things, then this early determination shall obtain.'. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that if the Government is genuine in saying that it is going into these negotiations with no prior conditions other than that it is seeking a fair remuneration for the pharmacists out of this new determination, it should go in with the decks cleared and with no preconditions. I am surprised that it does not accept this amendment, moved by the Opposition and supported by the Australian Democrats. The other thing that really surprises me about this is that if the pharmacists do not enter into these negotiations genuinely and the Tribunal is still disturbed by the sorts of data that it gets and is forced to come to the same sorts of conclusions as it did beforehand, there is no reason why the new tribunal should not come down essentially with a copy of the determination which is already in place. </PARA>
<PARA> For both those reasons the Democrats have great difficulty in seeing why the Government insists on removing the amendment from the legislation. Therefore, we have no difficulty in supporting the Opposition yet again on this amendment and sending the amended Bill back to the House of Representatives with a request that it give consideration to the passage of this amendment. We have no objection to the original purpose, the increase of the maximum patient contribution from $11 to $12, and we are surprised that the Government does not simply accept what has been sent to it, get on with the business, get on with the new Tribunal, and then come forward with a fair determination. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of what has gone before, I remark perhaps rather cynically that, if the rumour which is going around this place that we face an election on 24 February is anywhere near right, it seems fairly clear that the Government has set up the process such that the new determination will not be on the table until after the election. I suppose one could be cynical enough to suggest that that also is part of the strategy. Nonetheless, for the two reasons which I have given, I can see no reason why the Government should have difficulty in accepting this amendment originally moved by the Opposition and supported by the Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not speak for very long either. Anything I say might provoke Senator Puplick. Even the oratory of Senator Cooney may not convince the Opposition to vote with the Government on this particular issue. It should be recognised by honourable senators that the conditions laid down for this further review were in fact laid down by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. The Government acknowledges, and in fact insists, that the conditions are fairly laid down by any tribunal that is charged with deliberating on an issue such as this. The conditions essentially ensure that there will be full cooperation in the conduct of a survey-a survey which is quite necessary in terms of the Tribunal's considerations and also in terms of any government's ability to make decisions in this area, so that the Tribunal's decisions can be based on a rational and comprehensive analysis of the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government sees this survey as vital, and obviously the Tribunal does. Honourable senators should acknowledge that the Pharmacy Guild of Australia has not been all that keen to support this survey, and in fact has obstructed it from time to time. But the Tribunal did lay down these preconditions, and I think that any tribunal has the right to ensure that its operations are conducted so that all parties can be free to participate in it. I could speak for some time on this matter, but the Government sees this decision by the Committee as running counter not only to the way business should be run in this place but also to good government. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat this point: if we are talking about making decisions in a good, rational and comprehensive way, we should not be talking in the way that Senator Coulter talked when he mentioned anecdotal evidence and rumours about impending elections and so on. We are ensuring that an appropriate and adequate amount of information can be collected in a comprehensive survey. This is what the Tribunal has been about. I finish by indicating that the Government will, of course, insist on its amendment being supported. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The words of the Minister for Consumer Affairs, Senator Bolkus, about the importance of a further review and survey come into the same category as the apology of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to the pilots. It is a totally cynical exercise and is clearly designed for election purposes, as Senator Coulter outlined. I will not detain the Committee long, except to say that there has been a long, concerted effort by the Government to attack the integrity of the pharmacists, to try to imply that they are somehow engaged in practices which are not designed to assist people who seek their help and guidance and earn a fair day's pay for a fair day's work, but are somehow guilty of, in that well-known phrase, ripping off the system, trying to gain money from government coffers which they have not earned. The pharmacists are part of the community delivery of health service. They play an important part in it. They give people access to advice on simple health matters which averts their need to have recourse to a doctor. They have important skills which ought to be recognised, and that is why I spoke previously when this matter was before the Senate about their professionalism being attacked by the Government and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal's determination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no reason why the pharmacists should have any confidence at all in this so-called attempt to buy them off and get the matter off the agenda. There is no reason at all why sensible, intelligent pharmacists should be fooled by the attempt of the Government simply to get the matter off the agenda. Only a week ago when I was walking through various suburbs of Sydney, talking with shopkeepers, I encountered one pharmacist who had had one old customer come into his store, take out of his wallet his Australian Labor Party membership card to show what office he held within the Labor Party and say, `I am a customer of yours. If you want to keep my custom, get all these signs out of your shop'. That sort of thing the pharmacists will not wear. That is what the Government is attempting to do by saying, `You accept our terms and conditions, take down your propaganda and stop saying that the Government is not interested in the proper delivery of health service'. That sort of thing will not work with people who are intelligent, who are able and who know that their cause has justice. That is why the Opposition will persist with this amendment and, indeed, encourage the Government to desist. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.11)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating cognately the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), the Therapeutic Goods Bill and the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Bill. My contribution will relate only to the community services and health legislation. Senator Puplick will look after the therapeutic goods legislation. This legislation represents the fifth stage of an eight-stage reform plan for aged care, introduced some three years ago. The four stages that have been introduced to date have covered, as the second reading speech of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) mentions, the rational use of resources, more effective planning within the aged care industry, the equitable distribution of funding-and there is some doubt as to whether that is the proper term for it-and effective assessment and equity in care provision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some trauma has arisen during the implementation of these four stages. For instance, in the rational use of resources, which some in the industry translate as `reduced funding', the proportion of the frail aged going into homes has been arbitrary and is still being worked through on the basis of 40 nursing home places for every 1,000 frail aged people and 60 hostel places. Also, in the push to get people out of nursing homes and hostels and into the home and community care (HACC) program, there has been frustration in that funding has not been forthcoming in terms of delivering the appropriate services and the standard of care required. </PARA>
<PARA> Capital funding is available to only one sector of the industry. It should be remembered that almost 50 per cent of all nursing homes in Australia are operated and financed by private individuals who have made substantial investment in the aged care industry. These individuals do not receive any capital assistance from the Commonwealth, but they suffer at the hands of Government policies which fix their income and then allow interest rates on mortgage loans to escalate from 14 to 22 per cent. There have also been traumas associated with the funding formulas for the care aggregate module and the standard aggregate module. Reviews are to be undertaken in this regard, and I strongly suggest that they should take into account industry concerns. People from the industry should be represented on the review panels. </PARA>
<PARA> Also of concern is the resident classification instrument, which classifies patients into categories one to five relative to the prescribed numbers of hours of nursing care they require. The resident classification instrument lacks flexibility and sensitivity. It overlooks the way in which standards of health and appropriate standards of care continually fluctuate relative to an individual almost week by week or month by month. It also fails to address the specialised and intensified care for the ever-growing number of dementia patients who will inevitably be classified for lower funding hostel care, as opposed to the higher cost care that will be required. The effectiveness of the assessments by geriatric assessment teams is being questioned, as is that of the standards monitoring teams. The Government's changes have certainly caused concern in all sections of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The main part of this legislation relates to the rights of residents in nursing homes and hostels. The Opposition agrees with the principle of residents' rights, particularly where the Commonwealth is a funder to the residents in the homes. Indeed, we are on record as stating that we believe that there should be rules and guidelines associated with residents' rights and responsibilities, but having regard to the individual, other residents, staff and the service providers. We agree with the concept of contractual arrangements between residents and carers. We are also on record in relation to our concern and support for the welfare and care of all the aged, and, more particularly, for their rights in the hostels and nursing homes in which they reside. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the Opposition does not disagree with the principle involved in this legislation. Most of the hostels and nursing homes around Australia not only provide excellent facilities but also have a high regard for the rights of individuals, the rights of residents and the rights of patients within those homes. I know there are and will be exceptions-as there are to every rule-some of which have already come to the attention of the monitoring teams and the State and Federal Departments. But most hostels and nursing homes are providing an excellent service and the Commonwealth is playing its part. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that there is a need, and we know that the industry supports the rights of residents. However, the industry needs to ensure that the recommendations in the report on which this legislation is based can be put into practice in a way that does not add significantly to operating costs and in a way that is workable and acceptable to the individual, other residents, nursing staff and proprietors. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has said that there will be an extensive discussion and negotiation process with providers, unions and consumers before the final charter and contract of residents' rights and responsibilities is implemented. This is enabling legislation only. The Opposition stresses the need for consultation with all national organisations-not just those of the Minister's choosing-consumers, relatives, the States and local government. </PARA>
<PARA> The principle of user rights is not opposed by the industry but all the people in it maintain that the legal ramifications attached to defining user rights too specifically, when considered in the light of the legal aspects of duty of care, are of such magnitude and have such far-reaching implications-to proprietors, directors of nursing and every other level of staff-that there should be no rush to judgment on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has said that he will consult, but his record in relation to this matter has been poor. He has not consulted the chemists. The issues paper on residents' rights, I'm still an individual by Chris Ronalds, on which there was to be full consultation, caused concern and outrage to residents and to the industry, and the consultation that followed was minimal. Only 0.6 per cent of all the residents in hostels and nursing homes were polled, there was a lack of industry consumer representation in the consultancy group, and little meaningful consultation afterwards. It is no wonder that the industry is now suspicious when the Government says there will be proper consultation in regard to some of the proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the release of the issues paper and the final report, Residents' Rights in Nursing Homes and Hostels, almost overnight hundreds of frail aged people have become scared about going into a nursing home or hostel. They are worried about the care that they will get in a home. Hundreds of people have contacted Mr Braithwaite, myself and many of my colleagues about the issues paper. They claim that their comments were misconstrued, that the emphasis was changed and, according to some of the proprietors, that some of the interpretations of their statements bore no resemblance to the situation as it really is. The industry has asked the Minister to defer this enabling legislation until such time as the charter and agreement have been finalised. This request has been rejected and has fallen on deaf ears. One must wonder why the Government is pushing this legislation through at this late stage in the parliamentary session. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to deal specifically with the legislative process. At this stage I indicate that in committee the Opposition will move certain amendments. First, as to some of the areas that are of concern, I begin with the charter of residents' rights and responsibilities. This legislation sets out various criteria and provides for a statement, by instrument, of rights and responsibilities of residents of approved hostels. This is subject to a regulation to be brought in at a later stage, which must be either completely accepted or rejected in full. There is no means by which the charter can be amended, if necessary, by the House or the Senate. We propose that this matter not be subject to regulation, but that it should be subject to formulation by the Minister and brought back before the House and Senate where it can be debated and amended if necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The position in connection with the agreement is worse still. The Minister has the right to determine a common form of agreement which does not come back to the Parliament at all. We intend to move amendments which would have the effect of making the agreement subject to formulation and approval by both the Senate and the House of Representatives. We feel it is absolutely necessary for both Houses of Parliament to scrutinise both the charter and the agreement, especially in view of some of the comments we have received on the drafts contained in the report entitled Residents' Rights in Nursing Homes and Hostels. I should like to quote just one comment-from a lawyer consulted by the Victorian Hospitals Association Ltd:</PARA>
<PARA>We have given careful consideration to the proposed charter and the draft model contract. In our view, there are provisions in each document which are unintelligible, meaningless or which amount to no more than `motherhood statements' and which do not take account of life in the real world. </PARA>
<PARA> The so-called `draft model contract' is one of the most one-sided unworkable documents which I have seen during twenty years in the law. The background material to the contract speaks of `residents rights'. However, there is virtually no reference to a facility proprietor having any rights or, more importantly, any rights which are, in any real sense, enforceable or meaningful. The overall tenor and tone of the agreement needs to be radically altered. Having said that, even with major alteration, it is our view that the agreement is likely to give rise to considerable dispute such that we anticipate it will provide a source of considerable revenue to the legal profession for many years to come. </PARA>
<PARA>That is scathing condemnation of the charter and the agreement. Apart from the charter and agreement of residents' rights, there are many other proposals in this legislation. The Bill introduces more conditions with which a nursing home must comply in order that the residents of that home can receive funding from the Commonwealth. Under various provisions it sets conditions that require a proprietor to allow standards monitoring inspectors, community visitors, classification review inspectors and advocacy service employees to enter the nursing home at reasonable times and require a proprietor to provide all reasonable facilities and assistance in order that the people may achieve the purposes for which they are appointed under the legislation. The community visitors to be given these facilities are not designated in the legislation. No-one knows who they will be or whether they will have a capacity of concern and compassion in entering the home and meeting the residents. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments are conspicuously silent on the responsibilities and the authorities of these people. Here, it should be remembered that there is a condition of approval from a nursing home that a proprietor must meet the gazetted outcome standards which refer to the privacy of residents and confidentiality of information. This legislation enables the implementation of a charter of residents' rights which includes the right of personal independence and the right of privacy. Yet, within the same legislation, we have provisions which will allow all of these visitors to have access to residents and staff and to information concerning residents. This is the greatest offence against a person's civil liberties that I can imagine, particularly when this access is being given to people yet to be designated. These visitors will also judge the quality of the care received by people in the nursing home. Will they have the capacity to make that sort of judgment? This provision in the Bill is especially worrying. We would like an undertaking from the Minister that consultations will be held with the industry. Such consultations are absolutely necessary, not only with the industry but also with concerned people in the communities. The standards to be set must be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill gives power to the Minister to approve an operator of a nursing home by the formulation of principles. He is not compelled to do so under the legislation; he has a choice. What is the position if the Minister decides not to formulate the principles? Is he then unrestricted in his powers? Will Parliament ever get to see the principles under which these powers will be exercised? The Bill allows a proprietor or operator a period of 14 days from receipt of a notice that the Minister intends to revoke his approval as an operator in which to make a written submission stating why the approval should not be revoked. The industry does not feel that this period is anywhere near sufficient, given the importance of the situation. If an approval is revoked, does it mean that residents of that particular nursing home will lose their entitlement to funding? Does the approval simply move from one operator to another, from, say, husband to wife? What are the consequences of the revocation? These questions are not answered in the Bill and need some light shed upon them. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments also proposed in this Bill include the removal of the need for medical certificates for entry into a nursing home in some cases, and a lodgment and sitting fee for nursing homes which lodge appeals with the Minister against the fee determinations of the Department. The Minister has claimed that many appeals have been lodged as part of an orchestrated protest against various aspects of nursing home reform introduced by the Government. The industry states that this is completely untrue and that the large numbers of appeals have been submitted because the Department introduced legislation which limited the period-only 28 days-in which a nursing home proprietor could appeal against fee determinations by the Department. The Bill proposes a $500 charge on the initial appeal and $500 for each half-day thereafter. The legislation is silent about who will pay the nursing home's appeal costs and the cost of submitting the necessary information if an appeal is successful. All this suggests that the Department has taken a rather blase attitude towards this provision and is deliberately trying to deny to genuine nursing home operators who may want to appeal any access to that right. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the amendments that the Opposition will propose in committee. I should like to say that they have the support of the Australian Nursing Homes Association (ANHA) and the Australian Affiliation of Voluntary Care Associations (AAVCA). These are the peak bodies representing the nursing homes and hostels industry and, indeed, bodies represented on the steering committee for the report Residents' Rights in Nursing Homes and Hostels. They are the organisations nominated by the Government to participate on behalf of providers in the detailed discussions and negotiations on the charter and agreement with the Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health. The ANHA and the AAVCA believe that the charter and agreement must come back to Parliament for scrutiny, debate, amendment, if necessary, and approval-thus protecting and safeguarding the democratic rights of the people to express their opinion through their elected members of parliament in the House of Representatives and the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will be aware that for a long time I have held a particular interest on behalf of my constituency in stock routes and excisions and Aboriginal living areas in the Northern Territory. In fact, on 15 August I gave notice of a motion to the Senate, which is terribly important and is still on the Notice Paper. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, introduced the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 1989 into the House of Representatives on 31 October. This Bill is currently before the Senate and we will be dealing with it in the legislative process-hopefully, later this week. However, as a result of reading the initial Bill I discovered a number of problem areas that I believed needed urgent attention by the Minister's office. Tonight I want to speak about the administrative processes and the ineptitude of the Minister's office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 1 November in the House of Representatives the former Opposition spokesman, Mr Chris Miles, tabled my letter dated 1 November listing 11 matters that required urgent attention. That letter was most important and I would have anticipated an early response to it. However, it is only today, after a lot of cajoling and pressure, that I have been able to obtain a very unsatisfactory answer to the letter. That is 41 days after it was tabled in the House of Representatives. So much for a facility which is so terribly important for my Northern Territory constituents. I believe that I only received an answer to the letter because last Friday I wrote to Senator Robert Ray, the Manager of Government Business in this place, drawing his attention to the problem of no reply and the way in which we would be able to deal with the legislation later this week. </PARA>
<PARA> Coincidentally, Mr Hand's reply to me is dated last Friday, but I was informed this morning by government staff that it was signed this morning and delivered to me at about midday.

<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> I have begun examination of the Aboriginal Land Rights Bill which you introduced on 31 October. To assist my understanding of the Bill, could you please let me have your advice in relation to the following matters?</PARA>
<PARA> (1) On page 7 of your Second Reading Speech, you refer to a letter you have written to the NT Chief Minister about the Territory legislation. Could you let me have a copy of that letter, please?</PARA>
<PARA> (2) You refer to a number of ``undertakings'' provided by Aboriginal claimants. Could you provide me with documents particularising the various undertakings which have been made? In particular, can you document the way in which these undertakings were made known to lessees of pastoral properties in the area of the claim?</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The 6/7 September Memorandum says that, upon enactment of the scheduling legislation the Commonwealth will then proclaim the June 1987 amendments. Page 7 of your Second Reading Speech says, after referring to the ``granting of certain parts of existing land claims'' that the 1987 amendments will be proclaimed ``at the same time''. My understanding of the September agreement is that the proclamation would be made upon enactment of the present Bill, that is, on the very same day. Since the words used in you speed give rise to uncertainty, would you be prepared to state in the parliament, exactly when the amendments will be proclaimed?</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Also, in relation to the proposed proclamation, is it the intention to proclaim section 23 (1) (ea)?</PARA>
<PARA> (5) What were the unintended consequences of section 74 (2) of the Act? What consultations in relation to these consequences were undertaken with the Northern Territory Government, and has that Government agreed with the decision not to proceed with the 1987 amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> (6) What is the purpose of new sub-section 4 (1aa)?</PARA>
<PARA> (7) With reference to the first paragraph on page 6 of your Second Reading Speech, could you inform me who, on behalf of ``the Commonwealth'' said what is there attributed to it, on what date and to whom. I must say that my own understanding of events is somewhat different. </PARA>
<PARA> (8) At the bottom of page 13, you suggest that certain proposed amendments relating to Coronation Hill had been ``misrepresented''. Can you tell me by whom and on what occasion(s)?</PARA>
<PARA> (9) There is a reference on page 14 to new clause 77C. Would you be prepared to accept an amendment to the effect that modification to descriptions of areas in the Schedule would be moderated or limited in their effect? I note that such an amendment would be consistent with your own advice to the Parliament that the provision is not intended to permit major changes to the area of land to be granted. </PARA>
<PARA> (10) Referring to the first paragraph on page 11 of your speech, can I assure those affected pastoralists who may want to put any matters to you that they will be considered and responded to before the Bill is finally put to a vote in the Parliament?</PARA>
<PARA> (11) Finally, may I draw to your notice a typographical error in clause 2 of the Bill. May I take it that the Government will be moving to delete ``Subject to subsection (2)'' when debate is resumed?</PARA>
<PARA> Your early response to these matters will greatly assist me in considering this measure which affects the interests of many of my constituents. </PARA>

His replies are needed if I am to make an appropriate contribution to the debate on this Bill. Even though I have reminded his office many times indeed that a reply is outstanding, I have had nothing but a whole series of brush offs.

<PARA> I understand you are anxious to receive a reply to your letter of 1 November 1989 judging from the contacts you and your staff have made with my office. I am puzzled by this activity because such endeavour has not previously been the hallmark of your representational activity to me regarding matters to do with Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Your letter of 1 November raises a number of queries relating to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 1989. My answers to your questions are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. I enclose for your information a copy of my letter of 19 October to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory which expressed my concern that the Territory's Aboriginal living legislation does not entirely reflect the words of the Memorandum of Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. As I indicate in my second-reading speech, I have sought undertakings from Aboriginal claimants in respect of particular pastoral properties in order that pastoral operations will not unreasonably be interfered with. I believe I have provided sufficient detail of these undertakings in my speech to the Parliament. The particulars of the undertakings as they relate to individual pastoral properties will be discussed with the relevant pastoral lessees before surveys of the scheduled areas are commenced. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. I am not in a position yet to tell you the precise date on which the amendments to section 50 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 will be proclaimed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw attention in particular to the pathetic reply which is, in many respects, an insult to the constituents of the Northern Territory, and the fact that it is only after prompting from Senator Robert Ray and Senator Tate-who, I appreciate, really do understand the problems in this particular area-that we have been able to solicit this inadequate reply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make sure that senators are able to assess for themselves the very serious effects that the Minister's actions will have in this area, particularly the lack of concern that he has shown to the pastoral lessees and the cattlemen of the Northern Territory. I am well aware that about a month ago these pastoralists made representations to the Minister, Mr Hand, in a series of very important letters that addressed the detrimental effects and problems that they saw with the Aboriginal Land Rights Bill. I seek to table those letters. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These letters are most important and will be invaluable to senators who need to make themselves familiar with the issues that have arisen. I believe this whole issue is graphically compounded when one looks at the press work during the last week or so of both the Northern Land Council and the Minister's office. One 3 December a media release was issued by Mr John Ah Kit, the Director of the Bureau of the Northern Land Council, in Darwin, with regard to this very important issue. On the same day a number of journalists in the Northern Territory telephoned me for comment on that press release, having been prompted and having had discussions with Ms Sharon O'Neill, the press officer from Mr Hand's office. It was very clear that Ms O'Neill had relayed to the journalists in the Northern Territory a false concern that the legislation was imminent last week-in fact, we were all well aware that it was not programmed for at least another week-and that there were some strange deals being done. Referring to Mr Ah Kit's press release, I would like to refute the following statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The cattle barons have instructed Senator Tambling to delay the legislation in the Senate and the Chief Minister is co-operating with this shameful strategy.</PARA>
<PARA>I consider that statement and the action of Ms O'Neill to be sailing very close to the wind. Both Mr Ah Kit and Ms O'Neill would be well advised to think again before they act in contempt of this Parliament in the way in which they have done. They will not get away with it just because they are doing the Minister's bidding. It goes without saying that the moral superiority that appears to be coming from the Minister's office or from the Northern Land Council should not go unchallenged. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a sensitive issue. The people of the Northern Territory, particularly the Aboriginal constituency, have a lot of interest in this legislation and in getting satisfactory resolution. I think it is terribly important that this type of privilege should not be abused in the way in which I believe it has been. I certainly ask honourable senators to take a very close look at the letters which I have incorporated now into Hansard tonight and also the documents which have now been tabled. They provide a very important resource for the debate which obviously will be of major concern to the Senate later in the week. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made another of his vote buying, basically dishonourable, statements. This one relates to Jervis Bay. In effect, the Prime Minister said, `I don't care what the facts are about whether Jervis Bay is a good or a bad place for the Navy to be relocated out of Sydney, but for political reasons I must placate the Australian Conservation Foundation and those members of the environmental movement who, rightly or wrongly, believe that Jervis Bay would be a bad place for the Navy to be relocated to'. This is a typical pre-election stunt by the Prime Minister. It is a typical pre-election purchase of votes. But I assure the Australian Conservation Foundation and anyone else whose vote is being bought by this device that the Prime Minister rarely delivers on these pre-election promises. There is no need for me to go into the great list of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is simply a disgraceful vote-buying decision because the environmental impact study (EIS) has not been presented to the Government and has not been to Cabinet. As I say, neither we in this chamber nor the Prime Minister know the consequences of not only the environmental impact study but also all the other studies that are being undertaken into Jervis Bay. We do not know what they show. But the Prime Minister does not care what they show. Today he made this statement:</PARA>
<PARA>Already the EIS processes have thrown up a number of serious environmental impacts that would be associated with a move of the Sydney based naval fleet to Jervis Bay. Moreover, the costs of moving the Sydney fleet base to Jervis Bay would be very high indeed. We will be putting alternative sites to environmental and economic analysis. But I can inform you that the Government is no longer disposed to move the Sydney naval fleet to Jervis Bay. </PARA>
<PARA>`Is no longer disposed to'. Is that a real undertaking by this Government? Is that a genuine, fair dinkum commitment by the Prime Minister? He does not say, `I promise you there will never be a naval base in Jervis Bay'; he just says, `The Government is no longer disposed to move the naval fleet to Jervis Bay'. This is a typical Hawke pre-election stunt which has proved in the past to be dishonourable and it will be dishonourable once again. It will be dishonoured, as they all are. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply want to remind the Senate that the EIS process, according to Mr Hawke, has thrown up a number of serious environmental impacts. I have seen the leaked letters that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) authorised to be leaked. He happily admitted so; he said that there was nothing wrong in doing it. The letters from the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories which were leaked in fact basically concentrate in their attacks on the environmental impact statement and say that that EIS does not look at alternative sites well enough; in fact, it does not look at them at all. To my knowledge, and to the Prime Minister's knowledge, by the way, the EIS itself has not thrown up these doubts. Honourable senators will notice his careful wording; `The EIS processes have thrown up'; in other words, letter from the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories ministry-no doubt suiting Senator Richardson's newly found green colour and his political nose, which is also turning green-are the motive for this pre-election stunt. As a result the multi-millions of dollars being spent on the EIS statement have already been spent by the departments concerned-the department responsible for construction, as well as the Navy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and others are doing research on this score. Why go ahead with it? Why should multi-millions of dollars of taxpayers' money be spent if a decision is going to be made by this Prime Minister on political grounds anyway that do not matter, that do not relate in any way to the results of any of those studies? That is the essential thing. The statement by the Prime Minister today, appropriately enough, addressed to the Australian Conservation Foundation, is based not on any factual evidence but on political necessity as he sees it. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go back and remember why this whole thing came up in the first place. Back in October 1985 the following was stated in a newspaper report:</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, said in Sydney yesterday that he had proposed the move-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, of the Navy from Sydney to Jervis Bay-</PARA>
<PARA>when he began using Kirribilli House . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We all know that he spends all of his time in Kirribilli House, at the taxpayers' expense, when in Sydney. It is supposed to be the facility available to visiting dignitaries, but they can never get into it because the Prime Minister is there all the time. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>he had proposed the move when he began using Kirribilli House, the Prime Minister's official Sydney residence. </PARA>
<PARA>That is how it is described these days. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hawke said: `I looked out across Sydney Harbour and it just struck me as an absurdity in this day and age that you should have a major naval concentration in the middle of a great populous city like this'. </PARA>
<PARA>It also interrupted his view. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Tambling says, he will not be in Kirribilli House for much longer anyway, so he does not care whether the view will be improved by the removal of the Navy base. I take that point. What is interesting is that Mr Hawke said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I hope, on the basis of the report that we get, we will be able to initiate the moves in the relatively near future. </PARA>
<PARA>What has changed since Mr Hawke decided that the Navy should go to Jervis Bay? One thing has changed-the green vote. Senator Richardson is buying it. He has convinced the Prime Minister to that effect. I remind the Senate that the statement that was made in November 1985 was a joint statement by the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the then Premier of New South Wales, Mr Wran. That statement related both to the armament facility and the rest of the Navy's bases leaving Sydney. It is interesting to note that Mr Hawke did not mention armaments in his statement today. It no doubt means that while the naval fleet base is not to be moved to Jervis Bay-or may not be, or he is not disposed to move it-he did not say how he was disposed in the matter of the armament facility, which is to involve a wharf on the north-eastern side of Jervis Bay, and a large armament facility in the north-western hinterland, in a forest area. There is no mention of armaments. So before people start saying, `Isn't it marvellous that the Government has blocked the Navy going to Jervis Bay?', they had better have a close look at what Mr Hawke's statement really means. There is no doubt in my mind that it does not mean any change in the proposal for the armament facility. I notice that in the November 1985 release Mr Hawke did not say, `The Government may move the armament facility', or, `Subject to examination, it may be moved'. The statement read:</PARA>
<PARA> The largest waterfront site occupied by the Defence Force in Sydney is to be relinquished . . . for civilian use in the early 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA>There are no ifs, buts or maybes-it is to be relinquished by the Commonwealth for civilian use in the early 1990s. The statement was announced jointly by Messrs Hawke and Wran at a news conference on board HMAS Adelaide, in Sydney, on 17 November 1985. The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The site, which covers about 260 hectares on the Parramatta River at Silverwater, presently houses the Navy's Newington, Ammunition Depot which is to be moved to the Jervis Bay area. </PARA>
<PARA>There are no ifs, buts or maybes. It was also mentioned in the statement that the Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, had established a study group in the Department of Defence to examine all significant issues and options associated with the relocation of other naval facilities in Sydney, including its possible timing. That, of course, was what led to the suggestion that the whole of the Navy's base operation move to Jervis bay. Let us see why Jervis Bay was chosen, as a result of this inquiry. The Navy's own document reads:</PARA>
<PARA> For operational reasons, a future Fleet Base needs to be within 300 nautical miles of Sydney's dockyard facilities. Harbours within the area are Port Stephens, Newcastle, Botany Bay, Port Kembla, Jervis Bay and Twofold Bay. </PARA>
<PARA> Port Stephens has no available land. Newcastle and Port Kembla harbours are too small to accommodate both Naval operations and merchant shipping. Botany Bay is fully developed. Twofold Bay is occupied by the woodchip industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Jervis Bay is the only port that can accommodate both the proposed Fleet Base and the Armaments Depot Wharf. </PARA>
<PARA>So now we see what it is all about. Twofold Bay was omitted, the Navy said, because it was already occupied by the woodchip industry. It looks as though Senator Richardson will get two for the price of one. He is going to knock woodchips out of Twofold Bay and whack the Navy in: strike two to Senator Richardson! That is all very useful except that it means that the Navy has been sabotaged by the Government and, in particular, by the Minister of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. When the announcement was made today, the Navy at operational level did not know about it. It had to be told by the media of this great decision. The Navy document continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Of all the locations, only Jervis Bay satisfactorily met all the strategic and operational requirements. A very thorough study was commenced to detail what moving Navy facilities to Jervis Bay would mean for the environment and people. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The relocation proposals have, since 1987, been studied under Department of Defence contracts by thirty groups of experts from different bodies, including the CSIRO, the New South Wales Fisheries Research Institute, and the ANU. The major areas of detailed study are:</PARA>
<PARA> * Social and economic impact</PARA>
<PARA> * Archaeology and anthropology</PARA>
<PARA> * Geology and resources</PARA>
<PARA> * Engineering and planning</PARA>
<PARA> * Meteorology and air pollution</PARA>
<PARA> * Landscaping and visual impacts</PARA>
<PARA> * Terrestrial ecology</PARA>
<PARA> * Marine ecology</PARA>
<PARA> * Naval requirements</PARA>
<PARA> * Risk and Hazard</PARA>
<PARA> * Acoustics and noise</PARA>
<PARA> * Public attitudes</PARA>
<PARA>Separate studies of these subjects have been done for both proposals. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement recognises that there are two proposals-that involving the armaments depot and that for moving the whole fleet. The document continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The combined effect of both proposals has also been studied. A good deal of time and effort has been spent so that nothing important has been overlooked. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the crux of the matter: two distinct, clear proposals have been made, yet when the Navy wanted its environmental impact study done on the armaments depot, the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories said that the study should be done for both proposals. In other words, the armaments depot proposal was submerged into that proposal for the whole fleet moving there. The result of that has been to delay the simple, straightforward proposal about moving the armaments depot to Jervis Bay and everything is apparently now up in the air. The assertion by the Prime Minister-not that it `may' or `would' be done, but that it `will' be done-is now apparently at some kind of risk, and we do not know what the merits or otherwise of the Navy's moving to Jervis Bay are, as neither we nor Mr Hawke have seen the environmental impact study. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Prime Minister gave an undertaking about the move in November 1985, his undertaking to the people of Australia was not in terms of the environment; it was this:</PARA>
<PARA> I give the undertaking that the changes that we believe ought to be made will not, in any sense, be made at the expense of proper defence considerations. </PARA>
<PARA>I would now like the Prime Minister to restate that commitment because it appears to have gone by the wayside. Now we have a commitment to a green vote instead of a commitment not to do anything at the expense of proper defence considerations. In the purchase of votes by the Government in the run-up to an election, that commitment has been lost. I condemn the Prime Minister, firstly, for the phoney nature of his statement, which does not provide what it appears to provide in terms of any sense of commitment; it simply says he is no longer disposed to move the fleet and says nothing about the armaments depot. The statement is based on a total lack of knowledge of the environmental impact. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, we have a desperate Prime Minister buying votes by promising or saying anything at all, whether it rests on facts or not. In this case, surely the people of Australia are entitled to see the environmental impact statement, to be able to participate in discussion on it, before this kind of unilateral and dishonourable statement goes out as a simple and disgraceful attempt to buy votes. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) ANOP Market Research was commissioned in October 1984 by the then Department of Home Affairs and Environment to conduct a community attitude research program to guide the formation of a national education campaign for the introduction of unleaded petrol. The final report of this survey was entitled Introduction of unleaded petrol in Australia: Report on Attitude Research Program February, 1985. ANOP Market Research was again commissioned in January 1986 by the then Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment to monitor the opinions of the motoring public and representatives of the automotive trade on unleaded petrol and the process of its introduction to the Australian market. The survey was based on the earlier benchmark research conducted by ANOP in November-December 1984. The final report was entitled Unleaded Petrol in Australia Survey: An Update of Research on Community Attitudes May, 1986.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) The cost of the 1984 survey was $44,000 and the cost of the 1986 survey was $24,000; (b) ANOP Market Research performed both surveys; (c) ANOP was selected by the Department of Home Affairs and Environment in consultation with the then Department of the Special Minister of State, the Australian Government Advertising Service and the State agencies following the submission of proposals from three agencies. ANOP was selected as their quote was within the budget proposed by the Department and their methodology and approach was closest to the Department's requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> ANOP was selected for the later survey because of their experience in carrying out the earlier benchmark survey.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The 1984 survey had three distinct phases. The first phase used qualitative research among general population groups with 12 group discussions in Sydney, Adelaide, Toowoomba and Bendigo. The second phase used 35 depth interviews with specialist target groups in Sydney, Melbourne and Bendigo. The third phase used a national quantitative telephone survey of general population target groups around Australia. The total study sample was 1500.</PARA>
<PARA> The 1986 survey consisted of 753 short telephone interviews amongst members of the sample previously interviewed in November-December 1984. Thirty depth interviews were also conducted with members of the oil and automotive trades in Sydney and Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Questionnaires are not available because of commercial in confidence reasons.</PARA>
