<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;(10.05)-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate my second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will enable people who are buying the house that they live in to get some tax relief on their home loan repayments. The Hawke Labor Government and the Liberal and National Party Coalition, give favoured tax treatment to people buying investment properties. In this Bill, the Australian Democrats will give much needed tax relief to Australians who are struggling to pay off the homes in which they live. </PARA>
<PARA> As I introduce this Bill, interest rates are high and rising. I am sure that in the future interest rates will fall, but nobody knows when. Maybe this will coincide with an election. Yet all Australians must realise now that in a deregulated financial system, interest rates can rise at any time and when interest rates on housing loans rise, many Australians suffer. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who have recently taken out mortgages find it difficult to meet the increased repayments. Some lose their homes. People who are about to purchase a home have to think again because they do not know whether they will be able to afford the increased repayments. Without doubt, deregulation has made it more difficult for many Australians to buy a home to live in. The same cannot be said for property investors who are encouraged to buy many homes with special tax concessions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has taken some action to reduce the pressure that foreign investors were putting on home prices in Australia. However, it was little action, very late. Following this action, foreign investors can and do buy property for development. </PARA>
<PARA> There seems to be something very wrong with this Government's housing priorities. Foreign investors can still push up home prices. Australian investors who already own a home and buy another one, two or three houses as investments, are allowed to claim the interest they pay on their home loans as a tax deduction. If they are making a loss on renting out their investment properties, they are allowed to deduct that loss against taxable income from other sources. The Hawke Government, with the support of the Liberal and National Party Coalition, reintroduced this mechanism of negative gearing to subsidise at the taxpayers' expense, the losses deliberately incurred by property investors. They are prepared to give a tax incentive to people who are not living in the houses they are buying. </PARA>
<PARA> It is sad indeed that the property investor can afford to pay more for a property than the person who is buying a home to occupy. It means that investors can outbid potential owner occupiers at an auction. This is the result of giving all the tax breaks to the property investor and nothing to the person buying a house in which to live. The property investor gets to deduct the loan repayments and to negatively gear. The owner occupier faces crippling interest rates which are still rising and meet the full home loan repayment with no tax relief. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill, therefore, gives the tax benefit to Australians who are living in the houses they are buying. Australians who are currently finding it very difficult to keep increasing the payments on their housing loans while their real incomes are falling, need this help to stay in their homes. Australians who are contemplating buying a home to live in need this assurance that they will get some tax relief. Otherwise as their mortgage commitments rise, they risk financial hardship and eventually being thrown out of their homes when they can no longer afford to meet their loan repayments. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence, this Bill is similar to legislation introduced by the then Treasurer and now Leader of the Opposition, as part of the 1982-83 Budget. In those halcyon pre-deregulation days, he was prepared to deal with the problem of high interest rates making home ownership unaffordable to average Australian income earners. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will introduce a tax rebate on the interest paid in excess of 10% per annum on the first $80,000 of a housing loan. Those buying the most expensive houses will not abuse the system because the rebate is limited to interest paid on the first $80,000 of a loan. We will also prevent the highest income earners from getting the biggest benefit by applying the same 40% rebate to all owner occupiers with home loans, irrespective of their actual marginal rate of tax. </PARA>
<PARA> In Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, the U.K. and the U.S.A., there is either full or partial tax allowance for interest on home loans for a principal residence. So this is not an unusual measure. Given the financial problems confronting Australians who have recently bought or who want to buy a home to live in, there is at least as great a need to introduce this legislation now, as there was when it was introduced in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of this measure will vary as interest rates fluctuate. Obviously if we get home loan interest rates down to 10%, there will be no cost. However, at current interest rates, the costs are likely to be in the vicinity of $200 million. </PARA>
<PARA> If my Bill to exempt from tax the first $2,000 of interest earned from savings accounts with financial institutions that lend for housing is passed, then money at 12% or less will become available to institutions that lend for housing. Interest rates on home loans will then drop and the cost of this tax subsidy will be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Can we afford not to help Australians buy their own home? Can we afford to have more Australians trying to find accommodation in less public housing because they cannot afford to buy a house? Can we afford to sell Australian houses to foreign investors and allow housing to become unaffordable to average Australians? Can the Labor, Liberal and National Parties afford to deny tax relief to people buying a house to live in when they have voted to increase the tax incentives for property investors to buy many houses?</PARA>
<PARA> I commend this Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is an omnibus bill for legislation administered within the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio. Its introduction will facilitate the passage of amendments to existing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Sugar Agreement Act 1985</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the repeal of the Sugar Agreement Act 1985 with effect from 1 Ju1y 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act prohibits the importation of sugar and sugar products as described in the 1984 Commonwealth/Queensland Sugar Agreement. The Agreement is set out in the Schedule to the Act. The Agreement expires on 30 June 1989. This expiry notwithstanding, the Act provides that the import prohibition extends beyond 30 June 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of the Government's Economic Statement of 25 May 1988, it was announced that the prohibition on the importation of sugar and sugar products was to be replaced by ad valorem tariffs of 35% and 25% on raw and refined sugar respectively, phasing down to 15 percent in 1992. The initial tariff rates are set to provide a similar level of support as the current import embargo and domestic price arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industry has sought a different form of tariff protection, and the government is considering that approach. In addition, the current domestic administered pricing arrangements will be terminated on the expiry on 30 June 1989 of the current Commonwealth/Queensland Sugar Agreement. The industry is considering the desirability of a future Commonwealth/ Queensland Sugar Agreement. The Government will introduce further legislation to implement such an agreement if necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The revised arrangements for the sugar industry are part of a package of measures based upon the outcome of the recent review of Government programs and policies within the primary industries sector, known as the Industry Development Review. </PARA>
<PARA> The Review outcome, which was comprehensive and far reaching, was considered by the Government along with proposals for general industry assistance reductions and proposals for reforming the business taxation structure. This had the advantage of allowing consideration of the important linkages between assistance measures for various sectors as well as their interaction with taxation measures. One of the strengths of the package of measures is that it is not restricted to one or two sectors of the economy. As a result, the outcome should be far more effective than the sum of the individual contributions by each sector. </PARA>
<PARA>Repeals of Live-stock Slaughter (Export Inspection Charge) Legislation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The introduction on 1 July 1988 of a fee for service charging regime under the Export Control Act 1982, for export slaughter floor meat inspection by the Commonwealth, has obviated the need for the livestock slaughter export inspection charge legislation, which related to a per carcase charge on the slaughter of livestock. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act 1977</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The first amendment to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act removes the requirement that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy approve orders to be made by the AMLC in relation to the export shipping of meat or livestock. The change is consistent with the Government's policy of deregulating the activities of Statutory Authorities and will permit the implementation of agreements which have been negotiated between the AMLC and shipping companies on a commercial basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The second amendment is to vary sub-paragraph 30d (1) (a) (ii) of the Act, pertaining to the time requirements for notification of motions to be put to the Annual General Meeting of the Corporation. This amendment removes an inconsistency in the Act which resulted from amendments made in 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>Wool Marketing Act 1987</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Wool is Australia's major export earner with exports valued at some $5.8 billion last year. To preserve the competitiveness of wool and its profile as a high quality fibre it is important that we maintain the confidence of buyers in the quality and description of the wool they are purchasing. </PARA>
<PARA> An important source of this confidence is the integrity of wool testing procedures. Nearly all wool sold at auction is tested for key characteristics which form the basis for a commercial assessment by buyers. This testing is done by testing houses on the basis of a sample. Buyers also visually appraise the wool for sale on the basis of a sample displayed on the show floor. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 127 of the Wool Marketing Act provides for regulations to be made in relation to registration and inspection of sampling sites and registration of wool test houses. An amendment to provide for the inspection of wool test houses is being considered by Parliament in these sittings. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there are no provisions for the registration and inspection of wool display areas and sample security areas which are central to the wool selling system. To ensure the integrity of the description of wool and the wool auction system, it is necessary to provide for registration and inspection of these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision is also required for the payment of fees in relation to registration and inspection costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Regulation-making powers providing for registration and inspection of wool display areas and sample security areas and payment of fees in respect of these, will therefore be inserted in section 127 of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments in this Bill have no financial implications for the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to Honourable Senators and present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to clarify and refine the technical operation of ``grandfathering'' and related provisions in the Broadcasting Act 1942. The relevant provisions were introduced by the Broadcasting (Ownership and Control) Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The Broadcasting (Ownership and Control) Act introduced new radio and cross-media ownership and control limits in the Broadcasting Act. Relevant prescribed interests or directorships held before 29 October 1987 were protected, or ``grandfathered'', from the operation of the new media ownership limits. The then Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Gareth Evans, had announced the Government's intention to introduce these new limits on 28 October 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to these ``retrospective'' grandfathering rules for interests held before the date of announcement, the Broadcasting (Ownership and Control) Act introduced ``prospective'' grandfathering rules. These rules provide protection where relevant radio, television or cross-media limits are breached because of minor changes in the service areas of commercial radio or television stations or because of changes in Census Count population figures within relevant service areas. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill improves the technical operation of the grandfathering and related provisions introduced by the Broadcasting (Ownership and Control) Act. A detailed outline of the amendments is provided in the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments are of a minor, technical nature and involve no change in the Government's policy toward the grandfathering of relevant interests. In essence, that policy is to protect legitimate interests acquired before the date of Government announcement or, where they were acquired after that date but only breach relevant ownership and control limits because of minor changes in service area populations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also allow the Minister to delegate his or her powers to make determinations for the purposes of relevant Gazette Notices that are necessary for the enforcement of the new ownership and control limits. These Gazette Notices relate to the populations within defined radio and television service areas as measured by the most recent Census Count results published by the Australian Statistician. The determinations made for the purpose of these Gazettals do not involve the exercise of any real discretionary power and are based purely on objective data. The delegation of these Ministerial determinations to an authorised officer in the Department of Transport and Communications will facilitate a more streamlined process for the updating of existing Gazette Notices. </PARA>
<PARA> The Broadcasting (Ownership and Control) Act has completed a process of reform of media ownership policies in Australia. The present package of radio, television and cross-media rules in the Broadcasting Act has also complemented the Government's policies for the provision of additional commercial radio and television services, particularly in regional areas. The `fine tuning' amendments in this Bill are designed to ensure that the technical operation of the Ownership and Control Act is more certain and equitable for those persons who have a legitimate claim to protection under the grandfathering rules. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA> There will be no additional costs to the Commonwealth in the administration of the provisions in the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems some time ago that I actually spoke to the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission Amendment Bill. My colleagues have made some comments about the length of time it has taken me to deal with this, but I would like to put it on the record that it is no fault of mine and I have not been involved in the debates in the intervening period. Opposition senators will be looking very carefully at what progress has been made in sorting out the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission through the passage of the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Hawke Government has assured us again and again that the accord with the unions is central to its economic policy. One of the key elements of the accord is supposed to have been non-wage benefits-the social wage. There is a list of these benefits which are the cornerstone of the accord. Up near the top of the list the Government was to take steps to ensure a safer workplace for Australian workers. To date-as I said in the first part of my speech-the sorry record of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission cannot have been much comfort to the families of the eight people a week killed at work and the 6,000 a week injured. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's failure to implement effectively such a central part of its deal with the Australian Council of Trade Unions indicates real ministerial incompetence. This was a Government priority. Yet the Labor Government-the so-called workers' government-has failed dismally in its promise to the workers of this country and, at the same time, Australian businesses and new enterprises are being strangled by excessive regulation. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate notes that, while the Bill seeks, inter alia, to streamline the administration of the Commission, the Government has failed to implement effective procedures to reduce the burden of excessive regulations on industry.''</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats to support the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission Amendment Bill and, hopefully, to make some observations which will contribute constructively to the debate on this very significant issue of occupational health and safety. It is also a very current issue in light of reports that have been tabled in the other place by the relevant Minister which highlight the magnitude of the challenge with which we are confronted in Australia concerning occupational health and safety.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's action in establishing the Commission was laudable. However, as others have observed, the outcome of that Commission to date has been extremely disappointing. In fact, there has been little improvement in Australia's abysmal record on occupational health and safety since the establishment of the Commission. The Bill addresses the fact that the challenge is still great, and that the machinery that was put in place has not yet proved to be effective. Indeed, some of the changes which will be implemented by this amendment Bill presumably are designed specifically to address that problem. Although on the one hand the Government has taken action, albeit it to little effect so far, I point out that, unfortunately, on this issue the Opposition has been, we believe, rather negative. If we look at the history of the Opposition's position, we see that it opposed the establishment of the Commission in 1983; it is now being critical of the Government, which has at least taken major steps towards resolving an extraordinarily serious problem relating to industrial relations and the health and safety of workers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats supported the establishment of the Commission. We certainly agree that its output and effect have been disappointing. We agree that it requires fine tuning, which was the expression used by the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) in his second reading speech on the Bill in this place. There is need for attention to be paid to the massive problem of occupational health and safety, and immediately a need to address the inadequacies or ineffectiveness of the Commission that was established to resolve those problems. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Patterson said, it is now a day and a half since the Senate addressed this problem. Perhaps it is worth taking a few moments to restate the magnitude of the challenge before us. Senator Patterson outlined it in detail in introducing the debate. However, it is worth returning briefly to see the magnitude and the relative size of this challenge to the Australian Government, the Australian people and workers in comparison with our overseas counterparts. The National Occupational Health and Safety Commission was established as a result of the Commission's establishing Act in 1985 with three broad objectives. These were to develop awareness of the problem; to provide a forum directed at resolving the problem; and to give a national focus for activities which would resolve the problem. The Commission consists of 17 members. Its name, in more popular terms, has been Worksafe Australia. It has two operational arms, the National Occupational Health and Safety Office which is responsible for policy and administrative support, and the Institute of Occupational Health and Safety which is responsible for scientific and technical research. The challenge of the Commission was to resolve a problem of enormous relative magnitude. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian workers are exposed to great health hazards and occupational danger. The figures previously cited clearly illustrate this. According to figures cited by the Minister, each year in Australia 550 Australians die as a result of work related accidents or illness, with over 300 of those deaths occurring in the workplace itself. The conservative estimate of the Minister was that these injuries and illnesses involve $6 billion of expense per year to the Australian economy and community. The cost of workers compensation alone is in the vicinity of $3,000m per annum. The magnitude of these fatalities and illnesses and the subsequent costs are clearly indicative of the size of the challenge which faces the Commission. The Commission has addressed itself to the challenge but, sadly, the judgments of those who have examined the performance of the Commission are that it has been relatively ineffective. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, Senator Patterson drew our attention to some of the limitations concerning the achievements and effectiveness of the Commission which were cited in the McKay report which was released by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) on 3 March 1988. The report reinforces the continuing magnitude of the problem. The report was critical of most aspects of Worksafe's activities and recommended 34 ways in which the Commission could be improved. Among the most significant criticisms of Worksafe made by the McKay report were as follows: an overall lack of progress in its first two years of operation, requiring immediate structural and organisational changes. Indeed, those structural and organisational changes are the essence of the amending Bill which is before the Senate at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The second major criticism was that there had been inadequate progress in heightening public awareness of occupational health and safety matters and developing strategies and priorities. The resolution of the dual problems of occupational health and safety lies essentially in the attitude of those in the workplace. The heightening of awareness and the re-structuring of those attitudes are the essence of success. The McKay report suggests that the Commission has fallen well short of heightening public awareness. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the report directs criticism at the inadequate coordination of occupational health and safety, particularly between the States and Commonwealth departments. As legislation comes before this chamber decade after decade we see both the advantages and disadvantages of belonging to a Commonwealth system. The interface between Commonwealth and State departments is a constant source of difficulty, not only in regard to policy but also coordination. It is apparent that the Commission has also fallen victim to those problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, the report cites inadequate development of standards, information and education programs and research activities under the National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety. This flows from the previous criticism. Uniformity of standards and information across State lines is absolutely essential to any rational addressing of occupational health and safety challenges. The report cites the inadequate representation of women on the Commission and its committees. This observation recurs in a climate which, theoretically at least, is addressing this imbalance, but which seems to be having very little effect. The lack of representation of women on the Commission and its committees occurs at a time when women are being increasingly represented in all aspects of the work force. It is a dimension of the whole question of equality in our community which we are seriously and, to a degree, effectively addressing. </PARA>
<PARA> The report cites communication problems between Worksafe and the outgoing Minister and his Department, although some of the blame is levelled at the latter two. The report cites a rigid adherence to tripartite principles at all levels of activity as being a restriction upon the effectiveness of the Commission. The negative impact of a Public Service model organisation on the Commission's activities was also cited as a major inhibitor of the Commission's effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> The McKay report tabled in March 1988 was very critical of the effectiveness of the Commission. It was essentially saying that the Commission has to get its act together; it has to streamline the processes. That is the essential thrust of the Bill which is before the chamber. The Democrats identify with that process and, of course, we will be supporting the Bill. In doing so, I point out that the essential emphasis of the Democrats is directed towards actual health and safety in the workplace as opposed to the creation of the bureaucratic structures which seem to be preoccupying the Government and have done so now for a period of almost four years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats' main cause for concern remains, therefore, the health and welfare of the work force and not the bureaucratic minutia associated with the creation of the Commission. In this regard, our possible criticisms of existing policies, both State and Commonwealth, would concentrate on the following: the inadequacy of resources devoted to inspection services-the main critique of earlier reports-and the laissez-faire approach which has been demonstrated in the lack of resources devoted to inspection; the failure of the Government to enact its oft promised legislation concerning Commonwealth employees and private sector employees working in the Territories; and the need to raise the Commission's funding to levels recommended by the interim Commission. This should be done at once. Presumably the Government is influenced by the recommendations in the McKay report that the funding levels should be raised immediately to the level prescribed for full implementation of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, our possible criticisms would concentrate on: the desirability of integrating programs covering occupational health and safety into the various workplaces; returns being promoted by the Department of Employment, Education and Training under the general banner of restructuring; and the apparent lack of commitment by governments, both State and Federal, to the occupational health and safety issues peculiar to persons engaged in home duties. Indeed, we have to acknowledge that many people are engaged in home duties. We have to address the fact that those duties, even though they are performed in the home, should be the target of the Government's consideration when it is considering matters of occupational health and safety. </PARA>
<PARA> We would also concentrate on the failure of government's to ratify relevant international conventions such as conventions Nos. 155 and 162. Both have been endorsed by the National Labour Consultative Council but they have not been ratified by all governments, State and Federal, in this country. There is an apparent lack of progress in getting workers to sit up and take notice of warnings from health authorities such as Worksafe. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats are saying that whilst we acknowledge the positive move by the Government to establish a commission, on the other hand, we cite the limited effectiveness of that Commission to date. We support the recommendations of the McKay report which says, `Put the structures right, get the act together, give it the appropriate level of funding and deliver to the community what is the stated intention of the principal Act and, indeed, the inherent intention in this amending Act'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats support the Bill. We support the observations in the amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill, as moved by Senator Patterson at the end of her speech. In essence, we are saying that the challenge is enormous, the initiatives of the Government are positive, but, as yet, ineffective. We support this Bill which is designed to render them more effective. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendment to the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission Act 1985. Senator McLean, for one, has spelt out very extensively the reason why this amending legislation is being introduced. The Government was certainly concerned that if we have established a national occupational health and safety commission it should function optimally. The review done by Mr Bernie McKay indicated that there was room for improvement. This legislation is one step in the implementation of the recommendations in his report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In passing, I pick up the point Senator McLean made about home duties needing to be considered seriously under the heading of occupational health and safety. Some of us who have actually spent extensive hours in home duties were very concerned that this be part of the deliberations of the Commission and the interim Commission when it was initially established. Despite our earnest pleas, let alone evidence that we led in this direction, home duties workers of this country are not at the forefront of the agenda of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (NOHSC). It may be that that is not ultimately the most appropriate place, but certainly a number of hazards of the workplace also occur in the home. One small example would be the use of chemicals. Many of the chemicals manufactured in industry under stringent health requirements are used in the home with nothing like the same regard given to information about proper use, handling and the like. </PARA>
<PARA> Two other comments of the McKay review of the NOHSC went to the very poor representation of women on the Commission at all levels. I hope to see that change. Certainly, the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Peter Morris, has given a clear indication that that would be his preferred way too. It is also interesting that the original structure of the Commission restricted the opportunity for the appointment of women to the Commission and its boards because of the definition of categories of people who would be eligible to take a place on the Commission or its committees. As much as possible, there will be new flexibility in this area too. </PARA>
<PARA> I take the point Senator McLean made about the lack of flexibility of some of the operations and a rigid adherence to a tripartite representation of any committees examining anything. The Commission certainly intends to proceed with more flexibility and with the appropriate people to do the designated tasks, mindful, of course, of all the requirements under the initial Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I came into the Senate-certainly in the first year or so of my time here-I was aware that the figures cited in the area of occupational health and safety were that something like 300 Australians died at work each year at a cost to the community of $4.5 billion. A year or so later the figure had increased to 400 people dying each year and the cost had gone up to $5.5 billion. We are now talking of 550 deaths per year and the cost is now over $6 billion. Some people, less modest, would put a figure of $9 billion on it. I do not believe this means that in that last six years many more Australian workers have died. What it does mean is that we are now approaching something like accurate statistics. One of the best contributions of the Commission to this point has been the establishment at least of the beginnings of national data collection and standards for adequate collection of data. </PARA>
<PARA> Comparing our figures of death and accident in the workplace with other countries is fraught with just the sorts of problems we have had in the past in this country. There is considerable difference between countries as to what is called an accident and what is called an injury. To this point, however, most people do know what is death. In some ways, that is why it has been the easiest to define, though cause of death has been very difficult to define. We have still to practise considerable caution when comparing figures from one country with those from another. Even allowing for considerable caution, Australia can take little comfort in its relativities, compared to similar Western technological countries. For example, in a work force of seven million in Australia the current estimated 555 deaths a year works out to an incident rate of 77 per million. That can be compared with figures produced in the 1984 International Labour Organisation year book of labour statistics, showing comparable rates of 22 in Sweden, 24 in the United Kingdom, 20 in Japan, and 37 in the United States. I urge a caution about comparison of those figures, because we are quite clear that there is not an exact comparison of matching data and descriptions of what is included in those figures. Indeed, of the 550 deaths of workers per year in Australia, about 20 per cent are incurred when travelling to or from work. They are not deaths in the workplace. It may well be that the extent of our coverage of workers for workers' compensation means that we rate higher because of the gains won by the union movement for workers over time. I am not in a position to say whether figures of that sort are included in figures from other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Even so, the number of deaths is far too high and, of course, inordinately costly. The first and worst cost is of human misery and pain, either for those who are injured or for relatives of those who die. To date I do not know anybody in the world who has put a dollar cost on that kind of pain, suffering and loss. We do have a dollar cost, however, on compensation payouts, on sickness benefits, on loss of productivity, and so on. That cost is roughly estimated to be over $6 billion in this country, which is certainly no cause for complacency. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that the Commission has done is that it has forced Australia to focus nationally on accidents and deaths in the workplace. Although this is largely an area of State legislation and State responsibility, this Government saw the importance of trying, first, to have a national perspective and a national focus for all the States, and, secondly, of doing such things as providing a place to produce the national data collection, advice and outlines for statistical collections. The Commission can also provide a central information pool for research and advice about practices, regulations and any further information which would be very beneficial to those involved in occupational health and safety across the country. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from all of the things which the Commission has achieved and the areas in which it has increased its presence and activity, it has also given a sense in Australia that there is a thing called `occupational health and safety' which has to be taken very seriously. We could not go into the next decade, century, or even millennium with the prospect of another Wittenoom-of people in their workplace being at risk of disease that is denied, avoided and unfairly disregarded for about 40 years, so that when the people responsible and concerned finally have to address the question of compensation, the Bill is inordinately high. </PARA>
<PARA> If pain and suffering and reasonable requests do not get onto the minds of people concerned, certainly the hard dollar cost will. It is sad that we have to wait so long until things cost so much that finally people will address it. But at least the economic argument is now helping to focus the minds of many people on occupational health and safety in a way which was not being done before and in a way which is very beneficial, as it occurs in association with the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission, and might be, in some ways, consequent on its establishment. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of leading some kind of evidence for that perhaps large claim, I would refer honourable senators to an article in the Mining Review in January 1989, headed `Managing occupational health and safety for the future-now'. It is a summary of a paper presented by a Mr N. A. Amos, Deputy General Manager, Australian Mines and Metal Association, at a seminar run by his association and the Tasmanian Chamber of Mines in September 1988. He points out the seriousness of occupational health and safety, the cost to industry and the important ways in which the proper allocation of responsibility can be made for health and safety in the workplace and costs can be reduced. His words are particularly pertinent to this issue. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>However, no matter which way you look at it, good occupational health and safety is synonymous with good economic management because accidents at work cost organisations and employees vast sums of money in terms of loss of productivity, waste and quality control. </PARA>
<PARA>I can only say hear, hear; we agree with that. It is precisely that point at which we have now arrived-that occupational health and safety is not a tinsel issue, it is not a frill or frippery on the side. Ultimately, it is a very hard and significant part of good economic management. It must be understood, appreciated and absorbed into the practices of the work force and management of any industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The article gives one considerable food for thought. What the writer says is consistent with what I said earlier about the difficulty caused by the lack of non-comparative national statistics. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> As the compilation of figures are not consistent across the country, I will use the NSW statistics as examples. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> The mining industry had by far the highest employment injury rate of any major industry sector, averaging 299.6 injuries per 1,000 workers, almost five times the average for NSW industry. </PARA>
<PARA> While only 2 per cent of the work force is employed in mining, the industry accounted for nearly four times that proportion in total accidents and workers' compensation costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Coal mining (the major group within the mining sector) has the second highest incidence rate of any individual industry in the State, averaging 291.2 workplace accidents per 1,000 workers. </PARA>
<PARA> Miners, quarrymen and related workers had the highest incidence rate of any occupation in the labour force, at 384.0 workplace accidents per 1,000 workers. This group also had the second highest incidence rate of diseases (principally industrial deafness) in the labour force. </PARA>
<PARA> The general trend is that the number of compensation cases in the industry appears to be falling while average period off work has increased. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to talk about the costs and the adjustments as a result of that, the average time off per injury or accident. Finally, he says:</PARA>
<PARA> Total workers compensation paid in the coal mining industry averaged $37m a year and in the rest of the mining industry $4.8m. </PARA>
<PARA> The average workers' compensation claim in the coal mining industry is for $5,400 and in the rest of the mining industry, $3,900. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, patterns are now emerging of workplaces which have higher levels of accident and injury and therefore clearly generate more costs in terms of compensation, sickness benefits, loss of productivity and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The article goes on to point out the importance of management, as well as workers, taking very seriously the question of occupational health and safety. While I might not agree with the final conclusions of this article about exactly where final responsibility resides for safety in the workplace, I think we can take considerable comfort from the fact that people of this ilk are now producing very thoughtful and informed papers about occupational health and safety. While this matter may not be in the consciousness of the full community, the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission is certainly becoming a body of which industry-both management and workers-are more and more aware. Indeed, any understanding of the accord between the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the trade union movement and this Government shows that part of the social wage of that accord includes the appreciation of the costs and benefits of occupational health and safety being properly managed. </PARA>
<PARA> I have just a couple of other points that I would like to make in this contribution. The six areas that have been identified by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission for the development of preventive strategies are occupational back pain, noise induced hearing loss, chemicals in the workplace, occupational skin disorders, mechanical equipment injury and occupational cancer. All of those are well under way and there are special projects and programs associated with them-first of all, of course, the necessary research and particularly ongoing research as to whether any changes in workplace equipment, processes, chemicals, et cetera, contribute to any of those six areas in a particular way. That information is then provided to the relevant workplaces. With that basic data and basic information particular strategies can be put in place to try to reduce any or all of the accidents and injuries occurring in the workplace. But essentially these six targeted programs look at the long term causes of illness and disease in the workplace rather than tackling the other very urgent matter of health and safety. For that reason I did ask the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) in this place representing the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) last year whether or not NOHSC would or is continuing to address questions of safety, accident prevention and first aid in the workplace as well as these preventive strategies. The Minister in reply said that he would be pleased to take that to the meeting of State Ministers to make sure that this matter was looked at. I have not heard yet if there has been a change in program or a report of what is currently in place, but I certainly hope that matters of safety and accident prevention remain very high on the list of occupational health and safety practices in any workplace. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not read a broad number of annual general reports but, if honourable senators look at the annual general reports from various large organisations or companies in this country, they will see that the reports have changed somewhat over the last few years and very often they include a section headed `Occupational Health and Safety'. I think that that is a matter of real appreciation of the companies involved that they are addressing this matter very seriously. I might add that I sometimes see reports under the heading `Affirmative Action'. I find it equally pleasing to see that in annual general reports matters such as occupational health and safety and affirmative action are now being addressed in a public way in a report to shareholders of any large company. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we have very excellent people in place in the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. They do very excellent work and it is being done, as it has in the past, by all sorts of people who are involved in trying to reduce the numbers of accidents and deaths in the workplace. Our figures show that there is no room for complacency. I do not think that, with the Commission in place, it is operating more and more at its optimal level and contributing to an increased awareness of the importance of all these steps and, in particular, to an increased awareness that taking these things seriously into account can contribute to very excellent economic management. The cost of death and accident is not only to the worker, but also to the whole society. Any company or organisation which loses a qualified person has to replace that person and has to pay compensation, sickness benefits and so on. I would be pleased to see this amendment in place while it is actually a mechanical or implementation change. It will allow the Commission to function more efficiently. I still think that it is part of an ongoing commitment to occupational health and safety and, hopefully, to reducing not only the numbers of deaths and injuries, but also the appalling cost to the individuals and society that the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission is aiming to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to detain the Committee in this area, but since at the second reading stage debate on this piece of legislation certain events have occurred which I think it is important for the Parliament and this Committee to know about. The Swedish Government has legislated for a five-year phase-out of the ozone substances included in Group I of Annex A of the Montreal Protocol of Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Legislation has been introduced into the United States House of Representatives and into the Senate also seeking a five-year phase-out. The Canadian Government has recently introduced legislation for a 10-year phase-out and, more recently, we have seen that ICI and Dupont have patented their CFC134A, CFC123 and CFC124, which are the substitutes available for CFC11 and CFC12, and they have officially announced that those materials will be available in commercial quantities in Australia by 1991. Only yesterday the Victorian Government issued a statement prepared by its Environmental Protection Agency calling for a five-year phase-out of the substances in Group I of Annex A of the Montreal protocol. I think it is important to put those matters on the record because they are matters which have become apparent only since that earlier stage in the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a couple of comments about clause 3, which is the objectives clause of the Ozone Protection Bill 1988. I indicate that the Opposition currently has an amendment to insert a new subparagraph (c) to clause 3 which is in the process of being circulated. I think everybody agrees that the timetable laid down by the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was laid down at the time on the basis of the best available scientific advice and obviously reflected many of the compromises which needed to be made between the desire to eliminate ozone depleting substances as quickly as possible and the practicalities and the timetable to achieve that. What we are discussing, which is raised both by the objectives clause and by Senator Coulter's amendment, is the question of the timetable and the practicality of setting a date which is a date in advance of the timetable set down in the convention and the protocol and expecting legislative adherence and enforcement of a date which is different from that established in the convention and the protocol.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When my amendment is forthcoming it will be seen that it deals with what I might call an exhortation to industry to proceed further and faster, rather than the approach Senator Coulter has laid down in his amendment, which is to specify compliance with certain requirements by certain dates. I think it is true to say that, in the course of the last couple of months, the amount of public discussion, the amount of information, the amount of public concern about atmospheric questions in general, both in terms of the ozone depletion effects and in terms of the greenhouse effects, have considerably moved up the international and the domestic political and environmental agendas. As honourable senators would know, during the next couple of weeks two major conferences are to take place. One is to take place in London, at which Mrs Thatcher will be indicating the concern of the British Government to bring about progress in this area, and one will take place at the Hague, which will deal with more global environmental and climatic conditions. It will be attended by representatives of a large number of countries at some of the most senior levels. I believe that it will be attended by various Australian Ministers. This is an indication of the extent to which this is now perceived as a major international problem. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, and despite what Senator Coulter has said, which by and large I accept, nevertheless there are continuing difficulties in establishing precisely what all the facts are at all times. Indeed, there continue to be considerable disagreements in some of the scientific publications one reads and some of the reports of those scientific publications as to precisely what the dimensions of this problem are. For example, an article appeared in the Australian on 14 February headed `Ozone reports are alarmist: scientist'. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> One of the world's leading atmospheric scientists says the effects of the depletion of the ozone layer to date have been insignificant-so small they cannot even be measured by the most sophisticated equipment available. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Paul Fraser, a member of NASA's Ozone Trends Panel . . . and a senior researcher at the CSIRO's division of atmospheric research last week told The Australian that alarmist reports in the media, such as those claiming there was an increased possibility of contracting skin cancer at Australian beaches, were nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA>On the other hand, four days later a report in the Sydney Morning Herald quoted information from Washington. Under the heading `Shock finding on ozone layer', the report stated in part:</PARA>
<PARA>A group of scientists just back from the North Pole is expected to announce tomorrow that the ozone layer is deteriorating more quickly than had been believed. </PARA>
<PARA>Frankly, one is constantly faced in this place with the dilemma of sorting our responses to conflicting scientific claims. I think the only sensible thing to do is to approach it more inclined to the worst case scenario than to the best case scenario. To that extent one basically has to work on the proposition that even if the problem turns out eventually not to be as bad as we had imagined, nevertheless it is advisable in terms of public policy to put in place all necessary controls and conditions as if it were going to turn out to be as bad as we suspect. Yesterday's Australian newspaper, under the headline ` ``Hole'' theory in skin cancer rise', says in part:</PARA>
<PARA> Tasmania's proximity to the so-called Antarctic ozone hole has been suggested as a cause for a significant and unexpected rise in the incidence of malignant melanoma, a potentially fatal skin cancer. </PARA>
<PARA> The Menzies Centre for Population Health Research says the incidence of melanoma in Tasmania is far higher than expected and has increased by 90 per cent for men and 106 per cent for women between 1978 and 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>The speculation is that this is somehow related to the depletion of the ozone layer, a point which I have made in a number of previous debates in this place. It is true that action is being taken on a worldwide level. As Senator Coulter rightly pointed out, action has been taken in Sweden. However, my understanding is that Swedish legislation has a fairly significant number of exemption provisions, including major exemption provisions for ozone depleting materials used in the dry cleaning process, which use a substantial amount of such substances. Action has been taken in Canada. Announcements were made within the last couple of days in Victoria, and indeed, a call was made in January of this year by the European Commission, which is not a body noted for its adherence or commitment to the protection of the environment, for urgent action. The Commission prepared a report for the European Council of Ministers analysing the problem related to the greenhouse effect and presenting a series of conclusions, one of which is that the emission of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) should be virtually eliminated by the year 2000 through a revision of the Montreal Protocol. I believe that that is a somewhat more realistic date in terms of approach than that put forward in the amendments which Senator Coulter has foreshadowed in terms of dates, but we will come to those specifically. Nevertheless, I think that the year 2000 is a reasonable proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to address just two other matters in terms of the objectives clause which is currently before us. First may I say I think that we tend to be somewhat niggardly in giving due regard to the industry for the steps which industry itself has taken to deal with this problem. As we know, there are a number of joint government-industry working parties which have been quite hard at work setting strategic goals and analysing alternatives both in terms of substance alternatives and technology alternatives. By and large the industry gives me the impression that it is working seriously to bring about a major reduction in the amount of ozone depleting substances which are manufactured and used and is seeking to cooperate with government and State authorities to ensure that there is maximum activity on their part to bring about reductions in the problem that we now face. For example, on 24 January the Association of Fluorocarbon Consumers and Manufacturers announced its commitment to a nationwide system for the recycling of CFCs. The Parliament should be aware of and give credence to those important initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I want to make on this clause relates to the objective dealing with the reduction of exports. This is a vexatious and difficult problem. I will draw attention to one area where Australia is increasing its exports of CFCs-in the pharmaceutical sector. Recently Glaxo Australia Pty Ltd was given an award by the Federal Government for the program which it had undertaken to expand exports. It has received quite substantial financial reward and incentive from the Government because it has managed to boost its exports by about $352m. Of that, approximately $100m is from the export of materials which are major users of ozone depleting substances-namely, the asthma sprays to which I have referred on previous occasions. As a consumer of those products I have declared my self-interest in the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear that the amount of CFCs which will be used in pharmaceutical products will continue to increase. It will increase from about 170 tonnes to about 260 tonnes in the course of the next few years. The amount of material which is being exported in terms of the propellant used in asthma products is of significance. I do not in any sense think that there is anything wrong with that. I believe that eventually there may be some way of replacing the current CFCs which are used in pharmaceutical products. At the moment I am persuaded that no viable alternative is available. Under those circumstances it would be an advantage to have the manufacture and export, and, in some cases, the re-export through Australia, of some of these substances as a far better alternative than expecting countries, particularly those in this region, to have to rely upon producing their own CFCs, because that is the only reasonable alternative for them. If they are not able to source them from places such as Australia, they will be forced to start becoming producers. In my view, they will not be able to produce under the same degree of regulation and control and the same sorts of environmental constraints as those which are currently imposed on producers in Australia. We must be aware that from time to time this policy runs in a slightly contrary fashion. The Government, on the one hand, seeks to reduce Australia's export of such substances, and indeed puts it in the objectives clause of a Bill, and, on the other, it pays substantial financial incentives for people who are increasing the volume of export of such substances in a particular item. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the objectives clause can be strengthened. When we deal with Senator Coulter's amendment to subclause 3 (a) we can discuss that matter further. I simply say in relation to Senator Coulter's precise amendment to subclause 3-adding the use of the term `use' together with `manufacture' and `import'-that that is not the essential purpose of the Bill in terms of controlling internal or end use. I do not think that it sits well with the rest of the provisions of the legislation. I am not altogether sure of its practicality and it is for that reason that the Opposition will not support Senator Coulter's amendment to subclause 3 (a). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too believe that a great deal has happened since the second reading debate on the legislation. As I indicated then, I am not satisfied that the legislation as it stands will achieve what it is intended to do. I believe that what the Government proposes has been largely superseded all over the world. The United States has gone past us and other countries have made more effort. To say that Australia is in the forefront of action is not quite correct. It is claimed that Australia is responsible for 2 per cent or less of the emissions and, as such, there is little we can do. I do not agree. I do not accept that because the figure is only 2 per cent-if, in fact, it is-we should not do what we can to eliminate it. I believe that the figures are not good enough. I believe that the suggestions Senator Coulter brings forward may well be achieved and surpassed long before even the times he has in mind, as pressure from the public generally builds up and as industry's attitude generally begins to take effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government should seize the opportunity to do a lot more about coordination of the research. At present many people seem to be racing about doing all sorts of things in a fairly uncoordinated way. Although I personally, over a period of months, have been trying to find lists of the research that is being carried out, who is doing it and what specifically they are doing, as yet I have been unable to obtain such a list. I do not know whether the Government has any idea what is going on either within its ranks or in industry and academia generally. </PARA>
<PARA> The Institution of Engineers, as I noted from yesterday's news brief, is calling on the Government to assist in this coordination and to bring the ends together. I realise that it will be attractive to the Government to try to keep this as an election sweetener and before long there will probably be big announcements as to all the things the Government intends to do. But this is not an election matter or a party political issue. It is a matter on which we all have a good and sensible agreement. I would like to see this placed on a much more useful basis than has happened until now. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) is able to give the Senate some assurances on coordination and funding, if we can be given an assurance that Cabinet is likely to reverse the decision in which it refused to allocate $1m for these purposes, we will be much more satisfied. In the meantime, I agree with Senator Puplick that to strengthen the intentions of the Bill is a start. The details in the Bill may all prove to be overtaken by history before very much longer anyway. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will not be accepting Senator Coulter's amendment, largely for the reasons outlined by Senator Puplick. I do not see that the amendment achieves anything. Certainly clause 3 (b) refers to use and that covers part VI of the Bill. In regard to the rest of the Bill we are not looking at regulating use and therefore the Government is opposed to the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to respond to some of the comments which have been made in the last few moments. I understand that Sweden has gone further than we have. In fact, it intends to cut consumption by 50 per cent by December 1990. Sweden will cease using chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) for all new products by 1994, but of course there is a heavy list of exemptions. There are 10 for industrial use and 20 for medical uses. Those exemptions in Sweden will apply for three years. I doubt very much whether the Swedish Government will be able to stick to that timetable. </PARA>
<PARA> On the subject of medical exemptions, Senator Puplick referred to the recent announcement by Glaxo Australia Pty Ltd of a considerable increase in its exports, which included exports that contained ozone-depleting substances largely in the medical field. Obviously one has to be careful in examining any exemption. Glaxo takes the view that 7 to 9 years is the likely time frame from when a product is first identified as a possible substitute and as likely to be safe for inhalation. After identification it has to go through a long period of testing. Naturally enough, it has the potential to cause harm if it is not rigorously tested. After that exhaustive testing there is evaluation and approval by government regulatory agencies. Judging by experience in the United States, that is not a quick affair. It can take a long time, and in Australia it can take even longer. Naturally, governments are cautious about approving the use of anything for inhalation for obvious reasons. I do not know whether the Glaxo claim of 7 to 9 years is precisely right. One could perhaps quibble with it, but I doubt very much that one could get it down to three years. For that reason I do not believe the Swedish legislation is workable. I shall be very surprised if there are not some changes to it. If one looks at what the Australian States have done, one sees that Tasmania produced a Bill on this subject. I note Senator Archer's comments about how we should not use these things as election sweeteners. Looking at the Tasmanian experience, one would have to suggest that that legislation might have been exactly that because the list of exemptions is enormous. </PARA>

However, the plan went astray as soon as the question of the mill came up when the Tasmanian Government botched it so badly that it backed off. The list of exemptions in the Tasmanian legislation is much bigger than the Bill. It robs the Bill of all power and potency. The difficulty is that one can either stand up in the chamber here and be hairier-chested than the next on this and related matters, or one can attempt to deliver something which industry believes is workable and with which it will comply. It must be remembered, with everything we debate here today, that the protocol itself will be re-examined next year in 1990. I do not believe that this legislation will be the end of government regulation in this country, but that it will be just the beginning. No doubt after we have had that re-examination of the protocol next year, we will almost certainly be changing legislation here. But with whatever we do I would hope that we can continue to take industry with us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Industry has cooperated in this process remarkably well. Industry came together with the Government in three working groups and I think that industry has behaved responsibly. I made a speech in Washington in December, which received a lot of coverage here. It was not mentioned that I praised Australian industry in this respect. I said that in respect of ozone there had been a great deal of cooperation, an obvious acknowledgment that industry was producing a harmful product and a willingness on the part of industry to do something about it. After exhaustive discussions with industry, I believe that this Bill represents a workable option-a way of getting through. But it is a beginning and not the end. If there are to be concerns about whether Cabinet will be dealing with the matter, it will be dealing with it very shortly. I can never pre-empt Cabinet decisions, but I am confident that we will make announcements soon which, I say to Senator Archer, will be a long way in advance of an election. Hopefully, they will ease some of the honourable senator's concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> When I spoke previously I should have tabled a revised explanatory memorandum and correction relating to the Bill. The correction largely relates to a renumbering, which caused me some confusion as I read my brief on Senator Coulter's amendment which was actually to the old Bill. I hope that we can sort that out this morning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was somewhat amused by the remarks of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories a moment ago. The copy of the Bill I picked up this morning was the older version. I had to run out and get a newer version even to read my own amendments in the correct order. I hope that others are not confused. Picking up on what the Minister has just said about industry cooperation, I was surprised to hear such remarks coming from the Minister and also from Senator Puplick. Industry is clearly trying to make a virtue out of being hit over the head by a piece of four by two, because that is what has happened to it. For years people in the environment movement have been pointing to this problem and particularly to the need to remove chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) from aerosol applications. Industry has consistently and vigorously resisted those moves. Now, when the inevitability of the removal of those substances is staring industry in the face, it attempts to make a virtue of it and says, `Are we not good fellows? We have removed these materials from aerosols'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Similarly, industry, unless it is pushed very hard, will resist the removal of chlorofluorocarbons from all other applications until it is pushed. When it is pushed hard enough it will find that alternative technologies and gases are available. Yesterday an Australian Associated Press release stated that Mr Roberts of Afcam had said that Afcam had been working with the Federal Government on the issue and had made significant progress. My goodness, it has certainly made significant progress! It has significant let-out clauses in relation to exports and it has a weaker Bill than it should have got. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick mentioned pharmaceutical applications and pointed to the fact that Glaxo Australia Pty Ltd had been given an award by the Government because it had increased its exports. But I point out that in this Bill we are looking at an increase of exports above the 1986 level of 1,500 tonnes as a starting point and that pharmaceutical uses are expected to plateau at 2,600 tonnes, a minuscule proportion of the total amount which the Federal Government is allowing as an initial increase in exports before it begins to reduce exports.</PARA>
<PARA> As on previous occasions, Senator Puplick has attempted to smear the evidence in relation to the need for reducing the release of chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone depleting substances by saying that there is some doubt about the data. I say to him and to other honourable senators that there is no doubt about the data. Very often journalists are unable to understand scientific material and draw wrong conclusions. Let me give an example. Senator Puplick used the example of an increase in skin cancer rates in Tasmania and pointed out that some people have claimed that that increase may be due to decreases in ozone and increases in shortwave ultraviolet light. Those who work in the area know very well that a long latent period separates the mutation which occurs at the single cell level from the appearance of a clinical cancer. No person understanding this could possibly claim that increased cancer rates in Australia observed now are due to decreases in ozone and increases in short wave ultraviolet light which have occurred in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably, if we have an increase in skin cancer, it is due to the fact that recently people have gone around with less clothing. In recent years women, in particular, have uncovered themselves rather more. Consequently, we see an increase in skin cancer. Senator Puplick mentioned malignant melanoma, the third most common cancer in women. He pointed out also that the increase in this disease in women has been greater than the increase in men. The evidence is clear that there may well be an increase in skin cancer but one cannot in any sense tie that to the subject we are discussing this morning. </PARA>
<PARA> We are looking at long term consequences. We are looking at scientific data which clearly indicates that, once chlorofluoro- carbons get into the stratosphere, they have very long resonance times, that they are catalytic in their breakdown of stratospheric ozone and that, therefore, the breakdown will occur over a very long period. The observed fact that the breakdown of stratospheric ozone so far has not been very large is no assurance whatsoever that this matter is not urgent. The decrease in stratospheric ozone as a consequence of the effect of CFCs in the Antarctic, recently observed in the Arctic also, is particularly worrying because of another effect. The greenhouse effect, which is a consequence of an increase in a range of gases in the atmosphere, increases the temperature of the lower atmosphere and decreases the temperature of the stratosphere. We do not need a very large decrease in the temperature of the stratosphere before the Antarctic phenomenon could be observed on a much wider scale. There have been substantial decreases in stratospheric temperature as a consequence of greenhouse gases. </PARA>
<PARA> One cannot stress too strongly that this is an urgent matter. We need urgent action. I stress that the timetabling foreshadowed in my amendments is achievable. I draw attention to the fact that the first year's reduction, or first two year's reduction, is achievable right now by the removal of ozone depleting substances from aerosol use and other non-essential uses. Several years will pass before a 20 per cent reduction per year will bite at the level where we will need to institute the alternatives, both in terms of gases and technology, in industries such as refrigeration and air-conditioning. By that time I am certain that those technologies will be available and achievable. However, without the passage of strong legislation companies will simply dilly-dally and not get on with the business of developing alternatives. I believe that the alternatives are available and that the technology could be put into place. But that will occur only if we put very strong legislation into place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was heartened after hearing Senator Coulter's comments about the rise in skin cancer in Tasmania. Being a person who lives in southern Tasmania, when I read the article that Senator Puplick referred to which stated that the so-called Antarctic ozone hole had increased cancer rates, I was quite alarmed. Recently, two of my very close friends passed away because of melanomas. Quite a few of us down in Tasmania are rather concerned about the effects the hole in the ozone layer is having. But if, as Senator Coulter has said, there is a long latent period, perhaps we can take heart and consider the research that has been done recently, reported in the Hobart Mercury, regarding the wearing of reflective clothing, and that type of thing. I make the point to the Minister that I hope the Government continues to fund research. We have seen cutbacks in research for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) over a period of time. It has been very vocal in its call for more money for research. The CSIRO has been researching this ozone hole for some 30 years. It was only in 1979 that it discovered the hole over the Antarctic. Some people at our end of the nation thought that it was caused by some of the spy flights that Senator Gareth Evans authorised over southern Tasmania. Of course, we now know that this ozone hole has increased not only over the Antarctic but also the Arctic. A lot of research is being done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand a submission for special funding for the continued research into the greenhouse effect and all those other climatic changes is before the Government at the moment as well as before Senator Richardson and Mr Barry Jones. As Senator Coulter said it is not just the ozone layer that is causing concern but also the greenhouse effect. I urge the Government to take a much wider view of this situation by providing more money for scientific institutions and universities around the country. I hope that these organisations can put more evidence into the debate. We are well aware that the Bureau of Meteorology has made major contributions. It is important to point out that the five ozone monitoring stations in Australian territory and the work that is performed by the staff at these stations is enabling the scientists around the world to increase their knowledge of the ozone areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Government to increase the funding to the CSIRO for these studies. I commend the great contribution that has been made by Dr Paul Fraser and Willem Bouma at the Division of Atmospheric Research. They are doing great work. As the Minister already indicated the industry itself, the Association of Fluorocarbon Consumers, made a generous donation of $25,000. I hope that government and industry cooperate to continue research and that we can get some more positive action on something that at the moment is only being looked at by scientists and those types of people rather than getting a combined effort from industry and all those other people who are being affected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support Senator Coulter's amendment and to make a couple of brief points. It is interesting that this committee stage debate is being quite significantly participated in by a number of our Tasmanian colleagues. The Tasmanian Government has been an initiator in terms of this kind of legislation although it is imperfect. This amendment attempts to strengthen this legislation, as do all of Senator Coulter's amendments, in particular, the question of use and its relationship to the Government's legislation. I draw attention to the fact that it is not just the Australian Democrats, including Senator Coulter, but also our Tasmanian colleagues who are saying somewhat tentatively to the Government that we need to go further by way of this amendment and certainly by way of others to this legislation, as well as the Victorian Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have not heard any response from the Minister or from the Government to the Victorian Government's paper which was released the day before yesterday. Certainly as paragraph (7) of the policy statement of the Victorian Environment Protection Authority's (EPA) draft option paper and policy paper on ozone depleting substances says, regulations should be based on end use controls. If it were appropriate in the committee stage, I would ask the Minister if he had a response to that. It is probably not appropriate; I suggest he is here responding to Senator Coulter's amendment. The paper put out by the EPA, which was endorsed by the Victorian Government and specifically by Minister Roper, does most of the things which the Democrat amendment is attempting to do. This amendment and subsequent ones will speed up the phase out process, will make it far more effective and will strongly acknowledge the inadequacies of the Montreal protocols. This is what the whole series of Senator Coulter's amendments is attempting to do. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Minister has explained to us that he wants to bring industry with him-there has to be some sympathy for that view-it is interesting that this senior Labor Government is further down the track or would prefer to go further down the track. It is important to make that point. This is a process which Senator Coulter's amendment is beginning. It is saying that this legislation that the Government is putting forward is not adequate. I want to inject into the debate that it is not just the Australian Democrats who are saying that but also some colleagues in the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will make a couple of points on this. I understand that the Victorian Government put a draft paper out yesterday saying what it would like to do. I have had a look at that along with-one has no doubts-a great many other organisations and individuals. I will sit down with the Victorians and give them my views. There seems to be developing here some assumption that the legislation that we have before us today is being surpassed and overrun everywhere. That is just not right. I think Senator Archer said earlier that the United States of America has already gone further than we have. That is not true. All that has happened is that a small group of senators is sponsoring a Bill which may one day get debated. It may one day get passed or amended and they are a long way off doing anything. Honourable senators should not try to adopt a Bill or make the Government adopt a position when we deal with practicalities which requires almost total backdown.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Tasmanian legislation was introduced on 8 September last year. On 27 September the first of the backdowns began over the proposal for the labelling of products. That was backed off two weeks after the legislation was introduced. The idea that all aerosols would be banned by 1 October was dropped immediately and extended to 31 December. We then had the list of exemptions which were published in the Government Gazette on 25 January this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give honourable senators an idea of how far the Tasmanian Government has backed down. Everything is exempted if it is a control substance; if it is applied in refrigeration and cooling. It includes: furniture and furnishing manufacture; application of packaging material; dry-cleaning products; veterinary treatments; industrial uses; scientific or measuring equipment; or the use of propellants and aerosols. Virtually every single use that we have for chlorofluorocarbons or ozone depleting substances is exempted under the Tasmanian legislation. In other words, there is a piece of legislation which has absolutely no force on anything. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to be placed in a position-I am sure the Opposition would not want to see us placed in a position-where we have that sort of farce. Rather, we have to go for the art of the possible. I hope that the art of the possible includes a further revision of the protocol next year and no doubt the further revision of our own legislation in the light of whatever happens with the Montreal protocol. That is what we should all be about. I never decry bringing industry along. It will be much easier to implement legislation if we have checked with industry first and we know can be done. Of course, we have given industry a nudge. I doubt very much that it likes everything that is in this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Senator Coulter's amendment to the Ozone Protection Bill 1988 and the other amendments he will introduce later because I believe that the Government's Bill should go further than the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer in reducing the production, export and consumption of ozone depleting substances, as recommended by numerous Australian experts and community groups, as well as the European Commission in its recent report to the European Council of Ministers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of the Government's Ozone Protection Bill, as outlined in the explanatory memorandum, is to `provide for additional controls, beyond those required by the Protocol, which will further reduce the usage, and emission to the air, of ozone depleting substances'. The Montreal protocol itself sets maximum limits for production and consumption of ozone depleting substances, presumably to encourage signatory countries to strive for the lowest limits possible of ozone depleting substances. I am concerned that the imperative to achieve this is not embodied in the Government's Bill without the inclusion of the amendment put by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> The Montreal protocol of 1987 was an enlightened and commendable achievement for 53 nations to agree upon. However, it was arrived at without the benefit of the surprise observations of the spring of 1987, when ozone levels over Antarctica were reduced by 50 per cent. They also could not know of more recent evidence of ozone thinning over the Northern Hemisphere. As an exercise in international cooperation on the global environment, the Montreal protocol is a milestone. As a target limit for the production and consumption emission of ozone depleting substances, the reduction schedule prescribed by the Montreal protocol is, sadly, obsolete. The implications for human health of such drastic reductions in the ozone layer have been widely discussed. The impending disaster for Antarctic and Arctic ecosystems has received less attention. Massive extinctions can be expected if the trend is not reversed in time. </PARA>
<PARA> I have grave concerns about self-regulation and search for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) substitutes by industries where global climactic patterns and biological food chains are at risk. Some manufacturers, according to the Alliance for a Responsible CFC Policy, reported in the Sydney Morning Herald on 26 November last year, regard as the `horrific consequences' of the diminishing ozone layer the impact on the industries themselves-not fear for our children's cancer rates or the global food chain, but fear for their profits. Conventional economic accounting systems, with which companies and governments like to run the country, have set the short term costs of ozone depleting substances, such as those used in refrigerators, air-conditioning and aerosols, much lower than available alternatives and the development of new ones. The long term environmental costs are not included in the corporate reckoning of ICI Australia Ltd, Atochem Australia Pty Ltd or Australian Fluorine Chemicals Pty Ltd, all CFC manufacturers in Australia, until political pressures force them to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986, the United States Environmental Protection Authority concluded that several adequate substitutes for ozone depleting substances were available, but the absence of a market for the higher priced alternatives had slowed their manufacture. We now learn that ICI claims to have acceptable alternatives ready for market by 1991. The level of community concern about the threats to human health and the global environment from ozone layer depletion has been underestimated, as has the community's willingness to switch to higher cost alternatives where necessary. I am not referring to essential medical use of these substances but to such innovations as the CFC-recycling units for refrigerators, which have been developed recently in WA, and to aerosol substitutes. </PARA>
<PARA> Further reductions in the essential use categories can be achieved by stringency of essential use criteria, as recommended by the Victorian Government in its recently released draft policy statement. Its suggested mechanism of an independent body to evaluate exemptions from CFC bans, comprising medical representatives from government, consumer and environment groups, should be taken on board by the Government. The Victorian Government's policy document points out other areas where Commonwealth Government initiatives could encourage reductions in ozone depleting substances, including the use of financial incentives and disincentives and public, professional and industry educational programs. We clearly cannot afford to ignore any initiatives which may assist in addressing his threat to life on earth. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to consumer awareness, industry advocates should be heartened by the results of a Frank Small and Associates Pty Ltd survey published in October 1988, which showed the breakdown of the ozone layer was rated the most significant environmental problem for which something had to be done soon in all major cities in Australia. It also showed that 52 per cent of the people surveyed are changing their usage and buying behaviour because of this concern. Unfortunately, the generous export quotas provided for in the Government's Ozone Protection Bill will delay the accounting of environmental costs for the development of alternatives to, and a market for, ozone depleting substances. As Senator Coulter pointed out, this constitutes a major deficiency in the Ozone Protection Bill before us. </PARA>
<PARA> Using 1987 as the reference export year, instead of 1986 as prescribed in the Montreal Protocol, allows exports to continue at unacceptably high levels. Australia must set an example or, at the very least, follow the examples already set by Sweden, and now indicated by Canada, the United States, and Senator Coulter's amendments, in curbing this selfish and dangerous global experiment. The suggestion by the office of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) in its reply to the Australian Conservation Foundation's criticisms of the Ozone Protection Bill was that if Australian-based CFC manufacturers were prohibited from supplying CFCs according to `existing legitimate business arrangements', developing nations would build their own. This bears a disturbing resemblance to the argument for supplying uranium to the nuclear market. The bottom line in the rationale of `If we don't do it, someone else will get the profits and, anyway, it provides an avenue of influence over its final use' is sales, not the survival of the planet. </PARA>
<PARA> As a developed nation which has enjoyed the luxuries of such inappropriate technology as ozone depleting substances, we have an obligation to develop and share appropriate and sustainable alternatives with the developing nations in our region. I am therefore pleased to be able to endorse the amendment moved by Senator Coulter and those he has foreshadowed, which will have the effect of an annual reduction in the use of ozone depleting substances of 20 per cent per year from 1986, leading to a total phase-out by 1996. That is what we must do if Australia is to act responsibly in a non-partisan way for the benefit not only of the Australian community but also the global community. </PARA>
<PARA> Having heard various Liberal senators express dissatisfaction with the Government's Bill, I hope that they and their colleagues will also support Senator Coulter's amendment. It is not good enough for the Minister to say that this will be just the first stage of restricting the use of ozone depleting substances. Why not do the job thoroughly now? Why not lay down the timetable clearly so that industry will be pressured to research and market alternatives right now. Time does not permit the luxury of taking a slow path to progress. This is urgent. I do not want to argue whether other countries have gone further, how many exemptions they allow, or whether their legislation can be effective. That is just an excuse for not doing a thorough job right now. Let us be courageous and a model for other countries. Let us prove that the job can be done. The public has picked up on the urgency of the situation, as the Frank Small and Associates poll shows. The people want alternatives and they are prepared to pay extra for them. The legislation should not fall short of the will of the people to deal with this urgent situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Page 2, paragraph 3 (a), line 8, leave out ``and''. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Page 2, after paragraph 3 (b), add the following new paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA>``and (c) to use the best endeavours to encourage Australian industry to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) replace ozone depleting substances; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) achieve a faster and greater reduction in the levels of production and use of ozone depleting substances than are provided for in the Convention and the Protocol,</PARA>
<PARA>to the extent that such replacements and achievements are reasonably possible within the limits imposed by the availability of suitable alternate substances, and appropriate technology and devices.''. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said in my earlier remarks, the general agreement across all sides of the chamber is that we ought to be moving further and faster than the Convention and the Protocol provide. This, without attempting to specify dates and precise figures and arrangements, is an exhortatory provision to go into the objectives clause of the Ozone Protection Bill which recognises that we ought to take steps to encourage Australian industry to replace ozone depleting substances and, in fact, that we ought to go at a faster and greater pace than is provided for in the convention and the protocol, but also recognises that there are limits and they are the limits of the availability of suitable alternative substances and the availability of appropriate technology and devices. I have already agreed in the earlier debate that in some areas the replacement of existing CFCs by alternative substances is in fact quite practical. We know, for example, that the possible substitution for the use of CFCs 11 and 12 by substances such as HFC-134a and HFC-123 is clearly already on the agenda, but equally, as I said earlier, I am persuaded that the immediate alternatives for things such as the propellants used in asthma sprays and pharmacological products are not at the moment available. Similarly, we know that alternative devices in areas such as refrigeration and dry cleaning are available, but again there are certain limitations in terms of genuine cost and actual efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already made the point about the pharmaceutical industry and about the particular problems which have arisen there. I made the point about Glaxo Aust. Pty Ltd and its export program. I believe that this paragraph, proposed to be inserted in the objectives clause, is simply a clear sign that the Parliament believes that industry should be encouraged to move at a faster and greater pace than the minimum pace provided for in the protocol and in the convention, but recognises that it cannot be done overnight, nor can it, I believe, be done by tying it to specific dates in the way in which Senator Coulter's proposed amendment would have us believe. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been raised with me that perhaps there is some problem about going further and going faster. However, I draw attention to two comments on this: The first is, quite clearly, that in the explanatory memorandum under the heading `Outline' the Bill is described in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the obligations which will arise when Australia ratifies the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, and to provide for additional controls, beyond those required by the Protocol, which will further reduce the usage, and emission to the air, of ozone depleting substances. </PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, I look at a press statement which was put out on 14 December 1988, on the stationery of the office of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson), headed `Ozone Protection Bill 1988. Reply to the Australian Conservation Foundation's criticisms' which says, in part:</PARA>
<PARA> However, other constitutional powers are used in the Bill to go further than the Protocol requires. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, the Government makes a virtue in its explanatory memorandum and in its public statements of going further than the protocol requires. Indeed, I have acknowledged that and have congratulated the Government on taking that stand. I therefore believe that some of the ingenious and almost persuasive legal and constitutional arguments that were put to me about this matter are not sufficiently persuasive for the Opposition to fail to pursue this amendment and, therefore, I offer to the Committee this particular amendment, which is certainly exhortatory; it will certainly sit well in the objectives clause of the Bill. It is not intended to specify dates or figures but is simply a statement on the part of the Parliament that industry should be encouraged to move at a faster rate and, indeed, to achieve progress in greater quantum amounts and recognises that limits are imposed by the availability of appropriate alternative substances and appropriate technology and devices. </PARA>

<SPEECH PAGE="289" SPEAKER="Coulter Sen J.R." NAMEID="TF4" PARTY="AD" ELECTORATE="SA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME><ELECTORATE>(South Australia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(12.18)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have no objection to these amendments. They do, in fact, approach the next amendment which is on my circulated list of amendments but, as Senator Puplick has pointed out, they do not mention particular phase-out dates or targets. I foreshadow that if this amendment were to be passed the next amendment on my list, paragraph (a) of proposed new clause 3a, might disappear because it is essentially aiming at the same purpose. That would still leave proposed new paragraph 3a (b) of my amendments to be debated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In speaking to Senator Puplick's amendment, I again stress that in my view industry will not achieve a faster phase-out, it will not achieve the implementation of the alternative chemistry, or the development of the alternative technology to use the alternative chemicals unless it is put under very strong pressure. I do not see that an exhortatory clause by itself will achieve that objective. I see nothing wrong with putting the clause in if it indicates a direction, but I strongly suggest that my proposed new clause 3a (b) should go on after this. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is worth reading into the record the statement made by Mr Christopher Hartley, the Marketing Manager for ICI Australia Ltd. The other day, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Samples of ozone-friendly fluorocarbon, HFC-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, a substance not containing chlorine in its molecule-</PARA>
<PARA>would be available in Australia this year for testing, and commercial quantities would be available from 1991 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So the achievement of the faster phase-down rate is possible and, as I have already indicated, I believe that the first year to a year and a half will be achieved even under the Government's legislation because of the removal of CFCs from non-essential uses such as aerosols. So that one need not have any compunction, at least for several years, before the 20 per cent figure which I would like to see written in here begins to bite into those so-called essential uses. I think it is worth stressing also that we had refrigeration in this country long before the CFCs were developed by General-Motors Holden's Ltd in 1928 and we still have refrigerators in this country which depend upon alternative technologies. The conventional gas and kerosene refrigerators use technology which still uses a solution of ammonia. </PARA>
<PARA> In using the word `essential' we need to be aware that we are saying that, in the strict sense of that word, there are no uses of chlorofluorocarbons which are absolutely essential. There is a sliding scale of desirability of use which has to be weighed against the consequences of continuing to use and release these substances into the atmosphere. Clearly, we have made a judgment that the use in aerosols is the least essential. Next after that we have a range of uses as solvents in foam blowing agents and, probably, last, we have the use in refrigeration and air-conditioning. But even there, strictly speaking, the use is not essential. So I support Senator Puplick's amendment and, in doing so, I draw attention to proposed new clause 3a (b) in my circulated amendments. </PARA>

<PARA> (2) Page 2, after clause 3, insert the following new clause:</PARA>
<PARA>Additional objectives</PARA>
<PARA> ``3a. In addition to the objectives specified in section 3, the objectives of this Act are:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to eliminate, not later than 31 December 1995, the manufacture, use, import and export of substances listed in Group 1 of Annex A of the Protocol contained in Schedule 3 of this Act; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to eliminate, not later than 31 December 1998, the manufacture, use, import and export of substances listed in Group 11 of Annex A of the Protocol contained in Schedule 3 of this Act.''. </PARA>
<PARA>It may be that, in rewording this Bill if the amendment is accepted, it can be added on after Senator Puplick's adopted amendment. I am suggesting that, in addition to the objectives which have been specified in clause 3, this further objective be included:</PARA>
<PARA>to eliminate, not later than 31 December 1995, the manufacture, use, import and export of substances listed in Group 1 of Annex A of the Protocol contained in Schedule 3 of this Act;</PARA>
<PARA>That extends the remarks that I made in response to Senator Puplick's amendment to write very specifically in the objectives what I hope the Bill will set out to achieve; namely, a complete phase-out on the use of these substances in that list by 31 December 1995. I believe that it is appropriate to put that objective right up front in the Bill. I think it sets a target; I think it gives effect to the additional material which Senator Puplick has just had written into the Bill; and I believe that, without such a strong objective and the clauses that would flow from it, industry would not do its job adequately. I have spoken to that at some length already. </PARA>

Of course, it is dependent upon other amendments which Senator Coulter will move later in the debate and which the Government does not support. In response to these continuing references by Senator Coulter and others to what needs to be done to industry: industry has been conducting the largest toxicity testing program ever on chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Industry-and that includes ICI Australia Ltd-is already building plants that will produce the alternatives. Even though the lifetime studies on the toxicity of these alternatives are not yet completed the short term ones have been. I believe that industry is playing its part. I do not believe that, at this point in time, we need to do any more to convince it of the need to go down this path. The Government cannot support this amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

It concerns clause 4 of the legislation, which is the clause intended to save the operation of laws of a State or Territory. The Minister will recall that during the second reading debate on this legislation I mentioned the concern that had been expressed by Tim Moore, the New South Wales Minister for Environment, to the extent that his initial reading of the clause was that, instead of striking down any State legislation which might deal with this matter, there was a potential problem in that the legislation might prohibit a State from going further within its own area of jurisdiction than is provided for in the Commonwealth legislation. The Minister will be aware of correspondence which was addressed to him from Mr Moore and the question I raised during the second reading debate. It would be useful, for the record, to allow the Minister the opportunity to respond to the concerns raised at that time and on behalf of the New South Wales Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Clause 7 deals with definitions. However, the definitions appeared only through a reading of the later clauses of the Bill. As one read through the Bill, a number of things were unclear. One had to discover them further along, as in the case of the ozone depleting effect, which is defined in clause 11. One came across that almost by accident. Further on there were other definitions which one had to work out for oneself. For instance, `quota' was used but not defined. We find `quota activity' defined in the Bill but not `quota'. I have attempted merely to bring forward those matters which are defined later in the Bill to make the Bill clearer, and also to write into the Bill definitions in those areas where the Bill is deficient. There is, so far as I can see, nothing in these amendments that is in any way inconsistent with the Bill. They simply aid in clarification of the Bill and make it easier to read for people starting at page 1 and working their way through. </PARA>

Normally when I approach a Bill I go to the definitions and look through them to find out what the various terms mean, and if one has to go to a later part of a Bill to find a definition that in itself is messy. It is far more appropriate to bring that definition forward, even though it occurs later in the Bill. It makes the Bill much easier to read and easier to understand.

<PARA>The amendment seeks to substitute a period of five years. There are two reasons for doing this. First, there is a clear connection between the desirability of having licences running for only five years and the move which the Australian Democrats are attempting to make to phase chlorofluorocarbons out of use entirely over a period of five years. It would make little sense to give a licence which would remain in force beyond that period. That becomes a substantial reason within the context of the amendments which we have attempted to move already and amendments we shall be moving later. Beyond that, even if those amendments are not accepted, we believe that there are substantial reasons why the period of licence should be reduced.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will be aware that on 8 and 15 December 1988 I raised the subject of allegations of corrupt practices among some Commonwealth Bank officers and allegations that the Federal Police had failed in their duties in relation to investigating these matters. The Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) answered questions on both days and I tabled seven sworn statements and other documents in relation to six cases. Since then my office has received several hundred phone calls alleging malpractice and I have selected in excess of 70 cases which I believe are credible. The number is growing daily. I have interviewed many constituents, a significant number of lawyers, accountants, journalists, bank managers and employees and ex-bank managers. I am convinced that we have a problem of major proportions which I am compelled and duty bound in the public interest to pursue vigorously and determinedly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two things have happened in recent years which have dramatically changed the ethos of banking and given rise to widespread allegations of malpractice and corruption. The deregulation of banking has intensified competition dramatically and triggered a surge in credit promotion. This has been accompanied by an extraordinary increase in indebtedness which has rendered individuals, companies and their businesses highly vulnerable. It is alleged that this has created the opportunity for unscrupulous bankers to engage in malpractice and corruption. The evidence suggests that there has been a serious erosion of the fundamental fiduciary relationship in banking. Allegedly there have been at least three parallel dimensions to this problem: first, that which involves asset stripping of specifically targeted businesses; secondly, inducement of clients into foreign borrowings which have rendered businesses vulnerable because of exchange variations; and, thirdly, premature foreclosure on rural property holdings. The allegations suggest a serious national problem warranting a major and immediate Senate inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> I will briefly address each of these areas of alleged malpractice. First, there is the targeting of certain businesses and asset stripping. I have previously outlined variations on this method. Healthy and prospectively profitable businesses are targeted. By manipulation of cash against debts, businesses or individuals are rendered vulnerable. Takeovers and/or foreclosures occur or bankruptcy is induced. It is alleged that either banks themselves acquire the assets or other prearranged recipients acquire them at ridiculously favourable terms. There are many variations on these techniques and additional opportunities for malpractice occur at the receivership and liquidation stages and among agents who service bank needs in these stages. To date allegations have been directed only at the Commonwealth Bank, but of course the allegations relate to most major banks and other financiers. I now seek leave to table 20 additional cases which typify the alleged malpractices.</PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The substantiating documents are all signed statements, but they vary in form. These cases include millionaires and battlers and are drawn from several States. In most cases very comprehensive documentation has been provided to substantiate the general allegations made. All signatories are willing to expand upon their statements, and I table the cases of Baines v. State Bank of New South Wales, Baker v. Westpac Banking Corporation, Bourke v. State Bank of New South Wales, Brandon v. Commonwealth Bank, Cheesman v. Elders Rural Finance, National Australia Bank Ltd. and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., Chick v. Commonwealth Bank, Colchek v. Commonwealth Bank and Delonga v. Commonwealth Bank Finance Corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The list of cases continues: Doughty v. State Bank of New South Wales, Douglas Hill v. the Commonwealth Bank, Frame v. Commonwealth Bank, a series of statements from Galli in relation to various banks, Gardiner v. Commonwealth Bank and the Commonwealth Bank Finance Corporation, Hamod v. Westpac Banking Corporation, O'Connor v. National Australia Bank Ltd, Porter v. Commonwealth Bank, Rigg v. Commonwealth Bank, Salmon v. National Australia Bank Ltd, Smith v. National Australia Bank Ltd, and Somerset v. National Australia Bank Ltd. The cases and statements of Bourke, Rigg, Salmon, O'Connor, Somerset, Smith, Colchek, Chick, Cheesman, Douglas Hill and Hamod are especially relevant. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the second aspect of the allegations, namely those commonly referred to as the forex or foreign loans debacle. I seek leave to table statements and a summary of cases provided by a Sydney lawyer, Paul Galli, who has in the past three years handled 300 cases of people who are alleged to have been victimised by banks in what is now referred to as the Swiss loans scam. He cites eight typical cases and provides the relevant statements of claim filed in various supreme courts. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He describes the forex loans scam of this period as `the darkest chapter in the history of Australian banking'. In essence, Australians, individuals and companies, were enticed into foreign loans quite deliberately and therefore into a situation which was fraught with danger. Many were then left to founder in bankruptcy when fluctuating exchange rates caught them out. His statements are very potent indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to the third aspect of these allegations, namely premature rural foreclosures. Rural indebtedness, of course, has historically been a problem requiring special consideration and in the past it has even given rise to the formation of special banks. In an intensely competitive context where the fiduciary duty of banking has been seriously eroded, the difficulty of rural indebtedness has become a disaster. I seek leave to table the Mitchelmore report to the New South Wales Parliament in 1987 which documents the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am led to believe that the legislation which flowed from the Mitchelmore report to the New South Wales Parliament has passed both Houses of the State of New South Wales but has never received royal assent. I draw the attention of honourable senators to the fact that as recently as last week in Port Lincoln, South Australia, a public meeting attracted 1,000 farmers and others and formed the Eyre Peninsula Action Group to save the properties of colleagues whom they allege had been victimised. They have picketed their banks; they are door-knocking their communities and have initiated a process which they call `Bankwatch'. This is a superb example of a community responding to what it sees as a huge and significant problem. We are seeing bank borrowers associations and foreign exchange associations forming to gain mutual support and to fight the causes of those who allege to be victimised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The social costs of such malpractices are enormous. These people are not only broken financially but are also often emotionally, physically, maritally and domestically broken. Some of the actions described to me and cited in these statements have been extremely ruthless. Because these people are broken financially, most of them cannot fight in courts, but some can and have. Many of the cases tabled are now before supreme courts and one is before the High Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We are faced with a problem of enormous consequence. I have today given notice of my intention to refer the matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs for a major Senate inquiry to be reported to the Senate by the last sitting day of 1989. To facilitate the assembling of prima facie material, the Australian Democrats have today established a Democrat bank hotline through which the public may offer initial support of this process. I will be asking further questions of the Minister for Justice today and I will continue to advise the Senate of the developments on this matter in most weeks. </PARA>

There is insufficient information-this is certainly what Professor Johns was saying to me three months ago-on which to draw hard conclusions. I think that, on balance, that was his view. That view has been supported to some extent by comments made quite recently by Mr Mohl, of the ANZ Bank on the AM program yesterday or the day before. The view has been expressed in part, I think, by Mr Ray Block, the Chairman of Dominguez, in an article I saw in a newspaper the other day. As I said, in previous discussions with Professor Johns his view was that there was insufficient hard data to draw any definite conclusions.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is interesting to note that in a paper that has been circulated on this weekend's forthcoming women's tax convention, the Country Women's Association has gone on the record as supporting government subsidised child-care. Over the last six years, because of the Federal Government's strong commitment to child-care, significant awareness has built up in the community as to the importance of government subsidised child-care.</PARA>

I would like to assure a number of citizens in the ACT that the Senate's recent motion about the construction of a child-care centre facility simply reiterated the procedures that the Government has already put in place.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Devereux raises a question which has been of concern to me over the last 12 months. There has been a recognition in the community that financial counselling groups and facilities are limited by a number of factors. The case workload they carry and the scarce resources they have have led to a basic problem that credit education and research is a function that is often not addressed as highly as it should be. There is also a recognition in industry, as well as in consumer groups, that training for financial counsellors and finance industry staff could be improved to address a basic problem in the community, that is, providing consumers with more information on their credit facilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Basically the underlying acceptance by consumer and industry groups at the consumer forum held in Canberra last year was that a greater degree of credit education and research would be of great assistance to all involved in this field. There was also an acknowledgment by industry that it felt it had a role to play in this area. Since the forum, which I said was held in the middle of last year, there have been a number of talks between my office, the finance industry and consumer groups with a view to setting up some sort of mechanism for the development of credit education and research. In fact, the ultimate goal is to set up a foundation for credit education and research.</PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that in recent days we have reached agreement with a number of industry organisations and consumer groups to do a number of things in this area. The industry groups involved are the Australian Bankers Association, the Australian Federation of Credit Unions, the Australian Finance Conference Ltd, the Australian Association of Permanent Building Societies and the American Express corporation. They, together with consumer groups, have agreed to form part of a working group to investigate the establishment of such a foundation.</PARA>
<PARA> The task force has been given an amount of $40,000 by industry and is expected to report some time in the middle of this year. Basically the task force will be looking at two major factors involved in the establishment of a foundation. One is the preparation of guidelines to cover key areas of training, credit education and research. The task force will also look at the determination of funding targets for the maintenance of the foundation for a minimum of three years.</PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to thank those in the industry as well as those in the consumer movement for the cooperative way in which they have approached this matter. A number of key individuals in the industry have very keenly taken on this project and they should be given credit for their cooperation. As a government, we welcome this positive response from all sides of the consumer credit area, particularly industry. Underlying it all is an acknowledgment that by working together the sorts of problems that governments alone would find it almost impossible to address can be addressed with the cooperation of industry and consumer organisations.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal with the fourth part of Senator McLean's question first. As honourable senators are aware, the question of regulation of the financial sector is one for my colleague the Treasurer. I suggest that Senator McLean direct this part of his question to the relevant Minister. I turn now to those parts of the six-part question which come within my portfolio responsibilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, Senator McLean asked a very broad question about whether the Federal Police is currently investigating any allegations of improper conduct by officers of Australian banking institutions. Whilst the answer in a general sense is yes, as all honourable senators are aware, the broad charter of AFP responsibilities means that it is almost impossible to give a detailed and definite response to this question in its widest interpretation. Investigations into breaches of various Commonwealth laws may involve the examination of allegations of improper conduct by officers in banking institutions. For example, drug investigations which include following the money trail quite obviously would require examining banking records. It is a very general question and I do not want Senator McLean to misunderstand my answer yes.</PARA>
<PARA> In the second part of his question, Senator McLean specifically referred to alleged corrupt practices detailed in documents tabled by him in the Senate last year. I am advised that the Federal Police is not investigating any aspect of those allegations. The reason will become clear in a moment; it has already done so.</PARA>
<PARA> In the third part of his question Senator McLean talks about the so-called forex or foreign loans scam. The AFP has been unable to provide me with information on this matter without specific details identifying to what Senator McLean was referring. For example, I refer to an article in today's Sydney Morning Herald headed `Forex loan bank ``advised sales and patience'' ' which reports on a Federal Court hearing. It apparently relates to a civil action seeking redress on bank advice. If any of the documents tabled earlier today by Senator McLean-which, of course, I will refer to the AFP-relate to this alleged foreign loans scam, I would expect that I would receive advice from the AFP on whether there is evidence that Commonwealth criminal offences are involved, as opposed to the breach of fiduciary relationship and so on which Senator McLean has spoken on in the media.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the other parts of Senator McLean's question, I resent the suggestion in the latter part of his question that I have changed my attitude to the matter concerned since I indicated to the Senate on 8 December, not 15 December, that I took these matters seriously and would give them my personal attention. In context, my undertaking there was in response to his assertion that the Australian Federal Police had failed in its duty to investigate certain matters. Of course, I took the matter seriously and as a matter of course referred all the material to the AFP. On the same afternoon of 8 December, I directly raised with Commissioner McAulay personally Senator McLean's allegations that these matters had for several years been known to the Federal Police and that it was claimed that it had failed in its duties. I received briefings as a result, the substance of which I conveyed to Senator McLean privately. He nevertheless asked a series of questions on 15 December, in response to which I was able to refute his allegation that the AFP had perhaps deliberately briefed me in a grossly inadequate way, to use Senator McLean's terms. Indeed, Senator McLean must have been satisfied with my response on that day, because he did not renew the allegations on any of the many remaining sitting days of that session, nor has he since.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no evidence in the history of my dealing with this matter, as known to the Senate, and it is not queried by Senator McLean therefore, which should provide any basis for his now more obnoxious imputation that I may have colluded with the Managing Director of the Commonwealth Bank that the AFP should confine its investigation of the matters raised by Senator McLean last December in order to take the heat out of the issue because I wanted the issue defused. This allegation against me is made in Senator McLean's press release on 13 February after he had received my press release of the same date which quite properly told the public the following:</PARA>
<PARA>Australian Federal Police investigators have found no evidence to back up allegations made last year concerning improper activities by employees of the Commonwealth Bank.</PARA>
<PARA>I made it clear in that press release that the AFP had reviewed a number of matters raised in the Senate in December, yet Senator McLean chose in his press release to state the following:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister has referred to a single case which is even now the subject of litigation in the New South Wales Courts and was only one among those I raised in the Senate in December.</PARA>
<PARA>It will be clear to honourable senators that I did not refer merely to a single case, I was responding to advice to me from the Federal Police that it was currently unaware of any evidence which would support charges relating to improper activities of employees of the bank. The conclusion reached by the AFP came after examination of all the documentation tabled and the allegations made by Senator McLean.</PARA>
<PARA> The Managing Director of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, Mr Sanders, wrote to me on 22 December 1988 making the obvious point that Senator McLean's references had been most damaging to the reputation of the bank and its officers. He asked that in the interests of justice and the bank I resolve matters and make a statement as quickly as possible. Of course I was happy to make such a statement as soon as possible, but only in the light of a fully considered examination by the AFP of the matters raised by Senator McLean. I was informed of the result of that examination six weeks later and had no hesitation in informing the public, including Commonwealth Bank customers, that there was no evidence to support Senator McLean's allegations.</PARA>

<PARA> I was, however, disturbed by one aspect of the Four Corners program which singled out Wang, one of the partnership companies. I just make the point that Wang has a very sound record in discharging it obligations under the partnership program and commenced in the partnership with a very substantial offsets credit. Wang is working with some two dozen local companies in Australia to achieve its partnership targets. The recent first annual audit or review showed it had over achieved in both exports and research and development investment. Therefore, the Government is very pleased with Wang's performance and believes that it is fully committed to the partnership program.</PARA>
<PARA> Since the Four Corners program, my Department has received reaffirmations of commitment to the partnership program from most of the partners. Some of the local beneficiary companies have also expressed concern about the way in which their activities were presented on the program. Last Friday, at a meeting of State and Federal industry Ministers, the program also received the support of all Ministers. I am pleased to say that in the past week, following the Four Corners program, two further partnership agreements have been signed with Pyramid Technology (Australia) Pty Ltd and GEC-Plessey Telecommunications.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not received any information at an official level, although officials from the Department of Finance did contact the Queensland Treasury this morning requesting information about the allegations which have been made in Queensland in the last couple of days. However, I have received from the Queensland Department of Primary Industries a copy of a report which is presumably leaked from the drought secretariat and is addressed to inspectors of stock. That report does tend to confirm some of the worst fears and suspicions I have had for some time about the administration of drought relief in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Notwithstanding Mr Ahern's comments on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation this morning that this is just a political stunt, there is very clearly recognition among those people who are actually administering the scheme that there are some very serious problems. First, the document notes that drought assistance is available only to properties affected by an extreme lack of rain. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Properties exhibiting drought symptoms due to mismanagement are not experiencing a natural disaster.</PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on to describe some things which are neither natural disasters nor mismanagement. They are clear rorts of the system. I table the document, but I do draw attention to a number of highlights within it. Pressure is exerted for early isolated drought proclamation declarations for mismanagers, `get-in-for-your-cut' people, and 36aaa tax users. IDPs are given earlier, increasing the frequency of drought declarations and the provision of assistance for non-disaster periods. There is no check on the stock carried and some IDPs have been issued when it is subsequently found that properties are stocked at twice the normal stocking rate.</PARA>
<PARA> Once one of a number of properties under the same ownership is drought declared, it provides a means for laundering stock between properties to maximise subsidy payments. Once a number of IDPs have been issued, pressure develops to have the whole shire drought declared. People get kudos by pushing for an area declaration and drought assistance is thereby extended to non-droughted properties. Since 1964, when existing drought declaration procedures were adopted, many areas have been drought declared on an average of once every three years and have remained drought declared for 50 per cent of the time. In other words, normality is defined as drought, which is standing truth on its head.</PARA>
<PARA> Agistment movements are subsidised for trips of 1,500 to 2,000 kilometres when alternative reasonable agistment is available within 500 kilometres. A so-called agistment movement from a droughted to a non-droughted property under the same ownership can trigger a whole series of reagistment movements to other properties under the same ownership. The physical identity of stock can change along the way. Some properties return twice the number of stock that went to agistment on the transport subsidy.</PARA>

It is headed, `Subject: Drought Assistance Anomalies'. I have already tabled this document, so the honourable senator will be able to read it. I would be surprised if there were much revealed in there which Senator Boswell did not already know. Normal sales are disguised as drought sales and restocking subsidies are paid for normal restocking movements. That provides a double dip on the subsidy. And so it goes on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion, I want to read a quote about the select few who have been receiving the benefits of the bulk of these rorts:</PARA>
<PARA> It can be seen that the pickings are worthwhile for those prepared to have a go. Indications are that most people are honest . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate, even in Queensland most people remain honest. It is those who operate the system who seem to be under suspicion. To continue the quote:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . and many do not make subsidy claims for all eligible movements. In a drought when $15m was paid out in subsidies, 84% of subsidy users received subsidies of $5,000 or less and the remaining 16% of users received 76% of all subsidy payments. The 16% tended to be larger properties who have more opportunities to work deficiencies in the system.</PARA>
<PARA>If I may add to that, these people probably have better contacts in the National Party. Not surprisingly, since it was prepared within the Queensland bureaucracy, this report does not address the question of the occasions on which the administering committee has properly applied the rules and guidelines and then subsequently had those decisions overturned by ministerial directive.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was there, Senator. You and I must have missed each other. I am sorry about that. I was reminding Senator Newman and members of the Opposition that in 1985 women came together in relation to their complete opposition to the consumption tax, for which Senator Vanstone has subsequently indicated some support. I know that she has muddied the waters in that regard, but in 1985 women at the women's tax summit, as it was called in 1985, came together on that particular issue. What the Women's Tax Convention will determine in terms of its recommendations on Saturday is not for me to say; it is not for Senator Vanstone to say; it is certainly not for members of the Opposition to say; and it certainly is not for Paul Keating or the Prime Minister to say. It is an opportunity for women to express their views about the current wage tax debate. We know that men in the community have many forums in which to express their views. In the business community, which is predominantly comprised of men and very much male dominated, men are expressing their views all the time. While there are some women expressing their views in the trade union movement, again it is dominated by men.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is an important occasion-an artificial occasion, if you like, as was said today on the Ray Martin program-until we get more women speaking out in the forums of the business community, the trade union community and, indeed, in this Parliament. So I am afraid Senator Vanstone will have to wait for some considerable time for my direct response to that question for the simple reason that the Women's Tax Convention will, firstly, make recommendations on Saturday.</PARA>

Does the Minister appreciate that point? Secondly, does she appreciate that whatever Keating is pulling, it is not the right levers on the economy?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How can the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade reconcile Australia's vote in favour of agenda item 64 on international arms transfers in the First Committee Meeting of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in November last year with moves announced by the Minister for Defence to promote the export of arms and defence equipment and with forthcoming government legislation designed to relax defence export controls? I further ask the Minister how the Government can reconcile these moves to promote defence exports with the statement made by his predecessor, Mr Hayden, at the United Nations Special Session on Disarmament in June 1988, when he stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is also clear that arms exports should not be turned to as a way of solving domestic economic problems. Arms transfers must not become a new cash crop.</PARA>
<PARA>I also ask whether he agrees with the article on the front page of the Australian Financial Review of 14 June 1988 which stated that the only major dissent to the fundamental changes in our attitude to defence exports came from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and that exports of anything, including so-called defence material, are now regarded as in the national interest? Finally, I ask the Minister: In light of these contradictions, is the Government still planning to go ahead with legislation designed to promote the doubling of defence exports in the next three to five years?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are no contradictions. The defence export policy announced by my colleague the Minister for Defence last June is entirely consistent with Australia's vote at the 1988 United Nations General Assembly. The UN resolution calls on countries to control the production and transport of defence exports and to refrain from acquiring arms additional to those legitimately required for national security. The resolution advocates greater openness about international arms transfers and asks the Secretary-General to report on such aspects as the illicit arms trade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The policy announced by Mr Beazley on 14 June last year streamlines administrative arrangements for requests for approval to export. The defence exports remain subject, however, to rigorous controls in accordance with existing legislation and in accordance with new Customs legislation which will enhance the powers of the Minister for Defence to control defence exports. That legislation was introduced late last year and I believe that it will be debated in the next week or so in the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA> The new policy places controls on exports of those goods specifically designed or adapted for military purposes which are inherently lethal, incapacitating, destructive or of major military significance. It tightly defines a whole series of circumstances precluding defence exports, such as mandatory arms embargoes, international sanctions and violations of human rights. The details of those criteria were spelt out at great length in the attachment to Mr Beazley's press release of last June, to which I refer the honourable senator. The policy provides for full consultation between the Ministers for Defence, Foreign Affairs and Trade, Industry, Technology and Commerce and the Attorney-General. The policy also provides for the publication of export guidelines, which will occur some time in the near future, while allowing for commercial confidentiality, greater transparency and openness.</PARA>
<PARA> Under these conditions and circumstances defence exports do not conflict with the Government's firm commitment to protecting and enhancing national, regional and international security through arms control and disarmament measures-a commitment to which Senator Vallentine referred and which she has acknowledged. One of the underlying justifications for defence exports is that, until there is an alternative to the current international security situation, all national governments have the right-indeed the obligation-to defend their peoples and territories. Legitimate self-defence is embodied in the United Nations charter. International peace and security can most effectively be advanced-another point of view-if nations are confident about their security. To the extent that Australian defence exports contribute to all those objectives they are defensible in accordance with principles which I believe we would accept.</PARA>
<PARA> From a more narrow commercial perspective, the encouragement of defence exports can contribute to the development of our domestic industrial base, which enhances Australia's overall defence self-reliance as well as our economic position. Finally, defence exports will continue to be strictly controlled and will reflect a balanced assessment of Australia's economic, strategic, defence and foreign policy interests.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications aware that the Wilshire program on Sydney radio station 2GB has used commentators on current affairs who include the former Deputy Director of the League of Rights, which has been widely criticised for its anti-semitic and racist comments? Peter Sawyer has also made the most outrageous and false allegations: an imminent one-world government with its headquarters in Parliament House; a violent uprising and civil unrest in Australia, which would require a civilian militia; unfounded criticism and defamation of many leading figures in Australian politics and business; and the allegation that the Deakin Centre was the site of a national surveillance network. Lately he has been promoting Mr Wilshire as a potential independent Senate candidate in New South Wales. Peter Sawyer has also been linked with the League of Rights and has heavily promoted the Citizens Electoral Council movement. Bob Clarke, the former President of the New South Wales Immigration Control Association and current head of New South Wales Greypower has recently been reported as having links with extreme racist groups and activities. Is the Minister further aware that pirate tapes of the Wilshire program are being circulated by League of Rights supporters with Mr Wilshire's knowledge?

His particular reference to the program is worth picking up. The program advancing the potential Senate candidacy of Mr Wilshire raises a larger question of political wolves in sheep's clothing which I think is useful for us to be alerted to, not least in the context of the present Australian Capital Territory election campaign. I am led to believe that, among the collection of anti-self-government candidates in this election campaign, there is a number of people with quite significant League of Rights connections which have so far been unacknowledged in the public arena. I think it would be a tragedy if voters were inadvertently to support such persons in ignorance of their true positions-people masquerading under a different guise. But, as I have said, it raises larger questions. I will refer to the Minister the specific issues that have been put to me by Senator Boswell and seek an early response.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am trying to give a serious answer to this question. I was asked whether a decision had been made to lease Bruce Stadium to the Canberra Raiders. The answer is no. The decision was taken by the Government to lease Bruce Stadium to the ACT Administration. That is the extent, thus far, of what the Government has done. Obviously, I would expect a decision to be made at some time in the near future by the ACT Administration to lease the facility to the Canberra Raiders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was then asked what costs were involved in developing the main track at Bruce Stadium for athletics. The first stage of Bruce Stadium was completed in June 1977 at a cost of $6.5m and an upgrade of that facility was completed in September 1985 at a cost of $8.4m. All these funds were supplied by the National Capital Development Commission. At the time no special consideration was given to wind factors.</PARA>
<PARA> I was asked whether a decision was expected to be made to lease the grounds and what costs would be involved in ripping up the athletics track and making the stadium suitable for rugby league. The estimated cost for modifying the stadium is $3 1/2m-a not inconsiderable sum. Of course, this would cover not simply making the ground suitable for rugby league but also the construction of facilities for spectators and appropriate dressing rooms for the players. The situation is not yet entirely clear because the brief on costs is not totally finished. When it is and I have some more final and definite figures I will give them to the honourable senator and to the Senate. But that is all the information I have at the moment.</PARA>

She also asked whether it is true that the warm-up track has deteriorated because of the high level of use and is not suitably wind protected for significant athletic competition. That is not true. The warm-up track is in good condition and it is adequately protected from the wind. That is not to say that we can ever protect athletes from the wind in an outdoor facility. That is why there are rules in athletics about wind assistance for when records can and cannot be set. Clearly, while they are not totally protected from the wind--</PARA>

In referring to the development of a child-care centre in the Parliamentary Triangle, she referred to an answer given last year by Senator Richardson. The sequence of events which occurred last year was that Senator Giles asked a question of Senator Richardson on 25 November. He gave a detailed explanation of the Government's intention to build a child-care centre in the gardens on the House of Representatives side of the old Parliament House. The heritage value of that building is one of the significant parts of the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Richardson in his answer gave details of that and of child-care places, but in no way referred to the Parliament having a role in deciding what goes into the Parliamentary Triangle. As a consequence of that, when the proposed child-care centre-parliamentary zone issue came into the Senate, I raised that question. I also gave notice of a motion to the effect-and the motion was passed by the Senate-that the Government ought not to proceed as had been indicated by Senator Richardson without the proper procedures taking place. </PARA>

Senator Richardson said then that he was aware of the Senate's motion, that he supported it and that proper steps would be taken.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the papers. </PARA>
<PARA>Dealing with the reports together gives us an opportunity to contemplate the research councils generally and the work they do. Reading all the reports on one day certainly shows the differences that exist between the various organisations. I believe that, if we can see those differences and learn from them, some of the councils can probably do likewise. I note that some councils are running administration costs from as little as about 5 per cent of their turnover and that for others the figure is 12 per cent or more. It is noticeable that the goals of the various groups vary quite widely. Surely, the aims of the various councils should be similar. I would have thought that they would include matters such as improving the product, ensuring the health of the animals or plants involved, combating disease, improving returns to producers, adding to the presentation, securing better markets and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The quality of the presentation and the amount of information that is given by the various groups varies considerably. I believe that the Parliament-as well as the people who actually pay their contributions as producers-is entitled to a lot better information than that which is coming through universally. The expectations and operations are not covered adequately. I was disappointed most of all with the Sugar Research Council's report. It provided virtually no information on what the Council is doing in any way, shape or form. It gave the titles under which the objectives of the various projects are operated, but no more. I would suggest to that organisation that it give more information. The aims are stated but the results are not. Many of the others have shortcomings to some extent in the same area. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that the rural industry research councils hold an annual meeting to which the chairmen go. It is very interesting that they should go. I hope that they are able to discuss their own operations in a group and can learn from one another. I would like to know whether that group of chairmen produce an annual report. If so, it would be highly desirable for us to get a copy. In the overview of the report of the Chicken Meat Research Council I found this extraordinary comment:</PARA>
<PARA>In line with the basic philosophy of the Plan, research in marketing, new product development and transportation were considered to be the responsibility of individual particpants in the industry. Accordingly, research has not been sponsored by the Council in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA>If the development of new products, transportation and research in marketing were not included by the Research Council, I would find it quite extraordinary. Surely in this important industry the participants could benefit considerably if these vital ingredients were included. </PARA>
<PARA> The grain legumes industry and the pig industry have both done very well in recent years because their research and presentation have been well above average. The nature and extent of their research has always been well organised, and this has been shown to be the case. The Oilseeds Council probably has provided the best information of all, and the follow-up remarks in relation to its investigations are very worthwhile. I believe that we are entitled to know how well these research operations have gone and what the results have been. The participants in the industry need to be told which ones have been successful and which have not. I believe that it is possible to reflect in these summaries the amount of cash by which the industry can benefit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some comments on the Grape and Wine Research Council's annual report 1987-88. I see from the early part of the report that Mr Brian Croser, the Managing Director of Petaluma Pty Ltd, a winery in my State, is a member of the Council. I know him to be a gentleman who contributes tirelessly to his industry; it is an industry in which most of the contributors are prepared to work together for the betterment of the industry. This can be seen from the Chairman's summary, which points out that the three main wine industry organisations involved, namely, the Australian Wine and Brandy Producers Association, the Australian Wine Makers Forum Inc. and the Wine and Brandy Cooperative Producers, have all agreed that the operative rate of the research component of the wine grapes levy should be increased to $1.50 per tonne. The report contains some reasonable detail on the work to be undertaken by the Council and the work it has undertaken thus far.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of problems face the wine industry-five in particular-not all of which can be addressed by the Council. One relates to raw material supply, which is a constant problem because of the changing tastes of Australian and overseas wine drinkers. The problems of technical and labelling integrity are, in my view, yet to be properly addressed by the Australian wine industry. A third issue is that of health. Certain bureaucrats and lobby groups have decided to target the wine industry as being a very significant cause of ill health in the country. Sometimes one can get the view, if one is in the wine industry or is a supporter of it, that the wine industry is targeted vis-a-vis alcohol whereas those who make and sell spirits and beer seem to get off rather lightly. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth issue is that of taxation, on which I wish to make a few remarks, particularly as to the case for having section 31a reassessed. There has been a campaign in my State to have something done about this matter. The Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, has taken the opportunity on a number of occasions to put this view with respect to the valuation of wine stocks. It is a pity that the Grape and Wine Council cannot with the resources at hand-perhaps it has not given the matter high enough priority-carry out some research on how to influence politicians from States which are not big wine producers to understand the extent of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh could well do with some education in this respect. He believes that the wine industry should be treated no differently from the building industry. His view is that the value of building stocks has to appear in reports in the building industry and that the wine industry should adopt a similar course. However, he needs to understand that for quality wine to be sold it has to be aged. Although Senator Walsh obviously believes that this is not a matter that needs to be addressed, he might like to concern himself with the activities of the Premier of South Australia, Mr Bannon, who has sought to discuss this matter with the wine industry. I hope that Mr Bannon decides to make a protest to the Federal Government aimed at persuading it to reconsider its attitude. I further hope that the Grape and Wine Research Council will be able to do some concrete research to show the Government what has been the impact of the changed tax structures on the wine industry and to stress how much better off the wine industry will be if the Government realises the error of its ways. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to comment on the annual report of the Australian Postal Commission for 1987-88. The report is most important at this time because, as honourable senators will be well aware, the form of management of the Australian Postal Commission is undergoing some very radical changes. Those changes, naturally, are brought about by the policies of the Government, which has now required there to be a considerable reform relating to the area of management. The Government has now imposed excise, payroll tax and customs duty and sales tax on the Australian postal system. This, of course, will force up the cost of postal services over the next few years. Unfortunately any increase in charges in the postal area has a negative effect in remote areas of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory, which I represent, where people naturally rely more on postal services for their communications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important that we look at the needs of the Australian Postal Commission. This matter was alluded to recently in some quite controversial media coverage. The implication was made that Australia Post might be looking to close down a number of remote postal offices around Australia. I am pleased to have received some very high level briefings from Australia Post which have largely allayed my fears in that regard. I am now convinced that the long term services of Australia Post will be maintained and improved wherever possible. In the Northern Territory Australia Post is already proposing to upgrade its equipment and mail processing systems. I certainly support the changes, such as the use of post office box systems in agency arrangements, particularly in very remote communities, where they could enhance a number of services to remote communities. In a place such as the Northern Territory where the impact of tourism makes extra demands on the poste restante services at an extremely high cost to Australia Post, it is interesting that Australia Post is introducing specific electronic services tailored to meet the needs of poste restante and, of course, the mail distribution systems for the business community. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia Post is having to undergo these reviews as a result of the financial imposts that have been put on it-such as the very significant staff changes. I commend both the management and the people who serve remote areas of Australia. The postie and, of course, all of the associated staff bring very welcome intimate services that are so very needed in so many areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I would challenge Australia Post in a couple of areas. The first challenge is to improve its communication systems with industry, particularly small business, in Australia. When changes of this nature are imposed or otherwise brought about it is necessary that there be a lead time and that advance notice is given in respect of matters relating to the communications systems that are undergoing change. There needs to be a very detailed and comprehensive review. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I ask Australia Post to consider right around Australia is the tailoring of its trading hours to meet local demand, even if this means opening some post offices or post office agencies in the evenings and, in some places, possibly Saturday mornings. I appreciate that economic considerations have to be borne in mind in considering these matters. In particular, there would need to be extensive union consultation. We do not live in a time when 9 to 5 from Monday to Friday is always the appropriate way of doing business. The private sector has recognised this. If Australia Post is to be forced into dealing more like a private institution, it should be open to the need for very dramatic change that often exists. One way Australia Post could enhance the services it gives to Australia is a comprehensive review and extension of its trading hours. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>We have recently seen a negotiated agreement package in the Northern Territory which brings together the interests of government, of Northern Territory people-expressed through their properly constituted government, the Northern Territory Government-and of the Aboriginal community largely in the Katherine area known colloquially as the Jawoyn. These issues are raised in this very important report on the Jawoyn (Katherine area) land claim. I applaud the fact that the parties have been able to react to the Commissioner's findings, which were very extensive; a number of very important comments were picked up. In fact, I commend Justice Kearney's report for the consideration of all honourable senators. The Katherine Gorge is included in the area covered and, as most people would be aware, this is one of the most significant national parks in the Northern Territory, if not in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The importance of the national park cannot be overstated. It currently enjoys visits from about 75,000 people each year. About 20,000 of those people camp overnight at the gorge or at Edith Falls. There are over 250 kilometres of walking trails which are used extensively by hikers and day trippers. So the park is used extensively by Territorians, interstate visitors and overseas tourists. Commissioner Kearney commented on a whole range of areas of possible detriment if the park was not properly managed, and these matters have now been picked up. I refer to the issue of its proximity to Katherine, a quite significant urban town, and in particular that town's future water resources. Both these matters were commented on. </PARA>
<PARA> The parties have been able to come together and negotiate a form of management that is now satisfactory to all of those parties. In fact, at a recent and quite public press event, members of the Jawoyan working party and the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Mr Marshall Perron, announced the successful conclusion of the 18 months of negotiation with regard to this national park. As a result, the Northern Territory Government will legislate for a joint management arrangement which will secure access to the park for all people and guarantee the future water supply needs of Katherine. The Aboriginal people of the Jawoyn working party also commented at that press conference that they were happy with their negotiations with the Northern Territory Government, the Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory and the Northern Land Council on behalf of Aboriginal people. So this has been an example of appropriate local decision making and of negotiations resulting in arrangements which are very satisfactory to all people. Of course, the history of Katherine Gorge and this particular land claim was fraught with a lot of difficulty, frustration and very serious and at times controversial media and community comment. I certainly commend the report and the arrangements that have fallen into place between all the parties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak on this report, entitled Future Directions for Pay Television in Australia. There is a great deal of commercial interest in the introduction of pay television in Australia. The Federal Government will be allowing certain groups and companies to operate pay television. We must be very careful as to who those groups are and what services they provide. We must consider how those services will impact on the community in general. Page xvii of the executive summary states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>There are, however, likely to be some significant community concerns about the introduction of pay television. These concerns could include a belief that we do not need, or there is no demand for, more television services, or that the introduction of new services is an inappropriate use of community resources. Some may consider that pay television will reduce the time available for more rewarding activities such as family interaction, recreation and homework. A further source of concern may be fears associated with declining community moral standards through access to a greater range of pornographic material. </PARA>
<PARA>The summary then goes on to indicate the possible impact on commercial broadcasters, et cetera. In these economic times we have to have regard to whether this service has a high priority as a demand on our resources. That matter must be considered very seriously indeed. As is indicated by this report, there is concern amongst the community. Page 128 talks about options regarding program standards. These options are in need of serious consideration. One of the options that is talked about is that there be no program standards, that they be left to the viewer, the recipient of pay television. It is noted that there is a capacity to have control systems and lock-out devices on television sets. </PARA>
<PARA> The Joint Select Committee on Video Material received evidence relating to this. Such systems are not foolproof. Before we go too much further on this matter, it is important that those responsible consider the problems that have emerged in the United States as a result of the introduction of pay television in that country. Concerns are now being expressed by a large and broadly representative group of parents as well as community groups in the United States about the effect of pay television on children's viewing, in particular, together with its effect on the general community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report we have before us, entitled Future Directions for Pay Television in Australia, was prepared by the Department of Transport and Communications as a discussion paper regarding the way in which pay television could be introduced into Australia. What I have to say is somewhat akin to one of the comments Senator Harradine made. The approach in this report is that pay television is a fait accompli. The Department's report accepts that pay television is to be introduced into Australia and discusses how that will happen. There is no discussion about what the cost will be to the nation. This should be addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The introduction of pay television into Australia will cost many billions of dollars. Figures in the report outlined how much the various options which might be used will cost. As a nation we should be asking, before the introduction of pay television, how much material would have to be purchased overseas and what that would do to our present balance of payments problem. Would it make it even worse? If it would, I suppose that the question, then, is whether Australia can afford to introduce pay television. I am not saying that we should not, but it seems that in this respect the report by the Department of Transport and Communications is deficient. We have a significant problem with our balance of payments. If we are to introduce something new which requires a great deal of material to be brought from overseas it is possible that we will damage our country by spending more than we should, increasing our overseas debt problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not sure at this stage whether there is a great demand in Australia for pay television. I am prepared to be convinced otherwise. Many people whom I represent however, would not be concerned about using pay television or paying for an extra service. They would like to use television and the broadcast facilities that are free to them at present; they are paid for by another means, for example, by government or by advertising. But I am not too sure whether there is a great demand for pay television. </PARA>
<PARA> The point we should be considering is what this means to the country's finances and resources that we will use to introduce pay television. If we are to provide many billions of dollars for its introduction, we should be asking, `If those billions of dollars are available, should they be used for this new service or should they be used for some other service in Australia, indeed some other area where we need funds, for instance, in the housing area?'. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Government to look at pay television again particularly and at the financial implications that could result for Australia from its introduction. I do not consider that the Department of Transport and Communications is the correct department to do that. It is not surprising that the Department of Transport and Communications would accept the introduction of this new service as a fait accompli. After all, that Department would be the department which would be responsible for it once it was introduced to Australia. Perhaps the departments to have a good look at it are either Treasury or the Department of Finance so that they can determine whether pay television is something that should be introduced to Australia at present. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The report is quite comprehensive and deals with the activities of the Australian Capital Territory Gaming and Liquor Authority. It indicates the highlights of the year, the income and distribution of the moneys which it has received from gambling and from liquor licensing. It is particularly the section relating to liquor licensing to which I wish to refer and specifically the matter of under age drinking with which it deals. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall speaking on a report from the Authority a year or two ago. I am pleased to note the reference to what we know occurred, that is, an amendment to the law on 22 December 1987 when new provisions came into the Liquor Ordinance 1975 relating to under-age drinking and the responsibility of partners who hold a licence. Specifically, in relation to under-age drinking, the term `liquor' was defined and new proposals for checking on under-age drinking, of course, were brought in. There is in the report also a reference to under-age drinking and what has occurred since that time. It refers to the fact that the Australian Federal Police had for a number of years been seeking this amendment to the ordinance. It deals with the number of young people who were spoken to in the then six-month period and who had been cautioned. The issuing of caution was a new development in the matter of under-age drinking. </PARA>
<PARA> The report refers to the fact that there are a number who are cautioned and encountered on more than one occasion. It gives the numbers of those who were cautioned by inspectors of the Authority and the police. Quite a story is told. Specifically, the report refers to the difficulty that police and inspectors were having as a consequence of the changes to the Childrens Service Ordinance 1986, specifically, section 30 sub-paragraph 1 of that Ordinance which came into effect early in 1988. It has been the subject of discussion. It has been a matter that has caused some problems in relation to having people present when young people are spoken to, the length of time they can be held and matters of that nature. This particular clause of the Childrens Service Ordinance is creating difficulties for inspectors and police to caution young people about drinking matters as provided for now in the Liquor Ordinance. It is an aspect of the Childrens Service Ordinance that needs to be modified so that the cautioning procedures of the Liquor Ordinance can operate properly and more efficiently, as I believe they are a very good idea. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that those who have encountered the problem and who are thus aware of it will be diligent in pressing for a review of this matter so that the quite valuable procedure of cautioning under-age drinkers can be used in the way it was intended. The report also refers to the fact that two licensed premises have had their licences cancelled in the period covered by this annual report. At that time, another prosecution was pending. I think I am right in saying that all of those related to under-age drinking. It certainly is a problem in most parts of Australia. It is in Canberra. If one talks to the police who are on duty in Civic, on weekends and late at night, one gets some comprehension of the extent to which under-age drinking is a problem. Any matters which impede dealing with it need to be resolved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In looking at the list of papers before us, I find that there are some 97, of which 16 are predicated on issues arising totally out of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). Senator Reid and I were just commenting a few moments ago, privately, that this is probably, and hopefully, one of the last times when, in consideration of Government papers, we will have to give detailed consideration in this Parliament to issues such as health, housing, parole boards, surveyors' boards, fire brigades and electricity authorities, which will very probably pass with self-government to the ACT at the election this coming Saturday to the people of Canberra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can understand a lot of of the apprehension in the community at the very significant change that will take place this weekend with regard to self-government. Indeed, I was a member of the Legislative Assembly in the Northern Territory when we negotiated the self-government package for the Northern Territory. As deputy leader of the majority party at that time, with Dr Goff Letts as the majority leader, he and I negotiated with the Fraser Government the basic principles for the financial arrangements that came into being for Northern Territory self-government. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there were many other people involved in that entire process. What I can attest to is the success of self-government for 10 years in the Northern Territory. I am very hopeful that we will see a similar form of success emerge in the Australian Capital Territory community. It is very important that people take as much responsibility locally as they possibly can. Indeed, my Senate colleague from the Northern Territory, Bob Collins, of the Australian Labor Party was quoted in the Northern Territory press recently as saying, also in support of self-government as a success story and as a way of running the Northern Territory, that he would far rather have a Country-Liberal Party government in Darwin running the Northern Territory than have the Northern Territory administered from Canberra, even by Labor. </PARA>
<PARA> There is certainly a lesson that we can follow in that local government of that nature and self-government are the right way to go. It is my earnest wish that the elections on Saturday will produce a very stable, strong and responsible government for this Territory. There is a plethora of candidates standing. The range of choices available to the Canberra people, of course, crosses so many different interests and sectors. I hope that the Canberra residents are able to see through those groups and individuals who are not really dedicated to the principles of what parliaments and good government are all about and are able to choose teams that will make for a very good government and very good opposition. </PARA>

<PARA>I take the opportunity to associate myself with the comments just made by my colleague, Senator Tambling, with respect to the forthcoming Australian Capital Territory election. For the last 7 1/2 years, I have also almost daily heard expressed by Canberra residents concerns on matters such as health, education, transport and criminal justice. However, the people of the Australian Capital Territory have unfortunately had no direct means by which to influence legislative or governmental changes or behaviour. On Saturday they will have the opportunity to put into being a government which will be responsible directly to them. I believe that they will act wisely. Apart from anything else, they will probably vote Liberal, in view of their experience of the Federal Labor Government as it relates to Canberra over the last six years. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Responsibility for apprentices will also pass to this new government. With your gracious liberty, Mr Deputy President, I make the quasi-political point that there is concern in the Australian Capital Territory that self-government will cost residents more. It is my view that now the Grants Commission makes specific references calculating the cost of the Australian Capital Territory to the Commonwealth there is a process of accountability that will require for the people of the Australian Capital Territory their own government to argue their case. As honourable senators know, the Grants Commission indicated that in its belief the Australian Capital Territory had a shortfall of some $60m, as compared to the States, in the year 1986-87. All the States have governments to argue their cases; the Territory has not. It will need that government in future or the result will be that the cost to the people of the Australian Capital Territory will be greater. Self-government will cost the residents less.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Getting back to the Apprenticeship Board, I point out to Senator Reynolds, the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, and Senator Crowley, who participated in a debate in the area of the status of women two nights ago, that we had put on our desks yesterday evidence of their failure in a critical area of the status of women. Two nights ago, we debated in part whether girls and young women were being attracted into areas of skilled employment in order that they might improve their financial security and independence. This report gives figures as to the position in the Australian Capital Territory. Those figures should be highly illuminating to Senator Reynolds because they are inconsistent with the attitude that she expressed the other night. There are 1,769 apprentices in the Australian Capital Territory, of which only 282 are women. However, if we take out the number of those involved in ladies hairdressing, we find that the number of apprentices is reduced to 1,509, while the number of women is reduced to only 62. Thus, if we take out the number of those involved in ladies hairdressing, 62 of 1,509 apprentices are women. </PARA>
<PARA> If we consider achievements in the last year, taking out the numbers in hairdressing and cooking, we find that of 537 apprentices only 16 are girls or young women. The proof that their policies have been unsuccessful in attracting women into these other areas of employment and into apprenticeships is in the document before Senator Reynolds and Senator Crowley. They ought to face up to their responsibilities in this area rather than gloss over it by seeking commendation for their wonderful successes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Regulation of Video Material Bill 1988, introduced by Senator Walters. I am the third speaker in the debate which was commenced last year. It was commenced with the introduction by Senator Walters of her private member's Bill. On 15 December 1988, Senator Tate, the Minister for Justice, responded to the second reading with the Government's position. He did so in a brief speech that at best could be described as disappointing. He did not address or seek to address in any way the content of Senator Walters's Bill. He spoke about a subject that is strictly irrelevant to the Bill, namely, the matter of violence on videos. He told us that the Caucus of the Australian Labor Party was addressing the subject of R-rated films and videos with the establishment of a committee to see whether there was confusion between X-rated and R-rated films and videos.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The history of the matter is that late last year Caucus determined that it would not support its Attorney-General in taking action to ban R-rated videos in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). The ACT is the headquarters for the pornographic video industry in Australia. Such videos are mail ordered from the ACT throughout Australia. It is part of a highly lucrative business in pornography. To reflect on history again for a moment, I point out that the trade has been banned in all States of Australia. It was the unanimous recommendation of the Attorneys-General of this country that it be banned in the Australian Capital Territory; in other words, that the loophole be closed. The Hawke Labor Government was not prepared to so act and its Attorney-General late last year took his recommendation to Caucus for further consideration. It was rejected. In other words, the Labor Party and the Hawke Labor Government indicated that they intended to maintain the legislative structure by which the R-rated video industry in the Australian Capital Territory can be conducted. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we read at the time that the Caucus committee decided that the subject of violent videos required further consideration and would be referred to a subcommittee of the Caucus. As I indicated a moment or so ago, when we read Senator Tate's response to Senator Walters's Bill, we find that the Caucus subcommittee will see whether there is confusion between violent videos and pornographic videos and make recommendations. It is a development of what Caucus decided, recognising that there is a community concern. Not wanting to face up to that concern, the government has tried to camouflage the fact that it is not prepared to act in the area. In an indirect way it will now bring consideration of this matter within its Caucus committee structure. That response is totally unsatisfactory. We have been disappointed, as you would know from previous debates in the Senate, Mr Deputy President, that the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women (Senator Reynolds) has not been prepared to participate in these debates. She has not been prepared to put to this Senate her position on the subject of pornographic videos. We are aware, of course, that the reason for this is that she would be obviously aware that the vast majority of Australian women are totally opposed to this trade, which demeans women in such an improper way. However, she has not been prepared to front and contribute to these debates and I will be very surprised if she contributes today. </PARA>
<PARA> The position she has put to the Senate before is that she is not prepared to act because women's organisations have not expressed a view to her. We are well aware of the practice of this Government, and particularly of Senator Reynolds, to respond to representations of women's organisations. In fact, she conducts surveys and calls conferences-we have another conference being held this weekend-in which she says she seeks to ascertain the views of women's organisations, to which she will respond. With regard to pornographic videos, she says that these women's groups have not approached her. She does not know their views and therefore there is no need to act. Of course, she has not sought the opinions of women's organisations in this regard. She has not conducted surveys on this subject. She has not called conferences to see whether women are seriously of the view that we have put to her and that they oppose this trade in the strongest possible terms. In other words, her practice in this instance has been to close her eyes and her ears, otherwise she would receive evidence that would put her in an embarrassing position vis-a-vis that adopted by her Caucus and her Prime Minister. She has therefore not been prepared to front up to the attitudes of Australian women. </PARA>
<PARA> In a previous debate on this subject in this chamber we in the Opposition said that we would do her work for her; that we would write to women's organisations seeking their views; and that we would come back to the Senate and put those views on the public record, whether they came out in favour of Senator Walters's Bill to ban X-rated videos in the ACT or otherwise. We did this in order that Senator Reynolds could have the picture before her and, we believe, so that she would have one less reason not to respond to this public concern. </PARA>
<PARA> Pursuant to those undertakings, I wrote to women's organisations. I acknowledge the support of the Office of the Status of Women, which at my request provided me with a list of appropriate organisations to whom I could write. I want now briefly to take the Senate through the responses I received. The first response I have on this list is from the Women's Electoral Lobby (ACT) Inc. (WEL), which was mentioned at Question Time as one of those organisations which Senator Reynolds particularly takes note of in relation to taxation matters. It is a sponsor of the Women's Tax Convention that is being held in Canberra this weekend. On this particular subject, Joy Taylor for WEL ACT wrote in response to my letter:</PARA>
<PARA> I am writing in response to your letter regarding X-rated videos and the Oppositions intention to introduce a Private Members Bill on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> WEL is totally opposed to any portrayal of women that exploits or degrades them in any way, or any portrayal of women that reinforces the unequal power relationships that exist in society. </PARA>
<PARA> WEL ACT endorses the intent of your Bill to ban X-rated videos in the ACT. We believe that it is inappropriate for the ACT to continue to distribute X-rated videos in the face of the contrary decisions of the Attorneys-General in all States. </PARA>
<PARA> We would be interested to see a copy of the Bill . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Reynolds will now be aware of the attitude of the Women's Electoral Lobby to this particular matter. The second response I want to bring to the attention of the Senate is from the Catholic Women's League, Australia. Mrs E. Doyle, AM, the national President, wrote to me on 24 November stating:</PARA>
<PARA>Members of the Catholic Women's League Australia (app. 20,000 in number)-</PARA>
<PARA>that is something Senator Reynolds should take note of-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . are angered at the lack of action on the part of the Federal ALP Caucus in the matter of X rated videos. </PARA>
<PARA> Pornography degrades women, particularly in the minds of the young and the easily manipulated. We are convinced that constant exposure to violence/sex through the media, particularly the electronic media, can lead those of immature and/or warped mentality to commit crimes of sex and/or violence. </PARA>
<PARA> We are insistent that the Government should implement the unanimous recommendation of the State Attorneys General that X rated videos be banned in the ACT, as in all the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, we are against the introduction of the proposed NVE category and we feel that the existing `R' and `M' classifications should be tightened. </PARA>
<PARA> We would appreciate your making our views known to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>Now Senator Reynolds knows the views of the Catholic Women's League, Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The third response which I bring to the attention of the parliament is that of the Country Women's Association (CWA) of New South Wales. Mrs Patricia Keill, the General Secretary, wrote on behalf of Mrs Gedling, the National Secretary of the CWA, Australia, on 24 November 1988. I will not read the whole letter as it is rather long, but it is available for anyone who has an interest in the subject. Mrs Keill reminded me of a resolution of her organisation, stating:</PARA>
<PARA>That C.W.A. of Australia urgently requests the Federal Government to ban importation, production, sale and hire of X/ER rated video tapes within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>This Association was dismayed when, after the Attorneys General Conference in Darwin, it had been decided to have the matter discussed again in Caucus. We also took exception at the cavalier manner in which our Prime Minister treated the subject at the Press Conference on the steps of Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA>We had experience earlier this week of this Government apparently becoming aware-or so it claimed-of the effect on women of the foul language of its Treasurer. On a number of occasions we have brought to its attention the effect on women of the patronising attitude of the Prime Minister of Australia. It is interesting that this has been picked up by the Country Women's Association, a very large organisation. Patricia Keill continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Women are degraded when portrayed as sexual playthings and prolonged exposure to pornography can lead to a lack of respect by men. Although we cannot substantiate this statement, we feel that there is a higher likelihood of rape or to force unwanted sexual acts on women. Men who do not respect women think nothing of violent acts against them. </PARA>
<PARA>She goes on to reinforce the fact that the State Attorneys-General were unanimously of the view that action should be taken to close the loophole in the ACT. She expresses disappointment that this Government has not been prepared to act accordingly. In fact, it is her view that the political pressure which has been brought to bear by a lobby which has a $25m industry is related to the fact that this Government has not been prepared to take action. She states:</PARA>
<PARA>Our priority should be the care of men, women and children and not money. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a message which perhaps Senator Reynolds should take note of. </PARA>
<PARA> The next organisation was the National Association of Community Based Children's Services, which wrote to me on 23 November 1988. The Convener, Dawn Plested, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Thank you for your letter regarding the decision to continue to allow the sale of X-rated videos in the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA>This was the Government's decision. I continue:</PARA>
<PARA>The National Association of Community Based Childrens Services supports your efforts to obtain the implementation of the recommendations of the State Attorneys-General and the Joint Parliamentary Select Committee on Video Material to ban X-rated videos in the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA>The National Status of Women Committee also wrote to me. That, of course, is the Peak Council of National Women's Non Government Organisations, formed in 1975 at the commencement of the United Nations Decade for Women and concerned with the elevation of the status of women. What did it say? It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Your letter . . . was considered yesterday at a meeting of my Committee. The Committee unanimously resolved to inform you that it supports your belief that the unanimous recommendation of all State Attorneys General that X-rated videos be banned in all states and the ACT should be implemented. The Committee commends your commitment to the status of women in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that Senator Reynolds will at least do us the courtesy of reading this list and reading the views of these independent women's organisations. </PARA>

<PARA> Women's Action Alliance is pleased to hear that the Opposition is taking this action, as we were most disappointed that the Labor caucus saw fit to vote as it did. </PARA>
<PARA> We are enclosing some material that may be of use to you-and would be interested to obtain a copy of the proposed Bill when it is available. </PARA>
<PARA>Part of the material that she enclosed was a press release that followed a conference that it had in Queensland in which it quoted the Labor member for Forde (Ms Crawford), who stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Children's innocence is to be prized and their introduction to sex should not be through a fifth rate pornographic video. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps if Senator Reynolds listened to some of her Labor colleagues from the States she might respond in a way consistent with the views of the community rather than the views of her colleague the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Caucus. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Zakharov ought to listen to this. It said to us:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Along with many other people in the community we have been campaigning for the ban on X-rated Videos in the A.C.T. and the N.T. and the consequent end of the mail order trade which now flows into the States, where a ban already exists. </PARA>
<PARA> Our reasons are that X-rated Videos contain depictions of behaviour which, if imitated, may lead to the spread of Sexually Transmitted Diseases, including A.I.D.S. It is our contention that it is illogical for the Government to be spending millions of dollars on the education of the public about the dangers of certain sexual practices while at the same time condoning the sale and hire of videos which are sending the message that these very practices are normal, acceptable and presumably risk free. </PARA>
<PARA>This is particularly interesting and ought to be noted by Senator Zakharov. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> We also believe that it is illogical for the Government to support such projects as `Fair Go for Women' and `Affirmative Action' which seek to improve the status of women in the community while allowing the free availability of material which depict women as mere objects for male sexual gratification. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of advice that Senator Zakharov, Senator Reynolds and Senator Crowley ought to listen to from such responsible groups as the Anglican Church's Mothers Union. But of course, they will not be listened to. </PARA>
<PARA> I move on to the response from Australian Church Women, who wrote to us on 28 November 1988 expressing a similar sentiment. They stated:</PARA>
<PARA> This subject has been a real concern of our members and was brought forward by the Tasmanian unit-</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Walters will be pleased to hear that-</PARA>
<PARA>and discussed at some length at our National Conference in Adelaide in September 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> We believe it is ludicrous that the Federal Government can make a decision such as this against the recommendations of all State Governments to allow X-rated videos to be available by mail order from the A.C.T. There has been a great deal of opposition expressed by many responsible groups and people in the community against this, and though the States have heeded and listened to their concerns, it seems the Federal Government is completely unconcerned about their responsibility to the community to endeavour to maintain a responsible moral standard that will benefit all people. </PARA>
<PARA>That pretty clearly expresses the attitude of Australian Church Women as written by Mrs Napier, the National Secretary. The Society of Women Writers Australia also wrote to us. This perhaps may be of greater interest to Senator Zakharov if she is not prepared to listen to the women's organisations from the churches. It wrote on 28 November 1988, and stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Society of Women Writers Australia gives its wholehearted support to ban this destructive force within our Nation. Please do all you can to beat greedy vendors who are prepared to grow rich on moral poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the years we have tried to guide our writers, steering them away from using gutter language so that our heritage of National pride is retained to be handed down to succeeding generations. </PARA>
<PARA>That letter was written by Marjorie Wilke, the Federal President of the Society of Women Writers Australia. I hope that perhaps some of these Labor senators will listen to that organisation. Some 700 members, I understand, exist in the Society of Women Writers Australia. I will move on to the War Widow's Guild of Australia. It wrote on 6 December 1988. Referring to our letter, it stated:</PARA>
<PARA> At the Bicentennial National Conference of the War Widows' Guild of Australia held in October the matter of video pornography was discussed. As a result it was agreed that the Government should be asked to take steps to eliminate video pornography particularly in its demeaning portrayal of women. </PARA>
<PARA> The Guild therefore supports the Private Members Bill on X-rated videos as mentioned in your letter. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Federation of Business and Professional Women Inc., a highly respected body, wrote to us. I note from the speech I read given by Senator Reynolds in December last year that it is a body that she has specifically referred to as one which she listens to and from which she takes advice. Robyn Duncan, the Vice-President of External Policy, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Federation of Business and Professional Women Inc. is concerned that the Government has failed to implement the unanimous recommendations of the State Attorneys-General to ban X-rated videos in the ACT. We are concerned that by declining to introduce legislative measures to eliminate the exploitation of women the Government is not showing that it has a commitment to improving the status of women. </PARA>
<PARA> We welcome the introduction of a Private Members Bill on this subject. </PARA>
<PARA>Apart from the women's organisations that I have mentioned, not surprisingly church organisations have also been writing to us expressing similar views. The Australian Catholic Bishops Conference wrote to me earlier-it was not in response to my letter; it presumably wrote to all senators-on 27 September 1988, a letter signed by Monsignor Manning, who stated:</PARA>
<PARA> There has been much misunderstanding of what the majority of the Committee recommended with respect to the treatment of video pornography. The position of the majority is currently set out in a letter that the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference addressed to the Attorney-General on 8 June 1988. A copy of that letter is enclosed. </PARA>
<PARA>So Labor members must have it. I continue:</PARA>
<PARA>The majority of the Committee recommended that `the Commonwealth Government introduce substantive legislation to ensure that this material (i.e. almost all of the current X-rated video pornography and their R equivalents) is refused classification for the purposes of Commonwealth laws' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that that makes adequately clear the attitude of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference. And so I can go on. Particular members of the clergy have written to us. Don Barter, the Dean of Townsville, writes:</PARA>
<PARA> Please do all you can to reverse the recent decision to make our National Capital the Porn Centre of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is totally unacceptable to myself and many other Australians. Any Government which countenances such a degradation for our National Capital does not deserve to remain in power. </PARA>
<PARA>I said that I would report to the Senate not only on those who wrote to the Opposition in supporting the banning X-rated videos but also on those who wrote expressing a contrary view. Only one women's organisation has written to me believing that action should not be taken in this regard. That organisation is the Women in Science Enquiry Network Incorporated. On 24 November 1988 Dr Merrelyn Emery wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> WISENET is not against non-violent erotica as there are other issues such as freedom of choice in a democracy which must be considered. Some of this material portrays men and women as equal partners and it may be wiser to use other means of education to remove the need for that which does degrade women, rather than impose bans which have a very poor track record. </PARA>
<PARA>So one women's organisation has written expressing the contrary view or, in other words, supporting the Government's position. A vast number of women's organisations have written to us saying that women should not be demeaned in this way; that this Government should not condone the demeaning of women in this way; and that this Government should take action to support Senator Walters's private member's Bill. One organisation, the Federal Government's principal mechanism for consulting with women in the community, the National Women's Consultative Council, has responded in the last couple of days after many requests from us. It says that its members have varied views on the subject. In the cause of fair play I quote from that letter written by Anne O'Byrne, the Convener. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> After substantial debate it emerged that some members were opposed to X-rated videos, others were more concerned about the matter of censorship, and all were concerned about the effect of violence in videos. </PARA>
<PARA> I respect the National Women's Consultative Council but I suggest to the convener of that body that, if she takes an expression of views of women's organisations, it will be as these women's organisations have advised us and as we have put down in the Senate today-that is, very strong opposition to the Government's stand in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The letters and the representations that I have referred to relate to correspondence that has been written directly to us. Mr Acting Deputy President, you would be aware of many other organisations in the community, through letters to the editor pages of newspapers and other forums, that have expressed similar views in opposition to the X-rated video trade out of the Australian Capital Territory. I simply remind you of a list of these. References are also available for those honourable senators who might wish to pursue the matter further. There has been opposition from the National Council of Independent Schools; the Federation of Catholic Parents and Friends Associations; the Anglican Youth Synod; the Australian Parents Council, the Australian Council for Children's Films and Television; Dr Jocelynne Scutt, the former deputy chairperson of the Law Reform Commission; the National Council of Women of New South Wales; the New South Wales Women's Advisory Council; the Anglican Dean of Sydney, the very Reverend Lance Shilton; Cardinal Clancy, President of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference; the Labor President of the upper House in New South Wales, Mr John Johnson; the Archbishop of Melbourne, the most Reverend David Penman; and Australia's largest union, which has expressed its opposition to the Government's policy and practice in this area, the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, I remind you that the people of Australia have used the process available to them to express their views to the Parliament in the form of petitions. I am advised that, as of today, 16,854 members of the Australian community have petitioned the Senate to oppose X-rated pornographic materials being distributed from the Australian Capital Territory and 30,504 Australians have similarly petitioned the House of Representatives. I am advised that there has been no petition in favour of the Government's position of supporting the  X-rated pornography industry in the Australian Capital Territory. So I respectfully hope that the Government and, in particular, Senator Reynolds, with her special responsibility in relation to women, will take note of the material that I have put before the Senate today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill has just delivered a very revealing speech on exactly why a huge cross-section of Australian citizens believe that pornographic videos are a highly undesirable commodity in this country. The many letters and petitions to which Senator Hill referred are certainly not just some phantom. I am absolutely amazed that the Minister for Local Government and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, Senator Reynolds, has not even bothered to enter the chamber to listen to this debate. That, too, is quite revealing about what the Government is thinking. I am glad to rise in support of the Regulation of Video Material Bill 1988, whose purpose is to prevent the continued use of the Australian Capital Territory as the Australian centre for mail order hard core pornography. I do so as a Liberal. I am also a federalist who does not believe that the inaction of this Federal Parliament or this Government should allow the subversion of the declared policies of elected State governments.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Zakharov, with any degree of luck, will hyperventilate over there. She has been sitting through this whole debate huffing and puffing, yet at the same time she is a senator from the Australian Labor Party (ALP), which purports to support women. She cannot even be bothered in this instance to help protect women. I think it an utter disgrace that she is huffing and puffing over there. As I have said, with any degree of luck she might hyperventilate. Equally, as a Liberal, I am concerned at the effects this material is having on Australian society. That is why I am surprised that people such as Senator Zakharov, who spruik off from the hilltops, are not concerned about Australian society. As a representative of the people of Western Australia I am conscious of their wishes for some broad basic controls over videos.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other person sitting in this chamber who has been flapping his gums all day on this Bill, in a very derisive way, is Senator Cook, who is also from Western Australia. One does not need to be too bright to realise how many people have written to Senator Cook asking that these videos be banned. He, too, chooses to ignore them. Quite frankly, it is a pity that this Bill cannot proceed as a bipartisan measure and it is a greater shame that it needs to be introduced at all. However, it is the inevitable response to the continued inaction by this Hawke Labor Government right through its term of office. Until we had a change of Attorney-General after the 1984 election the Labor Party refused even to hold an inquiry. That says something in itself. It refused to use Federal Government power over Customs to take action at the importation of pornographic material. It is weak-kneed and lily-livered on this subject and this is proved time and again. When a vote is taken on this Bill it will prove it yet again. </PARA>
<PARA> This Hawke Labor Government ignored the 1985 Senate committee that reported strong public opposition to X-rated videos and exposed the inadequacy of regulations that did nothing to prevent the distribution of these videos by post. When the Joint Select Committee on Video Material finally reported last year the ALP seized on every excuse to do nothing. It has sought to fudge the fact that a majority of the Committee-let us not forget that it was a majority of the Committee-was opposed to an X-rated video classification. It is part of the role of government to take action to maintain an accepted level of social decorum and to inhibit personal activity that is likely to cause distress and harm to others. By tradition it has been the State governments in Australia that have legislated for or against such controls. In this field State parliaments have sought to reflect the wishes of their electors. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not by accident that State governments of both political persuasions have imposed greater restrictions on video materials and have moved towards the prohibition of the sale and hire of hard core pornography whether depicting violence or perversion. That just happens to be fact. Yet earlier Senator Zakharov sat there huffing and puffing in her usual way and poured scorn on the fact that the State governments had made their decision. The State governments have made their decision and that is something that is totally and utterly undeniable. Significantly, the State Attorneys-General, meeting in Darwin last July, recommended the banning of X-rated videos, which is another thing that honourable senators opposite choose to ignore. I wonder whether Labor senators will claim that their State colleagues from Western Australia, South Australia or Victoria are what one could call, I suppose, right wing wowsers because they oppose these videos. They oppose these videos but those opposite do not. It is amazing to see that they cannot even justify why they disagree with their State colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time, the Federal Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) was quoted as saying that only 7 per cent of video users hired or bought X-rated videos. However, since then this Government has bent over backwards to keep that 7 per cent happily watching their porn. Seven per cent is important, is it? To me, 7 per cent is a fairly insignificant lot. We all know that until this Parliament takes action to prevent the dissemination of video pornography by mail order from Canberra, the intentions of the elected representatives of the remainder of Australia will be diligently undermined by this Government. Unless the Hawke Labor Government is prepared to explain why the actions of the State governments in controlling pornography are wrong and harmful, it should act to close off the loophole that makes their policy ineffective. The present cynical inaction by this Government, paying lip service to family values while appeasing the pornography lobby, is treating the State governments and the Federal system with absolute and utter contempt. </PARA>
<PARA> When Senator Walters or anyone else stands up to demand action against X-rated material we can expect the shopworn allegations that we are trying to foist a minority moral standard onto the community, that we are threatening free expression, and that we are hung up on the evil that we are trying to control. It was interesting to watch the reaction of honourable senators opposite while Senator Hill read out a very extensive list of letters asking that the Bill be supported. Senator Zakharov murmured and mumbled and carried on with disgust at every letter that was read out supporting the Bill. Senator Hill had one letter opposing the Bill and she sat there and nodded so vigorously that her head nearly fell off. That was for one letter opposing the Bill. Where are the standards of honourable senators opposite?</PARA>
<PARA> It is time to ask whether those who take what I would describe as an extreme libertarian position in respect of hard core pornography are not the true unthinking conservatives. Too many Australians in public life are still trapped in the attitudes of the late 1960s and probably early 1970s when the sexual revolution was seen to be good clean fun and the destruction of all censorship was a great way of shocking the Establishment. It certainly shocked enough people. Certainly, Australia had to remove the types of controls that prevented us from reading books and seeing films that were accepted in other Western societies. I think that honourable senators ignore a deep-seated change in public attitudes that does not equate X-rated videos with something like Lady Chatterley's Lover-that is a very different scenario altogether-and people do not necessarily believe that freedom is threatened because governments take action against gross depiction of warped sexual behaviour. I have always suspected that some Government senators would have had enough morality, decency and concern in them about the general standards of behaviour in our society to vote for this Bill, but obviously my assessment of things in that respect is far off the beam. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the Bill because I believe there is too much evidence to ignore. As I have said before, if one wanted evidence, extensive evidence was given by Senator Hill. That evidence points to the fact that exposure to X-rated videos has a damaging effect on many individuals and, therefore, harms society as a whole. I do not believe that it is the right of any government to intentionally, willingly and knowingly harm society in the way this Government is going about it. This is not a matter that can be proved with the finality of a scientific equation because enough qualified behaviour experts who reported to the Joint Select Committee have pointed to the fact that exposure to pornography, whether explicitly violent or not, caused viewers to accept the values implicit in this material. Such values, so-called, teach the viewer that we are all something akin to two-legged animals and nothing more and that women especially are dehumanised sex objects, playthings for men and proper targets for their sexual aggression. Once again, I am absolutely staggered that this Government is prepared to accept that-not only accept it but allow it to continue. </PARA>
<PARA> Research by Zillman and Bryant, described in chapter 13 of the report, cites the facts that prolonged exposure to pornography promotes insensitivity towards the victims of sexual violence, distorts usual perceptions of sexuality, and results in a preference for less common forms of sexuality that are forced on reluctant female partners. Yet again, the Government chooses to ignore that evidence. If the overwhelmingly male audience of hard core pornography were simply harming itself there might not be a case for any form of government control. However, we must not forget that the final victims of pornography are usually women. There are cases where men are involved but generally they are women. Even if only a small number of pornography users commit sexual assaults, if is an evil that society cannot afford to condone. We cannot afford to sit back any longer and condone that evil. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said that over the last two decades when hard core pornography became easily obtainable in Australia there has been a tendency for rapists to force their victims into acts that have been learnt from pornography. I might say that in Western Australia we have had some very grim reminders of that in the not too distant past. Bearing in mind what two people did to a number of girls after watching videos-the two people happen to be in prison now-this Government is prepared to sit back and accept that young girls and women can be subjected to such violence. I quote from paragraph 13.131 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA>It cannot logically be argued that the effects of pornography can safely be ignored because, supposedly, only deviants would respond to pornographic influences. While behavioural science studies in this area do not provide certainly they do establish theories which make reliable predictions about human behaviour. It would therefore be unenlightened for Parliament to ignore them. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government chooses to ignore that report. Surely no honourable senator would argue against the proposition that X-rated videos would have a damaging effect on children and adolescents, poisoning their sexuality and self-image and, in many cases, possibly poisoning their lives in the future. But no, it does not matter. I hope that members of this Parliament would accept that as fact. It is not some airy-fairy fiction. It is in the very nature of video material that it enters the home and that some adult users will lack the responsibility to keep it from children. There are instances of that happening every day of the week. It is, therefore, proper to ask whether the protection of young Australians, who are subjected to enough other confusing and disturbing social trends, should override the rights of those supposedly mature adults who can watch X-rated material without ill-effect. </PARA>
<PARA> As an aside, it is ironic to note that to many observant young people the availability of pornography has made the word `adult' into a euphemism for a mindless obsession with sex. It is some adult world that we are giving them, by courtesy of this Government. I would warn the Australian Labor Party that it is kidding itself if it thinks that opposition to the Australian Capital Territory mail order pornography industry is confined to the conservative side of politics and to lobby groups that the ALP dismisses as religious fundamentalists. That is certainly not the case, it has never been the case, and is never likely to be the case. Many concerned citizens, out of the blue, have rung me and written to me on this subject-and I would not call them cranks in any meaning of the word. Those people are concerned. Some ladies from a pensioners group visited me in my office yesterday. They asked the same question: `What are you doing about pornographic videos? What is your opinion on the subject?'. They were extremely concerned at the effect of pornographic videos on young children; they were seeing the effect in the community. Yet this Government chooses to think that it is only radicals who can have a view contrary to the Government's. </PARA>
<PARA> A great deal of concern has been expressed by all the churches, including those whose attitudes to social questions cannot generally be described as right wing. The majority of Australians still adhere to Christian denominations, even if two certain people in high office in Australia do not. Concern at the social effects of X-rated videos extends way beyond the churches. Is anyone prepared to argue that the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association is an extreme conservative body? Senator Hill read out excerpts from the Association's letter, and its views would not generally be described as conservative. Rather, I might hazard a guess that a majority of its active members are Labor voters. Significantly, it is a union with a majority female membership, a membership concerned with the effect pornography has in shaping male attitudes towards women; but once again the Government chooses not to listen even to the people who vote for it. Many of the other people who have expressed concern would be people who vote for it. Try as we might, I do not think we could get 93 per cent of the vote-and about 93 per cent of the community are opposed to this. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter from the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association to members of parliament last year also made the point that the bulk of pornographic videos originate in the United States, where their production is substantially in the hands of organised crime. If women are the end victims, of hard core porn, one could say that `the mob' is the end beneficiary. Labor senators should not ignore the telling comments of a New South Wales Legislative Council member-I refer not to Reverend Fred Nile but to the Labor President of the Council, Mr John Johnson. On 9 November Mr Johnson accused his Federal colleagues of a `political cop-out' over their policy of inaction, and stated that they had lost touch with the electorate. He made this commonsense statement:</PARA>
<PARA>We're there for the good government of the nation and if we're not doing that we shouldn't be there. </PARA>
<PARA>That was a comment by yet another member of the Labor Party-indeed, not just a member of the Party but a member of parliament in that Party. Yet the Government also chooses to ignore him. I believe that the sentiments of Mr Johnson, noting that the Federal Labor Party has `squibbed the issue', speak for a vast number of Australians from both sides of politics, who do not wish to force their values on others but who simply believe that the dissemination of hard core video pornography is harming society and threatens the well-being of our children. Mr Johnson also mentioned the insensitive campaign of the pornography lobby to protect its lucrative investment. Spokesmen for this lobby are now claiming that the defeat of the coalition in the Western Australian elections was due to their advertising that equated our stand against X-rated videos with Hitler and Stalin. How outrageous can they get. </PARA>
<PARA> What makes this argument look thin is the fact that the State Labor Government had legislated against the possession as well as the hiring and sale of this material. Again I must stress that at State government level, with the agreement of the Attorneys-General that X-rated videos must go and that no non-violent erotica be considered to replace them, we do have a bipartisan view on this matter. I would add that while many might support the concept of some explicit material being used in bona fide sex education or of erotic material of genuinely artistic nature, we are all too aware that the NVE classification would be a means of circulating hard care pornography that merely avoids explicit violence. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not good enough for us, or for the people for whom we speak. I thought we were in this place to represent our constituents. No matter on what side of Parliament we sit, we should be representing our constituents. I would have hoped that on this occasion the Labor Party would represent its constituents and join with us in voting for this Bill. The Bill is a serious and honest attempt to rectify a social evil that makes our national capital the sleaze capital of Australia. That is very sad, and I commend the Bill's support to all honourable senators who can bring themselves to consider that pornography is not good for this country. </PARA>
<PARA> This Hawke Labor Government constantly sings a song about its care for women. We heard a convoluted answer from Senator Reynolds today about women-women this, women that. It was not too easy to understand because on this occasion no-one had written the answer and she was not able to read one out. She and many other senators continually sing about the problems associated with women, yet not one of them is prepared to be in this chamber to listen to this debate. Indeed, not one of those Labor senators is prepared to vote for this Bill. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) believes that he and the Government generally can appeal to women simply by Government members cleaning up their language. They have a long way to go on that issue. If anyone wants to check Hansard last night to see how Senator Collins performed, or check Hansard ever since Senator Collins came into this place, they will agree that, if anyone needs to have his language cleaned up and his mouth washed out, it is probably Senator Collins. However, he would probably be second only to the Treasurer (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA> For the Prime Minister to say that the Labor Government can appeal to women by Labor members cleaning up their language is the most patronising thing I have ever heard. We have before us in the Parliament today a Bill that would give the Government an opportunity to say, `Yes, we are legitimately concerned about women and we will vote for this Bill'. Women want delivery by governments of realities and not the platitudes that the Prime Minister and people like Senator Reynolds and others are offering at the moment. This Labor Federal Government has an opportunity right here and now to support this Bill, but at this stage the Minister has not been into the chamber. It is a great tragedy that we have not got bipartisan support for this Bill. It is a very important Bill, not just for women and for children but for society in general. That is why it should be commended to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad to have the opportunity to talk out these matters yet again, because I agree with Senator Knowles and other speakers in this debate that these matters concern the community very much. Certainly we are all here to represent our constituents and, as such, we should look at matters which are debated out in the community. It is my opinion and my assessment that opinion in the community is divided on erotica and pornography but not so divided on violence. I am surprised that Senator Hill and Senator Knowles have addressed their remarks to X-rated videos and not to R-rated videos. If we are to have this debate yet again in the Senate, it is very pertinent that we get our facts straight in respect of these videos. I noticed that both Senator Hill and Senator Knowles mentioned pornographic violence and violent sex in the same breath. In fact, Senator Hill, in talking about one of the responses he had received, said that particular constituents objected to depictions on video of violent sex. Violent sex is found only in R-rated videos and not in X-rated videos, according to the definitions. I will go into more detail about that later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to look also at the legislation. The aim of this legislation is succinctly described in clause 5 (3) of the legislation, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . video materials shall be refused classification . . . if the material includes explicit depictions of sexual acts involving adults, whether or not the material includes any depiction suggesting coercion or non-consent of any kind. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, clause 5 (4) states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . video material shall not be classified . . . if the material depicts detailed, relished or gratuitous depictions of acts of considerable violence or cruelty. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the words `refused classification' and `shall not be classified' actually mean `shall be banned'. Clause 5 (5) describes exceptions to the banning of explicit depictions of sexual acts involving adults and to `detailed, relished or gratuitous depictions of acts of considerable violence or cruelty'. That subsection states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . video material which, in the opinion of the Censorship Board, depicts matters of such educational, cultural, scientific, historical or cinematographic significance that it is in the public interest for it to be classified. </PARA>
<PARA>That means that materials will not be banned if they fulfil those particular classifications. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the section of the Bill headed `Importation of video material', we find, if I am not mistaken, that this relates only to explicit depictions of sexual acts involving adults and not to acts of considerable violence or cruelty. Perhaps this matter can be brought forward if this Bill comes to the committee stage-unless there is a misprint in the version of the Bill which I have here. This matter does give rise to concern and, as I said before, I hope that if we reach the committee stage we can talk further about that, in the time available. </PARA>
<PARA> The components of Senator Walters's Bill are to some extent complementary to the Government's response to the report of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material. As we heard previously-last year-the Government Caucus committee is to review the current X classification and also depictions of violence in the various classifications of violence in present video and film materials. This makes some sense. I would like to refer to the video classifications as defined in the report on page 802. At present the definition for classification X, extra restricted, for 18 years and over, is:</PARA>
<PARA> Material which includes explicit depictions of sexual acts involving adults, but does not include any depiction suggesting coercion or non-consent of any kind . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, no violence of any kind. Senator Walters has in fact expanded on the definition. In her Bill, she states:</PARA>
<PARA>``explicit depictions of sexual acts'' means depictions of:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) sexual penetration;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) oral contact with genitals between consenting adults; or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) sexual manipulation alone or between consenting adults. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Senator Walters has taken the bold move, I might say, of actually defining `explicit depictions of sexual acts'-a term which was not defined by the Film Censorship Board. I do not propose to debate this matter any further at present because I do not think it will add any great perspective to the essence of the Bill. But I do draw it to the attention of the Senate because I think it is pertinent to the matter in hand. Certainly the video materials Committee recommended a review of the levels of violence throughout videos, and I believe that was one very important recommendation which it made. Senator Walters's Bill goes further in her classification of violence than the present classification, which I will read out. In present R-rated videos, the provision concerning violence is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Explicit depictions of violence, but not detailed and gratuitous depictions of acts of considerable violence or cruelty. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, in the clause of Senator Walters's Bill I previously read out, we have an additional word, and that is the word `relished'. Examples are found of inappropriate language and depictions of violence not only at the R-rated level but also, I am afraid, at M, G and even PG ratings, and most people are amazed to learn that the Rambo movies are in fact M-rated. </PARA>
<PARA> Censorship is both a fascinating and a dangerous concept. To those of us who are ideologically opposed to censorship the concept of someone else, or, even worse, an institution, telling us to which information we shall have access or be denied access can be both offensive and sinister. Support for censorship can be popular. I do not want to go into any great detail here, but I remind the Senate that the Nazis' burning of books was opposed by the minority at the time, not the majority. Also, the path of making exceptions can be a murky one, fraught with individual and institutional prejudice. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to refer at this stage to Attachment E of the report of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material, Volume 2. This discusses the findings of the study on video viewing behaviour and attitudes towards explicit material in video movies. It was intended as a preliminary investigation. It is a study which provides some valuable data and raises a number of issues which have direct policy relevance. A questionnaire was sent to a sample of video hirers in Canberra and the surrounding district, and 175 people returned completed questionnaires. I think the Senate will find some of the results interesting. They appear on page 812, if anybody wishes to read them all. Attachment E states:</PARA>
<PARA> Nineteen per cent of respondents fell within the category of regular X-rated movie viewers. . . A much larger number fell within the category of regular R viewers . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is, 59.4 per cent. It states further:</PARA>
<PARA> Regular X viewers did not differ markedly from video viewers in general in terms of a series of characteristics including age, marital status, church attendance, education and work situation. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Only five per cent of respondents thought that X-rated videos should be banned. Over 60.0 per cent said that there should be no public display of such videos, while 30.0 per cent said there should be no restriction for adult audiences. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Attitudes to materials containing sexual violence were far more conservative. Over 60.0 per cent of respondents said that such material should be banned. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> A large proportion of respondents agreed with the present restrictions on the availability of X-rated videos. Over 85.0 per cent thought that X-rated videos should be kept in a restricted area of the video store. . . </PARA>
<PARA>I have read out just a few of the remarks with regard to that survey. I would like to point out that the results of that survey are very much in keeping with the recommendations which were made by the Joint Select Committee on Video Material. In recommendation 1 the Committee recommended that a new category, NVE, non-violent erotica, be instituted. That was a majority recommendation. Word seems to have got around that it was not, but it was. It was recommendation 2, which recommended that the new NVE category contained that material as defined in the current classification of X, that was a non-majority decision. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to draw the Senate's attention to the rest of the Committee's recommendations; there were 29 in all. For the most part they concerned the availability of video materials. The Committee recommended that both X-rated and R-rated video materials-I agree with this recommendation wholeheartedly-should not be readily available. It recommended that promotional material for these videos should not be blatantly displayed so that people are blatantly exposed to it in a way which they might find offensive. </PARA>
<PARA> Other recommendations have regard to video materials being labelled in such a way that people are well aware of their content with regard to language and depictions of sex and violence. The subject of language has come up in this chamber. A lot of undesirable language is used in the Parliament. My experience is that the most unexpected people use the most unexpected language when they are not aware that others are listening. </PARA>
<PARA> There is confusion over the present classifications. This is to be regretted, because it means that debates of this sort are often carried on without people being aware of what the classifications mean. I hope that my remarks have helped to clear up this matter. One of the problems is that X-rated videos in the United States of America and the United Kingdom can contain explicit depictions of sexual material and violence. That is a problem for us in Australia with our X classification. Therefore, it is a logical step for our X classification to be changed to NVE-non-violent erotica. The difference in the X classification between countries has given rise to unfortunate misunderstandings. For example, great play was made of the fact that Bundy, who was recently executed in the United States of America, watched X-rated videos. Those X-rated videos would have contained violence because, as I said before, the classifications are different. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been some open discussion in the community on this topic. In January it was a very popular topic on open line radio talkback shows in Western Australia. I listened to as much of those talkback shows as I was able. I believe that public debate is healthy. It is up to members of parliament to listen as much as possible to what our constituents have to say on matters. It certainly came out on the talkback shows in Perth that violence worries people in the community a great deal but that explicit depictions of non-violent sex are not of great concern. Many letters have been written on the subject. Perhaps we should have a referendum on the topic. It is a great shame that when we had the opportunity to put as a fifth referendum question that people in Australia should have the opportunity to initiate a referendum-a referendum could have been initiated by those citizens who wrote the letters-because of a decision by the majority of senators that opportunity was denied to them. I regret that very much. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to some comments made by Beatrice Faust and reported in the National Bulletin of the Women's Electoral Lobby, the September-October issue of 1988. Beatrice Faust said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there is more in pornography that is offensive than bad language and explicit sex and violence. We could include a machismo meter to identify stereotyped characters and situations, or excessively unrealistic sexual portrayals with general ratings going to those films that included plain, middle-aged or pregnant and menstruating women and x-ratings for those that were patently sexist. In terms of realpolitick, this is unlikely to succeed where the NVE classification failed. </PARA>
<PARA>She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>But in the current economic climate, there are more urgent priorities. Pornography is an effect, not a cause. To solve the problems of rape and domestic violence, we need to look beyond it to other causes such as the feminisation of poverty, alcohol, junk food, food additives, and the pollution of the environment. </PARA>
<PARA>I put it to the Senate that it is right that we consider these matters. I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Walters at the conclusion of her second reading speech when she said that, as legislators, it is our responsibility to do everything in our power to make Australia a safer and happier place in which to bring up our families. To do that, we must put an end to the scandalous situation of our homeless youth, to child prostitution, to child abuse and to domestic violence in general. It should be of interest to the Senate to note that the most frequent single category for both the perpetrators and victims of murder is the unemployed. Most murders and serious assaults occur in a domestic situation, where people know each other. The present taxation system favours high income earners and those without children. So there are many matters to be addressed. As I said before, I look forward to the committee stage of the Bill. I will examine the details of Senator Walters's Bill because I think the Bill canvasses issues that we should be addressing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy this afternoon to support Senator Walters's Bill, the Regulation of Video Material Bill. As a mother and a grandmother, any issues which affect women and families rate the highest priority with me. This issue should be of the highest concern to all women and families throughout Australia. The decision by the Labor Caucus last year to defeat the proposal by the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) to ban X-rated videos was a blow for women and families, not only in Canberra but throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government has made a sham of looking after families. It has given in to yet another minority-the pedlars of pornography-an industry which makes money out of exploiting women and which caters to the more perverse elements in society. Honourable senators opposite talk about civil liberties, the rights of people to do what they wish and to pursue a normal, successful life to the best of their ability. I ask honourable senators: What could be a greater infringement on the rights of the majority of average Australians than the sort of dangerous material we are talking about today? What could be more harmful to the pursuit of those aims?</PARA>
<PARA> What we need is control over the distribution of X-rated videos and R-rated videos. We are discussing in Senator Walters's Bill the prohibition of the importation, sale or hire of X-rated videos and the reduction of violence in R-rated videos. Decent families, church groups, women's groups and many other organisations have been crying out for firm action to be taken to stamp out this smut. </PARA>
<PARA> The largest union in Australia, the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA), has called for a ban on X-rated material and its equivalents. It has urged the Government to ban the sort of material which honourable senators opposite find to be not harmful. I applaud the stance that has been taken by the SDA. The Trades and Labour Council of New South Wales has also expressed support for this action. The Caucus decision to set up a working party to resolve the confusion about the content of X-rated and R-rated videos is a weak excuse. I listed to Senator Hill's speech in this chamber this afternoon. He listed some of the organisations which have written to him and other Opposition members complaining about the Government's inaction in regard to banning X-rated and R-rated videos. Organisations such as the Women's Action Alliance and the Country Women's Association (CWA) have called for these videos to be banned. All honourable senators would know the tremendous influence the CWA has throughout Australia. The Catholic Women's League and the Mothers Union of Australia, with 14,000 members, are very upset about the Government's decision. The Australian Church Women, the War Widows Guild, the Business and Professional Women's Association-all of these organisations-feel very concerned indeed that action has not been taken to stop the X-rated video industry, with Canberra the porn capital of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know too that the Attorneys-General from all States recommended the banning of X- and R-rated videos. Indeed, the Attorney-General, Mr Lionel Bowen, recommended the same course. That decision, of course, was overturned by Caucus. These videos are still available for distribution and sale in Canberra. The figures on the number of people who have signed petitions were very interesting. Petitions from 16,854 people against X- and R-rated videos were presented to the Senate, and petitions from 30,504 people against pornography were presented to the House of Representatives. These are very important figures and prove that people generally do not want these types of videos in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There is evidence readily available to show that these types of videos have a detrimental effect on our society. We are here for the good government of the nation and, if we are not doing that, we should not be here. I dispute the spurious arguments put by this Government that a ban on X-rated videos will drive them underground. That is a hoary argument put up by people who deliberately do not want the best for the community. We should remember that murder is done in private. Does that mean that we should legalise it so that it can be brought into the open? As a society, we closely follow what we legally permit to be viewed on television and videos. There is concern amongst many people that what is privately viewed by adults in their own homes today will ultimately be shown in public. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of us here today are parents. We realise that as parents it is difficult to control what our children watch and see during their daily activities. I am very concerned that many young people watching explicit sexual material, as well as violent material, may come to believe that such behaviour is acceptable. They might think that because they have seen it on a video it cannot be all bad. I sometimes wonder whether so much violence in our society today is due in no small measure to the R-rated videos and even the violent films shown on television. Sometimes even when we watch the news at night time we find that the first three or four items on the television contain violence. I sometimes feel this is, of course, a real problem as well. </PARA>
<PARA> While one can have some form of control in cinemas, control of access to television and video viewing is impossible. Governments have a responsibility to protect minors and others in the community from seeing material of a violent or sexual nature that would disturb them. I accept that parents have a responsibility as well. But parents, regrettably, are not always there to exercise control over television or video viewing and we cannot be too sure that those people over 18 years of age who see these videos are not adversely affected by them. </PARA>
<PARA> The best way to control these videos is to stop them altogether. It is time the Government realised its responsibilities. It is up to the Government to exercise control to protect children and all other members of the community from the psychological dangers of this type of video material. The only way this can be done is to prohibit the importation, sale or hire of them and to reduce access to them. I suggest to honourable senators that if they defeat this Bill they will be effectively pushing the pornographic industry onto 99 per cent of Australians who do not view these films. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my contribution by saying that I am concerned at the proliferation of what could only be described as anti-family behaviour and material in today's society. I have stood up for the family many times in this chamber. But I do not think that I have ever been more worried about the future of families in Australia than I am today. Families are the cornerstone of society. They form the basic structure on which we build our lives. In order to maintain our way of life, health, safety and order we must protect the interests of the family. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government can only stand condemned for its weak-kneed decision last year not to ban X-rated videos, which is no good for women, no good for families, no good for children and no good for Australia. The Government has abrogated its responsibilities to the community when it relies on Senator Walters to introduce this Bill instead of taking action when it could. If we truly support the concept of families as the basis of society, we will protect and preserve them by voting for Senator Walters's Bill. I must say I commend her sincerely for bringing this Bill into the Senate. We will vote to ban X-rated videos and to reduce the violence in R-rated videos. I commend the Bill to all honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been said before that wherever there is a problem there is always a simple answer and it is always wrong. This is one of those areas. In listening to the debate, both now and previously, I have been struck by the incredible frequency with which honourable senators impute bad motives to anybody who happens to disagree with them. It is a pity that this chamber cannot take cognisance of what people outside say about us and raise the level of debate so that we actually talk about the issue rather than always seek to denigrate our opponents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There was an example this afternoon. Almost every speaker who has spoken in support of this legislation has attacked Government members who have not contributed today, by saying that, as they did not agree to ban it, they are in fact in support of it. That is a patently absurd proposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Boswell would not mind sitting and listening for a while, instead of just wandering in to the chamber, he might actually learn something. One can totally disagree with the content of pornographic videos and still not suggest that they be banned. I want to use as an example something that I have been concerned with in the last five or six weeks as a member of the Joint Statutory Committee on the National Crime Authority, which is inquiring into the drug trade in Australia. I want to give an example because there are a lot of connections that when one wants to wave one's arms about and take the simplistic approach one tends to miss.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If honourable senators have the time, I recommend that they go through some of the transcripts of that inquiry. Time and time again in public meetings people who were totally, adamantly and violently opposed to the drug culture in this country reluctantly told us that they believed we needed a different method of banning drugs. They did not appear before the Committee because, as has been suggested here this afternoon, they support drugs and therefore want them decriminalised. They appeared because they are opposed to drugs and they know that the method we have used to date is failing. I hope that the imputation of bad motives might not have to be such a continual and pervasive part of the debate in this place. I hope that these issues, which Senator Walters recognises in bringing on the Regulation of Video Material Bill as being serious for the community, are not dealt with in a trivial, demeaning and politicised way to score points for Saturday's election. I presume that the Bill brought before us this afternoon was not for that purpose. I could throw around such accusations, but I do not think they help the debate or this chamber's purpose. I hope that further contributors to the debate get themselves out of the gutter and stop imputing bad motives to others. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the example I gave of the drug trade. The Committee to which I referred heard in evidence that last year 17,000 Australians died as a result of tobacco related illness; 3,000 died from alcohol related diseases and 300 died from illness associated with all other drugs. When we attempted one and a half years ago to have smoking in aircraft banned-something which has now occurred, thank goodness-everybody else in this chamber voted against our measure. When we attempted to ban advertising of the lethal drug that killed 17,000 Australians last year, everybody else in the chamber-Liberal, Australian Labor Party and National Party-voted against us. We are not talking about `sociological connections', to use Senator Walters's term; we are talking about 17,000 Australians dying. Despite that, honourable senators in this place would not vote to ban the advertising of tobacco. We should put into perspective the attitude of people who have been holier-than-thou on these issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Advertising of tobacco and alcohol will not be banned because interested companies provide large amounts into the pockets of political parties. That is why such advertising will not be banned in legislation in this place, even though we know it should be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The advertising of alcohol will not be banned for exactly the same reason and another 3,000 Australians will die each year, making a total of 20,000 Australians if we include those who die from tobacco related diseases. I point out to Senator Bjelke-Petersen that quite openly and happily we allow the advertising of drugs that kill 20,000 Australians a year. That advertising does not take place in a separate room in our homes. The drugs are advertised on the television for children to see. I have not seen Senator Bjelke-Petersen vote against it or speak against it in this chamber, yet she made a sanctimonious speech with respect to the subject of the Bill before us. I would find myself much more in accord with what she said had she done that. Holier-than-thou speeches are great, but one must be careful to keep a proper perspective. People will not address such issues as the advertising of alcohol and drugs because of the vast amounts of funds which float around in tobacco and liquor company coffers and which become available at election time. That is the first issue that I am concerned about and it relates directly to Senator Walters's Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second issue that I am concerned about also relates directly to Senator Walters's Bill. Senator Bjelke-Petersen called the issue a hoary old argument. I will trot it out again because, unlike her, for the last six weeks I have sat on a committee hearing of the problems we have with crime in this country. For years, I have sat on the National Crime Authority and I know what crime is doing. I come from Queensland and I know what crime has done there, even if she does not. It has perverted the judiciary, the political system, the police force and politicians. The money comes from crime and drugs and has been developed by a black market. Senator Bjelke-Petersen can say as much as she likes about hoary old arguments. There is nothing hoary about the crime taking place at the moment, as the Minister at the table, the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), well knows, being the Minister with some responsibility for this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Crime is rampant. It is almost out of control. Sitting on that Committee one is confronted with the terrifying spectacle of the crime in this country. I know from sitting on that Committee, as I am sure would every senator who bothers to read the annual reports of the National Crime Authority, where the funds come from. The funds that float around to corrupt and pervert the institutions of this society come almost exclusively from the drug trade. We banned that trade with the best of intentions because everybody in the chamber knows that it kills people; it destroys their bodies and their minds. A week ago we had evidence from the Australian Federal Police that 70 per cent of property crime is connected to drugs because the drug habit needs to be fed by further drugs. Hence, people have to break into homes, cars, and shops to feed a habit that can cost from $300 to $500 a day. Having seen the devastating effect of drugs on individuals, with the best of intentions we banned them. I do not know whether there are any other methods of dealing with the problem. I am unsure. I find it one of the most horrifying things that I have had to confront in the time that I have been in this place. However, I do know that our current methods are not working. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope Senator Walters listens to my remarks on the market for and supply of drugs, because those areas seem to be central to the issue and should not be ignored and tossed aside in the flippant way in which Senator Bjelke-Petersen tossed them aside. We know that the drug market in Australia is growing. We also know about the other side of the equation, that is, supply. We know that it is also growing. We spend untold millions of dollars in this country, although the figure is not yet available. I hope that the joint committee will be able to quantify the figure we spend. We spend almost totally and completely on the element of supply. The little that is done to educate people about drugs is done by voluntary groups, with some help from government. These include such marvellous groups as Life Education, Ted Noffs's organisation, and a number of others; I cannot mention them all here. There is splendid work being done in the area, but basically by voluntary groups, with some government support. Belatedly, education departments around the country are trying some reasonable drug education, unlike what was served up in years gone by. Some public money is being spent in that direction, but the amount of money allocated to trying to control the market is infinitesimal compared to the money being spent on trying to control supply. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walters has seen something she does not like and most honourable senators would probably agree with her on that issue. In our community when one meets something one does not like, there are a number of approaches available. Probably the easiest and simplest approach, as I said at the beginning, is to ban it. Unfortunately, in a pluralistic society such as ours that simplistic approach, I believe, is not only illusory in terms of controlling the market but it is also illusory in terms of controlling the supply. In fact, worse than that, it can do positive harm to the institutions of our community. I point that out in the analogy I have used with regard to drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> The market seems to be relatively well differentiated in Australia. Various studies that have been conducted, various questionnaires and so forth, seem to suggest that approximately 40 per cent of Australians at some time have viewed the non-violent erotica material that is available from the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). My own State of Queensland is the largest purchaser of that material through the post. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite easily ascertained. All Senator Boswell has to do is ask and he can find out the number of people in Queensland who actually buy it through the post, compared to the number of people who buy it from other States. People selling it from here are quite happy to give the figures. All Senator Boswell has to do is ask. About 40 per cent of Australians may have viewed one of these videos. Indeed, at one time in my own State of Queensland-Mr Acting Deputy President, you would probably remember the time because you operated at that very time in the police force-one of our censors was the main source of pornographic material in Queensland. He reproduced this material and sold it through the police stations to football clubs who held blue movie nights for fund-raising. You probably know the person I am speaking of, Mr Acting Deputy President.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to see, from the figures provided in the ACT, that the return rate is about 4 per cent. There are a number of reasons for that, one of which is cost. My understanding is that hiring one of these videos costs around $25 whereas buying one costs about $50. If there were any grounds for banning the videos, it would be on the basis of complete lack of artistic merit. In that type of exercise, once bitten is twice shy. I think most Australians are sensible enough not to part with another $25 of their hard-earned money for that type of material, which is of such appalling quality. </PARA>
<PARA> What we know about the market is that there are people-male and female-relatively young, generally single but often married, who want this material for a range of reasons, obviously sexual. Sex is not a crime in Australia; it never has been and, hopefully, it never will be. It is a healthy human activity. The depiction of sexual activities occurs in an enormous range of movies, some of which are even classified for general exhibition. An example of this is kissing. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the classifications under the current regime the various depictions become more and more explicit to include the things Senator Walters has been open enough to put down in her Bill, unlike the rather coy way in which they are currently defined in the main Act, as suggested before by Senator Jenkins. In the classification of the market, we have people who are seeking these materials for a variety of sexual reasons. As I say, this does not constitute a crime; it never has and never will. </PARA>
<PARA> The market, I suggest, is unlikely to move. I have not heard any argument that the market is likely to diminish. As with drugs, the only way in which that market is likely to diminish is through reasonable educational programs and a change in values within our community. These factors have nothing to do with banning or not banning. As we have seen with the drug exercise, from the moment it was banned until now the industry has grown in leaps and bounds; the market has grown every year; the supply has grown every year. The only movement in the drug area, in terms of meeting and trying to wind back that market, has been through reasonable education programs directed towards the values of people within our community. I am not arguing about what people like or dislike; I am arguing about the efficacy of this particular exercise, whether people like to watch these videos or not. It is only by directing one's attention to the market that one will have any hope of success. I can assure Senator Walters that in directing her attention to supply she will have no effect whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an added reason for this. To take my own example, I own a video camera. Quite a few people in this country own video cameras, if the figures are anything to go by. If that is not the case, somebody is actually hoarding them. Videos are widespread within the community. As a community, we have a larger penetration of videos than anywhere else in the world, even in excess of the United States. We have a larger number of videos per household than anywhere else in the world. My video camera also has the capacity to be a video machine. I therefore have two videos and a camera in my home. I have all the equipment necessary to establish an industry to produce these movies. I do not need any more equipment. That equipment is easily purchasable in any store anywhere in Australia, at a relatively low cost. Technology is such that the reproduction from one video to another is of such high quality that it is the method used to produce videos for the industry here in the ACT. One simply dubs from one machine to 25 others and gets a copy. It is a simple, technical process. </PARA>
<PARA> To return to the drug analogy, even if we interdicted supply coming from overseas-which we do not do in this area because of the enormous number of ways in which drugs can come into this country-does Senator Walters really think, in terms of a clause in a Bill relating to the importation of video material, that we would interdict the supplies of videos? We would not. I can assure her of that. If she wants to know what methods will be used for getting them in, I can tell her that also. I do not want to put that on the public record because they are methods that are used by the drug industry as well for bringing drugs into this country. We do not interdict the supply there. Where untold billions of dollars are available we will not do it in Australia. If we do it here, it will be at the expense of pulling away police and community resources directed at the heinous drug trade. Alternatively we will have to expend much larger amounts of money to do that interdiction. I do not know whether members of the community are all that interested in spending their dollars and in paying higher taxes to undertake that particular activity. They were never asked that, by the way. On all the polls that have been quoted in these debates members of the community have never been asked the question: `Are you interested in paying out millions of dollars to interdict this trade?'. If we put a ban on, let us make it very clear that we will have to spend public funds to enforce it, otherwise it will be a stupid law. A ban on this type of material is not enforced cheaply, because of the easy way in which it can be reproduced by simple technology available to every citizen in the country. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the terms of the drug analogy I was using on the importation of drugs, one of the other things which is exercising the minds of the people who are concerned about the drug trade in this country is in fact the home grown variety, the stuff that is done in the kitchen, the stuff that is done by chemists in their basement or by chemistry graduates who know about the operation of various chemical formulae and are easily able to concoct many of these substances once they know the correct amounts. I refer to the design of drugs-for example, taking a small amount of cocaine and then operating on that cocaine by splitting it up and creating from one small dose 100 doses of crack. We know what crack has done particularly to the youth in the United States. Thank God it is not here to a great extent within our community at the moment. That is an example of what can happen indigenously, without imports. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of sexual depiction, one does not even need other chemicals, of which there may be a trace; all one needs is two people, three people or four people, whatever the particular film is that one is trying to produce. I do not know whether Senator Walters believes that somehow or other all these videos have to be produced in a major film studio. I do not know whether she has looked at them. I believe that she has seen some of them because she has been on the Joint Select Committee on Video Material. Their quality is so trashy that fairly obviously they could be produced in anybody's bedroom. The video makers do not need actors. Most of them do not employ actors already. They do not need a scriptwriter-because if there was a scriptwriter scripting the things that I have seen, he should be sacked. They do not need people who have any attributes other than sexual ones. These videos can be produced in Australia and then they can be reproduced in Australia. So the market will stay the same because nothing in Senator Walters's Bill actually tries to address the market. So we are not addressing the market; we are trying to address the supply, and yet it is impossible to address that supply. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point I want to make-I urge Senator Walters to take it seriously because it is a matter that I take very seriously indeed, having sat on a committee on drugs-is that this is a multimillion dollar industry and I do not want another dollar going to criminal tsars in this country. That is what will happen if we ban X-rated videos. They will simply wallow in that exercise and they will be happy with that exercise. It will be another lot of money into their pockets to corrupt institutions, to corrupt politicians and to corrupt judges. I have had enough of that in this country. I have had enough of it from our drug trade not to want to add to it by this. That is what I believe is the serious problem in this country-the corruption of our institutions. That is what will destroy our community. That is what is destroying our community at the moment. Unless we take that seriously, we are not taking anything seriously. I say to honourable senators with regard to this particular Bill: `Please address the serious issues which are affecting our community. Do not believe that because you do not like something there is a quick fix and it is just banning it and that that will solve the problem'. In our type of pluralist high technology community, banning videos will put $25m into the hands of criminals, and that is the last thing that I want. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable senators want to stand up in this debate and carry on with the absurd imputations that we have had, I am going to take points of order on them in future, because it is disorderly. In closing, I ask you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to call to order all senators who impute improper motives to senators in this debate as they have done in almost every speech that has been made to date without let or hindrance from the Chair. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was explaining before the suspension of the sitting for lunch, the amendment is to remove the figure `10' and replace it with the figure `5' so that a licence would remain in force for a period of five years and not a period of 10 years. I was explaining that the two reasons for that were that if my subsequent amendments are accepted-in other words, we are looking at a five-year phase-out-it would be appropriate then that the licence remain in force for only five years. I was explaining that, going beyond that, even if my later amendments are not accepted and one relies merely on the arguments which the Government earlier put down-namely, that although it was looking to implement the Montreal Protocol only at this stage, nonetheless it was anticipating that in the next few years as technology developed it would be possible to achieve a much faster phase-down-it is appropriate to limit the period of the licence to only five years. It would be clearly undesirable to have somebody with a licence which extended over 10 years and then find that two years in the future, which I believe is a reasonable period to anticipate, alternatives will be available and that those alternatives could be slotted in and for us to be locked in to a situation in which a licensee might claim that he had a licence to continue to use the existing chlorofluorocarbons because he had been granted a licence for 10 years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a couple of questions which require certain clarification by the Minister. Senator Cook, ably assisted as he is at the moment, will undoubtedly be able to give this clarification because his advisers know all about these clauses at this stage. The passage of these clauses might not be as easy as the passage of clause 18.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to the position of what one might call late entrants into the market-that is to say, people who had a quota. This matter is dealt with in part IV of the Bill, starting at clause 23. Part IV deals with people who might be described as late entrants into the market, who started their operations in 1986, the calendar year upon which the figures for the allocation of quotas are based and who, in recent years since 1986, have grown in terms of their market share. As the Minister would know-the Minister has had discussions on this matter-I refer particularly by way of example to a company called Casnik Pty Ltd which operates in the electorate of Macquarie in New South Wales where my colleague Mr Alasdair Webster has been assiduous in looking after its interests. This company is concerned that it will be put in a disadvantaged position because it came late into the market. It has built up its market share over the last couple of years and it is concerned that it will be particularly disadvantaged by the operation of the quota provisions of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that that is not necessarily the case because there are areas where exemptions might be provided for companies such as Casnik, which has a substantial business in the defence industry and, therefore, would be able to get certain exemptions, under various provisions of the legislation dealing with the national interest, for its supplies of cleaning material for the defence industry. It is primarily involved, for example, in the cleaning of circuit boards for the Royal Australian Air Force. I believe that that is part of the electronic operations for which some chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are still used, particularly CFC113. I simply want from the Minister, if the Minister is ready-I will not keep talking until Senator Richardson gets here-some sort of indication that companies that are late entrants into the market will not be specifically disadvantaged by the passage of this legislation. Other companies may not take up their full quota entitlements-I am leading the Minister somewhat-and, therefore, quota entitlements say be taken up by people who did not necessarily have them in 1986. Can these sorts of reassurances be given to operators in that area? Will the Government always be giving sympathetic consideration to small businesses which it would not want to pick on and disadvantage simply by the passage of this legislation?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand the point that has been raised by Senator Puplick. Let me quickly exploit my new-found knowledge on this subject before the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) arrives. The Minister, who has just arrived, may wish to gather his papers because I think I can answer the question that Senator Puplick has raised. If I cannot the Minister can supplement it. Of course, we would not comment on any company; nor is the honourable senator, I note, inviting us to do that. If companies came in to the market in 1986 they can seek licences in their own right. If the market share has increased they can seek some discretion on defence force commitments and, when they do, that issue will be considered on its merits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that the Bill is designed to ensure that there is no destruction of any new industries. That is not the intention of the Bill. But we are not encouraging any new industries to establish in this field. Where a market share increase can be demonstrated that will be considered, appropriately, on its merits. I do not know whether that is a sufficient guarantee for Senator Puplick. If it is not I will ask the Minister to supplement that point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was very disturbed to hear Senator Puplick speak so eloquently in defence of industry. When my own Bill was being debated, he similarly eloquently supported the case for industry. I wish he were as eloquent in defending the rights of the environment and the rights of ordinary people to an environment less polluted by short wave ultraviolet radiation. I point out that the matter of solvent use can be adequately addressed by the use of alternative solvents. Moreover, solvents in the electronics industry, to which he specifically referred, can be handled in closed systems so that one can achieve almost a 100 per cent recycling of the material which would evaporate from those circuit boards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I pointed out earlier, that process was aimed at in my private member's Bill, against which Senator Puplick spoke very strongly. I am disturbed to hear him argue so strongly in favour of industry where industry needs no protection, where alternative mechanisms are available to allow people to use alternative solvents or, if using CFC113, to recycle it to a very high level so that very small amounts are lost to the atmosphere. </PARA>

<PARA> (7) Page 13, subclause 30 (1), line 41, leave out ``3,800,000'', insert ``2,300,000''. </PARA>
<PARA>The clause which is before us is the most pernicious within the Government's Bill and I hope that the Opposition will support my amendment. The Government has made a great deal about this Bill giving effect to the Montreal Protocol and going beyond it. The Montreal Protocol takes 1986 as the reference year. It seeks initially to freeze the production, importation and export of ozone depleting substances at the 1986 level; to move to a 20 per cent reduction of the 1986 level by 1993; and to a 50 per cent reduction by the end of 1999. With respect to exports, this clause in the Government's Bill does not take 1986 as the reference year-it takes a figure which is very close to the 1987 export year. The effect of that is that in 1986 we exported 2,300 tonnes of these substances and in 1987 we exported 3,800 tonnes. The Government, quite deliberately, is moving away from both the intention and the purpose of the Montreal Protocol to establish a much higher initial level for the export from Australia of ozone depleting substances. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth mentioning that it goes on and compounds the error of this clause by not seeking to reduce exports by a fixed absolute amount in 1993 and 1999; rather, it sets annual quotas and reduces those quotas by 5 per cent per year. Again, it is not an absolute reduction of 5 per cent each year based on the initial figure of 3,800 tonnes, but 5 per cent per year with respect to the previous year's quota; in other words, an exponential decay in exports in which the reduction each year is less than the reduction achieved the year before. The effect is that Australia will not achieve a 50 per cent reduction in exports until the year 2013 instead of, as under the Protocol, the year 1999. As a result, manufacturers are allowed an enormous loophole in exporting ozone depleting substances, which would not be the case if the full application of the Montreal Protocol applied. It is perhaps the worst example of the consultation which has gone on between government and industry and which has been made a great deal of by both the Minister and industry. Clearly, this consultation has led to the Government placing a very convenient loophole in the legislation through which companies can continue to manufacture and export ozone depleting substances. </PARA>
<PARA> The effects are quite disastrous with respect to the alternative approach which we might take to the control of these substances. Honourable senators will recall that the legislation which I introduced into this place took an alternative line. Rather than seeking control of manufacture, import and exports, it sought to control by way of recycling and emission controls. If that legislation, which is still on the Notice Paper, were debated to its completion and passed, I believe that we could achieve about a 95 per cent reduction in the emissions of ozone depleting substances from Australia very quickly. Under those conditions we would not need to manufacture nearly as much of these materials. What would happen to the excess manufacture? The companies, according to the clause which the Government has put in the Bill-the loophole which the Government has written in-could merely export their excess production. The loophole would completely circumvent any later efficacy which the passage of my Bill would have. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats will seek to divide on this matter if it does not receive the support of either the Government or the Opposition. I make a very strong plea that the amendment be accepted and that we replace the 3,800,000 units expressed in the Bill, in terms of ozone depleting units, with the figure of 2,300,000, which would bring the figure into line with the 1986 level of exports and into line with the terms of the Montreal Protocol, as it should be-according to what the Government claims it is doing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will not support Senator Coulter's amendment. It is correct to say that his proposal winds back the permitted quantity of exports of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) to the 1986 base year. The Government Bill before us in effect deals with an export quota which is to be based, roughly, on the 1987 level. Perhaps it would be better to say that it is the current contractual level. I think that that is a more accurate way of putting it as far as permissible quantities are concerned. The principle of retrospective operation, particularly of legislation which in that sense imposes penalty, has been the subject of considerable debate on a number of occasions. We on this side of the chamber have made it quite clear that the imposition of retrospective arrangements such as that which would flow as a consequence of Senator Coulter's amendment is not something that we are prepared to endorse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to return to a point I made earlier in our consideration of the legislation. It deals with two matters relating to export and is worth repeating. Firstly, a genuine choice arises concerning the extent to which simply withdrawing Australia from an exporting role will achieve an overall global reduction of the problem as it is at the moment, or whether it will simply encourage other people to become manufacturers or to take up the slack which Australia's withdrawal from the field may have occasioned. I would not under any circumstances want to provoke Senator Vallentine to come back into the debate, but it is precisely the same argument as one has about the export of uranium. </PARA>
<PARA> I invite Senator Richardson to comment on the parallel in that respect in order to give him the opportunity to draw the fine distinction, which he may wish to do, between the Government's position and those strands of the argument pursued from a consistent point of view on this side of the chamber in part as to whether if we are to have a situation in which there will be an inevitable use of certain products-in this case an inevitable use of CFCs-simply walking back from the position as far as Australia is concerned, claiming the moral high ground on the matter but making no realistic contribution to the overall global problem, will achieve anything. In terms of Australia's exports-previously I mentioned the export of pharmaceutical products and discussed at some length the position in which Glaxo Australia Pty Ltd finds itself with the expansion of its program of exports-simply viewing that as something that should be walked back from because it will make a contribution to the global solution to the problem is quite unrealistic. </PARA>
<PARA> If the countries in our region are unable to obtain the product from Australia, they will be forced either to obtain it from other sources-and there are plenty of other sources around-or they will be pressured into getting into their own domestic manufacture. I put it to the Committee that the way in which they will go about manufacturing will not be as environmentally secure, safe, controlled, regulated or as much within the ambit of the Protocol and the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer as is the case with manufacture in Australia. If I believed that by Australia taking this step there would be a significant global reduction in the amount of CFCs with which we are dealing, I would find the proposition attractive. It is simply not attractive. It is simply a piece of window-dressing in that sense and I do not believe that it ought to be supported. </PARA>
<PARA> The addition the Opposition has already made to this legislation with the insertion of the exhortatory clause 3 (c) is designed to indicate what the Parliament's attitude on the overall question really is. As I said when discussing that matter, I do not believe advantage is gained by putting in specific dates or specific figures in the way Senator Coulter has argued. Undoubtedly Senator Coulter will say that the fact that I have at least been honest enough to draw the parallel with uranium indicates the degree of moral corruption that he believes pervades the whole of the Opposition's position. Having now been, for the first time in my political life, accused of being soft on industry and a rabid spokesman for the developers and industrialists and undoubtedly for the wicked capitalists of this world, as I was a few minutes ago-something that I wish a few more people on this side of the chamber believed-I do not believe that the proposition put forward by Senator Coulter is reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this for three reasons, which I shall restate briefly. First, I do not believe in the legislation being passed in a way which has retrospective operation, going back to the 2.3 million figure rather than the 3.8 million figure which is in the legislation. Secondly, I believe that the initiatives which have been taken in areas such as the expansion of our pharmaceutical exports are important in Australia's national interest as much as anybody else's. Thirdly, the reduction from Australia will not constitute anything of a global reduction but will simply invite domestic manufacture in other places or replacement of Australian sourced material by material from other sources. For those three reasons Senator Coulter's amendment will not be supported by the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish Senator Puplick's eloquence were matched by his logic, but in this case I am afraid that, woefully, it is not. He himself drew attention this morning to the figures relating to the pharmaceutical uses of the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and pointed out that Australia currently consumes some 170 tonnes of CFCs in this use and that the industry itself has indicated it expects that figure eventually to plateau at about 260 tonnes a year. Yet here we are looking at the Government marking up the allowable exports beyond 1986 and the Montreal Protocol year by a matter of 1,500 tonnes. Certainly Senator Puplick cannot claim that the difference between 170 tonnes and 260 tonnes-which in my arithmetic is 90 tonnes-expansion is any justification for pushing up the allowable exports by as much as 1,500 tonnes. The figures simply do not match.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Puplick multiplies those figures by 1000, the figures come into line. The second point that showed a considerable flaw in Senator Puplick's argument was when he spoke about the current contractual level. He indicated that he placed a higher priority on commercial contracts than on the moral contract, and the legal contract which is implicit in our entering into the Montreal Protocol and on which this legislation is heavily based. In discussions with the Minister's Department, great emphasis was placed on the fact that most of this legislation relies on the external affairs powers. It relies on the fact that we are a signatory to the Montreal Protocol. Under that protocol we are obliged to take 1986 as the reference year. I would place a great deal more emphasis on that contract, which is both a legal and a moral contract, to take that lower level and to reduce from it, than on the argument raised by Senator Puplick, which places much greater emphasis on commercial contracts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Even if one were to accept what Senator Puplick said on that matter, he is implying that the only way to fulfil those contracts is through the continual export of the substances listed in group 1 of Annex A of the Montreal Protocol. He totally ignores the fact that, as indicated earlier, alternatives-which are already available and which we believe will be available in commercial quantities by 1991-could adequately fulfil those contracts. They are substitutes which can be immediately slotted into existing uses in refrigeration and air-conditioning. The present Government makes a great deal of the need to develop up to date new technology to put Australian industry in a competitive position with respect to industries overseas and, if possible, to take a lead. Yet here Senator Puplick defends a continuation of a technology which, by its very definition and by the fact that this legislation is before us, is rapidly passing out of favour, which is out of date and which we know will not persist for very long. For those reasons I believe there is no substance whatever in any of the arguments put up by Senator Puplick. It is desirable for those commercial reasons that we restrict the export and quickly develop in Australia industries which make the alternative materials, the substitutes. Those are the things we will export to other countries rather than continuing to attempt to export particularly CFC11 and CFC12. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are some dreadful distortions in some of the things that Senator Coulter has been saying. I hate to be cast in the role of the defender of Senator Puplick, but I am sure he can manage that if he thinks it necessary. I have been criticised a little by industry in recent times, and I have criticised industry when necessary. However, one cannot adopt the pose, as Senator Coulter has been doing for some time, that at all times industry must be under suspicion and must be criticised. The posing from Senator Coulter that has gone on in the last few minutes is quite extraordinary. One wonders what we will achieve if we decide to ban exports. I remember the 1982 Australian Labor Party conference-I have been trying to forget it for a while, but it is hard-where two things happened that were of note. The first was the now famous, or infamous, uranium debate which took a long time to get through and was all about, in the end, existing contracts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In fact, I said that he would not win, and I was right again. The debate at the time centred on existing contracts and how any government could or would upon election move in and force companies to cancel contracts which had been running for some time. Obviously compensation was a question, but it was not only a question of compensation; it was the legitimate question of how reasonable it was to do that. In my view, and in the view of the majority, it was preposterous. I say the same thing here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats continually say that we have to take this matter back to the Protocol and the Convention. The fact is that the Protocol and the Convention do not provide for export control. We do not have an argument about exports in that regard, and the Democrats know that. So they should not keep saying that we have to go back to the Protocol to find out what we should do about exports. This is the only country, I might add for Senator Coulter's benefit, that is talking about exports at all. For all the talk about how we have been passed by other countries-which is a nonsense-no one else is even worried about exports. But we are signalling to the industry-and the industry is prepared to accept the signal-that the exports have to be wound back. If we set 5 per cent as the quota for that winding back, it will be possible for the companies to manage that without causing too much disruption, not just to themselves-this is not an argument about just the companies-but to the customers. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us turn to the question of the customers. Already China has entered into the production cycle of ozone depleting substances, and, we are led to believe, is greatly increasing that production to meet the requirements of the number of its citizens who are now acquiring refrigerators. Throughout the developing world, or the Third World, it simply will not be possible to have all new technologies implemented immediately. Given that not every citizen in the Third World has an air conditioner or refrigeration-perhaps only a few-the reality is that it will be some time before that situation will be able to be changed. It will not change as quickly as that of a country such as Australia, and obviously it cannot. Clearly we use far more of these substances than anybody else. But all we can do by opting out and saying we will no longer export is make certain that either China steps up its production and takes up the slack-which it can quite easily do; with no reduction whatsoever-or, alternatively, that another country enters the production cycle. That is a certainty, because the need certainly will not disappear. If I can stand up at an Australian Labor Party conference-and, God knows, this may well get Senator Vallentine and Senator Dunn in here-and say that I have never believed that Australia had the right to say to the citizens of Japan or anywhere else, `You are no longer to have electric light or heat because we have determined unilaterally that we will no longer export uranium to you', then I must apply the same argument here. I cannot very well say that we will deny the countries of the Pacific and Asia the right to refrigeration and air-conditioning in the short term-and we are, of course, speaking only of the short term. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the 3,800 tonnes that has been referred to was chosen as the base line figure for existing contracts. There is no great secret about that. It has naught to do with 1986 levels. As I said, this proposal is not covered at all by the Protocol, which obviously recognised that exports would continue. Given that throughout the Third World CFCs are being looked at for relatively simple low technology refrigeration, and given that there will not be scope for huge reductions overnight in that consumption, any suggestion that we will dramatically reduce the quota here is not only wrong in principle but also it will achieve nothing at the end of the day. If we really believe that the 20 per cent reductions annually to which Senator Coulter refers would in some way be matched by a 20 per cent reduction in end use, then we are really deluding ourselves. I would hope that we are not all about the politics of delusion or about posing. I would hope just occasionally we could address what is actually happening. I believe that that is what this clause does, and, at the risk of a division, the Government indicates that it cannot accept Senator Coulter's amendment. </PARA>

I have been trying to find the sections in the Convention and the Protocol which deal with exports. They are mentioned, but I just cannot put my hand on it.

That figure is lower than that for existing contracts and was arrived at by averaging the 1987 and 1988 levels of exports. That is to put the matter precisely; I had not made it clear. I was saying before the break that, obviously, Australia has gone further than the Protocol on the question of exports. As a developed nation we have a responsibility to provide less developed countries, particularly those in our region, which do not produce chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) with supplies of substances so that they are able to meet their needs for products which we might consider basic necessities. I referred to refrigeration and air-conditioning in that respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is impossible to believe that low consuming, very poor nations can pare down consumption to the same extent as Australia can. Senator Coulter distorted statements that I had made. When I claimed that larger reductions were achievable, I was referring to developed nations such as our own rather than to countries that are still developing. Obviously, in the developing countries there is not the use of products that may be considered trivial by our standards, such as the use of personal care products or consumer packaging. Our actions will enable us to fulfil existing export contracts while at the same time signal to industry and to its consumers here and overseas that the Australian Government considers the issue important, that we expect industry to address it, that we expect reductions to occur and that we expect the consumers, the end users, even in developing countries, to acknowledge that there will be some small reduction over time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two interesting things arise from the Minister's reply. He still seems to be saying that the only chlorofluorocarbons which even people in under developed countries can use are chlorofluorocarbons 11 and 12. The whole point about the development of new substances is that they have properties very similar to chlorofluorocarbons 11 and 12 in terms of their boiling points and their expansion coefficients and, therefore, they can be substituted directly into equipment which would normally use 11 and 12. So the Minister's argument regarding under developed countries can be turned back. As I have indicated, we can develop these alternative substances here. We can make them in our factories and send them overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was also interested in the Minister's comments with respect to the 3,800 tonne level being between the 1987 and 1988 export levels and lower than the level for existing contracts, which seems to me to undercut totally the whole basis of Senator Puplick's argument as to why we should support that figure. Clearly, if it is less than that for existing contractual arrangements the Government is already coming in with a figure that is less. I wonder whether Senator Puplick, in view of his support for industry, would like to push the figure even higher. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has not answered the second part of my question, relating to the rate of reduction of 5 per cent which flows from this figure and whether it in any way accords with the nature of these contracts over succeeding years or whether it is an arbitrary figure that has been dreamt up by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry. I had neglected to answer that question. It was an oversight, it was not intentional. The 5 per cent reduction is not calculated to match the length of term of the contracts to which we were referring. It is, as I have just said, a signal to industry and consumers that we expect reductions. We have, therefore, set down a figure which we believe to be practical and able to be met, not just by industry but by end users in the Third World.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (8) Page 15, subclause 32 (1), line 24, at end of subclause, add ``and reducing the figure thereby arrived at by the figure that is 20 per cent of the quota that applied in the first quota period''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment is aimed, as I have already indicated several times in this debate, at achieving a five-year complete phase out or, in other words, a twenty per cent absolute reduction each year. That was why the figure is tied back to the first quota period. I will have more to say about the tying of the reductions to the immediately previous quota period when we get on with the next clause. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to this reduction, I ask the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) about the use of corporation powers. In discussing this matter with members of his staff, I had been led to believe that the Minister's concern over accepting figures different from the Montreal Protocol related more to concern over the use of corporation powers and mixing those powers with the external affairs powers under the Constitution than to the practicability of achieving faster reductions. I am a little puzzled that, this evening in debating the suggested amendments so far, the Minister has relied entirely on arguments based on the notion that to attempt to achieve faster reductions would be practically impossible. I wish to know to what extent the Minister's arguments, both on this clause and on my other amendments disputing the thrust of my contentions, are based on a concern which he has over the possible dependence upon powers other than the external affairs powers. I ask further whether he has any doubts about relying on the corporation powers in section 51 (xx) of the Australian Constitution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are talking about the difference between a constitutional preference and a practical imperative on this occasion. It is not exhortatory. If one looks at what we are examining now, we are being asked to amend the Bill to incorporate a total phase out of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons by 1995. One would have to query on what basis this date was chosen. Is it because of some evidence which has come to hand which indicates that this will be the practical time? Is it because substitutes for all the current uses will be found by that particular year? If the answers to those questions are yes, I would be fascinated to hear the details. I would like to know just how Senator Coulter came by that date because all of the information that I have suggests that that just is not possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at some examples. At present, there are no known substitutes for the halons. As we have all agreed, the first priority is to limit the usage of ozone depleting substances. I think that that is at least a common ground around the chamber and I have no doubt that there will be considerable success in reducing usage over the next few years. Substitutes for essential uses in respect of halons, nonetheless, will not be available in commercial quantities by 1995. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier, I referred to toxicity testing for the CFCs. I think I mentioned that the lifetime testing in that respect has some years to go before completion. It is hoped that the testing of those substitutes might be completed by 1993. If that is the case, one wonders just how much of those substitutes will be available in commercial quantities just two years later. I suspect that there will not be enough to go around and we would have to ask whether a total phase-out was possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Some essential uses of CFCs in aerosols will not have substitutes available in that time scale. Obviously, Senator Puplick's vested interest would be one of those areas in which that would be highly unlikely. It is even more than highly unlikely; it is just not on. I have also used asthma sprays, although fortunately not for some years now. I do not suppose the chamber is terribly interested, but I have not had to use a spray for nearly 10 years. Nonetheless, I know how important they are to so many people. With respect to refrigeration and air-conditioning units, even if there were a 100 per cent recycling, there would still be unavoidable losses. There would be leaks and accidents that would require some topping up with existing ozone-depleting substances. I do not understand how Senator Coulter can pretend that this date has any practical application. </PARA>
<PARA> In the coming years, this Government and, on the indications of Senator Puplick tonight, the Opposition, will be united in the desire to phase out ozone-depleting substances as soon as practicable, but we will not nominate arbitrary dates that at the moment are not technically feasible. Therefore, the Government rejects the amendment. From my comments I would have thought that Senator Coulter might have got the drift about the importance of the corporations power as against the foreign affairs powers as against the practical application. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to hear that reply and place on the record that my understanding in relation to corporations power is that within six weeks a committee will report on the corporations power. A large amount of legislation which is not to be proclaimed deals with the corporations power. The Government expects that power to be tested in the High Court this year and a judgment is to be given within about six months. My information is that the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) gave evidence before that committee to the effect that the corporations power will hold and that the Commonwealth had the power to legislate in this area. I am pleased at least to the extent that the Minister says he is not now relying on the information which was given to me in relation to the corporations power in opposing the figure I have cited.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Puplick did earlier, the Minister used some quite misleading figures. He went back over the pharmaceutical figures, although the Bill clearly sets out exclusion clauses which would allow the continuation of those uses which both he and Senator Puplick on previous occasions have defended. Therefore, it appears to me that the argument regarding those essential uses does not hold any water whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> More importantly, the Minister questions why I have attempted to achieve a much faster rate of phasing out chlorofluorocarbons. I hope that the Minister looked at the graphs which I incorporated in Hansard when I spoke during the second reading debate. It is quite clear from what we know about the long residence times of chlorofluorocarbons in the stratosphere that once they get to the stratosphere the two chlorofluorocarbons concerned, Nos. 11 and 12, have very long residence times indeed. They are estimated to be in the order of 75 to 150 years. Those graphs were predicated on a very conservative estimate of residence times, namely, a half life of 30 years in the stratosphere. Nonetheless, the graph showed that under the Government's Bill as it stands the concentration of those chlorofluorocarbons, put there by Australia, would be greater 100 years from now than it was in 1986. In other words, the Government's Bill will do nothing effectively to reduce the concentration of chlorofluorocarbons in the stratosphere for which Australia is responsible. The effect of the Government's measure will be simply to flatten the curve. There would be a very slow decay after an initial rise. Eventually the 1986 level would be reached, but the level would not go down to that low level until well over a century hence. When the Minister questions why I chose such a short period, I point out that I chose it quite deliberately as being an achievable time frame in which to achieve the most rapid cutback in the level of CFCs in the stratosphere in the future. If honourable senators look at the curves on the graphs, they will see that even with a 5-year phase-out there would still be substantial amounts of CFCs in the stratosphere, put there by Australia, even under those stringent cutback terms. </PARA>
<PARA> For the first time, the Minister also brought into the debate the matter of halons. He indicated that there are essential uses for halons. I would like to know what those essential uses are, because it is my understanding that even some computer companies are now going back to the use of water in computer installations, finding that the halons are not as effective as earlier claimed. I refer to their use as fire extinguishants, a horrible term but one which one finds in the literature. Indeed, many computer components can be washed down and the computers can be returned into use. In the past, many people argued that halons had a unique and irreplaceable property. My understanding is that several of the major computer manufacturers now prefer to use water instead of halons. I find it very difficult to imagine other uses which could be properly classified as essential. For those reasons, I again stress my belief that a faster phase-out period is achievable. My reasons for choosing the shortest practicable time is that it will achieve a reduction in stratospheric ozone-depleting substances which the Government's Bill simply will not achieve. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am always mindful of what my leader tells me. This week I and other Ministers have certainly been told to watch our language. Our demeanour has to be spot on. We are not to offend delicate sensibilities. However, I am straining at the bit when it comes to the comments Senator Coulter has just made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first thing the honourable senator did was refer to the graph he put into Hansard. Really, I do not know how many honourable senators have had a look at that graph, but it is a joke. Senator Coulter must be dealing with a different Bill. The only other explanation is that he deliberately refused to read part VI. He cannot have taken that into consideration at all, because his graph equates the Montreal protocol with the Government Ozone Protection Bill 1988. Despite the fact that we are going at twice the pace, his graph depicts us as exactly the same. That is rot. It is either a deliberate distortion or it is ignorance. There is simply no other alternative. I cannot believe that Senator Coulter would not have read part VI. I am not going to read that section now. I am sure there is no need for me to read it now. But if after any reading of that section he can say that this is the same as the Montreal protocol, then I have serious doubts about him and the Australian Democrats. Mind, I have pretty serious doubts after this election anyway. I am more than concerned that he would even say something like that. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter then compounded that by the reference he made to, I think he said, several major computer companies which were doing away with the use of halons and using water. I do not know how many ships sail the ocean. I do not know how many planes fly through the skies. I do not know how many tanks roll around the Middle East or around Afghanistan or around a whole lot of other countries. </PARA>

<PARA> (9) Page 16, clause 33, line 11, leave out ``5%'', insert ``20%''. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that we have already dealt with the substance of this amendment; that is, to reduce exports by 20 per cent per year instead of 5 per cent per year as indicated in clause 33 as it stands. I do not think that there is any need to labour the point further except to draw attention again to the way in which the Minister has indicated that the adoption of the starting figure is not related to the exports of any particular year and was in fact less than the contractual arrangements; in other words, undercutting the arguments which Senator Puplick first put up in defence of those, and that the figure of 5 per cent reduction per year again, by the Minister's own admission, was adopted quite arbitrarily and does not relate in any way to actual long term contracts. The figure of 20 per cent which I have just moved is consistent with the figure on which we have just voted. I shall, therefore, not be calling a division on it, but I ask the Government and the Opposition, bearing in mind the arbitrariness of the 5 per cent figure, whether perhaps they would be prepared to consider some other figure greater than 5 per cent. As I indicated both in my second reading speech and earlier this day, starting from the higher figure of 3.8 million units and reducing it 5 per cent per year on a previous year's quota-in other words, an exponential decay rate-Australia does not get to 50 per cent of its 1986 exports until the year 2013. It worries me that that indeed is an extension beyond the 50 per cent cut by 1999 which is included in the Montreal Protocol. </PARA>
<PARA> I only partly accept the assertion by the Minister that the Protocol does not mention exports; the Protocol does mention exports. I would have to agree that it does not mention exports. I would have to agree that it does not mention exports in terms of precise cuts in exports, but I think that the controls on exports which are written into the Protocol are sufficiently clear that there is an implied cut in exports, which this Bill does not achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> So I ask whether the Government and the Opposition, if not prepared to accept the figure of 20 per cent, which clearly they are not, are prepared to accept some other figure which would indeed achieve a 50 per cent reduction in exports by the year 1999. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The history of clause 37 is perhaps worth dealing with. I regret that the situation has arisen that it has turned out in this particular fashion. In November 1988 representations were made on the part of the Attorney-General of the Northern Territory to Senator Richardson drawing his attention to certain matters which I think were then in what was clause 33 of the Bill at that stage before the Bill had undergone certain amendments. In effect, the Government of the Northern Territory was drawing attention to the fact that in the current Bill as we have it before us, clause 37 subclause (3) states: In this section, `Territory' does not include the Northern Territory. If one had read the structure of the whole of clause 37 one would have seen that that sub-clause defined `Territory' as excluding the Northern Territory. As a result, a difficulty arose in terms of the proper understanding of paragraphs (b) and (c) of sub-clause (2) of the same clause to the effect that trade and commerce among the States and between a State and a Territory, other than the Northern Territory, was covered, but not trade or commerce between a State and the Northern Territory or between a Territory other than the Northern Territory and the Northern Territory. It was necessary, therefore, for some amendment to be drawn up which would overcome that problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has introduced three amendments to this clause which exclude the Northern Territory, by definition, from the precise operations of those activities which are covered in clause 37 (1) (d); which relates to `a body corporate incorporated in a Territory' other than the Northern Territory and clause 37 (2) (c) which relates to `trade or commerce within a Territory, between a State and a Territory or between 2 Territories'. They are now to include the words `other than the Northern Territory' and sub-clause (3) which defines `Territory' to exclude the Northern Territory has now been removed. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, that is the purport of the whole thing. In November last year Mr Manzie, the Attorney-General of the Northern Territory, made representations to my friend and colleague Senator Tambling, the senator for the Northern Territory. Indeed, he is the senator who most ably and almost exclusively represents the proper interests of the Northern Territory in this place. Senator Tambling raised the matter with me as the shadow Minister concerned and I had the opportunity to discuss these matters with the Minister's advisers. I am grateful to the Minister's advisers for those discussions. I will not necessarily try, as Senator Coulter has on a previous occasion, to relate in detail the nature of the advice which I received from the Minister's advisers, or the advice which I received subsequently from the Minister about whether all of this was necessary; that is something for the memoirs. The more important point to make, however, is that because of the way the legislation currently before us had been drawn quite clearly there was a hiatus, a difficulty, in terms of regulating the degree of interstate trade and commerce, either within a Territory or between a State and a Territory or between two Territories and the definition of a body corporate incorporated in a Territory read against the sub-clause which defined `Territory' not to include the Northern Territory. The amendments which have been moved by the Government this evening are designed to expunge the clause which defines a Territory to not include the Northern Territory and include in the Bill words to the effect that a Territory in each of the sub-clauses here relevant is to be taken as a Territory other than the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> With that precise and lucid explanation, which I am sure Senator Reynolds would have given if she had been asked in a nicer fashion, that is the purport of the Government's amendments as I understand them. I am sure that the Minister would be only too happy to indicate the nature of the very civilised relationship which has taken place to bring about this significant improvement in a piece of legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the words of a great learned judge, I concur. I said that I would not graciously acknowledge Senator Puplick's role, but I will do my best to come within the definition of grace by saying that this matter was raised last year, although Senator Tambling's correspondence from the Northern Territory was raised with me because Senator Puplick gave it to one of my staff during the second reading debate. I was not aware of the correspondence prior to that. Advice at the time suggested that this was not a problem and that no amendment was necessary. Senator Puplick again raised this matter with me in the chamber, I think prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner. Being diligent, as I always am, I had another look at it and asked my staff and officers of the Department to examine the question one more time. On that further examination we came to the conclusion that Senator Puplick and Senator Tambling were right in respect of the representations they had made; hence the amendments that are before us now, which Senator Reynolds moved before I returned to the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having listened to Senator Puplick I do not think I will go into any detail about what is in the amendments as he seems to have covered them syllable by syllable. Finally, I am confident that this will resolve the problem which Senator Puplick and Senator Tambling have drawn to my attention. </PARA>

I hope that, when he writes his memoirs, he does not write them in the terms which he used in his explanation tonight.

<PARA>I will not seek to divide on this matter. The amendment which I have moved is to tie the reduction of the quota to the initial quota; in other words, the 5 per cent reduction is a 5 per cent reduction with respect to the previous year's quota, it is a 5 per cent absolute reduction each year with respect to the first quota. Five per cent per year absolute would mean that we would get a complete phase-out over 20 years. A 5 per cent reduction on each previous year's quota would mean that we would have a much longer period; indeed, we would have an infinite series and we would never get a complete reduction. So I commend that amendment to the committee. I believe that it is a very modest reduction in the amount of allowable ozone depleting substances which could be exported. Therefore, it is certainly quite defensible, even within the terms which the Minister has outlined. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Coulter thought that my penultimate comment was a massacre of the English language, I inform him that we now have a most interesting one which occurs in the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees-Imports) Bill at clause 4 (3) and in the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees-Manufacture) Bill at clause 4 (3). In both cases the clause reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For the purposes of subsection (1), where a licence is only in force for part of a particular quarter, that part shall be taken to be a quarter. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, the Bill should read: `where a licence is in force for only part of a particular quarter, that part shall be taken to be a quarter'. The word `only' has been misplaced. I repeat that the Bills before us state:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . where a licence is only in force for part of a particular quarter . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The clause should read: `where a licence is in force for only part of a particular quarter, that part shall be taken to be a quarter'.

I am sure that the Minister and his erudite advisers will have no difficulty whatsoever in accepting the request that ought to be made by the Committee. Seeing that the principal Bill has to go back to the House of Representatives for amendment, I am sure that the Minister will be only too happy to accept a request to both of the Bills so as to remove the word `only' from where it appears at the moment and recast it so that, instead of reading `where a licence is only in force for part of a particular quarter' it will read `where a licence is in force for only part of a particular quarter'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendment to clause 46 with which the Committee is now dealing was moved on 8 November by the Australian Democrats, the perennial populists, who are ever eager to add a few dupes to their electoral base. They moved an amendment which, on superficial examination, seems to protect or enhance the interests of some women who have been separated. In fact, it would impose a retrospective liability for capital gains taxation in particular circumstances. The technical details were put on record by me on 8 November and can be found in Hansard on pages 2225-6.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition at that time-I presume in ignorance-supported the Democrat amendment. The Opposition now knows that the amendment would impose a retrospective tax liability, to which the Opposition says it is trenchantly opposed. As I said, I believe the Opposition made that original decision in ignorance, but rather than admit to its ignorance, and by implication its indolence and incompetence, I understand that it intends to continue supporting the amendment and hoping that nobody will notice. Let me make it clear that everybody who votes for this amendment is voting for a proposal which will impose on some people-admittedly a small number, but that makes no difference to the principle-a retrospective liability for capital gains taxation. So everybody who votes for this amendment is saying to the electorate of this nation that he or she has no objection in principle to the application of retrospective taxation liabilities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) is being especially kind tonight, and his remarks have to be taken with exactly the same grain of salt as that with which we usually take his remarks on whatever matter he is dealing with. He is simply trying to throw a dead cat into the chamber and obviously does not understand, nor has he thought through, the implications of what he has just said. The fact is that he admitted that the number who would be affected as a result of the amendment, if carried, is very few indeed. It is clear from representations that have been made, and I am sure the Democrats agree with this, that there are considerably more people who will be affected by this situation if the matter is not corrected tonight in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The simple fact is that the Government introduced the capital gains tax on 19 September 1985. It then announced on 20 January 1988, nearly 2 1/2 years later, that it would exclude a certain group of divorced persons who will have acquired assets in the breakup of a marriage from their former spouse and who previously with that spouse controlled a family company or trust. It is a highly technical situation, but the balance of concern on this issue falls clearly on the side of giving the benefit of the doubt to those people, mainly women, who would be trapped in a situation where they will suffer the capital gains tax, a factor which the Government now refuses to acknowledge. That is why the Opposition supports the amendment. The Government can carry on about some technical aspect, but clearly in our judgment a number of persons will suffer if the Bill is not amended. Therefore, we support the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I repeat that the Minister has had since 8 November 1988, with all the expert advice he has from advisers, to sort out this matter. On that occasion Senator Walsh did not know what this was all about and was leaning over to take advice from his experts so that he would know what to say next. The Minister has had since last November to work out a system to prevent anomalies such as he has now put forward. He could have removed liability to capital gains tax when such a tax has been incurred following the breakdown of marriage. This could have been done in relation to any property held in trust or in a company which has passed to a spouse in a breakup. Action could have been taken by the Government to prevent this problem, and I believe it can still be done. In fact, I drafted an amendment for consideration on the previous occasion to cover this matter. However, the Opposition decided to support the amendment suggested by the Australian Democrats. I believe that even the amendment I envisaged would have fixed the matter. I believe that the situation can still be fixed now. The matter was postponed on 8 November because the Government and its advisers could not produce the right sort of wording in an amendment. I am disappointed that after so many months the Government still has not reached a solution. I believe that a satisfactory end to this matter can still be achieved by the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendment that is being debated by the Committee to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) relates to the roll-over provisions. The particular group of people affected are those who in the period between 20 September 1985, when the capital gains tax came in, and 28 January 1988 were involved in a breakup of marriage. Any transfer of property that took place prior to 20 September 1985 would not have attracted capital gains tax as there was not any, and post-28 January, the period covered by this legislation, the same consideration will apply. However, in that other period there is a large group of people who potentially could be disadvantaged, and some actually have been disadvantaged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Finance raised what I took to be debating points, although the Minister has the unfortunate manner of not wanting to debate a matter but rather to abuse other people. That is his particular style. We can contrast his style in opening this particular debate with that of the Minister in the previous debate, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson). He was willing to debate in a robust fashion but without abusing people. In this way we can travel through legislation; we may not get what we want, but at least there has been an effective and robust debate. There is not a debate with this Minister, because he thinks that abuse is a substitute for reason. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not yet heard whether the Minister believes there are any people who have been disadvantaged by the current law. What he was saying is that there may be some people who will be disadvantaged by the amendment. It seems that the Minister will not accept that there are people disadvantaged by the current law. I found his last comment by way of interjection a very strange one. He said, `It is not our responsibility'. I thought it probably was. It is the Government's Bill; honourable senators opposite are in government. I would have thought that if unintended consequences arise from previous legislation-and this is an unintended consequence, as has already been admitted in the debate-and are pointed out to the Government, it is their responsibility to make sure they fix up those unintended consequences. If they find technical defects in amendments which are presented, they can do what was done last time-adjourn the debate. That was a most reasonable move for the Senate to take. We adjourned the debate so that the Government could go back and consider the matter. It is fairly obvious-as is obvious in respect of most of these matters that the Minister is involved in-that there has not been any reconsideration of the matter. There has been the bluster and the normal abuse hurled around, which is the substitute that this Minister uses. It does not worry me; I do not think it worries many people here. But it is a pity that the Government has not been willing to address this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Senate is compelled to press on with this amendment, because we know the difficulty is there and the Government refuses to address the issue. I believe that the Senate should support the amendment that was moved on 8 November. </PARA>

<PARA>``(15) Where:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a Crown Lease (in this subsection called the ``original lease'') of land (in this subsection called the ``original land'') has been granted to a taxpayer;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) after the grant of the original lease, the original land came to be vested in or held by a government authority; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the government authority granted to the taxpayer under a statutory law of the Commonwealth, of a State or of a Territory a lease (in this subsection called the ``fresh lease'') of the original land, or of that land less an excised area or together with an additional area;</PARA>
<PARA>then, for the purposes of this section, the fresh lease shall be taken to be a Crown Lease and to have been granted by way of renewal of the original lease. </PARA>
<PARA>``(16) If there was a period between the end of the term of the original lease referred to in subsection (15) and the beginning of the term of the fresh lease so referred to, that period shall not be taken to preclude the fresh lease from being regarded for the purposes of that subsection as a renewal of the original lease provided that the taxpayer concerned continued in occupation of the original land during that period under a permission, licence or authority granted by the relevant government authority pending the grant of the fresh lease.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment proposes the insertion of new subsections (15) and (16). It relates to capital gains tax roll-over provisions concerning crown leases. The Committee will probably not remember, but during discussion on this Bill in early November last year an amendment was carried to the legislation which protected persons who were forced by compulsory acquisition to accept terms and conditions by the acquirer for crown lease land which covered somewhat different circumstances than were set down in the original lease held by the leaseholder. The amendment concerned a particular case known as Yencken, in Melbourne. The amendment was moved by the Australian Democrats and had the support of the Liberal and National parties. </PARA>
<PARA> I now bring to the attention of the Committee a similar case, which is the subject of the amendment I have just moved. It goes to show how technically deficient and difficult is the capital gains tax, as are any amendments which need to be made to it. The situation, which affects the holder of a special lease of crown property administered by the Land Administration Commission for the Brisbane wharves has been brought to the attention of the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Democrats. The lease had been held for 28 years until its expiry on 30 September 1985. Subsequently, the holder of the lease for those wharves applied for a further lease of the wharf area. It was initially permitted and an interim lease was granted until 30 March 1987, after which a rather more formal and complete lease was granted by the Port of Brisbane Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee will have noted that two different bodies are involved here, firstly, the Land Administration Commission and, secondly, the Port of Brisbane Authority. We are talking about the continuation of the same lease for the same property. Yet, under the present Bill as it is drawn, the commencement of the new lease would not constitute a roll-over for the purposes of the capital gains tax. The expiry of the lease would constitute the end of the capital gains tax free period which was available to the lessee in the first place. This means that the property acquired by the new lease would become, upon any disposal of it in the future, subject to the capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA> We regard that as very unfair, as it involves only a technical change in the name of the lessor, from the Land Administration Commission to the Port of Brisbane Authority. The nature and circumstances of the lease have not changed. It is totally unreasonable that the Government's legislation does not provide a roll-over facility which would keep any future gain free of capital gains tax, within the original intention of the Government's capital gains tax legislation. For those reasons, and bearing in mind the similarity of this case to the case behind the amendment passed by the Committee in earlier debate on the matter of crown leases in November 1988, we have moved this amendment. We believe that it is just and reasonable and it will have have the support of the Australian Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We support this amendment. I do not believe there is any need to go over what Senator Messner has outlined. The amendment essentially seeks to correct an anomaly that has arisen, an anomaly which, legitimately, could not have been foreseen when the legislation was drafted. State instrumentalities which change their base and move from having a crown lease to not having a crown lease, as in the Bretts wharves case, could have had the roll-over if they had been granted a crown lease. The amendment is reasonable. The number of instances of this is probably quite small. It depends on a number of exercises undertaken by third parties over which people who are in possession of the property in question have no control.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think it was ever envisaged in the legislation that, because of technical changes by groups totally outside the control of the people who have the property, people would be penalised in any way, or be seen as seeking to make a gain. In these cases they did not get any technical gain. We believe that the Opposition's amendment, as in the case of the amendment passed previously, will cover such anomalies and grant people the roll-over relief from the capital gains tax that should have been provided in the legislation in the first place. But we are not critical of this omission because, obviously, it would have taken an extraordinary person to have foreseen such circumstances arising. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (General Capital Increase) Bill 1988 touches upon the provision of increased finance from the Australian Government to the tune of $1,250m by way of share capital subscriptions to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development-better know as the World Bank. Of course, it is that organisation which assists the development of the Third World countries and those lesser developed nations in the world which are seeking softer concessional loans to develop their infrastructure and lift the standard of living of their inhabitants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill is somewhat of a machinery one but it has been a concern of the Liberal and National parties for some time that there has been a lack of accountability and some problems with administration of some of the aspects of the World Bank's operations in lesser developed countries (LDCs). Without going into chapter and verse, it is true that there have been cases in which money has not found its way to the most effective point of expenditure and has ended up in situations which would not, without putting too fine a point on it, stand too much scrutiny. There have been examples of contracts and development projects which have been contrary to the general interests of some lesser developed nations. For instance, the one that comes to mind is the Amazon highway project in Brazil which was financed by World Bank money. It ended up being a total disaster, both financially and in other ways. </PARA>
<PARA> It is, therefore, the intention of the Liberal and National parties to draw attention in this debate to the distribution of funds by the World Bank. Our Government, which is represented on the World Bank by its nominated governors, should ensure that the administrators of the Bank follow appropriate controls and exercise accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> We are certainly not opposed in any way to the humanitarian objectives of the World Bank in the development of a better standard of living for those who live in lesser developed countries-quite the contrary. We believe the objectives are sound and, in general terms, quite necessary. All we are saying is that it is necessary for those aspects to be patrolled carefully and watched to a very close degree as we are talking about Australian taxpayers' money contributing to such schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a vital matter. We take some solace in the fact that the World Bank has acknowledged many of the problems that have occurred as a result of some mismanagement of projects in LDCs and by some lack of accountability by those managing those projects over the years. Indeed, it is taking up the cudgels on its own behalf to do something to improve those circumstances. Nevertheless, it behoves this Government to ensure that it exercises maximum control and supervision via our governors on the Board of the Bank who should ensure that this is properly carried through. </PARA>
<PARA> It goes without saying that no nation can continue a commitment to the assistance of the lesser developed countries in the world unless it is prosperous itself and capable of meeting its international obligations. It has to be said that this country is faced with some problems in that regard. We have a situation in which the debt owed by Australia to the rest of the world is escalating. It was only two years ago that Australia's debt was about $90,000m. A few years before that, at the time this Government came to power in 1983, that debt was as low as $30,000m-about a third of what it was two years ago. But today it is approaching $135,000m. In the first three years under this Government the debt multiplied by three. In the following two years it multiplied again by about 50 per cent. But looking over the whole period of this Government, the debt owing to the rest of the world has increased by a factor approaching four. In other words, it has multiplied by four. </PARA>
<PARA> The concern that the Liberal and National parties has is that there is no sign of change in that trend. It is not reversing. Notwithstanding that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) told us last August that he was bringing home the bacon in the Budget of 1988, the truth is that the only bacon that has come home to the Australian people is an increasing amount of debt being left on their doorsteps. Generations of Australians yet to be born and their parents will learn very early in life that this Government created an enormous amount of debt that they will have to pay off from their own income. Therefore, it will affect the standard of living of every Australian in the future. One might say, a little cynically, that we may be forced to seek the assistance of the World Bank in the future to help us out of our debt problems. It is easy, of course, to be very negative about this Government and its economic management. Of course, there is much to be negative about-not only the debt but also the high inflation that is running at around double that of not only the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development nations but also the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen an enormous rise in taxes per head of population under this Government as it has refused to take action to stop bracket creep and the effect of inflation on people's income as they move to higher brackets and, therefore, suffer artificially high taxes as a result. The taxes are not artificially high but the rates are. Australians have to shell out more of their hard earned dollars as a result of this Government's policy on taxation than they did under any government in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> A family on average weekly earnings of around $480 a week is suffering tax at 46 per cent on the next dollar earned by the family. That rate is absolutely prohibitive to incentive. It demonstrates clearly the problem that this Government has in getting proper leadership in the economy. I will return to that point a little later. We have seen the collapse of productivity growth in the economy in recent months. That is continuing. The futile and ludicrous promise that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made that by waving some magic wand we would get rid of child poverty by 1990 has been demonstrated to be a totally empty and, more than that, cruel promise for the population of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Returning to the point about debt, the most tragic lesson to be learnt from our debt situation is what is happening with our currency. The combined effect of high inflation and a lack of productivity growth means that Australian companies are developing an interest in investing overseas rather than in Australia, where Australians could be employed. Australian companies are taking their capital, their expertise and their best brains to set up industries in Asia, America and other places. The reason for that is quite clear. Dutiful managers have a responsibility to their shareholders. They need to generate enough profits to return suitable capital to those shareholders. Therefore, they find the place where the most gain can be generated. Because of this Government's policies, that means that they find a place off-shore, which is what they are doing. Given that every month we need $1,500m to fill up the gap in our balance of payments, we have to drag in that money from the world financial community. The money comes from those lenders who seek short term gain either in the currency-by fluctuations in the value of the Australian dollar-or from high interest rates. They will chase those two things as long as the economy of Australia is managed in such a way as to provide gains to them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is in a cleft stick because it has to maintain a policy in favour of high interest rates and a fluctuating currency to drag money into the country to fill up the gap of $1,500m every month. That is its policy. That is what it has to do just to meet the bills every month. The effect of that is that Australian companies wanting to invest overseas are taking capital, which would otherwise have found its way into productive investment in Australia, to overseas where it goes into equity development of new projects, new plants, and the like. Hot money to replace it flows in from those lenders and speculators from overseas who are prepared to lend to us because they see a short term gain. </PARA>
<PARA> What kind of country is it that borrows short and pays high interest rates, offering profits in the short term to pay for the long-term development of the nation? That is precisely what this Government is doing to Australia. It is not borrowing for the long-term advantage of the country by developing its resources. It is merely bringing in money which can find its way out of Australia tomorrow morning if the situation changes, thus leaving us exposed to speculators and international financiers. That is the effect of the Government's policy. It is a great tragedy that in the last six or seven years since the Hawke-Keating-Walsh financial team came to power that is what is happening to this country. It is a disaster of great proportions and the Government knows it, but it does not know what to do. All it does is say, `We are on track'. However, the Australian people want to know what track we are on because they do not know where we will end up. They hear from the Ministers that even such things as taxes are good for them. It is a funny thing that the Government can offer tax cuts on sales taxes on beer, as happened in the Budget last year, and say it is a good thing, but it says it is bad if a private brewer like Carlton United Breweries cuts the price of beer to the consumer by saving taxes. Where is the logic? It is obviously puerile political nonsense to argue that kind of case and Senator Walsh knows it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission of Taxation preaches to the Australian people that taxes are building a better Australia. The Australian people do not agree, as Senator Walsh knows. When the tax cuts promised by the Government come, the Australian people will know that their only purpose is political. The people will get back only what the Government has already taken from their pockets by not adjusting income tax brackets. The Government is not giving back anything that it has not already robbed people of. The people of Australia know that. They will not be fooled by a trick, such as that which the Government thinks it can get away with. It just shows how far out of touch with the Australian people the Government is. It has no concern for individuals or families. All it is worried about is its political survival. </PARA>
<PARA> The arrogance of the leadership of this Government is monumental. It is not leading Australians, it is not unleashing the capacities and abilities of the Australian people to solve the problems brought on by the Government. The Government is locking us into a political circle which cannot be defeated. Until the Government is thrown out of office, it will continue on a downhill path. If we could see how the Government could improve the debt situation of the nation and where it was taking us we might have some faith in the Government. No longer do we have any faith in the Government. As has been evident for a long time, the Liberal Party and the National Party certainly do not have any faith in the Government's capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to quote a few words from a speech made by Sir Arvi Parbo only the other day. He made the very important point that the basic need for Australia to get itself out of its financial and economic problems is better performance. In Adelaide last Friday he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Our basic need is for better performance. This includes working harder, but it means far more than that. It means improving our skills, removing artificial obstacles to the efficient functioning of the economy and, above all, developing a community attitude which supports and applauds achievement. It means encouraging, not discouraging, the natural desire of individuals to improve themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the essence of what the Government should be doing. It should be leading people to improve themselves, showing them ways in which they can do that. What has the Government done to improve the educational prowess of our people? It has introduced all kinds of projects which have been total failures. I refer to the Priority One scheme and the community employment program. The community employment program was an absolute failure in terms of giving people new skills or opportunities. The Government's schemes have been total failures. Sir Arvi Parbo mentioned `removing artificial obstacles to the efficient running of the economy'. We need look no further than the waterfront to see the problems in relation to our export trade. The Government refuses to address the problem because it does not have the guts to face up to its union masters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government talks about telecommunications. Telecommunications provides one of the greatest opportunities for the Government to develop new industries in this country, but it sits with a dead hand on Telecom and on the Overseas Telecommunications Commission. The Government will not allow them to be deregulated without putting them in a monopoly position first. It takes that position because it wants to protect the union membership of those organisations. The Government should free up those organisations and allow them to compete fairly with the rest of the telecommunications industry. It would see the flowering of a brand new industry with enormous opportunities for Australians to participate and to build a new technological base. But no, that is not capable of being achieved by the Government because it is tied hand and foot by its commitment to the trade union movement. Let us look at the labour market. The biggest problem of all resides with our arbitration system and the way in which we fail to reward excellence, to reward opportunities, to give people a chance to improve their circumstances. The Government fails to recognise that the key to getting Australia back on its feet is to give people opportunity. But it does not do that. It will not face up to that. It is too hard. The only parties which have the solution are the Liberal and National parties through our industrial relations policy, conceived and designed by John Howard. That policy is the one which, when in government, we will put into place. It will drag Australia out of its problems and produce a new and vibrant Australia with an outlook that, as Sir Arvi Parbo says, will support and applaud achievement, not sit on it and drive it further down into the ground, as this Government is doing by every action it takes. </PARA>
<PARA> What is missing is leadership; that is what this Government does not provide. The Government talks about levers, about bits of paper with figures on them. If talks about numbers each month, and each week if it can. But it does not talk about people. It does not talk about families. It does not talk about the living standards which people have to endure under this Government. The average family with two children has suffered a decline in its standard of living of $58 a week since Labor came to power in 1983. Every family has lost $58 a week of its purchasing power. This means that it is tougher in the supermarket; it is tougher when one goes to buy petrol at the pumps; it is tougher, most of all, when it comes to paying off the mortgage every month. Not only is there less money in the pool from which to pay the mortgage but the payments have risen as a result of higher interest rates. This is a deliberate result of this Government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the effects on families and on individual Australians. These are the things which worry Australians, not only at a personal level as to how they can make ends meet, but also at a national level, because they see that debt of nearly $140,000m growing bigger and bigger every month. Under the Fraser Government, the percentage of exports being used to make interest and debt repayments was about 6 per cent of exports. That figure is now up to about 20 per cent. Those are the facts. That is why this country is in a hell of a mess, and this Government is not in a position to lead us out of it, nor is it capable of doing that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has tried for nearly three years to convince the Australian people that it has the answers-by talking up the economy, by telling us lies when elections come around, by telling us on the Friday before an election that there are not going to be interest rate rises and on the Monday interest rates go up. They have become past masters of that kind of disposable promise. That is the situation we face. The Government will not have to meet the problems. It will be out of office. It will be gone. Senator Bolkus will be sweeping the streets of Adelaide again. But although the Government will be gone, the Australian people will still be here, picking up the pieces of the wreckage of the Hawke-Keating Government when that Government is long gone and has been forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned, our policy is a positive one. We adhere very strongly to the principle of encouraging individuals to do their best by providing them with incentive, something that this Government does not do. Our industrial relations policy will free up people's opportunities. People will have the freedom to move from job to job and to seek to improve themselves. </PARA>

<PARA> The Australian Labor Party has been peddling a lie recently that our approach to industrial relations would somehow lead to a wages breakout. Of course that is not true. The Government's argument is based on the proposition that we would maintain the present system of arbitration. However, if it read the policy it would understand that under our proposals that system would be significantly altered and employers and employees would be freer in their ability to make their own arrangements; productivity could grow; there would be greater production and therefore greater revenue to be split up between managers and employees, so that there would be better payments available to individual employees and their families. </PARA>
<PARA> That is how the situation would be under the Liberal and National parties' policy on industrial relations. If we are to recover at all from the mess the Labor Party has brought us to, we need to adopt such policies. We need to encourage people to work harder and better and, by so doing, to improve themselves. That is why the system has to change. This Government cannot change it because it is locked into its own political situation. It is controlled by the Australian Council of Trade Unions in Melbourne and as a result cannot adopt new policies without disrupting its own political situation. That is why the accord is dead, but the Labor Party will not pronounce it dead. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, we need a far more progressive outlook from a new government, one that is prepared to lead people and to provide them with opportunities so that they can improve their circumstances. That is what Australia needs. That need will not be met under this Government. We, on the other hand, will be able to improve the total performance of the Australian economy-as Sir Arvi Parbo said last Friday-in such a way as to produce more goods more cheaply and sell them on the world markets in an effort to overcome our present difficulties in marketing very costly goods and services. In that way, we will overcome the deficit in our current account balance. Of course, we do not promise that this will be achieved overnight. What is needed is a government that is prepared to change direction and, indeed, to move the nation and its people in the right direction. This Government is locked into a situation where it cannot change our direction, and the situation is getting worse. Senator Bolkus, even in his saner moments, would recognise that. </PARA>
<PARA> What is needed is the institution of new systems to reward effort, so that people see the circumstances, react to them and, in fact, create positive advantages for themselves and the rest of the country. This will result in more Australians being employed in more effective jobs, which will produce better opportunities on the world markets. There is a need right now for the Government to rethink its strategy. Yesterday, the Senate carried a motion in favour of the Government immediately bringing down a mini-Budget to consider these problems. Certainly we in the Liberal and National parties urge that course. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now with the greatest of pleasure that I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``but the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) notes that a thorough analysis of Australia's contribution to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development is long overdue;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (General Capital Increase) Bill. The purpose of this Bill, to reiterate the second reading speech of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray), is to obtain parliamentary approval for Australia to take up part of its allocated share subscription to the third general capital increase of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). As has been mentioned, the IBRD is one of the arms of the World Bank. The IBRD borrows on commercial terms from the international capital market and lends money to developing countries at an interest rate which gives it a small margin over its cost for administrative expenses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Consequently, the Australian Democrats support this Bill. In addition, we urge the Government to take up Australia's full share entitlement. We believe that this is particularly important in the light of Third World debt and the drying up of funds to the developing world from commercial banks and other official bilateral assistance, including Australia's own development assistance and aid. We also urge the Government to play a much more active role in the forums of the IBRD and other affiliates of the World Bank. More information about the bank, including the many unclassified World Band documents that the bank provides to member country bureaucracies, should be made much more freely available to the Australian public by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In bank forums we wish Australia's representatives to pursue questions to do with the effectiveness of bank programs to alleviate poverty, prevent environmental degradation, and to take into account the views and needs of indigenous peoples. I reiterate that these are concerns that are held by many members of this Parliament and of this chamber in particular. I acknowledge here the response of the World Bank to those concerns, as indicated in its annual report of last year. We want Australia's representative at the World Bank to continue to promote these areas of endeavour, and to support and monitor the bank's efforts. To this purpose we propose an amendment to the motion for the second reading expressing these sentiments. Since Senator Messner has already moved an amendment to the motion for the second reading, I foreshadow that particular amendment if Senator Messner's amendment is not carried. </PARA>
<PARA> Given these particular concerns, the Democrats wish for greater information to be provided for the Parliament about Australia's participation in the bank and Australia's views of the effectiveness of the bank. We thus propose an amendment in the committee stage of this debate to secure more comprehensive annual reporting to Parliament, particularly in relation to the concerns that I have just noted. We do not believe that there is sufficient detail in the present annual reporting to Parliament of Australian participation in the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which we are debating at the moment, as required under the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the framework of this debate concerns the problems of development in the Third World and the response of the World Bank to those particular concerns. I must admit that I was extremely disappointed with Senator Messner's contribution, which did not pick up the substance of this debate, which I believe is vitally important. Instead, he concentrated on issues of our own economic concern and left aside the larger debate. This is extremely disappointing and presumably means that the Liberal and National parties do not wish to contribute to that broader discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to look at this issue, we should be looking at the share increase to the IBRD. It is fairly obvious that we should distinguish this from other affiliates of the World Bank, such as the International Development Association (IDA), which provides concessional loans. It raises money through grants from developed member governments and makes loans at nominal interest rates to poorer countries. The other arm, the International Finance Corporation, unlike the other two arms, invests mostly in privately-owned enterprises in developing countries. Australia is a member of all these three arms of the World Bank-the IBRD, the IDA and the IFC. Australia is not, however, a member of the latest arm of the World Bank-the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, which was established last year. It was intended to increase the level of foreign investment in developing countries by guaranteeing investments against losses resulting from non-commercial risk. The nice thing about that, to put it in layman's terms, is that we are not actually going to go into an agency whose major concern is to compensate multinational companies when their activities have managed to create an overthrow of the government in those particular countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me focus again on the proposed share increase to the IBRD. The third general capital increase sought by the IBRD will allow it to expand its borrowing on world capital markets, and so increase its level of development assistance to more than $20 billion a year. The Australian Government is entitled to subscribe to an additional 10,734 shares. The Government has decided that Australia will subscribe to 7,880 shares. This is estimated to cost about $A35.65m between 1988-89 and 1992-93. The Government has not decided whether to take up the option of the additional shares.</PARA>
<PARA> At this stage, I note the sentiments contained in the coalition's amendment to the motion for the second reading. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a more efficient utilisation of the Bank's existing resources must eventuate before further contributions to its capital base will be provided;</PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats will not be supporting that amendment because we believe that those views are off target. First, the coalition seems to be saying that the IBRD is the World Bank. As I have noted, it is only one of its arms. Secondly, there is nothing in the literature about the Bank that suggests that it is an inefficient organisation in financial and narrow economic terms. It is, in fact, a very sophisticated, commercial operation. A very interesting article published in the Economist states:</PARA>
<PARA>Judged purely as a money manager, the bank . . . beats the pants off most of Wall Street. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that the focus of this debate over the IBRD and other affiliates of the World Bank is not their efficiency in those particular terms but, rather, the appropriateness of the development philosophy. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, and most importantly, withholding further contributions to the bank is the last thing that one would want, given the decline of investment by commercial banks in the developing world, the decline of government to government bilateral assistance, and the growing Third World debt. I think the words of the Prime Minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi, explain well the results of these changes. At an international conference in Delhi in March last year, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>About 25 billion dollars are being channelled every year from the developing to the developed (countries) in the form of a reverse flow of resources. The most heavily indebted countries find themselves diverting to debt repayment more than half the value of their mercantile exports and close to 5 per cent of their gross domestic product. Developing countries face serious shortages of finance to manage their balance-of-payments problems and meet their requirements of development. Yet, sources of development assistance are drying up . . . It is a sad comment on the inequity and inefficiency of the current order that developing countries are, in effect, financing the developed. </PARA>
<PARA>According to the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau submission to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the Australian Government must share some of the responsibility for this absurd situation. Official government development assistance and aid has dropped from about 0.56 per cent of gross domestic product to 0.36 per cent in the three years to 1988. The Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said that no other member country had ever reduced aid volume so dramatically. Clearly, increased investment through a capital increase at the IBRD of the World Bank will help redress the international problem. The Democrats, therefore, support this Bill. Furthermore, we urge the Australian Government to take up its full share entitlement as a step towards reversing the decline in Australia's aid and development assistance efforts. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point I believe that it would be worth while to indicate our support for the concept of a new multilateral debt management agency that would buy the discounted Third World debt now being sold by commercial banks. The agency would pass on that discount to debtor countries, thereby allowing them to restructure their debt. This would give their economies some breathing space. It would be appropriate if such an agency, with members and financial contributions from developed countries, were associated with the World Bank. We urge Australia to promote such an idea in the international financial fora.</PARA>
<PARA> Returning to the proposed share increase that is before us in this Bill, I would like to reply to those who have argued publicly that this will cost too much. I point out that taking up a share entitlement that allows the IBRD to increase its borrowings and, hence, development assistance does not mean that Australia must buy each and every one of those shares it elects to take up. A distinction must be made between paid-in capital-money that governments actually provide to the bank-and callable capital; that is, funds that member governments promise to provide if the bank ever needs to service its debts. As far as Australia is concerned, of the total proposed share increase a mere 3 per cent will be the paid-in portion of $35m-that is the immediate financial cost to Australia-while the other 97 per cent represents callable shares. Of course, these shares are a contingent liability which the Government must take into account but it is highly unlikely that such a contingency would fall due. If it happened the bank obviously would have to be, to all practical intents and purposes, in receivership. </PARA>
<PARA> However, this callable capital gives the bank the ability to borrow much larger sums in the financial markets and it provides those financial markets with the security which is necessary. On that basis we believe that the relatively small financial contribution, in terms of paid-in shares by Australia, will multiply the IBRD's development assistance many times because of the presence of the complementary callable shares. I think it is important for the Government to make that distinction known to the Australian public because I do not think it is well understood in the aid debate generally. </PARA>
<PARA> If we took up our full share entitlement it would give us increased leverage and influence in the policies and programs of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development since our voting rights in the IBRD are in proportion to our shareholding. However, as I said in another debate last year on the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Share Increase) Bill, it is not evident whether Australia has used the leverage available to it, through its representatives on the bank's board of executive directors in Washington, to look at that development philosophy that I referred to previously. Like other major shareholders, Australia has a right to shape policies for management but, in the absence of contrary information from the Government-of course, we have a massive dearth of information-one must assume that Australia is content simply to play a passive role in that institution. The Democrats would want Australia's representatives to have a much more active involvement-an involvement which has been aired by politicians from all parties in this Parliament over the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last few years in particular, two letters have been sent to the President of the World Bank calling on the bank to focus more on poverty alleviation and the prevention of environmental degradation. Both letters have been signed by more than 100 members of all political parties in this Parliament. Of course, similar letters have been sent by other legislatures, in particular those of Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Interestingly enough, I believe that the World Bank has been responding to the concerns of members of legislatures around the world. Let us look, for example, at two recent bank documents. I cite in particular The World Bank's Support for the Alleviation of Poverty, published in June 1988 and Environment and Development: Implementing the World Bank's New Policies, published in July last year. One can see that those concerns which have been expressed around the world have hit home and that the bank is now cognisant of those types of concerns. We want Australia to support, encourage and further develop the bank's efforts in this regard and to monitor the effectiveness of the bank's efforts to pursue those three major prongs. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at each of those three items-poverty alleviation, environmental degradation and the problem associated with indigenous people which is the item the World Bank has not yet responded to in a formal sense. The statistics of extreme poverty on this planet must lead one to a massive amount of concern. Previously Senator Messner was talking about our concerns in the Australian context. How much more would one be concerned in the world context? The following quote from the World Bank's document I think is as good as any:</PARA>
<PARA>It is probable that more than 900 million people now live in absolute poverty-a condition of malnutrition, illiteracy, disease, short life expectancy, and high rates of infant mortality. Although no part of the developing world is spared these problems, perhaps a little more than half these poor people live in Asia and a third in Sub-Saharan Africa. </PARA>
<PARA>We might become ashamed when we actually compare this with military expenditure on this planet. According to American economist Ruth Sivard, the world's annual military budget equals the income of 2.6 billion people in the 44 poorest countries. Poor country governments cannot be excused because they are guilty of excessive military expenditure in many of their efforts. The 1985 United Nations report on the world social situation indicates that at least four of the 20 countries with the largest foreign debt imported arms amounting to 40 per cent or more of their debt. Those are extraordinary figures. Already impoverished countries are spending up to 40 per cent on further military imports. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I wish to make some specific comments about the economy of the Northern Territory and, in particular, the Federal Labor Government's support for that economy, or perhaps I should say `the lack of support' that brings on a decent and general acceptance of what is required. Some honourable senators will recall that in last night's adjournment debate when I raised issues connected with airports at Darwin and Alice Springs I met with a very sensitive, vitriolic and personal attack from my Territory Senate colleague, Senator Collins. One can always tell from Senator Collins's reaction when something hurts or embarrasses him because he responds with a vicious attack.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tonight I shall be more specific and talk about the economy of the Northern Territory, what stage it is at and the important contribution that the Commonwealth must make to continuing that economic stability. It was pleasing today, finally, to get the acknowledgment from the Federal Airports Corporation that target dates would be put on the airports at Darwin and Alice Springs. As I said last night, it has been a long time coming. There has been some five years of lapsed promises and constant renegotiations. Whilst Senator Collins said last night that he has had a difficult time over the last two years, I would say that the Government should look at its history over the five-year period. We will certainly keep this Government to its commitments on these target dates-that is, that commencement will take place no later than 1 November this year and that the airports will be open for business by 30 June 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> We will certainly file away those strong commitments and remind the Government, as part of the Budget process, of them. I cannot help but be reminded that in August last year when Senator Collins and Mr Snowdon gave a personal commitment to these projects they said that the airports would be operational within three years. Three years from last August has now slipped to an additional year in today's announcement and the airports will not now be open for business until 30 June 1992. So in the space of that 12-month period, the completion dates and the commitment of the members has already slipped an additional 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Collins said last night, the capital underpinning of this $90m worth of capital works projects is terribly important to the Northern Territory economy. The Northern Territory's economy has gone through a very difficult period, just as the Australian economy has. However, the Territory economy has improved and is showing a strengthening. This has been reflected in some good results in the last couple of years. I believe that that has been because of the dedication of the Northern Territory Government and its management of the economy in the face of these very difficult Federal times, Federal funding and the stimulus that has been given by the private sector in the Northern Territory. Population growth, particularly in Darwin, did dip for some time, but in the last year it has shown signs of improving. The labour market is also increasing significantly. The Darwin inflation rate is currently the lowest of all the capital cities. That reflects a lot on what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA> Tourism, building and mineral exploration are areas that are being stimulated by the private sector. It is good to see that there is encouragement in that respect. The growth in exports stems largely from oil and gas production. In the local community there has been an additional improvement in the building industry, especially housing. We have seen increases in the number of building approvals. These are terribly important economic overviews in that area. This has occurred in the face of a very strong decreasing real change in commitment to the Northern Territory by the Federal Labor Government. In fact, since it has been in office Commonwealth funding to the Northern Territory has dropped by 17 per cent-that is over the past five years. The significance of that is appreciated when one bears in mind that approximately $1 billion of the Northern Territory Government's funding-that is, $1.5 billion-is generated from the funds, the total payments and the Loan Council borrowings from the Commonwealth. This 17 per cent real change and decrease from the Federal Government over the last five years has had to be managed by the Northern Territory Government in its provision of essential services. </PARA>
<PARA> For the first time the Northern Territory Government has been moved, by the Treasurer (Mr Keating), into determining, as far as possible, the same methodology of provision of financing as for the States. This change has induced and produced significant changes to the Territory Budget. We can see that from the time of self-government in 1978 total payments rose continually to the financial year 1984-85 and have fallen steadily since then. The decline has been more significant in the general purpose and capital funds. By any measure, that declining investment in the Northern Territory-I make no apology for saying that it is an investment in the north of Australia, because of what is going on there-has compounded the problems, particularly the economic management problems. </PARA>
<PARA> We also need to put into context the Commonwealth's commitment to its own capital works program of development in the Northern Territory where there is economic concern and worry. We are aware that the Government is not honouring its commitments. Whilst Senator Collins and I had a fight yesterday about the commitment and timing that is so necessary for airport developments, we also need to challenge the Commonwealth Government on its slippage of capital works in other important areas, particularly that of defence. It is easy to let defence programs slip. I refer, for example, to the Coonawarra naval base near Darwin. A commitment was given, it is on the program and there is now very real concern that this slippage will amount to millions of dollars over a number of years. The development of stage 2 of Tindal Royal Australian Air Force base near Katherine is also significant. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) intends to open the Tindal base on 31 March and that is a time at which he must give a real commitment to the defence of northern Australia and outline the real programs that he has in place so that the very economic underpinning of the north can go on undaunted. We need no slippage in that area, as we had with airports. </PARA>
<PARA> This issue is of major concern to the Master Builders Association of the Northern Territory. It has been unable to get a reasonable commitment from the Federal Labor Government. It comments that the cutbacks in Federal Government expenditure in the current financial year amount to a massive 64 per cent. Whilst some expenditure is being moved off-Budget, such as the airports situation about which we have heard in the last day or so, groups such as the Master Builders Association have a lack of confidence as they know that the Government has got it locked into a certainty for its program and where it is going. It is very important that we do not see further slippages in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Linking this to the airports issue, I inform the Senate that the radar station No. 2 CRU near Darwin was planned to be complemented by other radar facilities at Port Keats and Tindal. It now appears that the Department of Defence has decided to pick up the one from No. 2 CRU and relocate it at Port Keats. That will be an exercise to save millions of dollars in moving into additional facilities which are necessary and required for northern defence. Again, it reflects on the commitment to capital and civil works programs. Not only is there a defence concern about Darwin not being properly surveilled and looked at from a defence point of view, but again we are seeing the slippage in works programs. A number of people, including leading defence strategists, have claimed very clearly that the movement of the Darwin radar system to Port Keats is purely a money saving exercise by this Government. That is totally unacceptable, not only for defence reasons but also in detecting drug runners and as a backup to search and rescue operations in northern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time as the Government is undertaking at its Budget review this year, I would ask it to look seriously at the matter of zone allowances for people living in remote areas. The Federal member for the Northern Territory, Warren Snowdon, and I were both present at a meeting with pensioners in Darwin several weeks ago. We were looking at the liabilities and disadvantages suffered by pensioners. Many pensioners are also taxpayers. They have additional income and they are topped up. Pensioners living in remote parts of Australia depend substantially on the $270 zone A taxation allowance for living in remote areas. I had heard around the traps that the Labor Government was out to cut, slash, review or whatever that zone allowance. I challenged Mr Snowdon to tell me whether the Labor Government was intending to do anything to the zone allowance this year. He came straight back with a qualified answer to the effect that yes, it was under review. That $270 for a pensioner is crucial and most important. But it is even more important to an average family living in outback Australia, particularly a family with a dependent spouse and two children. The taxation advantage to that family would be in excess of $1,100. It now appears that that is to be ripped off. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the issue of support for families we cannot help but see that right across Australia high interest rates, high taxation and high inflation are forcing many young people to weigh up the demands on both mortgages and children-and we know the severe options that people have to face. Furthermore, one has to consider a few of the facts and figures as they relate to families. Disposable income for families is down 30 per cent since 1983, when this Labor Government came into office. The number of households living in poverty is up from 11.5 per cent in 1982-83 to 12.4 per cent in 1985-86. Family allowances are down 36 per cent in real terms, which is quite significant. The dependent spouse rebate for a family with children is down 27 per cent in real terms. The average home repayments, now at $675 a month, is up 93 per cent since March 1983. They are dramatic changes in a period of very high inflation, high interest rates and high taxation. The impost that this is putting on families astounds many people. Late last year the Federal Opposition Leader, John Howard, echoed the sentiments of many home buyers when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Bob Hawke has really become the Prime Minister for `DINKS'-double income, no kids. You cannot afford to have them and buy a house if you're a new home buyer'. </PARA>
<PARA>Even the financial world agreed. The Commonwealth Bank's chief manager of retailing banking, Mr Murray Westgarth, warned:</PARA>
<PARA>To handle a mortgage you need to put off having a family. Couples once would have thought of having a family at an early age, but that's being put back now. </PARA>
<PARA>Basically we need to remember that home ownership is part of the family dream and the family is the fundamental unit in our society. It provides a positive environment in which individuals can develop the most effective means of caring for children and a source of happiness and social support. Unfortunately, the rapid pace of economic and technological change means that relationships, marriages and families are now under more pressure than ever before. It is this pressure and the pressures that have now been induced by the Labor Government that make it so hard on families around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> My task tonight has been to stress that the Labor Government's commitment to northern Australia has waned. In the period since Prime Minister Hawke came to office we have seen a continual depreciation of support for people who live in remote areas of Australia. Whether that applies to groups such as the Northern Territory Government or to individual families who live in these remote areas, the issues must be addressed. They must be addressed urgently and in the next Budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I wish to raise an important issue on behalf of a constituent regarding the repayment of an overpayment of service pension between 1980 and 1987. The overpayment was caused by a departmental clerical error that resulted in a failure to adjust the service pension of my constituent in accordance with variations in the constituent's superannuation. The point I wish to make this evening is that the rate of this repayment has been set at such a level that it is putting financial stress on my constituent and his wife, and has also led to the diagnosed stress related illness of his wife. In my opinion there should be no repayment or, at best, it should be over an extended period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me go back in history a little to detail the background of this case. I would have hoped that the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) would listen to my outline of this problem, because it is a very serious one. It is a little distressing to find that the Minister has now suddenly occupied Black Rod's seat in the chamber. This is a very important subject and I would like the Minister to comment on it at the end of the adjournment debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know how the Minister could know because he has not been listening, he has been playing games. To return to the history of this matter, the rate of service pension is dependent upon the rate of superannuation. That rate is adjusted automatically by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, based upon information provided to that Department by the Minister responsible for the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund, more recently known as the Australian Government Retirement Benefits Office. Again, the Minister is not listening. If he were to find himself in the position of my constituent, I am sure that he would want someone who has the ability to fix this matter to pay some attention. The Minister cannot even sit in his place. This is getting a little beyond a joke.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. I am sorry that the Minister raised that smart alec point of order because the information I am providing is particularly serious. The information to which I have referred is based upon details supplied to the Department by the Minister with responsibility for the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund, now known as the Australian Government Retirement Benefits Office. That information is supplied on computer tape. The constituent was regularly required to complete an income statement upon which appears a declaration of the correctness of various particulars set out therein and an acknowledgment of the obligation to advise the Department of any change in particulars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During 1980 a clerical error was made by the Department of Veterans' Affairs which resulted in my constituent ceasing to be noted as a superannuation recipient. As a consequence of that the periodic information supplied to the Department by which the pension was automatically varied in accordance with variations in Commonwealth superannuation ceased to be applied to my constituent's entitlement. As a result, the Department failed to make any adjustment in the service pension until the error was discovered seven years later in 1987. I remind the Senate that this came about through a clerical error made by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, not by the constituent, and there was no desire whatsoever by my constituent to defraud the system. He had quite willingly, up until the time the Department ceased sending him the forms, completed those forms and sent them back. But it is my understanding that adjustments in the service pension of recipients such as my constituent are consequent upon changes in the rate of Commonwealth superannuation and are actuated by information passing between the Commonwealth bodies rather than information from the recipients. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the error made by the Department is, of course, in this case a cumulative one. In the first year the error resulted in a relatively minimal change in the total income received by the recipient. However, with each successive year the rate of change was similar and over a period of seven years the accumulated difference between the proper entitlement and the sum being paid by the Commonwealth is significant. In fact, that amount was in excess of $6,000. I might add that, while the amount is quite significant to pensioners in this instance, it is quite insignificant in comparison with the amounts involved in the cases of those people who quite willingly defraud the system and get far better treatment than this couple are currently getting. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth superannuation of which my constituent was in receipt was, during the period from 1980 to 1987, regularly increased in accordance with changes in the consumer price index (CPI). During the period within which my constituent's service pension was not adjusted corresponding to the changes in the Commonwealth superannuation payment, he may have perceived a periodic increase in his total income from pension and superannuation corresponding roughly to increases in the CPI. The Minister, in one response to the constituent, said that the constituent should have recognised the difference and notified the Department. In all seriousness I do not believe that many aged pensioners are true financial wizards who can distinguish one rise from another, particularly those who are not seeking in any way to defraud the system and simply trust the system to deliver exactly what they are entitled to. </PARA>
<PARA> It is well established in correspondence that the Department of Veterans' Affairs received information, in the form of the computer tapes to which I referred earlier, relating to variations in the superannuation entitlement as a basis for adjusting the service pension. I therefore submit that a person with no income other than the Commonwealth payments, being aware of the fact that adjustments are automatically effected, would not readily assume that the total responsibility rested with him to ensure that the Commonwealth failed to make any errors in relation to his payment. This couple have really been penalised because, as I said before, they trusted the system and were unaware that they in fact had to be a check on the system instead of the situation that applied prior to that where the system was a check on them. Many other pensioners do not sign the declaration, such as this couple did, which obliges the pensioner to notify the Department. I suppose, in hindsight, my constituent's mistake is that he thought that he was doing what everyone else did and that it was obligatory. </PARA>
<PARA> All correspondence currently available contains consistent errors in the emphasis placed upon these circumstances by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. One example of such an error is in the final sentence of a letter from the Minister dated 24 May 1988 in which he states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . consequently, any service pension which was incorrectly paid as a result of failure to notify changes is a debt to the Commonwealth and must be repaid.</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that the statement is simply wrong. The service pension was incorrectly paid as a result of an error by the Department, not a failure of the constituent to notify changes. It was not his fault. It has been declared that it was the Department's fault. My constituent's recognition of that error may have halted that error earlier and relieved him of the stress of the present situation; however, it can in no way be said to have caused the incorrect payment. </PARA>
<PARA> I further submit that it is neither necessary nor realistic for the Department to approach my constituent's case on the basis of guidelines which may have little or no relevance to his circumstances. Whilst a lot can be said about the obligation to advise and the nature of the declarations made, the reality of the situation is that the adjustment of the total pension income was a matter that should have correctly taken place based upon the system for adjustment which is maintained by the agencies in question. I suppose this really begs the question: If the Department has made this error, how many more errors has it made for the same reasons but for a greater value, or even a lesser value for that matter?</PARA>
<PARA> When the Department forwarded the form to my constituent it was duly filled out, signed and returned. I believe, therefore, that it cannot be realistically suggested that he be held culpable to any material degree for failing to recognise and subsequently alert the Department to the gradual changes in his entitlement which he had no way of knowing were not just CPI increases or would place him in the position in which he now finds himself of serious financial liability. </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise that the repayments have already been reduced from $84 each per fortnight to $30 each per fortnight. Nonetheless, $60 per fortnight to an elderly couple is a lot of money, particularly when it comes on top of an additional loss of income in the form of the reduced pension. I ask the Minister to consider the question of repayment by my constituent and his wife, based upon his particular facts. He is 74 years of age and his wife is approximately the same age. They are of most moderate means, with only the part service pension and the small superannuation. In order to repay the total debt claimed by the Commonwealth, each of their pensions has been reduced by $30 per fortnight for some four years. At this time of life such a period of indebtedness brought about through no real fault of theirs is a severe penalty. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the present reduction of service pension payable is, in general terms, a far greater hardship than the largely unrecognised benefit that was received over a period of some seven years. Once again, I remind the Senate that it has to be repaid over four years, not over the seven years that it took to accumulate-nor over the longer periods applying to people who have quite willingly defrauded the system. Some such people pay back a couple of dollars over 10, 20 or 30 years. This fellow did not try to defraud the system, and yet he is being penalised by a reduction in pension of $60 per fortnight over four years. The level of reduction of the pension itself continues to be relatively substantial, considering that the total weekly pension and superannuation income of both people together is only $251.07. I challenge the Minister, or anyone else in this place for that matter, to try as part of a couple to live on $251 a week. The present rate of payment from the meagre weekly income referred to constitutes a significant financial penalty. </PARA>
<PARA> The total effect upon this couple of the recognition and correction of the Department's error is enormous. In the first place, his and his wife's pensions have been reduced to the correct level. In addition, the substantial further reduction of $30 per week has been effected. If they are to continue to have deducted from their pensions repayments of the overpayment claimed by the Commonwealth at the present rate, I suggest that it is inequitable for such an impost to be maintained for the full period which would be required in order to repay the whole of the sum in question. I therefore ask the Minister for a review of the case with a view to a write-off, as a result of a bona fide error. There are circumstances on the basis of which the Department does that, and I cannot understand why this has not been done on this occasion. Alternatively, at the minimum, there should be a reduction of the present rate of repayment or a substantial increase in the period over which the repayment is to be made. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think anyone in this Parliament would be so bold as to suggest that pensioners in Australia are on any great gravy train or live a life of luxury. As I have said, this couple certainly live a very modest lifestyle and are concerned, honest Australians. I saw this gentleman a few weeks ago. I have subsequently spoken to him on the telephone. I can testify to the fact that he is a very sincere person. I can also testify to the fact that he is a very concerned person. Having gone through his details over the last couple of weeks, I can certainly understand why he is so concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the case I have detailed here tonight needs the Minister's further consideration, as it was not this gentleman's fault that the Department made the error in the first place. All he and I are really seeking is a fair go which would enable him and his wife to live without hardship. The Minister also stated the following in one of his letters:</PARA>
<PARA>If the recoverable overpayment can be repaid by a person then the options of write-off or waiver cannot be taken by a delegate. </PARA>
<PARA>That is probably quite true. However, I contend that the delegate cannot make a decision outside the guidelines. The Minister certainly can, however, particularly in extreme circumstances. There are sufficient precedents for action to be taken in this case. As I have said, many other people have willingly and intentionally received money under false circumstances. I think that my constituents should be given the consideration that they deserve as honest Australian citizens. I trust that the Minister will look sympathetically at this case and act accordingly and quickly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Muirhead Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody has justifiably focused much attention on the cell deaths of Aboriginal Australians who are alleged to have hanged themselves. The media point of view has been that the majority of the deaths are of this nature. However, in my home State of Western Australia this is definitely not true. There is grave concern about the number of deaths in custody of both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians and about the high imprisonment rate of both. The high imprisonment rates of Aboriginal Australians are a cause of particular concern. The statistics I will now cite cover the period from 1 January 1980 to the present. Of a total of 73 cell deaths in Western Australia, 25 were allegedly self-inflicted. Of these, seven were Aboriginal hangings. Of the 10 hangings in prison, one was an Aboriginal, and of the 13 hangings in police lockups, six were Aboriginal. The remaining two deaths were the result of slashing and an overdose. The first case was an Aboriginal death and the second case a non-Aboriginal death.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not wish to detract in any way from the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which is exposing to the public view the horrific happenings behind the closed doors of our penal institutions. Without the Australia-wide public uproar from the Aboriginal people, this Royal Commission would never have received its letters patent. But the time has come for the whole of the population to make its voice heard to obtain better conditions for all those still incarcerated in our mental institutions, prisons and lockups. The neglect of prisoner health and welfare in these places of imprisonment is a national shame. Conditions and attitudes that horrified our ancestors in the last century have not changed to this day. I seek leave, Mr President, to table figures and graphs which have been extracted by researcher Jennifer Searcy, whose son Nicholas died of encephalitis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you Mr President. Nicholas Searcy was a victim of medical help being denied. As an example of an unnecessary and tragic prison death, I would like to tell the Senate Nicholas's story and of the callous treatment meted out to him. Nicholas, a brilliant scholar-he had qualified for medicine at the age of 14, becoming the youngest holder of a technical and further education diploma in applied science-a poet, musician and sculptor, was an honours chemistry student and graduate research worker at a Perth University. In late 1986, when rushing to get medical help for a severe burn, he was arrested for driving while under suspension and was subsequently gaoled for the minimum mandatory term of one month. He was jailed for the minimum mandatory term of one month which, less remissions, was 17 days. He was to serve his sentence in Canning Vale Prison and entered that institution on Friday, 13 December, as a fit and healthy young man.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On Sunday, 21 December, on the ninth day of his imprisonment, Nicholas was very, very sick and in great pain, unable to eat and hardly able to walk. Such was his distress that when taken to the visitors room to see his fiancee he had to leave and return to bed. As he left the visiting area he staggered visibly for all to see. During the night Nicholas was reported by a prisoner in the next cell as crying in agony and sounding as if he was having a fit. He told the warders of this at the time, but they just walked away, leaving Nicholas moaning with pain. Another prisoner told the warders on the Monday morning that Nicholas was very ill and that he had not been drinking, but the warders took no notice and placed him in an observation cell for disciplinary reasons. He was so ill he could not report sick for himself and the warders had decided he was either drunk or drugged. This was later totally disproved. It is an undisputed medical fact that drunkenness with severe loss of coordination cannot last more than six hours at most without further consumption of alcohol. He was kept in solitary confinement until finally being sent to Fremantle Hospital in chains on the following Tuesday, at which time he had five days of his sentence to run and only 12 days to live. </PARA>
<PARA> In all probability, this young man's illness became irreversible in the period from the Sunday to the Tuesday. Despite Nicholas's being mortally ill and physically unable to move off the bed, as well as being guarded by a warder at all times, the Acting Superintendent of Canning Vale Prison insisted that the young man remain chained to the bed. All this time Nicholas was tossing in his delirium with the chain painfully pulling against his leg. The doctor protested that he could not properly treat so seriously ill a patient while he remained shackled. Nicholas's mother pleaded with the Acting Superintendent to remove the chains but she was told to go to a higher authority. Because it was obvious that Nicholas might die, Mrs Searcy could not leave him and asked the then chairman of the Christian Justice Association, the Reverend David Robinson, to act on her behalf in this matter. Reverend Robinson approached the Western Australian Attorney-General, Joe Berinson, who said he would consider the matter but procrastinated for two days before yielding to the insistence of the medical specialist. </PARA>
<PARA> Nicholas died on 4 January 1987. There is very much more. But these points alone tell a story of a disgraceful treatment of a young man with a deadly illness while in prison on a driving charge. The reason given for chaining him to the hospital bed was that he was said to be a medium security risk. At the coronial inquest no evidence was given supporting the assertion that a person in jail for a minor offence, with no record of escape attempts, and with only a few days left to serve, was any sort of security risk. I shudder to think of all the others who, like Nicholas, are incarcerated for whatever reason and are subjected to such malicious, brutal and uncaring treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> This abuse of prisoners is not unique to Western Australia but appears to be fairly standard in most States, as is indicated by the recent case of Malcolm Hatch, aged 21, who died on 18 July last year as a result of custody in New South Wales. Malcolm died of meningitis after transfer from Cessnock Gaol to Prince Henry Hospital, Sydney. His infections were bacterial and could have been responsive to timely treatment by antibiotics. There are certain facts that demand explanation. Although fellow prisoners at Cessnock Gaol had claimed that Malcolm Hatch had complained of long term severe headaches, the first record was on Sunday, 3 July, when the headache was diagnosed as flu and he was given aspirin. Six days later, on Saturday, 9 July, Malcolm phoned his family and told them he had terrible headaches but was not allowed to see a doctor. On the next day, Sunday, 10 July, the young man collapsed but still a doctor was not called. On Monday 11 July, Malcolm was transferred to the medical unit at Long Bay Jail and then to Prince Henry Hospital where he was immediately placed on a life support system. Malcolm's mother travelled from Queensland to be with her son but he did not regain consciousness and died on Monday, 18 July, 1988. The autopsy was delayed until Friday, 22 July. Infection cannot be reliably identified after 36 hours at the outside. </PARA>
<PARA> Two sharp questions need to be asked: Firstly, who chose to deprive him of treatment for so long, and why? Secondly, who chose to delay the autopsy, and why? The answers must be forthcoming. The relevant Ministers must take action to ensure that the barbaric practice of condoning denial of medical help to prisoners ceases forthwith. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take the Senate's time briefly-it is an opportunity I will probably never get again-to comment on the recent decision to remove the 40 per cent tariff on lightweight woollen cloth, which is sometimes called `cool wool'. The removal of this silly tax, as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) called it, will allow the fashion garment industry once again to use this unique cloth and not to have the unfair competition from lightweight cotton and synthetic material.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Wool Corporation, with the help of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and its own research, has developed techniques for producing lightweight woollen cloths of exceptional quality. It has allowed overseas mills to produce printed materials that are as delicate as silk and as colourful as any fabrics ever produced. The fashion industry in Australia has designers with unique talents who will now be able to purchase the best cloth in the world and produce garments that will compete with the best fashion houses in the world. The people of Australia will once again be able to purchase world quality clothing at a more reasonable price. </PARA>
<PARA> It has always seemed ludicrous to me, when we have a Wool Corporation spending many millions of dollars on wool promotion and the Government contributing to it something like $33m annually, that the Government would see fit to impose a tariff that would torpedo the promotional efforts of the Wool Corporation that it has already invested in. Those honourable senators who may have seen the Bicentennial Wool Parade or the recent Australian Wool Collection that took place at Darling Harbour would appreciate how lightweight woollen cloths are the showpiece or centrepiece of our promotional activities with wool. Why then would a government try to impede the wonderful marketing exercise that the Australian Wool Corporation is carrying out? The only answer I have is that it must have been an oversight, a mistake or an anomaly. For better or worse, it has been removed, so my congratulations to those responsible for correcting this mistake are forthcoming. Let us hope it has not damaged the industry too much and that once again confidence will be returned. </PARA>
<PARA> Early last year this matter was brought to my attention by a Mrs Wallis, a fashion consultant with the Australian Wool Corporation. As a result of that, I conducted a survey of garment manufacturers who were using lightweight wools. The results were quite alarming. The changeover from wool to synthetics and the reduction in the use of wool was quite significant. It was disappointing to me as a woolgrower to see manufacturers losing confidence in the `cool wool' promotion that the Australian Wool Corporation had spent so much time and money developing. </PARA>
<PARA> The collated results of my survey were made available to the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority, the Australian Wool Corporation, Mr Kerin's office, and also to the office of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button). I hope they were helpful in assisting the Government in its decisions. I go on record as thanking all of those who participated so willingly in the survey, and I hope that their confidence in the industry has returned. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, I commend the Government for its commonsense approach. As far as this situation is concerned, I sum up by quoting the Chairman of the Australian Wool Corporation, who in reply to this decision said:</PARA>
<PARA>Hopefully, Australian designers will now pick up the very best lightweight woollen fabrics, from wherever they're made and make clothes out of them here so we in Australia can wear the very best of our own product. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will say just a few words in summing up. In respect to Senator Tambling's contribution, I do not think anyone needs to say any more than to acknowledge it as a political speech based very much in rhetoric and fantasy rather than fact. With respect to Senator Knowles's speech, there are a couple of points she raised which I will definitely bring to the attention of the relevant Minister. In doing so, however, I wish to alert Senator Knowles to a number of decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in areas similar to this in the Social Security portfolio which may assist her in pursuing that matter as well. In terms of the responsibilities of clients as opposed to Government departments in this area, these decisions might be useful to her.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matters raised by Senator Jenkins obviously are ones that affect people who have been listening to the debate, and I will raise them with Senator Tate who has some indirect responsibility in this area. As to Senator Calvert, I say, on behalf of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), that it is good to see someone from the Opposition recognising some good. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 25 November 1988 (Hansard, page 2892), Senator Durack asked me, inter alia, as the Minister representing the Attorney-General, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (i) how many of the 500 or so individual files which have been opened by the Special Investigations Unit, as disclosed in evidence to Senate Estimates committees, have resulted in police calling on suspects, and how many statements have been obtained from these people by this method?</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) have Australian Federal Police officers explained to these people the origin of the allegations and the fact that the War Crimes Bill has not yet been passed by the Parliament?</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) have the police explained carefully to these people their rights under existing law in regard to answering question?</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) in light of the evidence that is now available about the number of people who have been questioned, why has a spokesman for the Attorney-General, as reported in the Age on Wednesday, denied as `absolute nonsense' that any such visits have taken place?</PARA>
<PARA>The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The first 3 questions were dealt with comprehensively in the course of debate on the war crimes legislation. I refer the Honourable Senator to pp. 4468-4470 and 4498-4503 of the Senate Hansard of 19 December 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the last question I understand that the description of `absolute nonsense' applied to the term `interrogation' and not to the fact that interviews had taken place. As is clear from the Hansard record, such interviews do not and have not constituted `interrogations' as that term is generally understood.</PARA>
