<TITLE>Privacy Legislation</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable President and members of the Senate assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws attention to the Senate of their concern regarding proposed changes to the laws governing credit reporting, as suggested in the Bill `The Privacy Amendment Bill 1989'.</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed reforms will:</PARA>
<PARA> Restrict the legitimate use of credit checking by business who sell/supply goods and/or services to their customers on credit terms.</PARA>
<PARA> The proposals/reforms will prevent businesses from determining the solvency of their customers and will increase the financial risk of credit providers, leading to an increase in company liquidations and individual bankruptcies.</PARA>
<PARA> Additional costs to business from bad debts due to the lack of adequate credit checking information will result in increased prices/charges and will result in credit providers refusing credit facilities.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray that the Senate will call on the Government to refer these proposals restricting credit checking to a Senate Standing Committee for further consideration before proceeding with the matter.</PARA>

<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament. This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia draws the attentions of the Senate to our opposition to any attempt to restrict access to the rebate for abortions under Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA> Medicare is a universal health care system and as such the availability of any schedule item should never be determined on the basis of the moral values of a minority of citizens. Equity and access within the present system should be the right of all Australian citizens and guaranteed to them.</PARA>
<PARA> The Webster Abortion Funding Abolition Bill would, if successful, severely limit the availability of rebates for items 6494, 274 and 275. The effect would be twofold-further discrimination against all women (particularly those who could not afford the full cost of this procedure) and an invasion of the confidentiality that exists between client and medical practitioner.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners humbly pray that the Senate vote against any attempt to restrict access to abortion or any related items on the Medicare schedule.</PARA>

<PARA> The members of the Australian Armed Forces who served in the Vietnam from 1962 to 1973 did so with distinction, valour and professionalism, upholding the traditions of the Armed Forces.</PARA>
<PARA> After World War 2 and the Korean War the Australian Government approved an End of War List of Gallantry Medals for individual acts of bravery that were not rewarded during wartime.</PARA>
<PARA> The Whitlam Government refused to approve such an End of War List at the end of the Vietnam War.</PARA>
<PARA> Your humble petitioners pray that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government reverse the decision of the Whitlam Government and thus approve an End of War List for the Australian Armed Forces personnel that served in Vietnam.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That we the undersigned strongly object to the Legislation which is being recommended by Professor Duncan Chappel, Department of Criminology, that parental rights to discipline our children by spanking (if necessary), being taken from us.</PARA>
<PARA> If we are not allowed to discipline our children at home, in love and according to God's Word we fear that we will have a nation of completely rebellious children on our hands. God's Word says, ``Spare the rod and spoil the child'' and also that ``Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of correction will drive it far from him''. We would therefore appreciate your consideration of our rights as parents to correctly and lovingly discipline our own children, and feel that if this right is taken from us we would lose the respect of our children.</PARA>

<TITLE>The Last Temptation of Christ</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and senators in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. That the film ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' portrays Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ in a blasphemous and offensive way and is calculated to outrage the feelings of Christians.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. That the decision of the Film Censorship Board to allow the importation of the film and to classify the Film with an ``R'' classification, rather than banning it, shows that the Film Censorship Board has failed in its statutory duty.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. That in failing to exercise his powers and ban the Film the Attorney General has, as with his failure to ban the Film Hail Mary in 1986, failed in his duty to the people of Australia.</PARA>

I seek leave to make a short statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this case, the Committee was concerned with rights of review of adverse decisions made under discretions granted in the instrument itself. These discretions related to the right of full professional practice by general practitioners. An adverse decision could have important effects upon a person's financial position and professional reputation. In cases involving the right to practise a livelihood, the Committee is particularly vigilant, almost invariably insisting upon external review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of the merits of a decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, this was one of the exceptional cases where the Committee accepted the explanation from the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) that existing review rights, although internal, were independent of control by the Minister or the Department of Community Services and Health. The Minister referred the Committee to the unanimous report of the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance on the vocational registrations of general practitioners, which expressly addressed this issue. The regulations are in general conformance with the report on this point. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee thanks the Minister for Community Services and Health for his cooperation. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a brief description of the Committee's scrutiny and its correspondence for the information of honourable senators and others. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The documents read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>HEALTH INSURANCE (VOCATIONAL REGISTRATION OF GP's) REGULATIONS STATUTORY RULES 1989 No. 270</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's concerns with this instrument related to rights of review of adverse decisions made under discretions granted to the Minister and to various Committees. The provision of appropriate review rights is an important safeguard upon which the Committee insists. In this case, one of the two areas of discretion raised by the Committee related to the right of medical practitioners to practise with full professional rights. The Committee has reported (see Eighty-third Report, April 1988, paragraph 4.38) that there are few more important rights than the right to earn a living. The Committee recognises that delegated legislation may suitably limit that right to ensure standards of competence and behaviour. Where, however, these supervisory procedures confer power on Ministers or others to exercise discretions which could result in the loss of the right to practice a livelihood then the Committee carefully scrutinises those provisions to ensure that decision making is objectively and not subjectively formulated, that criteria inform both the decision maker and the citizen of their respective responsibilities, that there is a right of external review of the merits of a decision with provision for substitution of a fresh decision, and that the person affected must be informed promptly of the decision, the reasons for the decision and appeal rights. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that generally such right of review can only be carried out effectively by an external, independent body. Only in exceptional cases will the Committee be persuaded that a right of internal review by the Minister, or by an internal tribunal effectively appointed by the Minister or the department, is acceptable. In almost all cases the Committee expresses a preference for such external, independent review on the merits to be conducted by the AAT. </PARA>
<PARA> The present case was particularly interesting in that although the review procedures established by the delegated legislation were internal, in that they were entirely provided for by the instrument itself and by other portfolio practices, the Committee was persuaded that the procedures were sufficiently independent to satisfy its requirements. The composition of the review body, for example, is not determined exclusively or even predominantly by the Minister and the peak body of the profession which is affected is represented strongly. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area of discretion related to lack of external merits review of the power of the Minister to remove a person from a Committee for misbehaviour or for mental or physical incapacity. Although membership of the Committee would have little financial value, removal would affect a person's personal and professional reputation. The reply to the Committee's letter pointed out that similar provisions in other legislation did not provide for the type of review. The Committee does not regard this by itself as an adequate response. The principles of the Committee are not static, but rather evolve and expand to meet changing situations. What may have been acceptable previously in the area of personal rights may have evolved under the direction of the Committee into more stringent requirements. In this case, however, taking into account all the circumstances, the Committee accepted the explanation provided. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the reply to the Committee's concerns mentioned the Administrative Decision (Judicial Review) Act. While this statute is a keystone of the comprehensive system of Commonwealth administrative law it is not concerned with review of the policy merits of decisions and also applies generally to decisions made under enactments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee thanks the Minister for Community Services and Health, the Hon Neal Blewett MP, for his co-operation. </PARA>

<PARA> I refer to the Health Insurance (Vocational Registration of GP's) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1989 No. 270, considered by the Committee at its Meeting of 2 November 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted that r.14 provides that ``The Minister may terminate the appointment of a member (of an Eligibility Committee or an Appeal Committee) for misbehaviour or physical or mental incapacity''. Each of these grounds requires subjective judgment and there appears to be no provision for review of a decision to terminate an appointment. The Committee accepts that membership of one of these Committees may not be of commercial value, but points out the loss of personal reputation which could have a serious effect on a person's future livelihood. In cases of such a decision, which could have a disastrous impact upon an individual, the Committee normally expects to see a right of external review of its merits. The Committee has also expressed a preference that such review be the function of the Administrative Review Tribunal, an independent, expert body which places itself in the position of the original decision maker. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the Committee noted that the entire review process in relation to entry on, or removal from, the Register, appears to be internal. Medical practitioners who are on the Vocational Register have substantial and valuable professional rights and prestige. In situations like the present the Committee would expect to see external review of the merits of decisions as a matter of course. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee does not appear to have been supplied with a copy of the document referred to in r.2 (2), ``Criteria for Vocational Registration of General Practitioners''. It would be appreciated if you could send a copy. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>

<PARA>Dear Chairman</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter of 22 November 1989 to the Minister for Housing and Aged Care regarding the Health Insurance (Vocational Registration of GP's) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1989 No. 270. I regret the delay in replying. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee raised concerns in its letter regarding regulation 14, namely the fact that there was no external review regarding such regulation. Further the Committee raised similar concerns regarding the review process in relation to entry on, or removal from, the Vocational Register. </PARA>
<PARA> As regards regulation 14 discussions with Attorney-Generals indicates that no previous legislation regarding termination of appointments has been made reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). The appropriate mechanism for review of this type of decision is that of the Administrative Review (Judicial Review) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee also raised concerns regarding the review process in relation to entry on or removal from the Vocational Register. The structure on which these regulations were based is that of the Specialist Recognition Advisory Committees and Appeal Committees (SRAC). The Specialist Recognition and the Vocational Registration Eligibility Committees are expert committees which look at criteria set by peers in the medical profession. In the case of the SRAC Committees review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal was not considered appropriate. In consid9ring the Vocational Registration decision making process the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance in the report ``Vocational Registration of General Practitioners''-(August 1989) at paragraph 2.25 stated ``that AAT review of decisions taken by an independent professional body about the professional standing of a doctor would not be appropriate''. Attorneys-General support this view. </PARA>
<PARA> Your Committee's concerns regarding the rights of external review are met by the fact that any person aggrieved may apply through the Administrative Review (Judicial Review) Act where the person believes they have not been accorded natural justice. Similarly the person can take out interim injunctions to stop any detriment which may be alleged would occur. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the Administrative Review (Judicial Review) Act mechanism provides an appropriate external review and trust this removes any concerns the Committee may have. </PARA>
<PARA> As to your request for a copy of the document referred to in Regulation 2 (2) please find included herein a copy of ``Criteria for Vocational Registration of General Practitioners''. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely</PARA>

<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter of 6 December 1989 concerning aspects raised by the Committee of the Health Insurance (Vocational Registration of GP's) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1989 No. 270. The Committee considered your reply at its Meeting of 7 December 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> After discussion, the Committee agreed that your advice met its concerns and is grateful for your explanation. The Committee, however, offers the following comments on your letter. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, in response to the inquiry about the discretion granted to the Minister to remove a member of an Eligibility Committee or an Appeal Committee for misbehaviour or for physical or mental incapacity, your letter mentioned that no previous legislation contained provisions suggested by the Committee. Such a reply is not considered, by itself, an adequate response. It is, of course, one relevant factor to be considered. The principles of the Committee, however, are not static but are constantly being developed and expanded. The committee has been responsible for numbers of advances in the area of personal rights, which had no precedent in existing legislation. Nevertheless, the Committee agreed to accept your advice after taking into account all the surrounding circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, in relation to paragraphs 5 and 6 of your letter, the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, while one of the most important elements in the system of Commonwealth administrative law, is not concerned with the review of merits of decisions, in connection with which the Committee raised its original concerns. In addition, that Act relates generally to decisions made under enactments. The committee respectfully points out to your departmental officers that it is familiar with the provisions of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Law) Act and with the various procedures for injunctive relief. It may be assumed in correspondence initiated by the Committee that the provisions of that Act have been taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee, however, agreed to accept the advice contained in paragraph 4 of the letter. It is unusual for the Committee in such an important matter to agree to an internal merits review procedure rather than reference to the AAT, but in this case the Committee was convinced that the procedure was independent of final ministerial or departmental control. The Committee was also influenced by the Report of the Senate Select committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance, ``Vocational Registration of General Practitioners'', to which you helpfully referred us, and to the copy of the Criteria for Vocational registration of General Practitioners which you furnished to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee appreciates your co-operation. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Defence Force Regulations (Amendment) as contained in Statutory Rules 1989 No. 290 made under the Defence Act 1903 be disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short statement of the Committee's concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Defence Force Regulations (Amendment) Statutory Rules 1989 No. 290</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The principal Regulations already provide for defence operations and practices where it is necessary to exclude members of the public from certain areas. A practice area is first declared, and an operation or practice is then authorised and notified to the public. </PARA>
<PARA> These procedures have been generally satisfactory, although there is now a new Navy requirement which is not adequately covered. To test mine detecting equipment it is necessary for objects to be left undisturbed on the sea-bed for up to two years. To avoid disturbance of the object it is necessary to prohibit certain activities such as bottom trawling for the whole of the period the objects are in place. </PARA>
<PARA> These Regulations provide for the installation for a specified period of up to two years of equipment in a declared area of sea, on the sea-bed or in the subsoil beneath that area or in the superjacent waters. Reasonable notice must be given of the installation of the equipment and of activities which may interfere with its operation. Criteria are set out for the way in which notice is to be given and the Committee does not raise any aspects of these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Regulations forbid a person from disturbing such equipment or interfering with its operation, except with the permission of a Chief of Staff or an officer participating in a defence operation or practice in relation to which the equipment was installed. This prohibition is, however, a strict liability offence punishable not only by a fine of $500 but by imprisonment for three months, or both. The Committee always requires full justification for strict liability offences, which it will accept only in the most unusual circumstances. In the present case, where the penalty includes possible imprisonment, the Committee is even more reluctant to agree to such provisions. As the installations are on the sea bed or nearby waters it may not be possible to provide adequate notice, despite the criteria in the Regulations, to all persons who may be affected. </PARA>
<PARA> The Explanatory Statement does not address the reasons why it is necessary to provide for a strict liability offence punishable by imprisonment. The Committee has written to the Minister asking for advice on whether the Regulations could be amended to provide for an element of knowledge in the offence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I seek an extension of time of the same length as was granted to Senator Teague to enable me to complete my remarks on the package of seven education Bills before the Senate. (Extension of time granted) Last night before the adjournment I was discussing the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill 1989. I made comment that the Government's emphasis with regard to overseas students has switched from a foreign policy direction with humanitarian and development objectives to a purely financial direction with our own local economic difficulties as the main focus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We must ask whether or not the new policy direction will contribute to assisting our local economic difficulties. It is interesting to note that many educational commentators believe that in attempting to gain extra capital, we may actually be pricing ourselves out of the market. It cannot be denied that the market in terms of the overseas student demand is extremely large and potentially very lucrative. Naturally, due to the demand and the money involved, the market is becoming increasingly competitive. To assume that the elasticity of demand for places in this country is so low that we continue to squeeze more and more out of overseas students is fallacious. At present the fees for courses offered in both the United States and the United Kingdom are declining, and in many Canadian provinces subsidies are now being used to snare a larger slice of the overseas student market. </PARA>
<PARA> We must not lose sight of the fact that the increased demand for places in Australia over the last decade was largely due to moves in the United Kingdom to impose full fees on its overseas students. Even on short term economic grounds, the benefits of the new scheme will remain to be proven. While the institutions may gain somewhat from the direct payment of full fees by overseas students, it is likely that the smaller number of students which will now come to Australia will provide significantly less in the way of incremental financial benefits-for example, in terms of rental payments, transport costs, travel expenses and the like. </PARA>
<PARA> The disadvantages of the new system are further compounded when one considers the likely effect on enrolment profiles. Clearly, given the high tertiary fees, the majority of our overseas students will come from more prosperous countries, perhaps reinforcing the view that we can continue to charge higher and higher fees. This means not only that we lose some of the cultural diversity which has characterised this particular area of our educational endeavour but also that we are limiting the range of countries able to avail themselves of our educational facilities. We are also looking at a move to short term informal courses, particularly English language courses. Unfortunately, the benefits to Australians from these types of courses will be strictly financial. The cultural exchange which occurs from long term formal courses is almost non-existent. We are looking at a situation which is short-sighted, which will damage our long term foreign affairs interests in this region, and which will eventually lead this Government, or a coalition government if it take its place in the next election, to reversing this trend and moving back, as other countries are currently doing, to a more open and more developmental based policy in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The last Bill that I wish to address today is the University of Canberra Bill, which is at the second reading stage. The Bill to establish the University of Canberra goes back quite some time, and the Australian Democrats welcome the move to change the old Canberra College of Advanced Education (CCAE) in order to establish the University of Canberra. Indeed, I made the first response to the Government's move to amalgamate the Australian National University (ANU) and CCAE quite some time ago. In fact I think it was early last year or possibly in the year before. The notion of amalgamation of these two institutions, from our point of view, made no sense whatsoever. However, as is still undoubtedly the case, the Minister is interested in some type of amalgamation and would dearly have loved to have seen his original Bill, which sought to bring about that amalgamation, passed by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The two institutions that we are now dealing with, the ANU and the CCAE as it is currently constituted, have two quite different missions. They are missions which are both necessary in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). There is the national mission, which the ANU, unfortunately, has not pursued with the type of vigour which I believe it should have done, and there is a local and territorial imperative that ought to be infusing the mission of the CCAE. Given the CCAE's excellent contacts in the local area, it seemed to us that it was a quite silly and disruptive move to attempt an amalgamation, either to dilute the national focus of the Australian National University or to try to run down the local focus of the CCAE. We now have a far better move, one with which I believe the people of the Territory will be well pleased. I think that in years to come it will be seen to have been the most sensible decision that could have been made with regard to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of problems in the Bill that I wish to raise in the committee stage. However, because any amendment, or even any attempted amendment, to this Bill could very well see its demise, we have no intention of moving amendments to those bits of the Bill which really ought to have been improved, but I wish to address those in the committee stage. However, I want to make one further comment about the Canberra University. It is entirely appropriate and ought to be on the agenda as soon as possible. The Canberra University should move under the control of the Australian Capital Territory Government. The reasons for that are overwhelming. </PARA>
<PARA> First, as I have already mentioned, the CCAE in its current constitution has already got a strong postgraduate body and, in fact, has extremely good links with the local community. The ACT Administration currently enrols students in the Territory's primary and secondary schools and the technical and further education (TAFE) sector. I believe that for any rational operation of educational policy within the Territory it is necessary that not only does the administration have people sitting on a board, but also that it has under its legislative control the main representatives from each sector of education. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the college has already developed very close links with the ACT schools office, the TAFE colleges, the Canberra Institute of the Arts, Australian Capital Territory industry and the broader community. The CCAE has been extremely successful in developing and establishing courses which closely reflect identifiable local needs. The principal of the college has enthusiastically participated in various local organisations: the ACT Education and Training Council, the employment agency heads meetings and the former ACT Administration coordination committee. Members of the college staff participate actively in the ACT Heritage Committee and are involved with the Canberra Development Board. </PARA>
<PARA> All of those reasons are topped off by the fact that the Federal Parliament really has, or ought to have a national scope. One of the reasons for the establishment of the ACT Government was to allow the Commonwealth Government to concentrate on broader national issues, with a Territory government directed at the needs of the local community. It should not always be assumed-in fact, Senator Reid, who is in the chamber, has pointed this out on a number of occasions-that what the Commonwealth sees to be in the national interest is what the local people of the Territory see to be in their interests. That is part and parcel of the notion of a federation. It is one of the very good reasons why the legislation governing our tertiary institutions resides, currently, under all the States and under the Northern Territory Administration. That is what ought to occur here. This point has already been supported by the Australian Capital Territory Select Committee on Tertiary Amalgamations. I hope that in a short space of time we will be able to move towards the Australian Capital Territory Government being the body responsible for the legislation for the University of Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish the university well. I think it will take its place amongst other State and Territory universities as an organisation which will contribute fruitfully to the people of the Territory. Over the years I have had the opportunity of meeting both with teaching and administration staff, and I believe that they are more than capable of taking their place within what is, in Australia, a very viable, strong and fruitful university sector. I believe that the matters that have now been resolved with regard to funding have been conducted in the proper way. At the beginning of this matter, we felt that there was going to be some attempt, because of the Government's thwarted policy direction, to penalise the institutions. In my mind, I never really thought that was on because of the political implausibility of any government seeking to penalise any particular sector. Indeed, I think we will see some ramifications of that objective when, at a later stage, there will undoubtedly be some discussions with regard to the proposed amalgamation in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We have here what is certainly the best and most progressive view that could be taken, and I hope that the people of the Australian Capital Territory find in their university a university responsive to their needs and, on the other hand, that the ANU will more aggressively pursue its national goals and seek to take its undergraduate and post-graduate student bodies from the whole of Australia, rather than the unfortunate situation that has grown up in recent years whereby, in terms of its faculties, at the current time some 60 per cent of its students come from the Australian Capital Territory. A national university ought to be national in scope, construction and composition. The establishment of the University of Canberra and its proper funding now provide the people of the Territory with their own university access. We should now see an aggressive exercise by the ANU towards its legislative mission which was put down in the original legislation and which is still there, that is, to pursue national goals which are not always able to be pursued and, in fact, currently are not being pursued in a number of areas by State universities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of the package of Bills we are discussing, I wish to refer specifically to the University of Canberra Bill 1989. It has been a turbulent year for higher education, particularly so for two institutions in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT)-the Australian National University (ANU) and the Canberra College of Advanced Education (CCAE). They have lived throughout this year with the threat of amalgamation and funding withdrawals if the Government and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) did not get their own way. This Bill is really a triumph over the adversity of the difficult year that I have referred to. Many people at the CCAE who saw benefits and advantages to the institution from amalgamation have never got answers to their questions about how amalgamation would come about and what the relationship between the two institutions would be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A report on amalgamation commissioned by the Minister does not, in any way, answer the questions about why the institutions should be amalgamated. A decision was taken to amalgamate the two institutions no matter what, and no matter what the cost. Many people in the institutions who were very worried about amalgamation could not get answers to the questions they wanted, the key question being: what benefit would it be to students? That question has never been answered. </PARA>
<PARA> We come to the end of the year with the CCAE in a situation where it will shortly become the University of Canberra. I think that is something we all welcome. This institution has proved its academic ability and it has been extremely successful in many areas. The CCAE has attracted people from overseas and it has, undoubtedly, an overseas reputation which will continue into the future. It has acquired that reputation in its own right. The ANU also has a splendid reputation. However, the two institutions are quite different. The CCAE has been extremely successful over the years in training people for careers in which they can obtain employment. It has been outstandingly successful in this respect, even during times of difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA> The opposition to the Government's plan stemmed from an inability to show that any educational or economic benefits to the institutions or the students could be gained from amalgamation. Presumably, if the Government had been able to show that there was merit, the amalgamation might have gone ahead. But the Government seemed to be arguing that big is beautiful. I think most people believed that the two institutions would stay as they were and that there would just be another layer of administration to bring them together. If there was anything else to it, it certainly was not made apparent to those of us who are interested in the future of Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the underlying fallacy of the amalgamation argument was made even more apparent when it become clear that threats were being made to try to force institutions to come together. There may be institutions in other places that can amalgamate quite satisfactorily, but this process did not seem to be appropriate across the board. The Federal Government has control over both the ANU and the CCAE in the ACT and because of this it was able to hold a gun at their heads in an attempt to make them bow to its will. The Government took a different course only when it realised that the Senate would not go along with an enforced amalgamation. This was not just a local reaction-academics and others in Australia had the same reservations. I think it is worth reviewing some of the views that were held. </PARA>
<PARA> In August 1988 the Chancellor of the University of Sydney, Sir Helmann Black, said that the Government's attitudes were `authoritarian, particularly dangerously vague and open-ended as to how they may be interpreted and utterly unnecessary'. Professor Nichol said that the Government `contradicted its own promise of deregulation with its detailed agenda for the way universities should be run, including areas of traditional university autonomy'. He referred to the `potentially burdensome government framework'. </PARA>
<PARA> In July 1988, the Dean of the Victorian College of Pharmacy accused the Government of social engineering in the plan which would put non-science and technology courses on a second rung. Melbourne University's Professor David Penington referred to `very serious flaws in Mr Dawkins' proposals'. In the Age of 6 August 1988, Professor Penington is reported as saying that the Government's White Paper heralded `a period of unprecedented political interference and central regulatory control virtually unknown elsewhere in the Western world'. I think these comments added considerably to the concerns that many people had about what was going on and why the amalgamation was being pushed. Certainly, no answers were ever given in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Financial Review in July 1988 also made an editorial comment on the Government's policies. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> By proposing to turn the Government funded higher education system into a gigantic bureaucratic shemozzle designed to suppress originality or research and initiative, Mr Dawkins has ensured that a flourishing private sector university system will come into being. </PARA>
<PARA> In one fell blow the Government will have succeeded in worsening the conditions for the best university staff and worsening the average quality of the staff of the new Dawkins mega-universities. </PARA>
<PARA>They are very serious comments indeed. People in Canberra were concerned that the character of the CCAE would be lost if it were absorbed into the ANU. I think the ANU likewise felt that its intrinsic character, which has been referred to by Senator Macklin, would be lost if it were absorbed into the CCAE and no benefits were apparent. </PARA>
<PARA> The CCAE is not against change and had already sought to become a university of technology in its own right. This was rejected by the Federal Government in spite of the quite strong merits of the case which were put forward by the college. As I said, since it became clear that the Government would face defeat in the Senate if it were to attempt to force a merger, the college has gone about strengthening its position. It has come to a conclusion, which the Government has now accepted-I believe that this will be best for the college and best for Canberra-that it should become the University of Canberra. This Bill provides for that under the tutelage of Monash University. There are similarities here with the way in which the ANU began life in 1946 as the Canberra University College, a branch of the University of Melbourne. I think all of us welcome the relationship which will exist over the next three years between the University of Canberra and Monash University. Benefits will be available from developing graduate programs, academic exchanges and joint research projects. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Macklin and Senator Teague referred to the question of the University of Canberra coming under the Australian Capital Territory Government. I think all of us see that as something which will occur and we will discuss it when we are in government. These institutions will create many benefits for Canberra. They will attract people to Canberra. Students will want to come here. Tertiary sector growth is very significant and important in the development of this region, economic and otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reading speech of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training commits the Government to maintaining the vital role which the CCAE presently plays in the Australian Capital Territory and the surrounding community in terms of vocational training. That is important to the people of the Australian Capital Territory. The excellent institution that we now have will become the University of Canberra. I certainly support the Bill. I wish the University well. I hope that the necessary steps will be taken to see that this change takes place before the end of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Alston has asked me to refer to the Overseas Students Charge Bill, in which he has an interest. In view of time constraints, he said that he would not speak on the Bill today. He has asked me to indicate that the Opposition will not oppose the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak briefly to the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 and allied Bills. In particular I wish to refer to the Bill which provides for the rural hostels program and the extension of eligibility for the funding under the capital grants program to rural hostels. This will allow government and non-government organisations providing accommodation for rural students to apply for funding under the general element of the capital grants program. It also provides for the establishment of a rural hostels program to provide assistance to hostels with an initial allocation in 1990 of $1m. The Government's April rural education and training strategy entitled A Fair Go stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The needs of young people undertaking secondary education in country areas and young people required to move from remote communities to undertake secondary education deserve priority attention. </PARA>
<PARA>This cannot be disputed. According to the Isolated Children's Parents Association, only 30 per cent of rural students complete year 12 compared to the national average of 60 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The main difficulty facing rural students is the distances between institutions offering various courses, usually due to a lack of resources at schools with small student numbers. One way of improving access for rural students is the provision of hostels at government and non-government schools. A category of rural student hostels has been established and $1m will be made available in 1990. I would have thought that a preferable avenue to increasing the provision of hostels for rural students, hence increasing access to secondary education, would be to improve their affordability. Schools would not hesitate to provide greater boarding facilities if the families of their students could meet the costs of these facilities. Boarding allowance is provided under the assistance for isolated children's (AIC) scheme. The $1m allocated to the rural hostel program in the Government's so-called `priority attention' to the needs of children from remote communities pales into insignificance compared to the decline in the value of the AIC allowances under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall contrast the 1983 scheme with the 1989 scheme to show the deterioration in the value of benefits provided to students. Under the 1989 scheme $989 is the guaranteed minimum payment, free of the assets test and the means test. There is a maximum allowance of $2,513. It is means tested from an income base of $16,950, being reduced by $2.50 for each $10 earned thereafter. The minimum is reached when the maximum income of $23,050 is arrived at. Under the 1983 scheme there was a base grant of $866, irrespective of levels of income or assets, plus a maximum additional allowance of $1,066, which declined at a rate of $2.50 for each additional $10 of income in excess of $10,200. That provided a total maximum benefit of $1,932. That cut out at an additional income of $4,270 of a total income of $14,464. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of today's dollars if we compare the consumer price index for 1983 to the consumer price index of 1989 and use 1981 as a base of 100, the figure for 1983 was 127.3. That figure would now stand at 197.8. The 1983 dollars have to be multiplied by 1.55 to put them into present dollar figures. There has been a very significant decline in the value provided to students over that period. There is a very significant fall-off-in fact, the decline is something like 26.3 per cent-in the level of the benefits provided to children. With the indulgence of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray), whose attention is rivetted to this speech, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table of the comparison of benefits to students under the 1983 program and students under the 1989 program. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. When the scheme was introduced in 1973 the Government provided a subsidy of 55 per cent of the cost of the boarding fees. That level has not been maintained with inflation, so students and parents are very significantly disadvantaged. I continue to wonder why this Government takes such a cynical approach towards people in the country, parents in isolated areas, who are seeking to provide an education for their children that is comparable with that in metropolitan areas. I see the very significant disadvantage these children are under. I ask myself why the Government does not address the problems-why it allows, for instance, in the case of the AIC a 26.3 per cent deterioration in the value of the dollar over the period 1983 to 1989. I can only put it down to political pragmatism on the part of this Government. I recognise that the poorest 27 per cent of seats are held by the Liberal and National parties. If we are looking at hard votes, I suppose that explains it. I record my disappointment at the fact that the Government, which under this scheme is saving itself many millions of dollars, has chosen not to increase the allowance for children living in isolated areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me give honourable senators an idea of the aggregate decline in support for rural students. In 1984 there were 21,651 students receiving a total of $22.9m under the AIC. That equates to $1,058 per recipient, or $1,583 in present dollar terms. In 1989-90 there are expected to be 16,500 AIC recipients. If the funding levels had remained constant there would be an allocation of $26.12m for these children. Instead, the Budget forecast is $17.34, almost $9m less. The shortfall would have been even greater if the 4,500 children being transferred from AIC to Austudy were included. The maximum Austudy allowance for children aged 16 and 17 is $2,792 compared with the 1983 maximum AIC allowance of $3,725-or $2,403 when adjusted for inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> So through the decline of the AIC scheme under this Government, millions of dollars which would have been available to fund rural hostels and other boarding accommodation have been withdrawn-at least $9m this year in comparison with 1983. With it the opportunity for country children to complete their secondary education is being withdrawn. In return, the families of isolated children are being given a rural hostels program with an initial funding in 1990 of $1m. </PARA>

Before I do, I will comment on two of the contributions made in the debate, express some disappointment about the nature of some of the comments made in one instance, and perhaps provide some balancing comment in the other.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it was arithmetically in error; that is somewhat more fundamental. He made an apparently profound point about the declining value of contributions per student in tertiary education. I thought he overlooked the fairly fundamental point that, as the number of students increases, in the normal course of events it is likely that the dollar expenditure per student will fall. It would be very easy to increase the dollar contribution per student. We could have only one and then there would be an enormous contribution per student, but it would not be a very substantial contribution to education. It is a fairly standard economic analysis that fixed and variable costs must be looked at. As the number of students increases, the relationship of fixed costs per student will fall and, even if variable costs per student-for staff, for example-are rising, the total expenditure per student is likely to fall. I thought Senator Teague's point in that respect was a bit more simplistic than the rest of his contribution and I qualify it in those terms.</PARA></TALK.START>

I have never met anybody who ran any institution who did, and I am not necessarily making an argument for whether they need more money; I am simply saying that that argument is invalid. It needs to be analysed much further. Of course, the heads of institutions would like more money and they can always think of valid and important things they could do with it. That is why they run institutions. Other people have the responsibility in running the Government to make hard choices about distribution of revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want not so much to disagree with the things Senator Macklin said as to add a point. He spoke at some length about the nature of the educational relationship between Australia and countries in our region. In so far as I was able to hear all that he said-telephones and other things interrupted a little-my understanding was that he overlooked one substantial initiative which has been beneficial in that relationship. I refer to the initiation of the equity and merit scholarship scheme under the aid program. I think it is the best education program that has developed between Australia and not exclusively, but principally, neighbouring countries. It makes a substantial and beneficial contribution and ought to be considered in conjunction with the other comments that Senator Macklin made. I do not want to debate those points. I would rather concentrate on the University of Canberra Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In supporting the Bill, I welcome the establishment of this new institution and congratulate those who have done so much work to lead to the point where the Bill can be introduced. I am confident that a smooth transition can be made from the Canberra College of Advanced Education (CCAE) to the University of Canberra. The people of Australia, in particular the people of Canberra, will be very proud of the institution that emerges under the new title, as they have had cause to be proud of the CCAE, which has done so much good work in the region up to now. </PARA>
<PARA> The sponsorship arrangement with Monash University is an appropriate mechanism for the transition in the context of higher education in Australia and the way in which the transition is being managed nationally. From discussions I have had so far with people at what is now the CCAE and what will soon be the University of Canberra, I think that until now the relationship has been beneficial and that the signs are that it will continue to be so. It is possible to argue that we could have established a very worthwhile, substantial university without the Monash connection. I think that is true, but we may establish a better university with the Monash connection. After the three years it will be very interesting to see whether there is a prevailing view that that sponsorship needs to continue. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a preliminary view that the conclusion drawn at that time will be that it will not need to continue and that the University of Canberra will be in a position to stand on its own two feet, but that is a judgment for three years hence. It may be that the relationship is so beneficial and future developments in it may be such that we will wish to continue it in the long term. That will be a debate in which I will be pleased to join at the time. But the sponsorship arrangement and the way in which it has been integrated into the Council of the university and the academic board of the university seem to me to be structured well. I expect that it can work both administratively and in terms of educational outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> The other controversial question relates to the relationship between the university and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and its Government, as compared to the Federal Government. The most important thing is that clause 6 of the Bill quite explicitly and appropriately states that special attention is to be given to the needs of the Australian Capital Territory and the surrounding regions. Although my constituent responsibility relates only to the Capital Territory, I would be very concerned to think that the University of Canberra and the Australian National University (ANU) in the faculties in which it operates as an undergraduate university failed to see themselves as significant regional institutions rather than merely ACT institutions. They have not done so up to now. </PARA>
<PARA> In discussing this Bill, I will concentrate on the role of the CCAE, the prospective University of Canberra, in this matter. However, both institutions have been effectively and consciously regional institutions and that is to their credit. It is necessary for people in Canberra who sometimes see the University of Canberra, as it will be, as theirs to be encouraged in this attitude that it is ours. It is, firstly, a national institution and, secondly, one that has particular responsibility to the wider region. </PARA>
<PARA> In the short term, we have struck a fair compromise in the constitution of the Council and in terms of the respective roles of the Federal Government and the ACT Government, and I believe that is the view of the people of Canberra. It would be reasonable to say that the people of Canberra do not have the same confidence in the contribution that a government of the ACT might make to the management of this institution as they currently have in the Federal Government. I am confident that, after the next ACT election, a more stable government will develop, one which will develop a high standing in the eyes of the people of Canberra, as high as that which the Follett Government developed in its seven months in office. It may be that we will see a transition in that matter as well, but it may also be that the proper recognition that Canberra has a dual role as a city of 250,000 people and as the national capital, which is so much the driving force in areas like planning in Canberra, will also be a factor in determining the composition of the Council of the University of Canberra in a way that says there should be a continuing national interest, as there is at the ANU with the parliamentary representatives on its Council. There will also at some stage be a change in the Monash University representation if the sponsorship changes. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I make in this debate is one about the relationship between the University of Canberra and the ANU. It is very important for those of us with children growing up in Canberra who hope that our children will have successful tertiary education opportunities here that the ANU and the University of Canberra work cooperatively and effectively on behalf of the potential students from all of Australia whom I hope the institutions will attract-but particularly, from my point of view, from the ACT. Therefore, I welcome the agreement that has been reached between the two universities, as I might call them, but it is a bit precipitate, as it relates to the University of Canberra, concerning the development of engineering education here in Canberra and in the region. I think both sides made some compromises. It may not be the perfect document, but it gives some certainty and confidence to people and encourages us to believe that that cooperative relationship can be enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA> So in supporting this package of legislation, and in particular the University of Canberra Bill, I express once again my enthusiasm for the emergence of this institution and my confidence that the University of Canberra will be held in high regard by the people of Canberra and by its peers in the tertiary education sector. I congratulate the Principal of the Canberra College of Advanced Education, Roger Scott, for his outstanding contribution to this transition. He has managed the political exercise so skilfully that I can only be envious. It has also been a very competent administrative task, and Roger Scott deserves to be congratulated. But no one person can make these transitions successful on their own. Although he has done a good job, its success is an indication of the support and capacity of all the people in the institution-academic staff, other staff and students. It reflects well on all of them, and it gives me confidence that the University of Canberra will be the success that I hope it will be. I support the Bills. </PARA>

<PARA>Student fees</PARA>

<PARA> (a) by inserting in subsection (2) ``, payable annually in 4 equal instalments,'' after ``may be charged fees''. </PARA>

<PARA> (a) the practice by institutions of charging fees for post-graduate courses of the kind described in subsection (2); and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the effects of charging such fees on the profile of postgraduate enrolments.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats have circulated a number of amendments to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2), the first of which is with regard to the instalment plan. The first amendment seeks to make payable in four equal instalments the fees which are required of students. The States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1987 first gave tertiary institutions the power to charge fees with regard to a number of their postgraduate courses. At the time of the second reading debate on that Bill I indicated the opposition of the Australian Democrats to this imposition of fees on our postgraduate students. I also devoted some time to explaining why I believe the skills and capacities particularly of that group of people, who already represent a significant investment on behalf of the community in their education, really deserve the additional support. It is a simple economic proposition in many ways, in that if a student has the capacity-and, of course, the capacity of postgraduate students is estimated by the institution in which they are studying-he is accepted into a course quite specifically upon his previous academic qualifications and his capacity to undertake that particular work. </PARA>
<PARA> I also pointed out in that debate some of the difficulties that were emerging with regard to the exemption operation. In particular, I raised the issue of postgraduate course work programs which have proved extremely useful for teachers to upgrade their qualifications, to enable them to seek advancement within their own profession and to seek an additional academic base to their professional activities in schools. The vast bulk of people in postgraduate course-work programs operating in Australia are teachers. Unfortunately, many tertiary institutions have made quite deliberate attempts to exclude course-work programs from the ability to undertake the exemptions. </PARA>
<PARA> The other problem that I have alluded to in the past is that when Senator Ryan, who was then the Minister for Education, raised the issue of fees in terms of institutions which are charging these fees at the postgraduate level, we had a guarantee on behalf of the Government that the situation would be very closely monitored. I have endeavoured over this year to find out what precisely that monitoring exercise we were promised amounts to. It is still shrouded in mystery: we are still not getting information from the Government about what is happening with those postgraduate course-work fee structures. One of the risks in the development of fee-paying courses is that it will lead some institutions in the tight economic context that they all operate in at the moment to divert more of their already thinly spread resources towards these particular kinds. That may be a risk and, indeed, if one looks at some of the course offerings currently there, one will find that a major risk is turning into an actuality with regard to a number of those particular institutions. Clearly, the charging of an up-front fee of $1,800 for post-graduate courses will have an adverse effect on access to those courses, and there is no provision in the current legislation which would ameliorate this. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment I am moving today is designed to allow students enrolled on fee-paying post-graduate courses to pay their fees in four equal instalments throughout the years. The beginning of the year is a particularly tough time for students, as many of them are moving house, having to pay bonds, having to pay additional travel expenses and having to purchase extremely expensive textbooks, stationery and other types of equipment. When all those things are added together at the beginning of the year, the pressure on the limited available resources of students or the resources available from their families is certainly stretched to breaking point. The ability to spread the payment-and that is all we are talking about here; we are not talking about the principle of whether there should be one or not-enables students to cope better and be in a financial position whereby they are able to pay as they go along. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the introduction of this instalment plan will alleviate much of the financial hardship faced by students in a large variety of tertiary institutions. Within each tertiary institution, of course, there is generally a specialised body dealing with the question of financial hardship for students. It is their view that an instalment plan would certainly alleviate that pressure on students and that it would eliminate to a very large extent the adverse effect on participation of the up-front fee that exists. I urge the Senate to consider this proposition of ameliorating the difficulties that people face and to put in place a more reasonable method by which people can pay the required fees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not have any amendments to the Bill. Neither do we support the amendment moved by the Australian Democrats. To save me rising again to speak, I will address not only this first amendment but also, in a summary fashion, the three matters that relate to this Bill. The first concerns postgraduate full fee courses. Whilst there is concern on the part of all of us to ensure that there is not an inordinate burden upon these students, not one of these students, not anyone connected with the full fee postgraduate courses that have been introduced, has written to me or, to my knowledge, other members of the Opposition, complaining about the present arrangements. Indeed, institutions are already flexible in the administration of these schemes. As I understand it, institutions are allowed to collect these fees under arrangements that they make with students.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For many of the students undertaking these full fee courses, the institutions at which they are employed pay the fees. Certainly the Opposition urged on the Government the flexibility for institutions to mount such innovative courses on a full fee basis. Therefore, I do not see why we need to formalise any amendments such as that moved by Senator Macklin. In particular, the reference in the amendment to the word `annually' may be misplaced, as many of the courses are of six months duration. Whilst the intent of the amendment is, I presume, to have two equal instalments in a semester--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Macklin" NAMEID="2I4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator Macklin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It doesn't say that.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Then I am wrong in my assumption. It actually says `annually in four equal instalments'. It would appear that that kind of amendment does not directly apply to a course that is of only six months or three months duration. So whether or not that is a technical fault in the amendment, the Opposition does not see the necessity to formalise such an arrangement by an amendment to the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second matter concerns the reference to the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. Senator Macklin said that there does not appear to be a great deal of information about with regard to the extent, number and type of courses, and perhaps the pressure upon students enrolled in these courses. I do not see this as such a priority matter that we must, in statute, require the National Board to make an inquiry, let alone annual inquiries. It is perfectly competent for the National Board of its own motion, to raise such a matter and either report separately to the Minister in this Parliament or refer to this in its survey of higher education matters. So, because of the particularity and the requirement for it to be an annual inquiry, the Opposition does not support it. However, I would add some weight to Senator Macklin's concern in this area. It would seem to me appropriate for the National Board of Employment, Education and Training and the Higher Education Council to take these comments on board and to fit such inquiries into their priorities. </PARA>

<PARA> (2) Page 7 after clause 16, add the following new clause:</PARA>
<PARA>Liability of students during enrolment</PARA>
<PARA>``17. The Principal Act is amended by adding the following section after section 68 in Division 3 of Part 4.4:</PARA>
<PARA>Liability of students during enrolment</PARA>
<PARA>68A. In spite of any other provisions of this Act, a student to whom paragraphs 68 (1) (a) and (b) apply, is not obliged to make payments in accordance with this Part until the student has, for whatever reason, ceased to be enrolled as a contributing student in the designated course of study with respect to which liability to make such payments arises.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment seeks to add a new clause to deal with the situation of part time students. In the current situation, full time students have an option. Either they or their parents are able to pay up-front in most cases or they may delay their payment, which then becomes a tax liability which is paid off over time. I have pointed to the problem with the second arrangement in respect of people in income brackets that reach the threshold but do not go much higher than that. I do not wish to go into that matter at this time but I want to look at the position of part time students. </PARA>
<PARA> All part time students earning in excess of $22,000 are required to pay up-front. The main argument that I put forward on this is similar to the one that I made in relation to the previous amendment, which was just defeated: whether one is studying full time or part time, there are very many considerable course-related costs-textbooks, transport, meals and stationery. Many part time students also face significant add-on costs. For example, many women going back to studies would need to pay significant fees for child minding. Part time students would have to find a not inconsiderable amount of money that they would not normally have to find if they were not studying. So there is a major disincentive for a certain class of part time student-females with dependent children on low to moderate household incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously this does not affect all part time students. In the same way that full time students with resources have a capacity to pay up-front and get a discount, people in full time employment doing part time studies who have the income would pay up-front because they would save by doing so. I am not referring to those people but to the other group of people-basically female students on low incomes with dependent children. </PARA>
<PARA> It is useful to recall that in 1987 the higher education contribution monitoring committee recommended that part time and external students with family incomes of less than $27,024 should be exempt. This is the only outside inquiry that has been undertaken. The members of the body which undertook that inquiry made a unanimous decision that the matter should be dealt with in that way. It is interesting that this non-government group that actually looked at the effects of this matter made that recommendation. Of course, that was $27,000 in 1987 dollar terms. Under the current scheme, part time students earning a salary above $22,000 are required to pay. If they earn over $25,000 they have to make a higher payment of $220 on the first level and $450 on the second level. It will be recalled that the higher education administrative charge that had such a marked adverse effect on part time enrolments was just $263 in its final year of operation. </PARA>
<PARA> Typically, a person undertaking part time study is earning only an average wage. In these times, particularly with high interest rates on mortgages, that wage must be spread extremely thinly to cover all living expenses. Upon graduation, however, this person is likely to gain significant financial benefit in the form of increased salary. That also is a matter of statistical fact. Therefore, after graduation the person's ability to pay the fee rises significantly. </PARA>
<PARA> As in the previous amendment, I am suggesting here a rearrangement of the methods that we currently use to assist students, and particularly a certain class of student, to meet the payments. This amendment does not go to the principle of whether there should be a payment or not. It goes to the way in which that repayment is to be made so that we can best alleviate the financial pressure at the point when it occurs, and that is when one is undertaking study, particularly part time study, either to upgrade or to enhance one's capacity to earn a higher income. </PARA>
<PARA> The ability of part time students to pay afterwards when their course related expenses have disappeared and their income is likely to have increased as a result of a successful course of study means that after graduation from a particular course such students are in a position to pay off that debt much more rapidly than a student undertaking a three year full time course. The rearrangement would not be significant in cash flow terms to the Government. There would be a delay-I acknowledge that-of a certain amount of money coming back from these part time students. But, since it is likely to come back much more rapidly after a student's graduation, the overall effect will not greatly disturb the current income projections for the ensuing financial years. It is on that basis that I recommend this amendment to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not support the Australian Democrats' amendment. Indeed, I ask the Democrats to put that whole question to the taxpayers of Australia. It is tantamount to saying this: under this Labor Government's higher education contribution scheme, or HECS, which the Opposition will abolish, no student is required to make any current year contribution unless his or her income exceeds $22,000. Do the taxpayers of Australia want to give an interest free loan to students on high incomes in order to ease their mortgage repayment problems or whatever else while they undertake some studies?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the case directly cited by Senator Macklin, a full time student with an income of $27,000 a year would be required to pay $540 in that year. Do the Democrats seriously want to put it to the taxpayers of Australia that it is reasonable for a student on an income of $27,000 not to be required to make a payment of $540 when undertaking a full time course worth $10,000 provided by the taxpayer? I believe that it is unreasonable. The Democrats may well be trying to win some marginal votes from mature age entry students in higher education, but it is not reasonable for us to give a blanket exemption to all students making up-front payments during any year in which they are enrolled. </PARA>
<PARA> In any event, 20 per cent of all students are choosing to pay up-front and are gaining the 15 per cent discount that the present Government offers to students who do so rather than accumulating a tax liability to be paid some time in the future. The Opposition will go a long way better than that. We will cut the annual tuition cost to a student not just by 15 per cent but by one third, so that the maximum payable by any student in any year will be reduced from $1,800 to $1,200. Students with high incomes-that is, higher than average weekly earnings-are likely to be part time students. Therefore, the costs that they will incur in that year of part time study will be short of the full tuition charges under the present Government or the much reduced charge which will apply when the Opposition comes to government, I trust after the March or May election next year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had an interesting proposition from the Opposition. It objects in very strong terms to what it calls a $500 free loan. However, Senator Teague explained that the Liberals will be dropping the fee from $1,800 to $1,200, which, in my accounting, is $600 free. The Opposition has a most extraordinary proposition: it objects to assisting low income earners, yet it wants to give people $600 free. It is a pity that Senator Teague did not listen to what I was talking about. He quoted the number of people who choose to pay up-front. The people who choose to pay up-front happen to be the people who have the money. It makes good sense to pay up-front. We are not giving an interest free loan to people with high incomes because they will pay up-front; we are assisting those people at the margins, particularly women with dependent children, to ease their way into part time study to upgrade their qualifications. The whole base of Senator Teague's proposition is flawed. He sees education as a cost. That is where we differ from the Government and the Opposition. We do not see education as a cost; we see education as a benefit to the community.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Page 3, after clause 6, insert the following new clause:</PARA>
<PARA>Benefits under AUSTUDY Scheme</PARA>
<PARA>``6a. Section 10 of the Principal Act is amended by inserting the following subsection after subsection (1a):</PARA>
<PARA> `(1b) In specifying circumstances in which benefits are not payable under this Part, the regulations must not have the effect of excluding from eligibility to be granted Education Assistance a student who is less than 16 years of age if the student is pursuing a non-compulsory course, or a prescribed part of a non-compulsory course, of study or instruction at an education institution for the purpose of completing the student's secondary education.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment looks at an item that we discussed some time ago with regard to the ability to provide education assistance to a student who is less than 16 years old. That student is undertaking a course of study in a secondary school-the post-compulsory years of schooling-or in a tertiary institution. We need to look back to 1986 with regard to this, because at that time and in the following year the Government put the tertiary education assistance scheme in the place of the secondary allowance scheme and the adult secondary education assistance scheme. I think this was an important move because it was based on the Government's view, which I think was shared by all political parties, that there needed to be a close alignment between the level of student assistance and the unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> This increase in the value of student assistance was necessary to encourage young people to continue their education and training rather than go onto the dole. However, an unfortunate side effect of the legislation was the withdrawal of Austudy support to those students in senior years at school who were not yet 16 years old. As we pointed out in 1986, a considerable number of students fall into this category. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) figures for 1989 are not currently available, but I think the 1988 figures give a very good indication of the number of students aged 15 or less who are likely to be in post-compulsory education this year, and who are thus ineligible for Austudy. In government schools there were approximately 31,800 students aged 15 years or less. This represented about 10 per cent of students in their post-compulsory years of schooling who were ineligible to receive any form of student assistance. In non-government schools there were approximately 13,000 students, or about 9 per cent, who fell below that age limit. So the discrimination that is operating on the basis of age affects about 44,000 students, on ABS figuring. </PARA>
<PARA> This discrimination was highlighted last year when the parents of a particularly gifted 12-year-old student who was planning to undertake tertiary studies were informed that, due to age requirements, their child would not qualify for student assistance. Here was a child who, due to her exceptional ability, had managed to complete her secondary schooling ahead of schedule and wanted to go ahead with her education. One would imagine that this was exactly the type of student that the country would be bending over backwards to support. Of course, had this child not been so exceptional and gone through her schooling at a regular pace, we would have been happy to support her, but because she was exceptional the Government said that it would not assist her. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time that issue arose, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) wrote to the Australian newspaper on 6 December 1988, defending his Department's decision. He stated that the offering of Austudy to only those students aged 16 years or older was essential in order to ensure that substantial income support should become available to students at the point at which the attraction of the dole might put them at the risk of leaving school. I have already recognised the valuable role that the payment of student assistance plays in this regard. However, I believe that the purpose of the student assistance scheme should be more than merely offering an alternative to unemployment benefit. It is my belief, and the belief of my party, that the scheme should be designed to assist the development of our young people. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely the attraction of the dole is not the sole motivation of students who leave post-compulsory education. The high costs involved with post-compulsory education and tertiary education often mean that parents are unable to continue to provide education for their children. If their children are aged 16 years or older, the Government is, quite rightly, prepared to meet some of these costs. However, if they are 15 years old, the Government says that the parents must pay. Clearly, the costs involved in advanced education do not suddenly arise as soon as a child becomes 16. Yet the current legislation presents it as though costs suddenly appear, out of the blue, when a student is 16 years of age. But the costs are the same for a 15-year-old as for a 16-year-old doing exactly the same course. What the Government is essentially saying to these people is, `Sure you have made it to post-secondary schooling, but you are different. You are only 15, so we are not going to help you. If you had come through like everybody else and were 16, that would be fine, but you are not, so we will discriminate against you'. So parents of 15-year-olds are trying to meet the high cost of secondary education with virtually no support from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In the letter that the Minister wrote about the costs for those under 16 in this scheme, he also said that the costs would be prohibitive. Yet he provides no evidence to show why these students are less deserving than 16-year-olds. I believe that the age limit is a purely arbitrary criterion, imposed simply to reduce the number of students eligible for assistance, and thereby reduce the cost. So, rather than encouraging gifted students to progress through schooling at a rate that suits them, this Government will punish them if they have ability. Rather than make it easier for those students to develop, it will quash them by placing disincentives in the way of their progress. </PARA>
<PARA> I readily admit that this is not a problem for a large number of senators representing various States here. But it is an interesting problem for Senator Teague, who is leading the debate for the Opposition. I have State distribution figures showing the percentages of 15-year-olds in year 11. They reveal some interesting facts. I am referring to government schools. The figures for non-government schools are almost identical. As I have said, the overall rate was 9.8 per cent in government schools and 9 per cent in non-government schools; so I will take government schools. In New South Wales the percentage of 15-year-olds that we are talking about is 2 per cent; in Victoria it is 1.1 per cent; in Tasmania it is one per cent; and in the Australian Capital Territory it is one per cent. However, in the Northern Territory it is 21 per cent; in Queensland it is 22 per cent; in Western Australia it is 23 per cent; and in South Australia-the State that Senator Teague comes from-it is 26 per cent. We are not dealing with a small number of people; we are dealing with a substantial number of people. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that there is no rational, ethical basis for this discrimination against those 15-year-olds. They are as entitled to this allowance as are 16-year-olds. Those percentages obviously reveal something. They reveal something about the organisation and admittance criteria in those States, the age at which children begin primary school and the way in which they progress through. It is fairly obvious that Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory have a structure such that children are able to find themselves in year 11 at age 15. That is what the law of the land provides. That is what parents accept. Having complied with State law with regard to the admittance of their children to primary and secondary school, they are now to be penalised by Federal law. It is not the fault of the parents that the children are in this position, and I hope it will not be suggested here that it is the fault of the students. The fault lies with the differentiation between what we have done in this place with our legislation and what State governments have done in their legislation. It is no good our waving our arms around and saying, `That is their problem'. It is not. We have created the difficulty. We have created the discrimination, based on nothing more than that the parents and children have--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Haines reminds me that the Government and the Liberal Opposition voted together on this matter last time it went through. They have created a context of discrimination against those 15-year-olds in those States and the Northern Territory. There can be no justification for the continuation of this discrimination. As it results from discrepancies between our legislation and State legislation, it cannot be overcome by State legislation. The reason for that is simple: these children have been in school for 10 years. It will take another 15 years to resolve the discrimination if we change State legislation. However, we can remove that discrimination now, today, by changing the Federal legislation. It is reasonable, rational and certainly moral to do so. I hope that this time around-not in the heat of the debate as happened when a similar Bill was here the first time-the Committee will see that this is a reasonable proposition with regard to those 15-year-old students.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not support the Australian Democrats' amendment. I well recall the debate in 1986 when then Senator Susan Ryan was Minister for Education. In the Budget of that year there was a response to a thorough review by the present Government of all student assistance, youth assistance, assistance for dependent children, the family allowance and other measures whereby the Commonwealth assisted families. At that time the Opposition was critical of the denial of Austudy benefits to year 11 students, particularly in my State of South Australia, in the Northern Territory and in Western Australia, where students enrol at a younger age in grade one and where there is thus a higher incidence of 15-year-old students undertaking year 11 studies than is the case in the eastern States. So I acknowledge the facts to which Senator Macklin referred. The proportions and discrepancies are exactly the same as those that we in the Opposition were critical of in the Government's decisions of 1986. Senator Macklin is right to remember that debate. But what he failed to refer to in his speech just now was that the cost of this reform at that time was $30m, and that that $30m cannot be taken on the run by a responsible Opposition and--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister interjects that he thinks it is $40m now, and I am not surprised. This Opposition is a responsible Opposition that has set forth its tax and expenditure policies and its education policies. It accepts that, unless there are extraordinary circumstances, we will not upset the Budget of the elected Government. Through this amendment in the committee stage of the Student Assistance Amendment Bill (No. 2), the Democrats are trying, without any reference whatsoever to cost or to the comprehensive picture of the Government's Budget, to redress a decision that was taken two years ago. The more responsible way ahead is that which the Opposition has announced in its education policy, which is that the Liberal and National parties will, in government, thoroughly review the rules and administration of Austudy to ensure that they are fair to all. That review will be one of our urgent tasks on coming to government, hopefully after the March or May election next year. The question of 15- and 16-year-olds in years 11 and 12 of our schools, particularly in the States to which I referred earlier, will be one of the aspects of fairness to be examined in that review. In the meantime, the Opposition does not believe that an extra cost of $30m or $40m should be taken on the run in this fashion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find Senator Teague's explanation quite extraordinary. The Opposition was prepared to support the Government's original legislation when it was introduced, presumably after some consideration. Now it says that on the run $30m is too much to knock off a Bill. If that is the case, one needs to ask why the Opposition saw it as perfectly acceptable on Monday of this week to knock off, yet again, between $50m and $550m-depending on who one happens to be talking to at the time-from some Government tax legislation. We must ask why the Opposition saw it as being quite appropriate to vote against the Government's capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax and gold tax legislation-worth over $1 billion to Government revenue-when it is not prepared to remove possibly up to $30m worth of revenue in this case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The good senator said that it would take some extraordinary circumstance for the Opposition to be able to make a decision of this kind. I suggest that we have an extraordinary circumstance in this legislation. As Senator Macklin has pointed out, this legislation is grossly discriminatory from State to State. It makes precious little difference in some States-predominantly the two main eastern States of New South Wales and Victoria-where very few students will be affected by the legislation or have been affected by the fact that the legislation exists. The reason is that in those States very few students who are 15 years of age are in those final two non-compulsory years of school. Yet their brother and sister students, if you like, in a number of other States-South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia being the main ones-are grossly discriminated against by the legislation. If those students were in New South Wales and Victoria, there would be no penalty imposed on the families and parents. However, the fact that they happen to live in Queensland, South Australia or Western Australia means that they face additional cost. </PARA>
<PARA> Maybe we ought to define and recognise the students and families we are talking about here. We are not talking about all families of all 15-year-olds who are in either of the last two years of school in any State in Australia. We are talking specifically about low income families-families who are entitled to Austudy under some pretty severe income test criteria. This is not something that is handed out willy-nilly to families no matter what their income is; it is handed out on a means-tested basis to low income families. I seem to recall that the maximum payment is about $40 per week. What the Opposition is saying, by and large, is that it does not care: `If low income families cannot afford to keep their 15-year-olds in school in South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland, well tough luck'. The Opposition has bigger and more important fish to fry-in particular, making sure that people on half a million dollars a year and over are no longer forced to contribute to Consolidated Revenue by way of paying capital gains tax, which is its proposal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Talk is cheap practically anywhere, but it is particularly cheap in this place, where it is the actions that count. On Monday of this week we were concerned enough about the additional problems facing deficit-funded institutions such as public hospitals, tertiary institutions and some benevolent institutions to support an Opposition amendment to allow them to continue paying their tax monthly instead of fortnightly. We saw that as a valuable means of maintaining the already precarious financial viability of public hospitals, tertiary institutions and some benevolent agencies. We agreed with the Opposition that it was worth while cutting $50m, or whatever it was, off the likely revenue raised this year by the Government by amending its proposal. If it was good enough on Monday for $50m-or whatever the current figure happens to be-to be taken from the Government to keep public hospitals and tertiary institutions operating, it ought to be appropriate for us to spend some $30m in order to keep 15-year-olds from low income families at school in the last couple of years of their education so as to maximise their employment prospects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us not make any bones about this. Most honourable senators come from a generation in which if they left school at 15 they stood a pretty good chance of getting a job. If they worked their way up, they could do fairly nicely. However, in some cases that goes back 30 or more years. In case some honourable senators have not noticed, times have changed. Very few employers will take on 15-year-olds who have not completed at least their second to last school year. Very few will take them on in a permanent capacity in the sort of job where, when they get to be 20 or 22 and seek to marry and have a family, they are in a position to be able to keep that family with its head above water financially. So do not come the pious, mealy-mouthed proponent of social justice and equity on me, Senator Teague. You have shown no evidence in your actions of believing a word that you said. To argue that we cannot do on Wednesday for low income families with 15-year-olds trying to finish their education what we did on Monday for hard-up public institutions is, to put it mildly, a load of rubbish. </PARA>

We have not sought definite legal opinion on this, but it is very likely that there are technical problems with the drafting of the amendment in that the reference to a `non-compulsory course' is probably technically inadequate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is conveniently overlooked by the Australian Democrats is that these payments are age related, just as an employment benefit is age related. In every State, leaving family allowances aside, parents are expected to accept the financial responsibility for their children until they are 16 years of age. That applies throughout Australia. The Democrats have misunderstood, or chosen not to understand, the basis of these payments-that is, that they are age related payments and not education related payments per se. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Walsh wants to have a debate about this, I am quite happy to have a debate. Senator Walsh knows nothing about education-he has never bothered to inform himself of his ministerial responsibilities concerning it-but he is pretty good at the abusive word. That passes, in Senator Walsh's terminology, for an education debate. I am not happy to involve myself in that particular debate, but I am happy to involve myself in a debate on the substantive issues. If Senator Walsh wants to get involved in that, good; if he wants to keep his filthy mouth to himself on other matters, that is also good.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I return to the point he raised-which, I presume, is the reason why the Government will not accept this amendment-which is that I did not know it was age related. He obviously has not even looked at this. Why would I be moving an amendment to change the age if I did not understand it was age related? The fact of the matter is that a particular group of people is caught within a particular situation as a result of State legislation which does not line up with Federal legislation. The point I am making is that we are out of kilter. Children come in at a certain age and may find themselves in those non-compulsory years of secondary schooling, yet still at the age of 15. As I have already said, it does not happen in a number of States but it does happen in others. We are discriminating between the States in what we do with the support schemes we have in place. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that both Senator Teague and Senator Walsh discussed the issue of money. That is important, and it should be discussed. There is a considerable cost to revenue-of course there is. Every one of these programs is a costly program. The program for 16-year-olds and upwards is costly to revenue. Presumably we consider that the cost of 16-year-olds' study is worth it. If we did not, the Government would not have introduced the legislation and, presumably, the Opposition would not have supported it. If we did not think that providing that support to a family with a 16-year-old in those circumstances was worth it, then the money would not have been provided. But I have not yet heard why it is worth it for a  16-year-old and not for a 15-year-old in identical circumstances. If it is worth it for a 16-year-old, it is worth it for a 15-year-old in exactly the same circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty is that we are dealing with a large number of people and a significant number of families. This discrimination has now gone on for two years. It will not lessen if we ignore it; in fact, it will continue. I hope the review that Senator Teague referred to, which would be put in place if a conservative government came to power, overturns the remarks that he has just made. If it does not, the review will be useless. If that review is going to mean anything it will have to look at the merits of the situation. I have suggested that the merits of a 15-year-old studying are identical to the merits of a 16-year-old studying. If the review that Senator Teague is talking about is going to say, `It will cost us that amount for 15-year-olds hence we will exclude them', I do not think that will be any review at all. If it is not going to say that, presumably it will overturn the comments Senator Teague has just made, and I would welcome that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I seek the Minister's response to a problem which has arisen since the Bills were last dealt with in 1988. I refer to Austudy being granted to students who attend private business colleges. The Minister will remember that at the end of last year the Senate held up States grants technical and further education assistance legislation, which was passed at the beginning of this year. At that time a number of private business colleges had government support and, thereby, their students were eligible to receive the allowance under the tertiary education assistance scheme (TEAS). At that time the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, gave a commitment that the Government would undertake to review these matters with a view to putting in place for 1990 a system to support students who attend private educational institutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The facts of the matter are that that review, as I understand it, has not been concluded; hence, we do not have any arrangement of a comprehensive nature in place. I also understand that the Government now intends to decouple the previous policy arrangement of support to private business colleges and the provision of TEAS to their students. Next year, on an ongoing basis, the Government will continue to allow those students to be eligible for allowances under TEAS. I wish to raise a difficulty in respect of that decoupling. For those institutions which, by and large, are profit making institutions and, hence, do not receive any support from the Government-the non-business definition in the Act refers to non-profit organisations-the profit exercise is now irrelevant. We are now dealing with simply a continuation of TEAS to students but not the other side-that is, money going to a profit making institution which, quite rightly, the Government will not take on and which I am not suggesting it should. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I am not at all sure that equity is being served-I am sure it is not-between the non-profit making private business colleges with regard to their students. Some of these colleges have been in existence for a very long time-in a number of cases that I have documentation of they have been operating for upwards of 12 years. Oddly enough, some of these institutions have been able to partake of other government schemes such as English language intensive courses for overseas students. It is not that these other institutions whose students are not eligible to receive allowances under TEAS are not acceptable to the Government. In fact, the reverse is the case. In some cases the Government has made a choice in favour of their high quality courses being acceptable for the purposes of other programs. I ask the Minister: What consideration is being given for 1990 to enable students who attend those colleges to be eligible for TEAS allowances on the same basis as students who attend other private business colleges and who, over the years, have been eligible? If the Government is not intending to do anything in this respect next year, can the Minister explain why that is the case?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remember having had some correspondence with Mr Dawkins on this matter. I do not remember all of the contents but I have some notes from the officials on this matter. The Austudy subsidy for the individual student continues for those who were enrolled at 23 August 1988. The original proposal was softened to allow colleges time to adjust to the loss of the pre-existing subsidy. The Government provided 25 per cent of the total payments made for 1988 to colleges in 1989. That scheme was terminated on 30 July.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the broader question of Austudy for students in this group, I am advised that Austudy is being paid for all students at non-government business colleges which were recognised for Austudy. Austudy for students at non-government business colleges generally is under review. It would be premature to foreshadow the arrangements for Austudy next year. The Government is looking at loosening the nexus between Austudy and government funding. In other words, the review has not been completed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I thank the Minister for his response. In fact, the points he has just made I made in the statement I made to him. However, what I want to know is how the Government is seeking to treat the disparity that has arisen, having decoupled the grants and the student assistance. How is the Government intending to treat those business colleges which have been out in the cold on both accounts? I do not know whether the Minister has seen this in his correspondence, but those other colleges are active advertising for students to come to them, because if they come to them rather than to the college which is next to them, the students will be able to get assistance. If students go next door, they will get no assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government, by not having completed its review-the results of which the Minister openly promised, at the beginning of the year would be in place next year-has built a commercial disparity between private business colleges, which seems to me to be grossly inequitable. It may be that at a later stage the Government intends to remove all assistance. I am not seeking to canvass any issues with regard to that. My concern is with regard to the commercial inequity between one group of private business colleges which allows its students to get student assistance and another one not being able to offer this, particularly when the second group has been accepted into a variety of other programs that the Government has in place. </PARA>
<PARA> In trying to draft an amendment on this, as I have been, I admit that it is extremely difficult because, by and large, all of those colleges are subject to regulations. We could solve the problem by way of legislation, but it would mean that one would have to go through a process of trying to vet each of these colleges. I am not seeking a response with regard to that. All I am seeking is that there should be at least some possibility-and this is a matter of regulation; it is not a matter of legislation-for reputable colleges, which have been operating in the field for a reasonable period of time and which are acceptable to the Government under other programs to be put on the same commercial footing as those other colleges. In other words their courses have been vetted. I am trying to elicit from the Minister some response on the commercial inequity that is now built into the system as a result of the review not being complete. </PARA>

<PARA>I understand from discussions that have already taken place that Senator Teague made some representations to the Minister with regard to the need for legislation to be changed to provide for payment of the charge in two instalments.

It is our intention to therefore wait until we see the new legislation which the Minister has proposed. We will then be in a position to deal with all of the legislation at the one time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -As I have already indicated, I will not be moving any amendments to the University of Canberra Bill. However, I wish to raise a couple of points that seem to me to cause some difficulty in the Bill. One is with regard to the title of the institution. The title, as it is set out in the Bill, seems to suggest that it will be called the University of Canberra. If we turn to clause 5 in the Bill, we discover that subclause 5 (2) (a) says that in spite of subclause 4 (2) the name of the university is the `University of Canberra sponsored by Monash University'. It seems to me that the problem is that this is a requirement that has not been imposed on any other amalgamated institution; that is that an institution has to move a name such as the `university of wherever sponsored by wherever'. In terms of typographical exercises, there may not be a difficulty with this name. I ask the Minister whether the Government has any intention of setting down regulations which will require this to occur or whether it will simply leave it to the good sense of the university to deal with that matter on its own. Secondly, can the Minister inform me whether or not that title, that is, the University of Canberra sponsored by Monash University, will be required to appear on degrees offered in the next three years?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for his response. I think it will relieve quite a number of people. The last question I have on this Bill concerns subclause 5 (2) (b). I query the way that the following is set down in the Bill:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . in spite of anything in this Act, the development of graduate programs, and the appointment of professorial staff or equivalent staff, by the University are to be subject to the prior approval of Monash University. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister would be aware that under none of the other amalgamations that have taken place in Australia, including those that occurred in my own State of Queensland and in New South Wales under the legislation of the State governments there, was this type of prior approval ever set in legislation. The mechanisms that were chosen were consultation, collaboration or other items, but never that one institution be totally governed, as is suggested here, in the appointment of its staff by prior approval. I ask the Minister: What might occur if there is a dispute between the two institutions with regard to the appointment of the staff? Is the clause intended to read, as it seems to on the surface, that unless there is a prior approval-that is, by going through the mechanisms within Monash University and its institutions-a person cannot be appointed by the University of Canberra? Has it no power whatsoever with regard to staff appointments?</PARA>

That is our belief. I will have that confirmed in writing if Senator Macklin wishes-or maybe confirmed or not confirmed in writing.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think that a number of people on the staff of the Canberra College of Advanced Education (CCAE) would like a clarification of that particular matter because it could be an ongoing problem. Knowing some of the senior people in Monash University, I hope that the collaboration will be a fruitful and harmonious one and that no such problems will occur. But when these things are set down in legislation it gives the staff of the CCAE-soon to be the University of Canberra-a great deal of concern.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen those comments. I am getting to sound like a previous incumbent of this position, former Senator Reg Withers, who as a matter of principle never read newspapers. I do not decline to read them as a matter of principle, but sometimes I decline to read some of them as a matter of taste. I certainly have not failed to read that on principle this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are plenty of trendy environmentalists about and there are plenty of redneck industrialists about. We are about trying to achieve some sensible balance in the debate between those two extremist views, which is the most important thing for this country. There is no doubt that the Government has that view. I am unable to comment on Mr Kerin's specific allegations about particular industries, particularly the mining industry.</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the long term future of this country we have to be about industry development; we also have to be about environmental protection and arriving at a balance between those two things. I think that is recognised by most civilised countries and I think we cannot be an exception to that. There are extreme views on both sides, between which a balance has to be found. I do not know what Mr Kerin specifically said about the sorts of policies in place, but I think it is agreed amongst Government Ministers that we have to reach, work towards, a balanced view on these issues-not only in government; we have to encourage that in Australian society as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA> In so far as I read the reports of Senator Richardson's statement, I did not see them as being a statement of policy; I saw them as a statement expressing a concern about the way some people approach this debate. Senator Richardson has received his fair share of criticism from people on the other side of the debate. I must say that some of it has been justified from time to time. On the other hand, he is entitled to hand it out occasionally, I would have thought, because there are people on the other side of the debate who need to have these sorts of things drawn to their attention. I think this is what Senator Richardson was attempting to do in the speech he made last night. I do not think Senator Richardson, although I have not discussed it with him, would claim it as a statement of policy. I think he would claim it as a statement which indicates the sorts of considerations people should take into account in looking at the concept of sustainable development. That is all I believe it amounts to.</PARA>

In view of Senator Button's response in respect of his inability to comment on Mr Kerin's remarks, I go back to the question I asked in regard to Senator Richardson's frontal attack on the Australian Mining Industry Council, in particular his comment as reported in the newspaper-which Senator Button said he had noted-that one of the policies Senator Richardson would pursue would be making industry pay higher prices for resources such as timber and minerals. How does the Government believe it can influence the world market prices of minerals?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That only reflects an expression of view which is quite respectable in most countries around the world. If Senator Parer wants to live in some sort of neanderthal society where nobody considers these issues, that is his privilege. The honourable senator is a Queenslander and he has been living in a society like that for 30 years. It suddenly changed last week and he will have to adjust to a bit of that. The answer to this question might help him in the process of adjustment. Throughout the world the debate about industry takes into account the need for industry to have regard to environmental issues, and it has got to happen here too. If Senator Parer does not like it, he will continue to do what he is doing now-talk to a receding section of the community, a little group, which understands what he is talking about and gives him some comfort. I am inviting him to broaden his horizons and think a little about these issues without necessarily reaching redneck conclusions about them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the attention of the Minister for Justice been drawn to a reported comment of a retiring senior Australian Federal Police (AFP) officer, Commander `Doc' Gillespie, that `fraud on the Australian Government is costing the nation millions of dollars a year'? Does the Government agree with Commander Gillespie's estimation of the amount it loses due to fraud? What action can be taken to reduce, if not eliminate, this massive loss of public funds to criminal elements in the Australian community?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is, of course, fully aware of the seriousness of fraud against its various programs. Given the nature of those programs and their very extensive reach, it is impossible to arrive at a precise figure on the total losses that might be experienced in any one year. The Government certainly has directed agencies to put their energy into actually preventing fraud against their programs, believing that it is better if the upstream agencies prevent the occurrence of fraud rather than burdening the Australian Federal Police and the court system with the results of their failure to fully protect their programs against the fraudulent activity of either their employees or other members of the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To that end, in September 1987 the Government accepted the majority of the recommendations of the review of systems for dealing with fraud on the Commonwealth. The review recommended that managers of Commonwealth programs ensure that the risk of fraud is assessed, that appropriate fraud control programs be put in place, and that procedures for the detection and prosecution of fraud be coordinated. It established the fraud control committee, made up of senior officials, to monitor the implementation of the Government's decisions. They have worked for two years doing just that. To date, 78 agencies have completed the crucial stage of submitting fraud risk assessments. Those assessments cover over 90 per cent of Commonwealth administration affected by the Government's directive on fraud control. The majority of agencies required to prepare fraud control plans have done so, and these plans are currently being implemented. Substantial progress has obviously been made in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA> Investigation of fraud against the Commonwealth is a major priority of the Australian Federal Police. Within the resources available to it, the AFP investigates a broad range of activity across the entire spectrum of fraud perpetrated against Commonwealth agencies. To facilitate the investigation of fraud, the AFP has concluded a series of administrative arrangements with agencies which are subject to fraud. These are viewed as essential for cooperative law enforcement at the Commonwealth level and for ensuring that fraud matters are appropriately handled. I believe that the Government has taken those necessary steps which were outlined in the report of the committee on fraud control and that we are well advanced in ensuring that the various programs of the Government are protected against this type of criminal activity, which reduces the effectiveness of those programs and leads to a loss of revenue and loss of confidence in those organisations which are funded by the taxpayer for the service of the whole Australian community.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of a report apparently produced by the United Nations Association of Australia which claims that Australia's human rights record at home and overseas has deteriorated since 1985. I find this a quite incredible charge and though I must admit I have not had the opportunity to consider the report itself, I have certainly seen various media reports and the press release issued by the United Nations Association of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is quite clear that in international circles Australia continues to be widely regarded as one of the most active countries on the question of human rights. Indeed, I believe Australia enjoys a record of concern for the protection and promotion of human rights which is second to none. For instance, in the period between July 1987 and June 1989, the Australian Government raised 780 cases of alleged human rights abuse with over 70 foreign governments. I am sure that members of Amnesty International in the Senate would recognise that those figures, which are on the public record, and those sorts of activities are quite often founded in representations made by Amnesty International itself or, at least, by the members of parliament who are members of Amnesty International's branch in this Parliament. It is very surprising, therefore, that the United Nations Association report does not refer to those specific international human rights issues where Australia has taken a leading role and has been outspoken in its condemnation of human rights abuses.</PARA>
<PARA> Out of some 22 existing human rights instruments, Australia is a party to 16, and amongst this number are all the major instruments dealing with human rights violations such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention against Torture or other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Australia is a party to four conventions dealing with slavery. It must also be remembered that the majority of these human rights conventions came into effect prior to 1985. They were ratified by Australia at those earlier dates. It is, therefore, both irrelevant and misleading to suggest that the fact that Australia has not ratified more instruments in the recent past is in itself suggestive of a decline in Australia's interests in those areas.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has also taken a leading role in preparing and progressing a new convention on the rights of the child which has been the subject of extensive discussion in this chamber. I also know that honourable senators will recall the passage through this chamber of the privacy legislation which had been on the agenda of the political parties of Australia for many years. In fact, it received the wholehearted support of all parties and senators when its passage was obtained late last year. The appointment of a Privacy Commissioner-a very practical step to protect that important human right, privacy-has also been achieved in the very recent past. I find it quite incredible that the United Nations Association of Australia should be so ignorant of or wilfully fail to give credence to the various activities, both internationally and domestically, that the Australian Government has undertaken in the protection of human rights.</PARA>

That work was done by the Department of Finance, and if Senator Chaney wants to make an issue of that I will give him the documents that the Department of Finance produced on costing government promises back in the days when the present Opposition was in government. On the reference to the difficulties the Government has had in following through a responsible fiscal policy with a mostly irresponsible Opposition and a minor party holding the balance of power, there is a very important difference between the list of measures that Senator Haines said the Democrats would oppose if the coalition were in government and what the Democrats have done when we have been in government. Every amendment which the Democrats have brought in since we have been in government which has a fiscal impact has either reduced revenue or increased outlays.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a very important difference in what Senator Haines threatened a couple of days ago to do, because Senator Haines said that the Democrats will not allow the Opposition to repeal the capital gains tax, thereby boosting revenue, on the Opposition's own admission, by $450m. It goes over halfway towards correcting the costing error in the Opposition's statement. Far from complaining about this, Mr Peacock, if he seriously believes he ever will be Prime Minister, ought to be very grateful because the Democrats would give a coalition government $450m that it did not expect. We have never got a cent from them. All we have ever got from the Democrats are pious amendments which increase outlays or reduce revenue.</PARA>

Firstly, housing commencements had been running at a level which I would suggest was unsustainably high. For a variety of reasons they needed to come down. Indeed, It has been part of the Government's overall economic management policy that there needed to be a slow-down in housing commencements, along with a lot of other things.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I am glad to have the Minister giving us at least one definition of unsustainable development, as distinct from sustainable development. But I would like to press him a little further on his expectations, which I thought I understood him to say were that employment in the dwelling construction industry could be expected now to hold up for the next six to nine months. I would like the Minister to confirm that view. If that is the case, and given the pipeline effects both of the very sharp fall in finance approvals and local authority permits that are coming through behind these falls in dwelling commencement figures, does he then accept that the implication of his own forecast is a very sharp fall at the edge of that cliff?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, six to nine months was my recollection of the sorts of lags that could be expected. I have not checked as to whether my memory is correct. Secondly, I think the last financial year figure for building commencements was something like 160,000, although I will not guarantee that figure. It was extraordinarily high and it needed to come down. There have been occasions in the past when residential buildings has been overheated, the resources were not available to meet the demand and demand fell to sub-optimal levels. The most recent example of that happened in 1982-83. If I remember correctly, commencements in that year fell to about 102,000, which was certainly well below the optimum level of commencements. The level of building activity, although linked to commencements in a particular period, is not necessarily linked in a one to one ratio because it takes a considerable time to complete the construction of a house. I do not believe that there is the slightest chance that building activity will fall to the disastrously low levels of 1982-83.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see the article in the Australian in which Professor Smart in particular blew the National Party's cover. The primary concern in the last couple of weeks or probably months-so Professor Smart said-of the National Party and the Liberal Party in Western Australia, was to try to present some sort of a facade of unity instead of the disunity that has prevailed for almost the entire period since the 1983 election. The report in today's Australian said that Mr Cowan, the Leader of the National Party, had announced last night that the National Party would oppose the merger of Murdoch and the University of Western Australia, which is a pretty bizarre decision by Mr Cowan and the National Party, particularly as the National Party purports to represent rural interests. More significantly-and considering one is talking about the National Party-the National Party policy spells doom for a proposed $17m world-class agricultural research complex. How the National Party can adopt such contradictory policy positions is something only the National Party mind can understand. Professor Smart, who is reported in today's Australian, says that it is ironic that the rural based party is blocking the establishment of this institute, particularly when the proposal has the support of farmers and graziers associations. Professor Smart said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . the rural-based Nationals controlling the balance of power in the Upper House . . . seem intent on blocking the potential research bonanza for the rural economy of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Needless to say, the rural electorate has been kept totally in the dark by the Nationals about the reason for this sudden reversal of policy. Unfortunately, the real reason seems to have more to do with the Nationals new-found need for a display of unity with the Liberals than it has to do with the research needs of the State's economy or the educational merits of the merger.</PARA>
<PARA>The ultimate irony, which is relevant to part of the question asked by Senator Beahan, is that the Opposition parties, which espouse greater institutional autonomy-only this morning Senator Teague moved an amendment in the very strongest terms denouncing the Government for its alleged centralist approach and alleged refusal to allow institutions to behave autonomously-will be denying autonomy to the two institutions in Western Australia both of whose academic boards and senates have agreed to seek a merger. The Opposition proclaims it believes in autonomy for these institutions, but the National Party in Western Australia is saying, `We will not allow this to happen and we do not care about that $17m agricultural research institution which was part of the merger proposal'.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under the administrative orders this falls more in the immigration area than in the foreign affairs area but, by happy coincidence, I can put on either hat. The first point is that Australia fully endorses the comprehensive plan of action which was agreed to by 35 countries at the June international conference. It is an integrated package of measures which aims to address the continuing high outflow of boat people from Vietnam. The package is based on the following principles: asylum seekers must be screened to establish their refugee claims; countries must provide first asylum while that process is undertaken; it offers resettlement for people who are refugees; and it provides for the return to the country of origin of people who are not. I interpolate there that the last point was not as specific as many people required, and I will come back to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that the group who returned yesterday have been through the screening process, including an appeal procedure, and have been found not to be refugees. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has participated fully in this process, endorsing the procedures as fair and objective. Counselling and legal assistance have also been provided by UNHCR-funded lawyers. Whilst I am not aware of the full circumstances of the arrangement for the return of this group, I have asked for further information on it, firstly, to ensure that the return arrangement was carried out under acceptable humanitarian conditions and, secondly, to ensure that arrangements for post-return monitoring will ensure safety and security. I have some disquiet about the timing of the removal, reported to have occurred at 3 a.m. The Government remains firmly of the view that the refugee solution should be preserved for bona fide refugees. By continuing to talk simply in terms of resettlement we are only encouraging more people to leave Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney asked whether I personally or the Government could guarantee this. I do not have enough information available to do so. It does raise what has been for the last year a terrible dilemma that no-one has a solution to. I have had hardly anyone, either in an international forum or elsewhere, argue with me, that people leaving Vietnam should be automatically resettled. Most people argue for voluntary return. When that is no further an option, one is left in a terrible dilemma-whether to pursue mandatory return, as opposed to forced return, or whether to simply leave people in camps for ever, encouraging push-offs from countries of first asylum. No-one has yet found an answer. The Vietnamese Government and the United States have virtually stood in one corner of the international forum arguing one view and the rest of the countries have argued another view. Whilst these meetings have continued since Geneva, they have failed to resolve the matter. We are left with the ultimate dilemma that one series of nations is arguing for return, either voluntary or mandatory, and the others are saying no to that but are not willing to resettle them themselves and are simply leaving people in camps to rot.</PARA>
<PARA> There are other specific problems in terms of Hong Kong. Its capacity to absorb people is limited. It returns virtually all People's Republic of China illegals, many of whom have relatives in Hong Kong. Their claims having been screened, they are returned to the mainland. The position in Hong Kong will be exacerbated once the monsoon season has passed. The winds change in February and there will be another large influx. I do not have any absolute solutions to these particular problems. I wish I did. I am now most particularly concerned about reports of push-off. We do not want to get back to the 1979 situation when people were deliberately pushed off and deliberately drowned and left to the prey of pirates, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion-and before Senator Chaney's supplementary question-the base problem with this is the Vietnam Government's policies, which have produced virtually a negative economic growth rate. Vietnam has an authoritarian regime. People argue that we should resettle everyone coming out of Vietnam, but there has to be consistency. There are other similar countries-not many, but a few-with similar economic conditions, with hundreds of millions of people, with similarly repressive regimes and with similar rates of economic growth. What do we do with the people in those countries when they want to relocate? I do not have a full answer to these dilemmas. I am not really confident that we will resolve them in the next year.</PARA>

One of the unknowns is what the conditions were between the Government of Great Britain and the Government of Vietnam. There is talk that each person returning to Vietnam will take back $750, which in terms of the Vietnamese experience is a very large amount of money.

The remaining personnel in New South Wales will receive their new uniforms by April 1990, while the issue of uniforms to personnel in the remaining States will be completed, at the latest, by September 1990. Soldiers are not in urgent need of the uniform as adequate stocks of the previous jungle green uniforms remain available for those personnel who have not yet received the new uniform.</PARA>
<PARA> As for the suggestion that the new disruptive-pattern uniforms are available through Army disposal stores and mail order, I trust that Senator Newman is not suggesting that the issue of these uniforms is being managed by some modern-day version of Sergeant Bilko. Commercial copies of the new uniforms are available. However, these copies do not meet military specifications in design, material construction or dye lot consistency. I would have thought that even Senator Newman would have been able to perceive that a newspaper advertisement for camouflage rugby tops, jogging suits and a teddy bear would be most unlikely to have come from Army sources.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr President, during Question Time today, Senator Powell, in the final point in the question she asked, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . does the Minister reject, as the Australian Democrats do, Senator Chaney's claim that the only way child-care can be funded in the future is by cutting out unemployment benefits, selling off publicly owned assets, charging students for basic tertiary education and slashing spending on the most disadvantaged in the community?</PARA>
<PARA>Subsequently Senator Powell identified a newspaper report of what I had said yesterday as being the source of her comment, which I claim grossly misrepresents my position and the position of the Opposition. For a start, the existing child-care programs, which are quite considerable, are in no way affected by the Opposition's current proposals. They will continue to be funded in the way that they are at present. What I was talking about yesterday was the $2 billion program for tax relief for families which was put forward as part of the Economic Action Plan. Let me quote the report from which Senator Powell purported to draw her comment. The report accurately quotes me as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the coalition's proposals to cut spending on unemployment benefits, Aboriginal affairs and tertiary education . . . were needed to pay for its proposed increases in tax rebates for child care, dependent children and dependent spouses. </PARA>
<PARA>The report went on:</PARA>
<PARA> What Senator Haines is doing is putting that under threat. </PARA>
<PARA>Later in the report I stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has been honest with the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA>The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA> If you propose to give $2 billion of tax relief to families, that money has to be found somehow. We've found that money by having a program of expenditure reduction in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> What Senator Haines is saying is, `We will let you have the nice bits but we won't let you have the measures that would pay for them'. That is a ludicrous approach to government, and one which would clearly lead to the economy blowing apart. </PARA>
<PARA>Incidentally, that was quoted by one of the Government senators in a subsequent question. My point is that the suggestion that the only way child-care can be funded in the future is by these expenditure cuts is inaccurate. There is already a very substantial program which has been much referred to in debate in this place. I put the fundamental point that it is only possible to provide several billion dollars worth of additional tax relief for families by finding the cuts in expenditure in other areas. I regard Senator Powell's description of what I was putting forward as grossly inaccurate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Micro-economic reform is certainly not just an arid economic term. In many ways it is the key to unlocking the quality of life for many Australians. Indeed, if we were serious about it we would acknowledge that employment is perhaps the most sought after aspiration for the vast majority of Australians. The quality of that employment is equally important, particularly where the denial of the freedom to operate constructively and to contribute successfully and efficiently to the workings of an employer enterprise are deliberately frustrated by government policy. In that situation we have a less than optimum result from which not only the nation but all Australians suffer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is therefore particularly disappointing that after the last election the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made such a great point about the significance of micro-economic reform. It is indeed the key to international competitiveness and the efficiency of Australian industry. In many ways it is the key to improved standards of living for all Australians, and that, of course, flows on not just in material terms but also in relation to the options that are available to us all. </PARA>
<PARA> There are not many Australians who appreciate high taxes. There are those who want taxes reduced simply because, whatever level they are at, they believe they are too high. But there are many others who rightly deplore the waste and extravagance and the dissipation of resources that they see as a result of deliberate Government decisions or indecisions. We should all sympathise with those aspirations because, quite clearly, there are people in the community who want the freedom to spend their own money in a way that suits them whilst acknowledging that they have an obligation to contribute to the public purse. But they certainly want to see governments using their funds efficiently. That is why this Government's tragic failure to deliver the goods in terms of micro-economic reform is particularly depressing for the health of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I go back to what the Prime Minister said on 26 August 1987-in other words, more than two years ago. It was described at the time by Gregory Hywood in the Australian Financial Review as `his first major speech on the economy since the July 11 election'. He was addressing a very important conference of economists in Brisbane and he told that group that the Government's efficiency agenda would grow as the task proceeded He specified a number of areas as deserving `early attention'. They included transport, aviation, the communications and information industries, government owned business enterprises, education, industrial relations and industry assistance. What a magnificent agenda! If the Government were able to deliver on the bulk of that, it would be well on the way to getting the country back into shape. The Prime Minister has been acutely conscious of the fact that under his administration we have been going backwards. The standard of living is declining to the point at which it somehow seems to be a boast of this Government that it has been instrumental in reducing living standards and presiding over a fall in real wages. I will come to the concomitant result, which is declining productivity throughout the period. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, if we are interested in competing-as I think Senator Button is from time to time, but perhaps not so much in a pre-election environment-and if we are interested in going offshore and mixing with the four tigers and all those others who are leaving us for dead, quite obviously the key is to reduce the cost of our inputs. If we can tackle those micro-economic infrastructure areas, we will be well on the way. The tragedy is that we have not done that. Those things have all been put in the too-hard basket and, as a result, the Government is hoist on its own petard. The Prime Minister said in that landmark speech that efficiency is the key. He was talking then about possible asset sales and said that this was `not some ideological debate about appropriate levels of public ownership'. In other words, he was rising above the ideology. He knew what was needed and he was going to deliver. He went on to say, in running through his agenda for reform, that past transport policy and practice had not kept costs down and that this had exacerbated the disadvantages of Australia's isolation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, one of the major items on the agenda of this term of government is a sweeping reform of the nation's transport infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA>They are brave words. He went on to say what I think even blind Freddy knows, which is that in the communications field we have a potentially major growth sector. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Legislation and the dominance of government business enterprises mean that Government decisions, or the lack of them,-</PARA>
<PARA>how prophetic-</PARA>
<PARA>will have a major influence on the future of this sector. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> We will need to examine ways to improve the performance of these enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA>Who could quarrel with any of that? That is precisely what is required. For a period of 18 months or so that was the major agenda item. Senator Evans, before he was rolled by the Telecom Australia monopoly preservation society in May 1988, which managed to head off all the brave new world which would have allowed real competition with Telecom and which would have opened up that sector in such a way that we would have been able to compete with the rest of the world, in tabling the May statement, said in his foreword:</PARA>
<PARA> In describing the Government's third-term agenda, the Prime Minister has given greatest emphasis to micro-economic policy: the structural adjustment of key industries, and the relationships between them, with a view to establishing and sustaining longer term growth. </PARA>
<PARA>That was a mere 18 months ago. The primacy of micro-economic reform was apparent. Senator Evans knew it. Those in the Government interested in improving the efficiency of the economy, and therefore passing on those real achievements to ordinary Australians and thereby improving both their material and spiritual aspirations to life, realised that this was crucial if the economy was to be got right. They knew that if exports were to exceed imports, they had to get a micro-economic reform agenda in place. But, unfortunately, what has happened is that this Government, this Prime Minister-all the big talkers-have been rolled, comprehensively and frequently, by the left wing, by the Public Service trade unions, by the anti-privateers, to the point at which we have had humiliating examples of Mr Hawke putting up his hand one day and Mr Willis tentatively supporting him, but both being chopped off and both going to ground. We have had other examples. Senator Walsh's frustration has shown through from time to time. A clutch of Ministers, Senator Button amongst them, know what is required. </PARA>
<PARA> But what has happened? What about that greatest economic advocate, the man who is held up, as he was by commentators until fairly recently, as somehow the acme of economic achievement-the Treasurer (Mr Keating). What did he have to say about micro-economic reform? On 20 November it was all dismissed as small beer. Micro-economic reform was small beer, said Mr Keating. It is pathetic because, quite clearly, this was the Government's own self-proclaimed agenda. It set the hurdle. It said that it was prepared to jump it; but it has not even bothered to try to run through it. It has simply baulked and is now trying to wish it away. It attempts to deny the obvious, which fools no-one and which has to be regarded as a monumental concession of failure. This is not just some cheap debating point. By the Government's own standards, micro-economic reform was to be the key to unlocking the revolution. That is why it is so tragic that we have seen what we have seen, which is virtually no progress at all in this important range of areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Archer will deal with coastal shipping and the waterfront, I trust. He provided me with some very illuminating comments from a recent transcript. They show quite clearly some of the real problems that are still dramatically in place on the waterfront. Indeed, one of the participants in that discussion described the waterfront not as the gateway but as the barrier to exports. Anyone who realises that it costs about $30,000 a day to keep a ship in port, and then realises that sometimes ships have to wait up to a week in turnaround time when this is accomplished in a matter of hours in comparable ports overseas, will have some idea of the dimensions of the problem. The comparison between Rotterdam and Melbourne or Sydney is perhaps also apposite. Rotterdam was rebuilt from the ground up. It was completely devastated in the Second World War and is now perhaps the most efficient port in the world. It is said about Rotterdam that one can do twice the work for half the cost. That was said about Sydney. I do not need to labour the point because the descriptions of the difficulties of Sydney are legendary. We all know what they are and that the Government has pretended to do something about them. But it simply will not bite the bullet and allow foreign competition to come in. Presumably it will pander to the Tas Bulls of this world who think the solution has something to do with providing financial incentives to change the culture of the waterfront. Again, it is tragically irrelevant to think that somehow we need to bribe people in that way. We all know what they would do: they would put the money in their pockets and ask for more. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the best objective indication of the Government's throwing in of the towel in this whole area was the Industry Commission Bill, which was recently dealt with in the Senate and which effectively abolishes the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC). The Government's greatest achievement is that it has put the IAC out of business, parked it into some new restructured body and pretended to be on the way to micro-economic reform. We do not hear much criticism of the IAC; it is really all about it being too hard to deliver, certainly in the run up to an election. In debate in this chamber on that Bill, Senator Walsh was, as usual, full of bile but did not have much criticism to make of the IAC or its reports. It was really just a matter of his trying to justify this new Industry Commission-a mickey mouse solution to a very real problem. An editorial in the Australian of 10 November said this of the IAC:</PARA>
<PARA> Of 14 completed IAC inquiries, the recommendations of only three have been substantially implemented by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>That spells out in very stark terms precisely what it is that has not been delivered on. We all know that the failure to open up the waterfront to foreign competition is costing us about $500m a year. Senator Knowles will deal with the personal costs to Australians of that failure to grasp the nettle, but this year's annual report of the IAC, which was released recently, notes that key micro-economic reforms could increase gross domestic product by around $16 billion and average household income by more than $1,600 per year. We all understand what the average Australian could do with an extra $30 in the pocket especially when, since 1983, the value of real wages has declined by about $60 a week. This is not a discussion about economics; it is a discussion about what is happening to the purchasing power of ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Some classic examples of why there is an urgent need for micro-economic reform are contained in the IAC's annual report. For example, in Queensland a scrap metal exporter is forced to pay $14 per tonne to get scrap metal on board, compared with $1.70 in the United Kingdom and $2.50 in the United States. The exporter which the IAC quoted estimates that he could do it himself for $1 per tonne. In other words, it would be cheaper for him to pay the waterside workers to stay away. </PARA>
<PARA> The Inter-State Commission found that wharf labourers' wages have been about 40 per cent above the national average for the past decade. Currently they earn about $800 for a nominal 35-hour week, although in practice, with all the pooling arrangements and other excuses for work, it works out at about 28 hours a week. That is a scandalous state of affairs. It is one which the Government is clearly aware of but unable to do anything about. The tragedy is that the Government is union driven. Despite the fact that only about one-third of the private sector is unionised, 75 per cent of the public sector is very much in the trade union movement and wields a great deal of power in the Australian Council of Trade Unions. As a result, there are legion examples of where there ought to be significant reforms but no-one is prepared to tackle them. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecommunications is an area in which I have taken a particular interest and now have responsibility for. That is probably the best example one can find. For a long time we have sheltered behind this smokescreen of community service obligations (CSOs) as justification for maintaining such extensive monopoly practices which are clearly inefficient, to the point where the IAC says that we are about 20 per cent less efficient than our Canadian counterparts. Telecommunications cost the average business about $30 a week by way of input. We could easily carve hundreds of millions of dollars a year from the nation's telephone bill. We could reduce subscriber trunk dialling rates by half and we could get local call charges down significantly. We could do all that we need to do in a fully competitive environment, yet the Government has allowed the telecommunications Telecom unions to hoodwink the public into believing that these so-called community service obligations need to be justified by extensive monopoly practices. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, the IAC blows that out of the water. It says that CSOs could be supplied in a competitive market environment if the way in which they are financed were changed. For example, their costs could be covered by a levy on all users of the service or by direct government funding. That simple proposition has been blindingly apparent for some years. The Government has had seven years in which to tackle the problem and is still deferring it. After sitting on the report for nearly three months, Mr Willis released it last week. The report confirmed what we all knew-that is, the cost of Telecom Australia's community service obligations is of the order of $240m a year, which is equivalent to about 1c per local call and about 5c per international call which, to quote Mr Keating's term, is certainly very small beer. It is something which Telecom could probably withstand in an open and competitive environment, but it could certainly be funded with a minimum of pain through other mechanisms. I have no doubt that in a competitive environment the efficiencies that would flow through to the system would leave Telecom in a much stronger position, better able to compete internationally and better able to deliver the quality of service that Australians expect from a national telecommunications carrier. Yet the Government will limp through to the next election having done virtually nothing in that and other very important areas.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that one can do more than hark back to Mr Hawke's heroic terms and look at how abjectly he has failed. In many ways it is a sad sight to see a rapidly ageing political leader who knows what needs to be done but simply does not have the political clout or perhaps the intestinal fortitude to try to bring it about. </PARA>

The reality is that Mr Hawke knows what needs to be done, as does Senator Button and as do a number of his colleagues. However, they are unable to deliver the goods. We would all be much better off if we were able to achieve micro-economic reform. Although the Government has our wholehearted support, it is not prepared to tackle that. The reason is abundantly obvious: it will embarrass some of its political allies who are clearly lead in the saddlebags and wilfully ignorant of what is required to get Australia back on the track. However, they are determined to frustrate those very necessary changes to achieve their own political agendas. That is tragic. The Government has had seven years to do something about it, but clearly it is not interested in pursuing the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Micro-economic reform has many direct implications for Australian society and for the way in which we can work efficiently. I believe that one of the most satisfying things in life is to do a job constructively-not to try to protect one's own patch and worry about how one can screw even more rights and entitlements out of the boss, but to be part of a team and to start delivering constructively. If these enterprises were opened up to competition there is no doubt that that is what would flow. The IAC said that that is the key, that competition is the secret. Perhaps even more importantly for left wing members of the Australian Labor Party who think that this is all irrelevant, that it is just an ideological debate, the IAC says that the employment gains which would flow from long term micro-economic reforms would be equivalent to about 35,000 extra jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> There it is. Does the Government want it or not? Does the Government want to deliver the goods or not, or will the position continue to be as the Macquarie Bank sets out-that as a result of the 4 per cent second tier increase, 90 per cent of the work force will get the wage increases without delivering the productivity gains? What a damning indictment. What a pathetic state of affairs. All we have is talk and the Government's caving in as it is not prepared to tackle the hard issues. Look at the pathetic cry for help yesterday by Ted Harris, one of the Prime Minister's great mates, that Australian Airlines Ltd, despite its good profit result, faces some critical issues. By direct implication he was critical of the Government. He said that to do nothing or to introduce ad hoc measures that do not properly address the capital injection and constraint issues may put at risk a very valuable public asset. He said that resolution of these issues is critical to the future progress of the airline. </PARA>
<PARA> Aviation, transport, the waterfront, telecommunications-all these are areas in which the Government has not been prepared to provide the necessary funds, to open up the environment and to let the work force contribute and achieve, but rather has stultified and undoubtedly will pay the penalty in due course. As a result, we are going backwards. Senator Button knows it and the economists in the Cabinet know it, but unfortunately they do not have the political will to do anything about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Alston, who proposed the matter of public importance, spent a lot of time discussing what he sees as instances of inefficiency in his particular bete noires-the waterfront, Telecom Australia and the airlines. However, he failed to address his own matter of public importance, which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's abject failure to deliver on its promise that micro-economic reform would be the centrepiece of its third term of Government with the inevitable consequences of declining living standards and increased social stresses for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>I was delighted to hear Senator Alston refer to quality of life and standards of living, but he gave us no indication that he has any interest whatsoever in the effects of what he says is the Government's abject failure. He managed to ignore the palpable overall gains of the Government and its policies over the last seven years. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Barney Cooney will deal with the details of micro-economic reform, of which there is a substantial record. I would like to deal more directly with the actual effects. It is interesting that Senator Alston's proposal talks about not only declining living standards-which is obviously incorrect, as I will show in a moment-but also increased social stresses for all Australians. There is a very respectable body of academic writing which proves quite conclusively that social stress is never greater than when unemployment is high and increasing. When this Government came to power in 1983 the unemployment rate was almost 11 per cent-in fact, in the middle of that year it reached 11 per cent. The unemployment rate is now 6 per cent. There is no doubt at all that one of the greatest ways in which social stress can be reduced is by the policies that this Government has introduced-policies that have greatly increased the employment participation rate in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal effect of a greatly improved employment participation rate is greatly improved real disposable household incomes. Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show quite clearly that over the last six years there has been an average increase in real disposable household incomes-deflated by the implicit price deflater for private final consumption expenditure-of very close to 3 per cent. In every one of those six years, except for one-1986-87, when there was a small reduction of 0.2 per cent-there has been an increase, on average, of around 3 per cent. That is a very substantial increase in household incomes. This increase is easily traced back to the fact that there has been a substantial increase in the labour force participation rate for women during that period. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a little exchange or two during Question Time today about the attitude that is taken by so many people in the Federal Liberal Party, that women are being conscripted into the work force, as if they have no minds of their own and as if somebody is telling them they must go to work. I think most of us recognise these days that women work for exactly the same reasons that men work-in order to earn their living and pay for rent, food and clothing. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to quote a line or two from a newspaper article which reported something said by Mr John Howard. I am amazed by his male chauvinism, which comes through very clearly. Having said:</PARA>
<PARA>If you live in Sydney-</PARA>
<PARA>he is clearly addressing a male, or notionally male, audience-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in particular and you're earning $27,000 . . . and you want to start a family and you want your wife to stop work, you're not in the hunt, you haven't got a hope. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that men who adopt that role within families these days certainly do not have a hope if they do not recognise the fact that their wives have skills, talents, needs and the right and the capacity to make their own decisions. I do not think I can do better than quote Senator Amanda Vanstone who said, extremely perspicaciously:</PARA>
<PARA>These women in the workforce aren't shells on the beach simply brought in by a bad economy. They represent change in the beach head itself. </PARA>
<PARA>They represent the fact that there is a greatly increased demand for female employment. There is a greatly increased capacity for part-time employment, considerably more access to affordable child-care and considerable growth in the service industries where women are employed in substantial numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> The employment participation rate to which I referred has increased-not only for women, but generally-during the seven years of the Hawke Labor Government, from 60.8 per cent in 1983-84 to 62.6 per cent. That represents a considerable number of jobs, as this chamber has been reminded consistently over the last few years. For example, in the last 12 months the increase in the number of jobs was 219,000. One may believe that many of those new jobs are part-time jobs-particularly the ones in which women are inclined to be employed-but, interestingly enough, that does not necessarily follow. The increase in full-time employment for females in the age group of 25 to 34 is nearly 10 per cent. Even in age groups older than that, the increases are 7.8 per cent for those up to the age of 54 and 2.9 per cent for those between the ages of 55 and 59. This is an extremely interesting phenomenon. Even for the group aged 60 to 64, there was an increase of 2.9 per cent between 1982 and 1988 in the number of women in full time employment. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as part time employment is concerned, the greatest increases are amongst those who are very young. That clearly indicates the phenomenon of young women working part time while continuing in the education system or training so that they can get better opportunities. We are seeing the social phenomenon of a greatly increased range of opportunities for women in the work force, many of which are a direct result of the policies that have been adopted by the Hawke Government, and I have detailed just a few of them. </PARA>
<PARA> Amongst the other remarks that he made in this debate, Senator Alston was extremely critical of the fact that there are such close ties between this Government and the trade union movement. Senator Alston might be interested to know that the corporate gross operating surplus share-which is, in effect, profit-over the years of the Hawke Government has increased from 13.4 per cent in 1983-84 to 18.5 per cent in 1988-89. This is one of the deliberate effects of the accord. The trade union movement, in conjunction with the Government, consciously set out to improve profit share in order that profits should go into the restructuring of Australian industry-into the purchase of new technology; the upgrading of outmoded machinery, which has been such a bugbear as far as our manufacturing sector is concerned; better software and better hardware for computerisation; and, of course, almost more importantly than anything else, better training and retraining. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority of Australian workers are not members of unions and, regrettably, the proportion is falling. However, I remind the Senate that whether or not people are members of unions, the vast majority of them are getting the benefits of the work that is being done by trade unions to improve their working conditions. The trade unions have maintained a close contact with the Government in overall policy development which has led-and I go back to the figures I gave before-to a substantial increase in real household disposable income. The Opposition may not want to talk about that but it is this figure which determines the way in which families are able to operate. Many Australian families are in a vastly better situation now than they were six or seven years ago for the very reason that there are more incomes in households-they may not all be full time incomes but they have made a great difference to the expectations of Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Alston said that he wants to see substantial changes in a whole range of industrial policies. He is managing to avoid looking at the substantial changes that have already occurred in the form of productivity increases; a better educated work force; the fact that we are able to encourage young people to stay at school and to increase their opportunities quite substantially; and the fact, which I come back to, that so many women feel that they are now able, in addition to what ever domestic responsibilities they have, to join the work force, to expand their skills, to contribute economically to their own families, in some cases to become independent and in many cases to improve their families' standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA> The demand for the sort of work that many women are employed to do has been growing over the last few years. A shortage is now developing to the point where it is realised in Australia and in similar countries such as the United States that there will be opportunities for the vast majority of women to join the paid work force, probably for most of their adult working lives. I do not know what sort of a model Czechoslovakia is for Australia, but 82 per cent of Czechoslovakian women are in the paid work force, in a country that is very highly industrialised. This opportunity must be accompanied by all the others that make it possible for women to work, such as increased access to children's services. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not so long since an employment consultant in the United States, speaking to a group of businessmen, told them that the majority of women who were employed would be taking maternity leave once, twice or perhaps three times during their working lives. The employers to whom she was speaking said, `Well, we shan't employ them, then'. They were reminded that they would have no choice, that unless they were prepared to employ women they would be short of workers and that it was a matter that they would have to come to grips with. Similarly we in Australia have had to come to grips with the fact that, unless we provide benefits such as maternity leave for our workers, we will lose good trained workers, mature women, who are amongst the most sought after in the work force and who have every entitlement, we believe, for some time off for the purpose of bearing and caring for their children. Madam Acting Deputy President, you may be aware that a case has just been completed in the Industrial Relations Commission seeking parental leave for fathers so that they also may have unpaid leave in order to be available to participate in parenting. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been very many social improvements of this nature over the years, adding to the quality of life about which we were reminded by Senator Alston but which he has managed to avoid discussing. I come back to the fact that the retention rate of young people in secondary schools has greatly expanded. This will clearly have long term, highly advantageous effects for the Australian economy. I doubt very much that this would have been the case had we not had a Hawke Government, one that was absolutely committed to ensuring that young people were able to stay in the education system. Having made that decision, the Government then worked on a range of measures which would make that possible. Austudy, providing an allowance for 16- and 17-year-olds still in the education system, has been one of the most important. </PARA>
<PARA> Besides this, the climate has been changed so that there is not the feeling of desperation and social stress-to quote from Senator Alston's motion-which led so many young people to believe that there was simply no future for them. This stress has been lifted from the shoulders of very many of our young people. Their opportunities, their hopes for the future, have been greatly expanded as a result. Their family's expectations also have changed. I recall very clearly that three or four years ago, with the memories of the very high unemployment rates in 1982-83, young people were quite desperate about their opportunities for the future. It is not the case now. I do not call this an abject failure by the Government; I call it a considerable achievement by the Government and probably one of the greatest achievements, if one could look to the future and to the long term implications of any particular policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Since Senator Vanstone has come back into the chamber, I just mention that I quoted her very accurately and attributed to her what I thought was an extremely intelligent comment. I would like to give a little gratuitous assistance to the Liberal Party of Australia, which seems to find quite a deal of difficulty in describing its front bench people accurately. According to an article by Pilita Clark, it is hard for Liberal Party members to use any term other than `spokesman'. In the cause of accuracy I make two or three suggestions: Opposition members could refer to them as people speaking on behalf of the coalition on this, that, or the other issue; or perhaps the coalition or shadow commentators on this, that, or the other issue. It is not a minor matter. </PARA>
<PARA> We on the Government side are very proud of our women Ministers. We are also very proud that we have women who can speak on behalf of our Party and our policies and we are glad to identify them as women who have already made a contribution not only to the Australian Labor Party but also to policy-making and, by extension, to the government and well-being, the quality of life, of the people of this country. I suggest that the Liberal Party and the National Party of Australia follow suit and make it clear to the community when a women is speaking on its behalf that she speaks on behalf of their party and, we hope, on behalf of women. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again, we have before us a fairly extraordinary matter of public importance put forward by the Opposition complaining about the economic performance of the Government-in essence in this case its slowness in implementing Opposition policies on deregulation and privatisation. It is yet another attempt to draw a picture of the Government and the Opposition as being markedly different in the run-up to an election. Those opposite do not want the voters to realise how very closely the actions of the Hawke Government match the policies of the Opposition. I would say that it is a vain hope.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clearly, the regular polls and the South Australian election result demonstrate that more and more people are seeing that the Liberal Party of Australia and the Australian Labor Party resemble the Tweedle brothers. There are slight nuances of difference but basically the Opposition and the Government are going down similar tracks. Even the media is acknowledging that fact at this point. Where once only the Democrats would have referred to the Opposition and the Government as Tweedledum and Tweedledee, we are now seeing that in the popular press. As I said, this is a complaint by the Opposition about the Government's economic performance with particular reference to micro-economic reform along a policy track on which the Opposition would want to push this country. We need to look at the performance so far and at the results. We agree with that part of the wording of the matter of public importance which expresses concern about living standards and social stress extended to problems concerning the quality of life of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at deregulation and the privatisation push and let us see what has happened under this Government and what complaint the Opposition might have. I want to express complaints that the Democrats have on both counts-the Government's performance and the Opposition's policies. I will start with the deregulated position of Australia in the world trade scene because we have a major problem with our deficit on current account, and we have been told that we have to trade our way out of it. Since the floating of the Australian dollar, our net foreign debt has increased from 6 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) under the Fraser Government to 30 per cent of GDP today. Our markets have been flung open for overseas access at the same time as genuine support for Australian industry has been reduced in a number of areas, especially in the research area, to the extent that we are now operating as the most unassisted free market economy amongst Western industrial nations. By way of comparison, we can look at West Germany and Japan, whose economies are still highly regulated and shielded, to a large extent, from overseas competition. Yet the Australian people are the ones who continue to pay the cost of this aspect of deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition, by this motion, a number of previous motions and, I am sure, some subsequent ones, wants to continue to urge the Federal Government to go blindly down this path in spite of its obvious failure to do anything for the people of Australia. Financial deregulation is an area in which the Opposition has concurred wholeheartedly, except perhaps inasmuch as it had to sit here and watch the Hawke Government deregulate the financial system and to acknowledge that it was not able to do that under Malcolm Fraser. Of course, John Howard would have wanted to do so, but he was not able to have his will prevail. So if the Opposition has a problem about financial deregulation, it is only the `green with envy' problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Financial deregulation has not, as we were promised, increased competition in the Australian banking system. Since the introduction of foreign banks and the deregulation of the banking system, the number of banks actively involved in the lending of money to ordinary Australians for housing loans, for instance, has reduced significantly and further amalgamations appear likely. Neither we, nor the average Australian consumer, can see any benefit gained by the people of Australia out of this exercise. Rather, we have seen interest rates reach record levels, bank profits soar and bankruptcies increase. On top of this, the Federal Government has given the banks an additional $200m. I noticed, looking through my files this morning, that the announcement of that was made on 29 September, which happens to be my birthday. I wish I had got such a good birthday present as the banks have had in recent years from this deregulationist government. </PARA>
<PARA> A major feature of concern in this area for the people of Australia is interest rates, so let us look for a moment at that issue. It is a blunt instrument which the Government is using to beat ordinary Australian families around the head on the basis that it is their responsibility-the responsibility of ordinary Australian families-to fix up the economic mess that this deregulationist approach has created. Families are hard-pressed to feed and clothe themselves while they pay the ever rising mortgages; families are not able to meet the payments and are therefore, losing their homes; and other families give up all hope of ever owning a home, the Australian dream. It is certainly affecting living standards, and it is certainly increasing social stress. </PARA>
<PARA> But at that point, we have to ask what the Opposition would do-after all, deregulation is its policy. We have a motion before us today on that matter. From the Opposition members' own mouths, including no less a person than the spokesperson for finance, Senator Stone, we have been told that we may not necessarily expect any relief on interest rates should the Government fall. Indeed, there has been no action, where the opportunities have arisen, by the Opposition in Government. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O14">Senator POWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I normally do not respond to interjections when I am giving a speech, but I am happy to have Senator Vanstone's interjection on the record because I refer Senator Vanstone to several matters of public importance in recent weeks mounted by Senator Stone in which, in his speeches, he made it quite clear that the Australian people should not expect interest rates to come down at the time of the change of government and within any short space of time thereafter. As I said, nor have we had any action in this chamber on the question of interest rates where the opportunity has been afforded by the Australian Democrats, namely, by Senator Haines, both by potential amendment to legislation and through private members legislation, for action on measures to encourage savings, to provide affordable housing finance to Australians and, in particular, tax deductions for interest payments which have to be made on mortgages. No, what we see is an adherence to the great god of market forces.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look a bit more at what has come from deregulated banking. Just last week, a recent report, which was put together by the Australian Financial Counselling and Credit Reform Association, was released. It found that Australian banks were the most profitable amongst major Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries and that consumers are subsidising them. That report has made it clear that the success of foreign banks in the retail market has not matched the predictions which were made at the time of the entry of those foreign banks, an entry opposed only by the Australian Democrats at the time. After significant losses, many of those foreign banks have withdrawn leaving the major banks in a very powerful market position, despite the increase in the number of players initially. The very disturbing aspect revealed by this report is that the subsidisation by people over 55 years in our community amounts to more than $87m a year, and by lower-income groups to $98m a year. </PARA>
<PARA> So we fail to see how that aspect of the deregulation policy can be seen to be of benefit to the Australian people, a policy supported by the Opposition and promoted by this matter of public importance. Another area destined for increased deregulation is the labour markets, should the Opposition's policies be in place or should the Government move faster down the track of the Opposition's policies, as this matter of public importance would have it do. Kenneth Davidson in the Age newspaper on 27 November said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . credibility on interest rates boils down to credibility on wages policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Here we can see why we are cautioned about any prospect of lowering interest rates upon a change of government. Clearly the deregulated labour market system of the Opposition is destined to have a disastrous effect on our economy. I am not the only one who is making this proposition. Again I refer to Kenneth Davidson's comments. He said that such policies are destined, in all probability, to force interest rates even higher. In this area, we see that the Government has not deregulated to the extent that the Opposition would like. Therefore, through the accord, the Government has been able to reduce the average unit cost of labour in Australia. But, indeed, Australia's workers have not had a real increase in their average rate of pay as they might have done without the accord. Support for the industrial relations deregulation policies of the Opposition would have to be based on expectations by workers that they would achieve higher real wages. This is likely to occur perhaps for some people in that system, those attached to strong unions, and those with compliant employers, for whom their own individual profits mean a great deal more than the general economic well-being of the community. As far as we are concerned, the labour market policy must be based on a basic minimum income for workers, adequacy of income and appropriate reward for labour. </PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned at the Government's talk about enterprise bargaining unless it is underpinned by a centralised structure and one which acknowledges the need for an adequate and appropriate reward. Clearly, we do have in our economy and, therefore, in our community the kind of stress which is being caused by that economic pressure, which in turn, we pose, is put through this deregulationist policy and the outright use of market forces. For that reason I certainly welcome, two days after my call for it, a summit on poverty which has been announced today by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), although I do think he could have at least involved the community groups. Nevertheless, I think that, if the Government were to go further down the micro-economic track, which is being urged on it by the Opposition's matter of public importance today, in the area of transport, communications, health, education, child-care, or whatever one would like to name, then the stress would be even worse. Surely that is one of the messages that would come out of the summit proposed by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the Opposition, the Government is too slow to act-too slow for the Opposition, anyway. I think we can see what further mayhem, deprivation and poverty would be caused by continuing further down that track. It is reasonably clear now that the Government probably would have moved faster in a great many of the areas-which the Opposition would have liked it to do-were it not for the fact that there has been resistance in the community, that that community resistance has been brought into this place by the Australian Democrats and that, therefore, it has not been able to be ignored. It has been a cautionary note, and we have been proud to be a part of the delivery of that cautionary note to this Government. I will conclude by quoting the editorial from the Melbourne Herald on 30 November 1989. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats are successfully carving a niche among electors who suspect the motives of politicians from both the major parties . . . They are not swayed by a set of expedients cut to suit the campaigning needs of a particular day. </PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly the reason this matter of public importance is before us today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating a matter of public importance which I will read because, unfortunately, the last two speakers really have not referred to it at all. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's abject failure to deliver on its promise that micro-economic reform would be the centrepiece of its third term of Government with the inevitable consequences of declining living standards and increased social stresses for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>As I say, I read that just to remind the Senate what we are actually debating, because Senator Giles's contribution, although a cute little speech, contained nothing really about the subject. Clearly she is like the rest of the Government senators and members-she does not understand what micro-economic reform means and what benefits can be derived by Australians when a government has the courage actually to implement it. </PARA>
<PARA> Then, of course, we heard Senator Powell. There was nothing unusual about Senator Powell's contribution because it was simply the Australian Democrats further being apologists for the Government. They want to prove that there is absolutely no difference between the Democrats and the Government or that they are further to the left than the Government. Having listened very carefully to Senator Powell's contribution, I really do feel that probably the better place for her this afternoon would have been as the clown at the front of Parliament House in the Ashton's Circus demonstration. She too obviously does not know what micro-economic reform is all about. We all wait very patiently to see whether Senator Powell, before she leaves, will deliver in this place a speech that makes some sort of sense or actually demonstrates some sort of logic. </PARA>
<PARA> The real thrust of this debate this afternoon is this: the Treasurer (Mr Keating) may express the view of the Hawke Labor Government that micro-economic reform is `small beer', as he did on 28 November, but I rise in support of this matter of public importance precisely because Australia must win this battle if ordinary Australians are to enjoy an adequate standard of living. Many Australians, I suppose, really do not have the faintest idea of what micro-economic reform is, let alone how such reform will be of benefit to them. What we must do today is clearly demonstrate to the people of Australia what it really does mean to them at the end of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are talking about is a type of reform that will attempt to create greater efficiency, and thereby competitiveness, for both the public and private sectors. This means that the huge current account deficit and foreign debt that have been amassed by the Hawke-Keating Government will be reduced. As our foreign debt is now totally out of control, thanks to Mr Keating, a repayment bill of $7,000 has been lumped on every man, woman and child which is rising at the rate of $108 every month. If Australians believe that they have enough debts of their own, how often do they stop and consider that this Government is amassing debts on their behalf? That is something that we simply cannot allow to continue, because the interest payment alone on this debt is costing every man, woman and child $625 this year-that is purely and simply the interest. Micro-economic reform is, therefore, essential if that burden is to be lifted from their backs. </PARA>
<PARA> The question may well be asked: how will this be achieved? The most fundamental measures that need to be taken are the abolition of restrictive practices and unnecessary regulation; more cost efficient delivery of communication and transport services-I was very alarmed to hear Senator Powell say a moment ago that she did not consider that that type of efficiency was either necessary or desirable; and increasing flexibility and competition in both the public and private sectors. People must realise sooner or later that profit is not a dirty word. Without profits there are simply no jobs, less income, and more hardships for many people, and that cannot be allowed to continue. The Hawke-Keating Government has talked long and hard about micro-economic reform, but has failed to deliver anything remotely like it. The Australian newspaper was correct when, on 10 November, it stated:</PARA>
<PARA> No previous government has been better informed about Australia's economic sclerosis. </PARA>
<PARA>This Labor Government has only substantially implemented three of the 14 reports that have been received from the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) and that have pointed the way to micro-economic reform. One may say that it does not have the know-how or that it is simply lacking the courage. Whatever excuse it might be, there is a real need for micro-economic reform today and in the very near future. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only the word of the coalition that such reform will benefit Australian families. The Industries Assistance Commission in its 1988-89 report makes it clear that, if reform of transport and communications, together with reductions in protection, were to be implemented, then the $16 billion improvement in our gross domestic product-how much Australia produces-would translate into an average increase in household income of $1,600 annually. That is no small amount. The amount of $1,600 annually means that every household would increase income by at least $30 per week. This amount is not insignificant when a middle income family is confronted with bills such as $50 to $60 per pair of school shoes two or three times a year for every child, plus uniforms, sports clothes, books and transport-just to name a few. </PARA>
<PARA> Women want more flexibility in the work force. Senator Powell said a little while ago that women want more wages. That is not necessarily what many women want; they want more flexibility to be able to work the hours that fit in with their family structure. She just does not understand what we are all about. That is not amazing. It is not insignificant either when a survey of a lower income Perth suburban street showed in the wake of the August Budget that one family with two small children had only $30 in the kitty for the food bill for the weeks ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> I found it most disturbing this afternoon to listen to Senator Giles when she said that there had been no decline in living standards during the period of this Government. I thought Senator Giles was one who ran around Australia saying that she supported the cause of families and women. Clearly, she does not understand what they are going through and how much of a decline there has been in living standards. It is also not insignificant either when the Support, Information, Education and Referral Association of Western Australia says:</PARA>
<PARA> There are more kids in poverty now than there ever has been and this prostitution is a result of it. </PARA>
<PARA>That is another sad element of where this country is heading. There are more and more young people heading towards prostitution and actually indulging in it just to stay alive. Yet in three weeks' time, supposedly, we are not meant to have any child poverty in this country. I do not know about the children-I do really. Let us face it; there will still be hundreds of thousands of children in poverty, to say nothing of their parents who also will be in poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> It was even more alarming this afternoon to listen to Senator Button's answer to a question in Question Time. The Leader of the Government in the Senate quite clearly demonstrated that he did not understand what was going on out there in the real world about the cost of living. I would like to know how recently it is that Senator Button has been into as grocery store, a supermarket, or a clothing store to buy clothes for children-just to find out how much it costs. People do not understand that until they have done that exercise. It is not insignificant when charities are telling us that there are more people needing help this Christmas than ever before. The reality is that there are fewer people contributing to their cause. </PARA>
<PARA> The IAC has predicted a gain of 35,000 jobs if its program of micro-economic reform were implemented. That, of course, would make an enormous difference to the lives of many individuals and families. But the Government is walking away from it. There will be many people in the suburbs, country areas and the like who would be wanting to get more employment. More employment would be available if micro-economic reform were implemented. It is worth remembering that some estimates put the household cost of protection to the car industry under this Labor Government between $170 and $250 annually. That is another amount that the Government is putting onto the backs of Australians. When we add all the bits and pieces Australians must remember that the debts they have are not only their own but debts the Government is running up on their behalf. If the levels of industry assistance were to be removed and industries were to become more competitive, it would be possible to have an additional and desperately needed increase in gross domestic product of approximately $4 billion annually. The coalition will not shirk its responsibility in the way in which the Hawke-Keating Government has done. We are all about providing less encumbrances on individuals whereby they can personally benefit from their hard work. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Alston earlier in the debate described how the Telecom Australia monopoly inefficiency makes our national communications system unnecessarily expensive. I reiterate that what we are talking about is a cost of $30 per week per business employee when, in 1985, Telecom manning levels had 69 main lines per employee compared with an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average of 135. If that does not point to inefficiency, what does? Again, it is the view of the IAC that improved efficiency in the postal, telecommunications and electricity sectors will deliver savings of $6 per week to each Australian household-another saving to the household. </PARA>
<PARA> When we consider the fact that the STD charges are twice what they should otherwise be, we should consider that in practical terms a 10-minute call only 50 kilometres away from a major city currently costs $2.40 and should only cost about $1.20, to say nothing of those private individuals who wish or need to keep in touch with relatives interstate, and to say nothing of the companies that need to have telephone communication interstate at a time of day when the highest charges apply. A 10-minute call for them at worst is $6.50 and, at best, at limited times, is $3.20. Once again we should be looking at about half that cost, which would be a further saving to families. The policies of this Hawke Labor Government are the only reason that those charges are not much less today. This Government has allowed costs and monopolies to run riot without any consideration of how it impacts on ordinary Australians and business. There are very few ordinary Australians who appear to have a privileged position with the Government's stance other than the waterside workers. Would it not be a very comfortable situation if all people who were retrenched had $300m to spend on redundancy payments for 3,000 people? That is what the waterside workers are being offered. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we hear Bill Kelty of the Australian Council of Trade Unions promising his members a 30 per cent productivity gain with no timetable or prerequisites. Would not every other Australian worker like a piece of that cake! But it is not going across the board. Let us not forget that micro-economic reform is all the more urgent when we consider that for many Australians, disposable income has been eroded under this Government. The effect of the increase in the consumer price index in combination with Labor's taxation bracket creep and the level of family support measures has meant that the real disposable income of a single income family with two dependent children has, in 1982-83 prices, fallen a massive 8 per cent. Yet Senator Giles said that there had been an increase. When we bear in mind that, with this reduced disposable real income, families have been struggling with spiralling interest rates, we realise that the need for courage to implement the structural reforms that will ultimately raise household income becomes overwhelming. </PARA>
<PARA> In four of the six years between 1983 and 1989 real wages have fallen, yet Australian have averaged a miserable 0.3 per cent rise in productivity compared with the 1.9 per cent OECD average. The coalition commitment to privatisation is another vital tool that will provide essential services more efficiently. This efficiency can only translate to better services, lower prices, and improved real incomes. That is particularly important for families. A couple may need to fly interstate for urgent reasons. The flight between Perth and Sydney would cost them about $2,000. </PARA>

<PARA> The Government's abject failure to deliver on its promise that micro-economic reform would be the centrepiece of its third term of Government with the inevitable consequences of declining living standards and increased social stresses for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very pertinent topic. It was put forward by Senator Alston, one of the foremost intellects on the other side. He is a person who has his finger on every aspect that we would expect him to have it on in the field of industrial relations and economics. I saw that he was to be followed by the previous speaker, Senator Knowles, and I thought, `This is weird. We are going to have a very deep and serious debate'. Senator Knowles is one of the great contributions the west has made to this Parliament. I saw that next on the Opposition speakers' list was Senator Archer. I thought, `We are going to have a very serious debate about micro-economic reform. They will have their finger on the appropriate issues'. I thought that the reason this is being brought forward on 13 December 1989 is that on 15 December 1989 a report will be sent to the Industrial Relations Commission about reforms on the waterfront. I concluded that this must have arisen from the concern often expressed by the Opposition about what is happening on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought we would have a debate about the in-principle agreement which will be the subject of the report to the Commission on Friday, 15 December. The in-principle agreement around the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority was brought forward in September 1989. It was agreed to by employers, employees and the Government. I thought that the Opposition speakers-these brilliant people-would analyse the central issue of micro-economic reform. There has been a thunderous silence on perhaps the most important document with respect to micro-economic reform. Whey would these two outstanding figures from the Opposition-Senator Knowles and Senator Alston, who represent perhaps the cream of the Opposition-not even refer to the very central issue of the micro-economic reform debate, the in-principle agreement of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps Senator McKiernan can tell me why those honourable senators with their intellect and knowledge of the issue would get up and berate the Government without even mentioning one of the central planks, if not the central plank, of the reform processes put forward by the Government. The conclusion might be that they have nothing to say about it. Perhaps they admit by their silence that contrary to the implication in the subject put forward as a matter of public importance, they understand very well that the progress made by the Government in micro-economic reform cannot be answered. I draw that conclusion because they have not sought to deal with the most fundamental plank.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is the in-principle agreement about? I will mention a couple of the subjects involved. Chapter 10.1 of the agreement, `Enterprise Employment', states:</PARA>
<PARA>In the ports of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Fremantle and Adelaide and other ports as agreed, enterprise employment arrangements will be introduced within a framework of enterprise agreements and an Industry Award(s). </PARA>
<PARA>One of the great cries we hear from the Opposition day after day is that we ought to move to enterprise employment. Opposition senators have echoed that theme all this year and certainly since September 1989. The document setting out the agreement, the centrepiece of reform, shows that the Government, the unions and the employers are moving towards enterprise employment, but honourable senators have not mentioned the document. What sort of proposition is the Opposition putting forward when it raises issues without mentioning such reform? I cannot repeat enough that the very heart of the argument ought to be this subject. Senator Alston said, `Oh, well, the waterfront!'. He said that Tas Bull, the General Secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, had a harebrained scheme and only wanted to give people more money. He said that the workers would put the money in their pockets and ask for more. That is Senator Alston's proposition, but it is not the reality. That is not what is proposed by Tas Bull, the Government or the employers. As evidence of that, on Friday next, if the Industrial Relations Commission sanctions it and if matters are taken to that point, they are going to the Commission to agree to an award based on the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority in-principle agreement. That agreement contains all the things that the Opposition wants: an increase in productivity, enterprise employment, and agreement between the parties, yet the Opposition either apparently does not know of the document, which I cannot accept, or just ignores it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has said that the labour movement, the unions, and the Government have done nothing. Let us leave the waterfront aside for a moment and look at the Williamstown dockyard where the Victorian Government, the Trades Hall Council and Mr John Halfpenny, who is often berated in this place, did great work in setting up the most efficient shipping yard in Australia.

<PARA> I turn now to the shipping industry around Australia and a record I obtained from the office of the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Willis. That record of shipping reform includes the establishment by the Government in June 1989 of a three-year reform strategy based on consensus and building on the progress of the Crawford scheme. It also reports that crews on ships have been reduced. Recrewing existing ships has led to a saving to the industry of $32m per year and further reductions will be carried out over the next few years. More than half of those reductions will have occurred by the end of this year, bringing down the average crew number to 25-a 25 per cent reduction over the level under the previous Government. By 1992, one-third of the fleet will have been modernised and the average crew size on Australian trading ships will have been reduced to 21, matching that ships from member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. In 1984 the average crew size was 33, the figure we inherited from the previous government. The big thing about it is that this massive improvement in efficiency has been achieved with unprecedented industrial harmony. This has been carried out with the agreement of the unions, the workers, as well as the managers, the employers and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has not mentioned those massive reforms at the micro-economic level. I can understand Senator Knowles and Senator Alston saying that the Government has done this and that but that it has not done enough, but they did not even do that. Senator Alston and Senator Knowles are both fair-minded people and I would have thought that in fairness on this occasion they would have given way to their instincts and mentioned these quite amazing reforms that have occurred under this Government at the micro-economic level. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to the program of reform at bulk grain terminals. That is a big issue that the National Party might be interested in, even if the Liberal Party is not, because it concerns the movement of primary produce. The document I received from the Minister for Transport and Communications states:</PARA>
<PARA>the program of reform of employment arrangements at bulk grain terminals has resulted in the implementation of substantial reductions in shipboard manning levels at Fisherman Islands (Brisbane) and Port Kembla. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to support this matter of public importance that has been proposed by the shadow Minister for communications, Senator Alston. In case Senator Cooney is thinking of disappearing from the chamber, as seems to be the pattern with honourable senators opposite, I suggest that he stays because I can give him some of the information that he has been looking for so earnestly. I start by asking: Just what has happened to the micro-economic issues that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) nominated as being the basis of his third term in office? As yet, there is nothing of any consequence to show. We have had seven years of hard labour where the macro-economic measures of the Government have left us with impossible interest rates, very high inflation, a huge and uncontrolled debt, a fiddled dollar and crippling taxation. That is what the macros have done. There has been no change in that system over this seven-year period. Times have changed, but the policies have not. There has been no relief and no progress. All we have seen is a blind ideological, stupid commitment to these matters when it has been patently clear to every Australian that it is absolutely essential to change from these disastrous policies. But we have not had that change. With the macros so far off the track, the micros have been left alone. The Government has been totally beaten by the macros-it just has not got anywhere with them at all. The issues of the real world and of ordinary people just have not been dealt with. The Government cannot do it; it does not know which way to go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One only has to look at communications, industrial relations, the airlines, housing, inflation control, the balance of payments and the wage levels. What has the Government done in any of those areas? What is the Government's reputation, and what is the result? It is essential at a time like this that we do not look only at the self-gratification that one of the previous speakers referred to when he said, `Oh yes, we have done this and we have done that'. What is important is where we stand internationally. I can give honourable senators a few facts in relation to that matter. In 1960 we ranked fourth in the world in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) on a per capita basis. By 1987 we ranked sixteenth. Are we proud of that? Between 1981 and 1988 foreign debt increased five-fold from 5 per cent to 30 per cent. By 1999, at that rate, the foreign debt will be 60 per cent of GDP. In 1987 the gross foreign debt was 38 per cent of GDP, the eleventh highest of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. The interest on the foreign debt represents 16 per cent of the value of exports of all goods and services, which is the fourth highest amongst all OECD countries. In 1989 the export of goods was 13.5 per cent of GDP-unchanged since 1958 and down from 25 per cent in 1900. From 1980 to 1989 the export of goods and services fell from 18.1 to 16.1 per cent. In 1988 and 1989 the relative unit wage costs grew by 7.3 per cent against an OECD average of 3.5 per cent. That is how we compare internationally, and that is the test of whether the objects of this Government have been carried out or not. </PARA>
<PARA> I must give credit to the Government-I was going to do this in any event-for starting to talk about railways. After seven years the Government has discovered railways. On 6 December a statement was released by the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown) which said:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Brown said the Hawke Government was making rail reform a priority. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, after seven years the Government has found a priority and has called it rail. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . micro-economic reform in the rail sector was important for industry in particular and the economy in general. </PARA>
<PARA>I am very pleased with that statement. Although the Government is teetering on the brink, we find that it is going to put its faith in railways. I also have to say that the Government has also discovered shipping. The Government has now found it necessary to have the twenty-fourth inquiry into shipping and the waterfront since Federation. I will say something about that later. </PARA>
<PARA> But has the Government any plan for micro-economic change? I do not care what the plan is. I would like to know whether there is a plan and, if so, which way it is heading. Where are we heading under Labor? There is no direction and no action. If honourable senators opposite would like to refresh their minds and read the Liberal Party document called Future Directions, they will find that the policy of the Opposition is the way to go. But we have not seen anything like that from the Australian Labor Party. I do not know whether it has got any plan; nobody does. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a quick look at industry. Where are we with industry? Are we going to reindustrialise? Are we a post-industrial society? Are we on the Argentinean road? Where are we heading? Who would want to establish a business of any consequence in Australia now? Would anybody like to start a pulp mill somewhere? How does anybody know what Labor has in mind? In short, does it want industry or does it not? In which direction should education go? Do we teach science or sociology? Do we concentrate on teaching dishwashing and bead threading? I do not know in which direction the Government is going, and neither does anybody else outside this place. Is there to be industry or is there not? Paul Cleary, writing in the Australian on the Australian Manufacturing Council report, very succinctly said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no plan, no strategy to fill the industrial wasteland portrayed in the report. </PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely correct. Why do we not have an on-processing plan or an import substitution plan? If problems exist in these areas, we should fix them and not just say, `Oh, it is too hard. There is a problem. We will leave it or go round it'. Problems exist to be overcome, and I expect the government of the day to try to overcome them. Look at the very fast train-and I use this analogy regularly. Everybody is just standing around, wringing their hands and saying that it is all terribly difficult. But one has only got to look at the road situation and the poor rail performance. Look at what we are talking about spending on an air service that may be unnecessary if we can get a decent train. Look at the deaths and injuries that are being caused by the state of our roads. Look at the costs and the time that is wasted. I urge the Government to get behind the very fast train project. I urge the Government to get behind anything. Let us see where we are going. We need national planning and national action. We need some leadership but we are not getting it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell raised the question of the accord. What a thing for anybody who is trying to support the Government to raise. What has the accord done for ordinary Australians? Wage earners generally are worse off than they were before. There are increased distinctions between the highly skilled and the less highly skilled. The accord has not overcome outside of award deals. It has forced the Government to grovel at the knees of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. There is no evidence that award restructuring has produced any significant overall increased productivity but it has seen wage rises above expectations. An article in the Australian of 11 December, just recently, was headed `Wage rises too fast for some'. I thought this is what we had the accord for. Let us look at the result of the accord. It has not been going long enough for us to at least look backwards. Has it made us more competitive? Are we exporting more? Is it putting Australia higher on the international scale of comparison? Has it resulted in fewer imports? The answer to every one of those questions is no. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to shipping. Yes, the Government has found shipping. We have had the twenty-fourth inquiry into shipping and what did it tell us that we did not know before? What was the result of this inquiry? We are still at the stage where, according to the Australian editorial of 10 November:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's coastal shipping is so expensive and unreliable that no general cargo is now carried by sea between Australian ports. </PARA>
<PARA>What an absolute disgrace. Australia, given its size and population and its general specifications, should have the best transport system in the world. Why do we not have the best transport system in the world? There are a variety of reasons, certainly, but there has been a lack of endeavour and this Government has done nothing about it-except to have another inquiry. The fact that there is is no competition is another real problem. We must remember that conditions on the waterfront are heavily padded. What has the accord done about these people who work 28 hours a week and who have an average income of 40 per cent above the national average? Is that based on their productivity? I do not think so. What does the Treasurer (Mr Keating) say? He washes his hands of it:</PARA>
<PARA> Opposition claims that reforms to ports and the waterfront would make all the difference to Australia's economic performance were `just bunkum', Mr Keating said. </PARA>
<PARA>What do other people around the world think about the situation? They might have a slightly different approach. A Mr Setchell, who was giving evidence to the Prices Surveillance Authority's public inquiry into the port congestion surcharge for cargo handling at Sydney, compared Australia's performance on the waterfront with that of Pakistan. I do not want to run down the Pakistanis but Pakistan is the country we are compared with on the international shipping agenda. In evidence to the Authority's inquiry, as reported by the Daily Commercial News, it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Average delay per vessel was 32 hours at Glebe Island and 41 hours at Port Botany . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What an absolute disgrace. I again ask Senator Cooney what has been done. I am not interested in what the talk is and I am not interested in what the plans for the next 10 years are; I want to know what has been done. An article in the same newspaper, the Daily Commercial News, of 8 December states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Conferences making this submission have sustained losses of approximately $16 million between January 1, 1988, to August 31, 1989 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is solely due to not being able to get in and out of the ports. There are absolutely and totally unacceptable delays, so much so that it is proposed to put a levy of $200 to $300 per box on all freight. I agree with the sub-heading of the article which says `Surcharge would only protect inefficiencies'. Putting a levy on these boxes would not solve the problem. We must not allow it to happen. We must think of the costs involved, the delays and our reputation, our unreliability. We must think about who pays. Nobody worries about who pays in Australia, but it is always the same person-the one on the end of the line. Overseas countries will deal with anyone other than Australia if they can possibly find a way in and out. What a reputation. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether honourable senators saw Senator Button's program on Australian Broadcasting Corporation television called Overseas and Undersold. I found it very edifying. I do not know what Government members thought of it but I hope that they all saw it. It has not sparked any action. It has not even sparked a comment from the Minister. There is talk of ships bypassing Sydney. It costs them $500 a box to move their freight backwards and forwards. Cranes have been out of commission in Sydney for nine months. We can compare the situation with that in Hamburg, where, if the port does not turn trucks around in 10 minutes, the port pays a penalty. If the port workers do not load 40 boxes an hour there is a penalty. They get in and out in 12 hours and 700 boxes are loaded a day. There is one national union. The last strike lasted for one day and it was 10 years ago. We are talking about double the price and half the productivity. A ship in Hong Kong can do in 14 hours what it would take Australia five times as long to do. A visit can cost $50,000 less in Hong Kong than in Australia. Let us expose public enterprises to a bit of competition. How can we survive without an entirely new start?</PARA>
<PARA> I am a Tasmanian. It costs $72 a tonne to get milk powder from Tasmania to Taiwan and $82 a tonne to get it to Melbourne. Aluminium can be shipped from Bell Bay to most Asian ports more cheaply than it can be shipped to Sydney. Newsprint is cheaper to ship from Canada to Sydney than from Hobart to Sydney. Cars are a third cheaper to ship from Melbourne to Japan than from Melbourne to Tasmania. Cement costs $12 to ship from Japan to Darwin but $20 to ship from Adelaide to Darwin. And so it goes on. What are we going to do about this? I do not want to know what has happened or what the plans are. Where is the action? Where are the results? Australia's micro-economic position is absolutely disastrous. It must be improved. I do not think that this Government is in a position to be able to do anything about it. It has had the time and the opportunity to do something but the results are not there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Government inherited a tremendously large deficit in 1983-some $8.5 billion, if I recall correctly. It was certainly not the figure that the Government of the time, prior to the Labor Government's taking office, was indicating. Our most recent Budget shows a $9 billion surplus. To me it is a fairly good effort by a government to have turned that deficit into a surplus over a period of some six to seven years. We had unemployment running at about 10 per cent and that has been reduced to 7 per cent. Of course, no mention is made on the other side of the chamber about the degree of private debt-the Elliotts, the Holmes a'Courts and such people. For instance, Bond borrowed almost $1 billion overseas to buy a thriving brewery in Brisbane, Fourex. All that resulted from that was the dismissal of some of the top executives and more profits for the Bond Corporation. So much for the question of debt. It is forecast by our Treasurer (Mr Keating) that by 1992 we will probably have no public debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The previous Government gave us bad industrial relations; there was no change for the better in sight; there was a confrontationist attitude; the unions did not trust the previous Government; and the unions could not trust it. The previous Government was opposed to all wage claims. History shows that; it is on the record. It suppressed workers' rights through penalties under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. It made union amalgamations difficult or impossible. Amalgamations are vital if we are to succeed in restructuring industry and jobs and at the same time develop career paths and better educate the work force in terms of the creation of wealth. Honourable senators opposite contributed to a framework in which no cultural change was possible. Without a cultural change in the industrial area we will not achieve the sorts of goals that we have set for ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us compare that with the record of the Australian Labor Party in government. It prepared its entry to government by reaching an agreement with the trade unions to bring about micro-economic reform and change, in the interests of all Australians. The accord enabled the containment of wage increases and the decrease of labour costs. Figures show that amount to be about 9 per cent. At the same time profits were increased. The accord contains a proposition that there should be a transfer of wages to profits. We did not do that because we felt that we suddenly liked the employers and entrepreneurs any better but because we knew it was an economically sound proposition and, in the medium and long term, we were seeking to create the opportunity for more jobs and a better and stronger economy. There has been a substantial increase in investment in machinery, technology and training but certainly not to the extent of the increases in profits. </PARA>
<PARA> People on the Opposition benches talk all the time about a reduction in living standards. I would not argue with that. There has been a small reduction because of the changes that have taken place. We know that and understand that. But, although it might continue in the near future, there is no reduction in the living standards of the Bonds and Elliotts. We are told by people using the correct facts that, if the capital gains tax is removed, Mr Elliott will be given another $18m. He is not suffering any particular reduction in his living standards. But the trade union movement and the Labor Party have gone out and talked to people about what their future should hold. We obviously need to be cooperative and not confrontationist. We need to create greater wealth, increase productivity and create and manufacture more value-added goods so that we will add to our gross national product. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is justifiably proud of its achievements in micro-economic reform. It has provided leadership and a comprehensive strategy to make Australia more outward-looking and competitive. We have listened to the needs and problems of people in all sections of industry, including those within the award system, and have worked together to plan and implement necessary changes that will benefit all Australians. That is where we depart from the attitude and philosophy of the Opposition. To those in the Opposition people are just statistics. They are an extension of the machine they operate. Those opposite are motivated by profit. To them a good balance of payments means a situation where the dollar is reasonably strong. If one is able to sell one's products, to the opposition that is great, one has prosperity. It does not matter if half the population is out of work. They might be out of work as a result of the restructuring of industry, changed technological levels, changes in the way in which industry operates or as a result of the economy generally, but, even if they are out of work for no fault of their own, they will be called dole bludgers and told that they do not want to work. </PARA>
<PARA> Progress was virtually non-existent under three decades of conservative rule. We know that the Opposition was then, and is still, unable to bring all the major interest groups together to discuss, plan and implement changes for the benefit of this nation. The Opposition has always ruled with a heavy hand. This has led to mistrust in the workplace, with sectional interest groups competing for dominance. We in the trade union movement know that that has not always been beneficial, though on most occasions it has been impossible for us to work in any other way. But we are on another path now and realise the importance of working together with employers to create even greater wealth so that mutual benefits can flow to the community. We need to work cooperatively for Australia's benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has continued to place micro-economic reform at the top of the political agenda. It has continued to look at dozens of areas within the Australian economy and has systematically produced strategies to improve the rationalisation and effectiveness of industry, the industrial relations system, the award system, and productivity and employment levels. The Government is continuing its commitment to overhaul the industry infrastructure and services sector of the economy. I would like to refer to a small sample of these micro-economic reforms to illustrate the care and attention the Government has given. I will list them: coastal shipping, steel industry, waterfront, grain handling reform, award restructuring, and industrial relations. Earlier this year the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) made a speech in which he said about shipping:</PARA>
<PARA> Our work on shipping builds on earlier reforms introduced by this Government. In 1984, in response to the Crawford report, we introduced taxation incentives which led to new ships coming into service in 1984 with crews as low as 26, well below crew levels for such ships of an earlier generation which were in the low to mid 30s. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a one-third reduction in crewing. The Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The Crawford scheme represented a critical turning point for the industry. It introduced a pattern for reform with shipowners and unions working together in a constructive way, for users and the economy as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a long way from the days when shipowners were pirates. I have some doubts about some of them having reformed their ways through the years, but the Minister's statement indicates a very good development. The Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA>These reforms have been achieved in a period of unprecedented industrial harmony in the shipping industry. In 1982-</PARA>
<PARA>when the Opposition was in power-</PARA>
<PARA>4.1% of ship time or 1593 ship days were lost through industrial disputes. Last year only 0.2% or 72 ship days were lost. This dramatic change has been brought about partly by the reduction in demarcation disputes through union amalgamations and partly by the industry's determination to improve its efficiency and public image. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, part of it is restructuring so that people gain multiskilling both vertically and horizontally. The Labor Government has embarked on a practical and deliberate program for change to reduce industry costs and to encourage the industry to make major investments in larger and more specialised vessels. As I have said, the program includes a reduction of staffing levels by more than one-third and the introduction of multiskilling. By 1992 the average crew size will be down to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average. Ten years ago the Opposition would have rolled around the floor laughing at that-and it would have been entitled to do so. But these changes have taken place. </PARA>
<PARA> What more does the Opposition want? Does it want ghost ships that go through the night with no crew at all? We might even eliminate all the consumers who will buy the goods they carry. Of course, the economy would be in a sorry state then. The industry is now in a position to inject the necessary funds into new and more appropriate vessels. The industry's costs have been reduced by our incentives to replace old and inefficient ships with new vessels. As a result, 25 new vessels have been ordered or introduced. This was confirmed to me some 18 months ago by a shipowner who, in reply to my question, said that industrial relations were the best they had been for some time and that people were able to talk together constructively. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the steel industry, which was going out the door backwards, according to Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP), with a return of 2 per cent. It was looking to the day when it might even close down. There was a significant improvement in both the then current situation and our expectations for the future as a result of the completion of the steel plan, which encouraged rationalisation and modernisation, produced a favourable environment for the industry and required only limited financial assistance. Industrial agreements were established and productivity improvements, job security, training programs and job award restructuring occurred. Production in the steel industry has improved from below 200 tonnes per employee per annum to nearly 400 tonnes. This figure will rise to 500 tonnes in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> So much for the Opposition's accusation about no increased productivity and the allegation that we have not embarked on micro-economic reforms. The situation in the steel industry is very clear. The figures are there, they are proved, and they come from BHP, a company that, in the past, has never been noted for good industrial relations or for seeking to be loved by its employees. As Senator Button said this week, only two areas exceed those sorts of production levels- Japan and some areas of the United States of America. We have the cheapest steel of its kind in the world, with exports up and increasing wealth for Australians. I have a document which states:</PARA>
<PARA> BHP Steel is undergoing a major capital expenditure program to expand capacity out to improve efficiency and quality . . . BHP Steel is aiming to export up to 25 per cent of its total steel production of 8.05m tonnes p.a. by 1992. This is double the average the company has been exporting in recent years, and increases the share of value-added steel product exports. </PARA>
<PARA>That has to be a plus for the whole community. I have given examples of the way in which micro-economic reform has been developed by the Government and of the framework we have provided. The companies themselves have brought about the changes, and certainly not with the Government having to stand over them. The Government has said to the companies, particularly BHP, `We have provided subsidies up to $550m over a period to help you maintain a market; you have got to do your bit'. BHP promised to do so, and has invested almost twice the amount it gave an undertaking about earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> On the waterfront there has been extensive consultation, and it has become clear that all major stevedoring operators should be responsible for their own work force rather than using the old pool system. The Government has developed plans to change both employment levels and procedures by 1992. It will introduce multi- skilling in the workplace and reorganise staff. Opposition senators talk as if there is real resistance by the waterside workers; as if they do not want to see any change; as if they are bloody-minded; and as if they really do not care about the community. That is not the truth. In June this year Tas Bull put out a statement to his members. He said, in part:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's ports are at a turning point. To ensure their future viability in a competitive environment we need:</PARA>
<PARA> A younger, skilled and motivated workforce</PARA>
<PARA> Better management</PARA>
<PARA> Coordinated and comprehensive planning. </PARA>
<PARA> The waterfront makes a significant contribution to the Australian economy, representing about 0.8 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product. More importantly it is the transport interface through which the nation's imports and exports must pass. In 1986-87 waterside workers handled a total of 7.6 million tonnes of non-bulk imported cargo and 10.3 million tonnes of exports. </PARA>
<PARA>There is somebody who is not worried just about when his next wage increase will come about; he understands the industry, he has worked in it and he is concerned about his members who work in it. He knows that changes have to take place if we are to have a viable future. He has a different view from that of the Opposition-again, he cares about people. He knows that changes have to take place but he wants them to take place in a reasonable, steady manner so that people who will forfeit their right to work, and will probably never get another job even if they want to-there are plenty of job advertisements saying, `If you are over 40, please do not apply'-will get some compensation. And he wants to ensure that there is cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the Australian economy has been placed firmly within the world economy by this Government. We have agreed that for Australia to become competitive in world terms we must also trade with the world on an equal footing. At the same time, the world economy is changing. This creates pressure on the Australian economy and our capacity to deal with this pressure is limited. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper and the attached statements. </PARA>
<PARA>In this matter one is tempted to commence by saying `better late than never'. This report entitled Pulp and Paper Industry Package is long overdue. It was promised to the Senate on or before 30 November but, as per usual, the Government has not been able to get its act together to consider matters even according to its own timetable. The need for this particular document derives essentially from the fiasco of the Wesley Vale development proposal where the Federal Government's latter-day intervention was a cause of so much trouble and confusion and was simply typical of the way in which this Labor Government goes about changing the rules of the game once play has started. As far as this Government is concerned, the new test, the now test, is `Will it adhere to those guidelines?'. Having promulgated these guidelines, will it now give an undertaking to stick to them and to allow industry to make decisions and allow the environmental movement to know what the ground rules are, or will it, in typical fashion, be prepared to change them again if political circumstances seem to its advantage?</PARA>
<PARA> I said that these papers derived essentially from the confusion over the Wesley Vale project and over appropriate guidelines. I go back for a moment to a comment made in March this year about the proposal for Wesley Vale. On 2 March the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) was asked to report on the Wesley Vale project. It reported to the Government on 13 March. The report stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In providing advice to the Government in relation to the proposed Wesley Vale Pulp Mill, CSIRO has focused its attention on two major issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Are the emissions from the proposed mill the minimum that can be expected using the most modern proven technology, and</PARA>
<PARA> What is the likely impact of these emissions to the environment?</PARA>
<PARA> Our response to the first issue is clear. CSIRO considers that, for the purpose of producing pulp for high quality printing papers, the Wesley Vale mill is proposing to use the most modern proven technologies incorporating advanced procedures to minimise liquid and gaseous effluents. In our view there are no alternatives to the proposed pulping/bleaching process that are commercially proven and that will produce a bleached eucalypt pulp with the desired properties for the export market. </PARA>
<PARA>In March this year this Government was told the truth. When we read the guidelines now, almost exactly nine months later, we find that the CSIRO's advice to Government, now accepted and incorporated in these pulp mills proposals, says precisely the same thing. It says precisely now what the Government knew the situation was in March this year. Nevertheless, for purely political reasons, it prevaricated and carried on about this issue to the detriment of Tasmania. Indeed, by the middle of March the Government was in a state of absolute embarrassment over this matter. On 16 March on the 7.30 Report Mr Keating admitted that the Commonwealth had failed to develop appropriate standards and should have done so at an earlier stage. Senator Button, as reported in the Canberra Times on 20 March, said exactly the same thing. On the Business Sunday program on 19 March, when asked by the reporter whether Commonwealth standards in this area were lacking, Senator Button admitted that they were lacking. Senator Cook put out a press release on 22 March, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Resources, Senator Peter Cook, said today that the Federal Government had to move quickly to define the environmental guidelines for future pulp mill investment in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>That was Senator Cook's own press release. It has taken him nine months to move quickly. He could have had a baby in less time for all of the urgency with which he has addressed this matter. When Mr Crean was asked about this matter on 15 March he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I think the fundamental problem is that the government has not got an overall environment strategy and it's environment strategy is to respond to complaints and issues around particular issues. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, Mr Kerin, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, on the Face to Face program of 26 March, admitted once again that the Government had simply not got its act together. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition consistently called for the development and promulgation of these guidelines. We raised the matter in the chamber in May. Indeed, on 2 May Senator Button put down a statement here, by way of an answer to a question, which was so confusing that the then shadow Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Chaney and I put out a statement on 5 May once again calling on the Government to issue these guidelines as a matter of urgency. We repeated that in a further statement which I put out on 10 July. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's eventual response was to commission an expert inquiry drawing on the resources of the officers of the CSIRO. I am glad that my colleague Senator Archer is in the chamber this afternoon. He will know, because of the particular interest he has taken in CSIRO, that the Government always returns to the CSIRO to get the Government out of the holes that it continues to get itself into over scientific questions at precisely the same time as it slashes and burns into CSIRO's budget, as it has done ever since its first day in office. In June 1989 the CSIRO produced a report entitled Pulp Mills: Modern Technology and Environmental Protection. I want to quote from one part of that report because I wish to come back to it. The CSIRO report stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The complete elimination of toxic substances from the effluent of a bleached kraft mill is presently not possible. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government was told that by CSIRO in June, but for purely political reasons it attempted to persuade the environmental movement and people around Australia that that was not so, that in fact it could produce a toxin-free emitting pulp mill somewhere in Australia. As I say, the Opposition now welcomes, at last, the production of these guidelines, presented yesterday by way of press release rather than being presented properly in this chamber. The guidelines would not have been debated in this chamber today had we not insisted. Again, this is typical of the way in which the Government behaves. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall now make a few comments about the precise guidelines. At the end of the day we will see that these guidelines, now adopted by the Government, have two remarkable features. The first is that they entirely endorse the guidelines originally laid down by the Tasmanian Government under the previous Liberal Administration. Secondly, in at least three areas, to which I shall draw attention, the guidelines proposed by these Federal regulations are, in fact, less than the environmental guidelines proposed by the Tasmanian Government at an earlier stage. </PARA>
<PARA> A criticism which can legitimately be made is that these guidelines and regulations do not adequately consider the alternatives to having bleached eucalypt kraft (BEK) pulp mills in Australia. It is possible over time to move away from the reliance on bleached eucalypt kraft mills and to move to the adoption of other technology relying primarily upon the use of plantation eucalypt as the source material to go into those pulp mills. Today, as to the technology being available to deal with mature eucalypt-to deal with that 4 3/4 million tonnes of eucalypt which we export by way of woodchips, worth something in the order of $370m a year-there is no way of going to the value added stage without the use of the technology of bleached eucalypt kraft pulp mills. There is no other way at all to add value to that 4 3/4 million tonnes currently being exported as woodchip. So to that extent we have to have these guidelines specifically for BEK pulp mills. But it is unfortunate that we do not have from the Government a strategy to move eventually to the use of other, more environmentally friendly technologies based upon plantation operations. I draw attention to the fact that the coalition's policy in relation to the development of the timber industry, again an area in which Senator Archer has been making a major contribution to the ongoing debate, puts a particular emphasis upon the development of plantation sources of material, and that in its turn will allow us to have a more environmentally friendly pulp mill technology. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point is that this document waxes lyrical about the question of consultations. In fact, if one looks at page 10 of the document under the heading `Need for wide consultations' and if one examines the process of consultation, one finds that at no stage were the Opposition or any of the Government's political opponents asked to be a part of the political consultative-or technically consultative-process. Indeed, one might understand that. But lest the Government thinks it will get mighty credit all- around, it is interesting to see that on 26 October Phillip Toyne, the Director of the Australian Conservation Foundation, wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth has failed to seriously consult with or address the concerns of anyone other than the paper and pulp industry. </PARA>
<PARA>I say both to Mr Toyne and, indeed, to Senator Richardson on this occasion that he who sups with the devil certainly needs a long spoon as far as these consultations are concerned. If they thought that they were going to lock in all and sundry by the phoney process of consultation that they went through, they have another political thought coming. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the specifics, and in particular to the amount of egg that must be left today on the face of Senator Graham Richardson. Senator Richardson went down to Tasmania and appeared with Jana Wendt at some publicly stage-managed presentation. What did he say about the preferred Commonwealth option for organochlorine discharges? He said they would be, to use his words, `none, zilch, none'. This document is a stunning repudiation of the deliberate attempt to mislead people into thinking that that could be achieved. It was going to be a zilch option, a zilch outcome. That was what Senator Richardson promised everybody. This document is a stunning repudiation of that, known at the time not to be possible or feasible and now exposed by the scientific evidence to be precisely that. </PARA>
<PARA> The guidelines Senator Richardson criticised, which were produced by the Tasmanian Government and which he was seen to be criticising in his reported remarks in the Launceston Examiner on 25 February 1989, have been vindicated in every significant respect by this CSIRO report. I draw attention to three specific areas in which the guidelines proposed by the Tasmanian Government of the day were in fact stricter than the guidelines which have now emerged. The first of those relates to the discharge of organochlorins. If one looks at page 15 of these guidelines one will see that there is a permissible emission level for organochlorins of up to one tonne per year, or one kilogram per air-dried tonne, as an average figure. The Tasmanian guidelines set out in the schedule to the Northern Pulp Mills (Doubts Removal) Agreement Bill 1989 said that the emission level was never to be above one tonne. An average of one tonne has now been adopted by the Government, with an allowance of up to 2.5 tonnes in any one sampling-that is, 2 1/2 times the maximum discharge limit which the Tasmanian legislation put in place has now been found to be acceptable by the Government-and instead of the absolute limit proposed by the Tasmanian Liberal Government it is now an average over the course of the year.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, we have the question of tertiary treatment. On page 17 of this document we see that the only guidelines relate to primary and secondary treatment. There is no requirement for any tertiary treatment of the effluent from these mills. Yet the Tasmanian guidelines were designed to achieve 0.7 kilograms of organochlorins per air-dried tonne of pulp in terms of movement towards tertiary treatment, with up to 40 per cent chlorine dioxide substitution for chlorine in the bleaching process. Again, this was a far stricter attempt to get to tertiary treatment guidelines. This document makes no attempt whatsoever to get to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, let us look at the question of what happens in terms of breaches of these standards. On page 13 of the document we see that in the case of the breach of an emission limit, the operator is supposed to notify the regulatory authority of the breach, provide a statement within 24 hours prescribing the reasons for the breach and the proposed methods of dealing with it, and reach an agreement with the regulatory authority as soon as possible on the method of addressing the problem. The document goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> The option of mill closure is available to State/Territory control authorities in the event of unacceptable breaches. </PARA>
<PARA>The Tasmanian guidelines provided that steps had to be taken to fix any breaches of emission standards within 30 minutes. It had to be decided whether it could be fixed completely within 24 hours or else there was an automatic shutdown of the operation. Again, that is a far stricter guideline than the present Commonwealth standards. </PARA>
<PARA> At last the Government has realised that economics matter. This document states on page 1:</PARA>
<PARA> The strategy being adopted by the Commonwealth to achieve these objectives is to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) establish stringent emission limits based on the best available technology economically achievable (BATEA) and specify site suitability studies, baseline studies and monitoring prerequisites. </PARA>
<PARA>When Senator Richardson was in Tasmania he told people that he would not be diverted from doing the right thing ecologically by simple economic considerations. He is now repudiated. Indeed, the Prime Minister, in an appallingly loose and meaningless address that he gave at the opening of the Australian Conservation Foundation headquarters on 11 December, a couple of days ago, made this criticism of the Opposition:</PARA>
<PARA> The Coalition and their backers have learned nothing about the environment. They have pledged economy before ecology. </PARA>
<PARA>We have always said that those two things go hand in hand. Now the Government guidelines endorse precisely that. The Government says that the standards have to be based on the best available technology economically achievable-not the best in the world, not the best theoretically, but the best economically achievable. It has taken the Government nine months of effort to wake up to the fact that some of these things require a reasonable economic input. It is not surprising to read in today's Australian:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for the Environment, Senator Richardson, said the Wesley Vale project in Tasmania was likely to be resurrected under the guidelines, but not at the same site. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the standards proposed for the precise development at Wesley Vale, the standards proposed under the Tasmanian Government's environmental requirements, are absolutely vindicated by these guidelines. Yet we have had all of the delay and all of the loss deliberately occasioned by Senator Richardson in his pursuit of purely temporary political advantage. At least we can now say that in the Commonwealth's guidelines Senator Richardson stands condemned and repudiated-and so he should be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I go into detail on the pulp and paper mill industry package, the press release and the background papers that we are debating, while I understand that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, is a big boy and can stand up for himself, I want to correct one comment that Senator Puplick made in relation to statements made by Senator Richardson in Tasmania when the Jana Wendt program was held down there. Senator Puplick said that at that meeting Senator Richardson stated that emissions from the pulp mill, under any guidelines with which he was concerned, would be `none, zilch, none'. That is a misquote. I was present at that meeting and know exactly what Senator Richardson said. He said that his preferred position for any mill established at Wesley Vale or anywhere else would be `none, zilch, none'. But he recognised that there may be some emissions, and that they would need to be dealt with and adequate protection given to the environment. To say that what he had proposed at that stage was simply a guideline that stated `none, zilch, none' is just not true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most of the argument put forward today by Senator Puplick centred around the situation at Wesley Vale. He referred to it as a fiasco. I agree that it was a fiasco. But the fiasco was caused by the State Government in Tasmania, not the Federal Government. The Federal Government was forced to step in and do something. If it had not done so, a mill would have been established with inadequate protection of the environment. Pollution would have been pumped out into Bass Strait and no proper study would have been done of the damage and the long term effect of that pumping of emissions into Bass Strait. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick has claimed that these guidelines are not as strong as those that were proposed originally. There is no doubt that the emission limits that must be met to satisfy the Commonwealth guidelines are more demanding in most respects than those of the original Wesley Vale proposal. For example, in the liquid effluent stream, the allowable level for organochlorins, total suspended solids and biochemical oxygen demand are all lower. As far as air emissions are concerned, again the Commonwealth is more demanding. The Commonwealth requires lower levels to be met for oxides of nitrogen, particulates, total reduced sulphur compounds, hydrogen chloride, opacity, sulphuric acid mist and sulphur trioxide. These emission limits will be met only by using the best available technology. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important point as far as Wesley Vale is concerned is that the guidelines do not just stop at emission limits. They also specify stringent site suitability criteria that must be satisfied. Anybody who proposes to build a pulp mill will be required to undertake detailed meteorological and hydrodynamic studies, using at least one year's adequate data to determine the suitability of proposed sites. This would form part of the environmental impact assessment process which would, of course, also include the full range of studies usually undertaken. If one considers those guidelines, on any criteria and any really objective view of the Wesley Vale proposal at the time, it would not have been suitable, and would not be suitable today. In my view, Senator Richardson is right: if a mill were ever to be built, it would not be suitable for Wesley Vale. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an acceptance by industry that the guidelines proposed for the Wesley Vale mill were inadequate. One does not need anything more than the comment made in the press today by Mr Paisley, the Forestry and Paper Director of North Broken Hill Holdings Ltd, who said that the guidelines were only the first step. He said that the company would need to consult with the State Government, reassess the potential markets and evaluate the potential sites. He said that it would be at least 18 months before the company would be in a position to announce a firm proposal for a project. What Mr Paisley is saying is that it was an inadequate proposal 12 months or so ago, because he is now conceding that at the very least there would have to be a reassessment of the site because the guidelines were not adequate. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess it is quite easy to understand why the Opposition is so agitated, as Senator Puplick was today. It is not in the best interests of the Opposition to have a debate on this sort of proposal because its only hope of getting elected is to find some differences of opinion within the Government on these sorts of proposals. The Opposition has no policies, so the only way it will win government is to find differences in the views of members of this Government, particularly the Cabinet. I would have thought that the Opposition would have been quite devastated by the statement issued. In the past, Opposition members have tried to make great play of the alleged great differences of opinion on this matter between Senator Button, John Kerin and Senator Richardson. I would have thought Opposition members would have been quite devastated when they saw the statement, and the attached documents, to which all of those Ministers were a party. There are no statements coming from the Government saying that there is any difference of opinion. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us compare that with the Opposition's position on this issue. The Opposition's position is similar to that of the State Government when the matter was before it. If the Opposition were in government it would pander to any State government which wanted, for its own short term expediency, to establish a mill which did not adequately protect the environment. If the Opposition were pressured by big business, away it would go; it would not worry about guidelines or about breaching any that might have been set by a previous government. That is an illustration of the Opposition's policy: it has been made on the run. Yet it chooses to criticise this Government because we have set guidelines. I would be the first to take the position that Senator Richardson took on Tasmania. Ideally there would be absolutely no emissions from any pulp mill. Failing that, we must take every possible precaution and set hard and fast guidelines that people understand so that there is adequate protection. The package includes a Commonwealth contribution of $7.7m to a joint Federal, State and industry research program aimed at: maintaining the capacity to research and monitor the environmental impacts of kraft mills; monitoring international developments in improved kraft technologies and alternative technologies; further reducing pollutants that may have adverse environmental impacts; achieving early reductions in organochlorines by a further 90 per cent; and, in the longer term, development of organochlorine free bleaching methods for eucalypt pulp. While that research into alternative technologies may not entirely satisfy environmentalists, it goes much further than the position we were in when the Tasmanian Government proposed to go ahead and build a mill. There would have been no further research. Believing that the previous Tasmanian Government would have instructed that mill to stop production if there had been some breach of the guidelines is the greatest joke I have ever heard. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industry Commission has been asked to produce two interim reports by 30 April 1990 assessing, firstly, the effects of Government policies on, and the environmental and economic cost benefit of, recycling and, secondly, the market prospects for unbleached chlorine-free paper products and the potential for non-wood feed stocks. Considering that the reports have to be produced by April 1990 and going back to Mr Paisley's statement, it is clear that in the 18-month period there will be ongoing research into the market prospects for unbleached paper and chlorine-free products. We may find in 18 months that there has been a dramatic change. There is no doubt that there is a move throughout the community to using more environmentally friendly products. That means recycled and unbleached paper. It is amazing how attitudes can change. I think there will be a reduction in demand for chlorine bleached paper and much greater use of unbleached and recycled paper. </PARA>
<PARA> Our big problem is that the Opposition is not in a position to come forward with any guidelines. If it were, it would never be able to abide by them and enforce them. The Opposition's problem could not be better summed up than by quoting from Bill Mandle's column in today's Canberra Times. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The people of Australia show great sense in their reluctance to endorse the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA>That would have to be the most ringing endorsement of the common sense of the Australian public. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Liberals have, with rare exceptions-and they ignore the message of these exceptions-fallen into the trap of `me-tooism'. Our environmental policy is better than yours. So it might be: but no Greenie is going to vote for it. </PARA>
<PARA>Those comments express the view that I have put to the Senate-that is, nobody with any concern for the environment in this country could vote for the Opposition because even if it had a set of words which purported to be a policy on the environment, there is no way it could be trusted to enforce that policy. I do not think anything more needs to be said. </PARA>

The fact is that Senator Richardson, the environmentalist par excellence, has been rolled by the development lobby in Cabinet, represented by Mr John Kerin, Senator Button and Senator Walsh, in a battle to reinstate Wesley Vale. Today's Australian Financial Review stated, under the heading `Wesley Vale pulp mill back on track':</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> North Broken Hill-Peko Ltd, the company which proposed the controversial pulp mill at Wesley Vale last year, said yesterday it intends to reactivate its plans for a $1 billion investment in northern Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA>This whole thing was an exercise to get Wesley Vale back on track-to let North Broken Hill and presumably its partner, Noranda Australia Ltd, back into the country to build its environmentally hazardous and technologically completely outdated pulp mill. It would seem that this is in response to the quid pro quo attitude which seems to be prevalent in the Government. Yesterday we had the welcome announcement by the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, that Jervis Bay would be saved from the environmental dangers of moving a naval base there. Apparently, this is considered by the Government as a pay-off to the environmental movement, so we should not complain too much if it allows a pulp mill to go in. </PARA>
<PARA> It is time the Government stopped looking at the environmental battles that we have in this country, and the environmental concerns of people, as some sort of industrial dispute where an ambit claim is made and then people bargain and argue back and forth and come up with a position between the ambit claim and another position. None of the environmental concerns we have are ambit claims. If we were making ambit claims we would say, `No logging whatsoever, anywhere, at any time'. We would say, `No mining, ever, at any time'. We do not say that. We state our environmental concerns. These are not ambit claims; these are absolute limits in themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The guidelines we are discussing today are directly descended from the infamous report of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), which was compiled after a trip to the northern hemisphere. A delegation was sent off to look only at kraft pulp mills with chlorine bleaching. As it was on its way back, a hastily sent message crossed its path which said, `Look at alternatives', but members of the delegation never got it. They looked only at kraft mills-which are chemical mills-and chlorine bleaching. </PARA>
<PARA> Who were the personnel? It was called a CSIRO delegation, but who was on it? There were three members of the CSIRO: Dr Chris Fandry, Dr Bob Johannes and Dr Peter Nelson, but that was the end of the involvement of CSIRO. There was Dr John Hagan, from the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, and Mr Terry O'Brien, from the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. The other three members were Mr John Morgan, who was to have been the head of the Wesley Vale project for North Broken Hill Pty Ltd; Mr Allan Jamieson, who was the process manager for the North Broken Hill Export Pulp Mill Project-the Wesley Vale project; and Mr Michael Hague, who was the technical manager of Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd in Gippsland. Only three of those people were with the CSIRO; the rest of them were from industry or pro-industry government departments. Some CSIRO report!</PARA>
<PARA> As one would expect, the report comes down in favour only of the construction of a kraft mill with chlorine bleaching. At page 45 it makes the peculiar statement that the thermomechanical pulping process (TMP), of which I will speak more later, has been used only on young plantation eucalypts and is not suited for processing mature eucalypts. That is absolute rubbish, and the authors should know better, but is suits their position. The most easily understood objection to this report is the objection I make to the statement that there is no market for unbleached paper. On page 49 the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Universally, however, the study team was advised that there was no likelihood that there would be any move from the existing demand for the high strength, high brightness quality parameters demanded in bleached kraft market pulp. The market for unbleached kraft pulp is small and tending to decrease. </PARA>
<PARA>These experts say that the market is small and tending to decrease, and that there is no recognised market for unbleached eucalypt pulp. What absolute nonsense. I criticised this paper in this chamber and Senator Button got up and repeatedly punched me around the kneecaps. It was obvious that he thought this report would stifle and still environmental criticism. In fact, it brought to the fore the fact that the Government is pushing very hard to allow the partners in Wesley Vale to go ahead. This is shown in the joint press release by Senator John Button, Mr John Kerin and Senator Graham Richardson, dated 12 December 1989. On page 1 it states:</PARA>
<PARA> A feature of the package is a comprehensive set of environmental guidelines that enforce the world's most stringent limits on pollution levels for new bleached eucalypt kraft (BEK) pulp mills. </PARA>
<PARA>These may be the most stringent limits on pollution levels for this kraft mill, but a kraft mill itself utilises old-fashioned technology which is being abandoned everywhere else in the world. No-one builds them anywhere else any more. We are being asked to build them here because they are cheap, and because our Government will allow our environment to suffer to make profits for these northern hemisphere rip-off artists. That is why it is going in. The statement goes on as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Over the last seven months the research team's work involved contact with the leading scientists in their fields from around the world, a thorough search of available literature and an overseas mission to assess the latest technology and procedures used in Sweden, Canada and Finland. </PARA>
<PARA>Is it not amazing that when the delegation went to Scandinavia it did not encounter one of Europe's biggest suppliers of paper, namely, an outfit called Roffs Stralfors, and its new pulp mill-did not even hear about it? Stralfors is very proud of its new pulp mill. I quote from an article in the New Scientist dated 15 April 1989. The CSIRO delegation certainly went to Scandinavia after 15 April 1989. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA> One of Europe's largest suppliers of paper this week launched the world's first ``environmentally friendly'' stationery for computers. Roffs Stralfors, a Swedish paper company, has run trials of the paper on the Swedish market and now plans to exploit the large potential market in Britain. </PARA>
<PARA>It refers to a `large potential market', and the CSIRO and the Government say there is no market at all. The New Scientist says that there is a large potential market. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>This market has been created by growing concern over the use of chlorine as a bleaching agent in the paper industry, and its implication in the release of harmful dioxins into the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Stralfors's new paper, Stralfors Zero, is produced by Holmen, one of Sweden's major paper mills, which uses hydrogen peroxide rather than chlorine as a bleach. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a process which the CSIRO says is not economically possible. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Several large companies in the computing and banking industries have tested the paper, which Stralfors's sales director, Iain Morrison, describes as ``November white''. </PARA>
<PARA> These companies are keen to use the paper as an easy way to adopt a ``green'' image. Such industries use huge amounts of paper in pre-printed form, for example in the continuous listings that make bank statements. </PARA>
<PARA>Holmen's mill, at Hallstavik, north of Stockholm, uses a pulping process called thermomechanical pulping (TMP). </PARA>
<PARA>This is the process that the CSIRO said was simply not economically possible. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> This process relies on steam and brute force to soften the fibres of wood, rather than the traditional chemical pulping process that is still the most popular way of producing paper . . . The main advantage of TMP is that it softens the wood fibres and extracts more lignin, so leaving the pulp whiter than that created by chemical pulping. In order to produce an acceptably ``white'' paper, the mill need use only hydrogen peroxide, a less powerful bleach than chlorine . . . However, mechanical pulping has other advantages. It is less likely to chop the fibres, as happens in chemical pulping, so the resulting paper is stronger. TMP also makes use of all the wood so it needs roughly half as much timber to produce the same weight of paper as chemical pulping. </PARA>
<PARA>This is not a pie in the sky operation that is the invention of a bunch of environmentalists. This is one of the world's largest suppliers of paper with an economically sound process in place producing pulp which the CSIRO did not even mention and did not even know about. Perhaps the CSIRO, and the industry people with it, did not want to know about it. Perhaps the Government does not want to know. The joint statement goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> ``The advice from the CSIRO scientists is that a mill meeting the guidelines will cause no known ecologically detrimental impacts. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what was said about asbestos; about thalidomide; about freon gas, the gas that damages the ozone layer; and about CO2. The statement is merely a justification exercise for what the proponents of Wesley Vale wanted to do. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Environment Minister, Senator Graham Richardson, said that in the longer term there would be an increasing world-wide demand for more environmentally friendly paper products. </PARA>
<PARA> ``We need to assess the global trends in this market,'' Senator Richardson said. </PARA>
<PARA>He has got it fairly right, but all he needs to do, if he really want to assess the trends, is go 1.5 kilometres from here to the Yarralumla shopping centre, look in the Shop-Rite supermarket and see the unbleached toilet paper on the shelves which is selling far more rapidly than the bleached varieties. People do not want to use toilet paper containing dioxin; they do not want dioxins in their sanitary napkins; they do not want dioxins in the nappies for their kids. People want unbleached products. They will buy them, if we furnish them. We do not have to study the market. We do not have to launch a year-long study. All that Senator Richardson, or anybody else, has to do is to ask a supermarket manager. Perhaps those people just do not go shopping; they leave the shopping to their wives. </PARA>
<PARA> There are alternatives to wood. An Australian company, ANKAL Pty Ltd, is putting in a pulp mill to produce 100,000 tonnes of paper per year from a plant called kenaf. It is an agricultural project. The plant is grown in fields. It produces both long and short fibres. The long fibre pulp could be used for high grade specialty paper, including bond, cigarette and filter paper, and the central material could replace eucalyptus. This operation is a $175m investment, launched by an Australian company. What encouragement did that company get in Australia? None from this Government. Here is a Government which very happily is inviting northern hemisphere people to come here, in the same manner as any Third World country invites investment, ignoring the possibilities of Australian developed processes for making paper from kenaf, ignoring the new technologies, and merely, once again, making us the receptacle for northern hemisphere pollution. The Government stands condemned.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just finished reading the Government's environmental guidelines for bleached eucalyptus kraft pulp mills. It is a very interesting document. I should say at the outset that the guidelines as advertised seem to be quite rigorous. The limits on emissions of organochlorines, measured as absorbable organic halide, are the lowest in the world for this type of mill. I notice that other sources of pollution, such as the solid wastes and gaseous emissions, are also limited to low levels-levels that are low for large scale industry such as world scale pulp mills. I am sure that these proposed levels will be subject to informed and critical scrutiny and I expect some of them to be challenged. For instance, the proposition that sulphurous emissions can be contained within the plant boundaries seems to me to be somewhat optimistic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I find the involvement of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in the monitoring program somewhat reassuring. But with the recent record of parsimony by the Government in funding the CSIRO, I wonder whether sufficient funds will be provided for a proper overview, especially when any deficiency uncovered by monitoring could involve the Federal Government in an unpleasant struggle with a State government and a multinational company, which could result in the closure of a mill perceived to be essential to Australia's economic health. However, the guidelines are currently only numerical statements of principle. The real test of these guidelines will come if and when a world scale eucalyptus pulp mill is built in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Some effects of such a mill could be tested only by actually getting up a large plant and running it. Although there are decades of experience in the use of the kraft process, there is relatively little data on the processing of eucalyptus and even less, for instance, on the effects of pulp mill effluent on marine life in Australian coastal waters. In this cautionary remark, I am merely paraphrasing a statement contained in the CSIRO report released in June this year. Even if a mill is built and operated to the guidelines, it is not the sort of plant that anyone would want to have next door. If a pulp mill is built next door to us, we can be reassured that we are helping to solve Australia's balance of payments problems!</PARA>
<PARA>M] There are many impacts of such a mill that are not considered in   the guidelines although, presumably, they would be addressed in the environmental assessment process. It might be salutary to consider some of these impacts at one of the previously proposed sites for a world scale mill, at Grafton on the north coast of New South Wales. The New South Wales Government proposal to build a large mill at Grafton galvanised a wide cross-section of local organisations and individuals into action to oppose it. Several meetings have been attended by thousands and there is a petition with 13,000 signatures that opposes the mill very strongly. Unfortunately for the locals, both the State and the Federal seats are held by the National Party members, so electoral threats against a Federal Labour government are likely to be ineffective. Equally unfortunately, the State coalition Government seems set on a mill despite the electoral consequences, one of which I believe to be that Mr Ian Causley will lose his seat at the next State election. </PARA>
<PARA> While we are considering electoral matters, I congratulate the Government on the transparent cunning of linking the pulp mill guidelines with a commitment to research the possibilities of paper recycling and unbleached and chlorine-free paper products, as well as non-wood feed stocks. Whether these developments will be of any use if we are knee-deep in bleached kraft paper products and heavily in debt because of a commitment to this process remains to be seen. </PARA>
<PARA> Returning to the Grafton situation, the local industry groups concerned about the mill include fishermen, sawmillers, and apiarists, as well as other groups with an interest in maintaining the character of the region. Note that many of these people are staunch National Party voters. It is possible that the fishermen could be reassured about the effects of organochlorines on the local marine life, although in my opinion it will not be possible to be really convincing because of some of the unknowns in the pollution equation. Organochlorines are not the only components of the emissions that could have an effect on marine species. The sawloggers, however, will not be reassured. A large pulp mill at Grafton would require a massive increase in the cutting of timber for feed stock. This would inevitably reduce the raw material available for sawlogs. The apiarists are concerned that the felling of old-growth forests would ruin their industry. Many of these people are from the south coast-refugees, if you like-who left the south coast because of the woodchipping industry there and have set up their businesses in the Grafton district-only to be chased by more woodchipping. </PARA>
<PARA> The original proposal for the Grafton mill suggested that it would require 1.6 to 1.8 million tonnes of woodchips to feed the mill. The current tonnage cut in this region is only 450,000 tonnes. To suggest that this tonnage could be drawn from the region without grave environmental effects, especially in soil erosion, strains credibility. I do not have time to go into some of the other impacts of a mill at Grafton, but I do wonder what will happen to the existing woodchip quotas if Australian mills go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook, the Federal Minister for Resources, recently promised the Japanese 17 years of supply of woodchips, but the arguments for the local mills always seem to presume that we will be processing the chips that we now export. I cannot imagine that the Japanese will be very pleased at the sudden cessation of their eucalypt woodchip supply when Australian mills come on line. It seems very likely that exports will continue, while there will be great pressure to cut even more forests to supply the local mills. This raises the question of exactly when local mills will come on line after the necessary processes of long-term environmental monitoring. It seems to me that, if we commit to the kraft technology at this stage and begin the process of setting up large mills, they will come on line just at the time when the rest of the world is turning to some of the new and cleaner technologies now in the laboratory. Whatever happens, the need for the development of plantations to supply pulpwood is more urgent than ever. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Federal Government's pulp mill guidelines are famous within the conservation movement for their failure to give adequate protection to the environment. Under these guidelines the Government is saying that it is perfectly acceptable for chlorine bleach pulp mills to dump up to 12 tonnes of organochlorine effluent into fragile waterways every day. However, there is considerable scientific evidence from studies of chlorine bleach pulp mills in the United States, Canada and Sweden that the dumped organochlorines poison the local marine environment and lead to dioxins entering the human food chain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These Federal Government guidelines were based on the findings of an overseas delegation which had hopelessly biased terms of reference from the start. Senator Sanders has gone into that in some detail. It is time that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) team was sent on another fact-finding mission to seriously investigate alternative processes, this time accompanied by environmentalists. Only four pages out of the 81-page report that was presented yesterday referred to other available processes, to other feed stocks or to market opportunities for unbleached and recycled paper. It is absolutely ridiculous in the changing environmental global climate that this fact-finding team said that there was no market for unbleached paper products, either in Australia or overseas. Surely it is obvious that this particular team had commercial interests in mind in depriving consumers in Australia of the choice to buy unbleached paper products. It is absolutely true that there is a huge demand for unbleached paper products in this country which continues to outstrip ability for supply. Research with either of the major supermarket chains in Australia will give testimony to that. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday Senator Button claimed in his press release that the chlorine bleach method is the only pulping process that will attract serious commercial interest in Australia. I believe that this is a totally untested assumption, which is contradicted by that enormous consumer demand. It is time that the Government got into line with public opinion, which, I believe, will not accept kraft-chlorine bleached pulp mills under any circumstances. This is mainly because during the chlorination process chlorine and wood pulp combine to form hazardous chemicals called organochlorines. Two groups of organochlorines, dioxins and furans, are particularly harmful. The dioxin 2,3,7,8-TCDD is reportedly the most toxic synthetic substance ever made. To date, no safe level has been found for this dioxin. </PARA>
<PARA> Organochlorines are artificially produced substances which persist for long periods in the natural environment. Their affinity for organic compounds which occur in living things allows them to accumulate readily in plants and animals. It follows that animals at the top of the food chain, including humans, will accumulate the largest amounts. It is not surprising then that organochlorines, such as dioxins and furans, are common in human fat tissues and breast milk. Effects on humans include changes to the immune system, birth defects, interference with reproductive processes and organ damage. These substances are also know as carcinogens. </PARA>
<PARA> The study of the effects of chemicals on human health is in its infancy. The full effects may not be apparent for decades. Indeed, many health problems related to organochlorine contamination may not show up for generations. The document very interestingly titled `Pulp and Paper Industry Package', which was produced yesterday, is very definitely leaning towards the side of the industry that wants to produce these kraft-chlorine bleach mills. It mentioned one slightly good effect, which was that there will be a three-year base line study. At least that is some improvement on the draft guidelines which were so justly condemned by the environment movement. It is also commendable that the Industry Commission is going to be looking at the question of recycling and at the unbleached paper market as well. I look forward to its report next April. It is certainly important that we have that kind of information because the Government so far has shown a tendency only to look at one particular side of this question. </PARA>
<PARA> Industry and governments seem absolutely determined to build the kraft-chlorine bleached paper mills in Australia. As a result, we would have high export quality paper which will bring substantial economic returns, but largely undefinable environmental problems. Therefore, we must weigh up the short term economic benefits with the potential long term environmental problems which industries can cause, some of which may be irreparable. The depletion of our forests, increased soil erosion, the pollution of our rivers and seas by hazardous chemicals, and the human health risk posed by the incorporation of these chemicals in the human food chain are all part of the cost that we may have to live with if this type of paper mill is introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The community has shown itself to be willing and eager to listen to and to participate in constructive proposals on environmental conservation. The Australian Government so far has not kept abreast with the community in the matter of paper production. The environment movement is not saying that we should have no pulp mills in Australia. Of course we realise that we must, but we also understand very clearly that we must look at alternatives to this potentially extraordinary damaging kraft-chlorine bleached method. The Government should be capitalising on the changes that are alive in the community. It should not leave itself so out of touch with community aspirations; it must change its way of thinking. Australians do not need eucalyptus kraft-chlorine pulp and paper mills in Australia, but generally the community will support more environmentally friendly methods of paper production. We must exert our right to a clean environment for ourselves and future generations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>Initially the Committee on Finance and Public Administration hoped to report on this reference as part of a general report on the timeliness and quality of annual reports presented on 27 June 1989. However, the inquiry produced claims to which it was necessary to allow various parties to respond. This led to prolonged exchanges of correspondence and a public hearing. I believe that this report should be read in the context of the difficult times experienced by the Aboriginal Development Commission in recent years. It is a matter of record that 1987-88 and 1988-89 were turbulent years for the ADC. During 1987-88 the Government developed its proposals for an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders Commission (ATSIC). In May 1988, the Minister terminated the appointment of all but two of the commissioners then serving and appointed replacement commissioners. There were changes in senior positions in the ADC. In addition, the ADC was subject to a special audit by the Australian Audit Office and close scrutiny by parliamentary committees. </PARA>
<PARA> The terms of reference for the inquiry were directed at the delay in the tabling of the ADC's 1987-88 annual report, its consistency with annual reporting guidelines and five specific omissions. Further issues arose during the inquiry, including the extent to which the former ADC Chairman, Shirley McPherson, was responsible for defects in the report and the use of the name and signature of the former General Manager, Mick O'Brien. With regard to the terms of reference, the ADC argued that the delay in publication of the report resulted from audit delays and difficulties with its computerised accounting system. The ADC told the Committee that its report was `of good quality and consistent with all guidelines'. We were told that, while one of the specific omissions from the report was an administrative error by the ADC, the others were either matters which were not required to be included in the report or were not included because Shirley McPherson failed to respond to requests that she contribute to the report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee concluded, however, that the main reasons for late tabling, and indeed for other defects in the report, were the low priority accorded to its preparation by the ADC and management deficiencies within the Commission. Audit delays were not a factor in the late tabling and the Australian Audit Office was not responsible for the ADC's failure to meet the reporting deadline. The Committee assessed the report as, at best, barely meeting the statutory authority reporting guidelines. However, it would be fair to note that, to the extent that the report fails to meet the guidelines, it is possible that similar failings would be found in the reports of many agencies if they were subjected to the same detailed scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> There was some confusion as to which guidelines applied to the ADC, and the Committee took the opportunity to repeat two recommendations from its report on the timeliness and quality of annual reports. We recommended that the Government immediately commence development of a handbook of external reporting to consolidate annual reporting requirements and that the Government declare its commitment to the introduction of an annual reports Act in the medium term. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of the omission of the chairman's introduction, we considered that it was ultimately the responsibility of the chairman to provide an introduction. But ADC management had administrative responsibility to arrange for its inclusion and, in its absence, should have ensured some other coverage of significant matters which would have been mentioned in a chairman's introduction. With regard to two other omissions, the Committee concluded that the annual report should have included references to the commissioners who served for most of 1987-88 and that recognition of their contribution would have been an expected courtesy in normal circumstances. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Committee accepts that the omission of reference to Mr Charles Perkins was an administrative error, though a serious one. It was a careless omission resulting from the rush of last minute preparation which would otherwise have been detected by proper supervision and proofreading. </PARA>
<PARA> On the last of the omissions specified in the terms of reference, the Committee concluded that, while there was no specific obligation on the ADC to report its advice to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) on ATSIC, it would not have been unusual for a statutory authority to have done so in the circumstances. A factual statement to the effect that the ADC had given advice to the Minister on alternatives to ATSIC should have been included, but in the circumstances it was sensible to avoid comment on the merits of the proposal. An annual report is intended to present a full picture of the activities of an organisation during the reporting period. Omissions, such as those referred to the Committee in this instance, detract from the overall quality of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of the dispute between the ADC and others who gave evidence to the Committee focused on the question of who was responsible for the report. It became clear that the annual report was prepared by relatively junior staff, sent to the printer without clearance by the acting general manager or any member of the Board and then sent immediately to the Minister for tabling in Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee concluded that responsibility for supervising the detailed preparation of the 1987-88 annual report lay with the ADC management. However, the chairman and the commissioners should have been more active in ensuring that the management of the ADC prepared a draft annual report and submitted it to them for clearance. The report contained a general manager's overview printed over the signature of Mick O'Brien, the former general manager. Concerns arose regarding the propriety of using Mr O'Brien's signature, or indeed his name, in that context, whether the overview faithfully reflected Mr O'Brien's draft and whether the overview should have been prepared by Mr O'Brien at all as he had left the position before most of the report was prepared. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee concluded that the final text of the general manager's overview was very close to Mr O'Brien's draft, and that there was no improper motive behind the minor editorial changes that were made. The use of Mr O'Brien's name and signature in the report without his consent was extremely unwise, if not improper. The Committee believed that the occupant of the position of general manager at the time of report preparation was the relevant person to provide the chief executive's comment, not Mr O'Brien. However, we could understand that a decision to ignore the fact that Mr O'Brien was general manager during the period under report might have been misinterpreted. </PARA>
<PARA> The attitude of the ADC to the inquiry was most disappointing, at least until the acting deputy chair, Lois O'Donoghue, intervened in October. Ms O'Donoghue commissioned two reviews of aspects of the report preparation and promptly provided the results to Committee. This greatly helped to clarify the facts of the matter. The Committee found that, prior to the two reviews, the ADC had persisted in arguing positions which could not be supported by its own records. This was, as I said, most disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank everyone connected with the preparation of this report, and pay tribute to a the efforts of the Committee members and staff which resulted in a unanimous report. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, I would also like to make some comments on the annual report of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). I agree with the Chairman, Senator Coates, particularly when he said that this was a long and drawn out inquiry. That was brought about because there was a great deal of correspondence and toing and froing between the Commission, ourselves and other witnesses. I remind the Senate that the inquiry into this annual report followed an inquiry that the Finance and Public Administration Committee carried out into the timeliness and quality of annual reports. This report was a pretty fair example of an annual report that did not comply with too many aspects of the recommendations that we made or the recommendations of another report that was brought down by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts about the quality and timeliness of annual reports. If we took the recommendations from both committees, it would be fair to say that the 1987-88 annual report of the Aboriginal Development Commission was sadly lacking in most aspects of good annual reporting. It certainly did not meet the guidelines because it was inaccurate, incomplete and late.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the course of the inquiry I was disappointed to see that officers of the ADC tried to shift blame for the inadequacies of the report to other people and for other reasons. For example, one reason used for the lateness of the report was that its delay was caused by the Australian Audit Office when evidence given to us suggested that that was not the case. During evidence officers tried to blame the former chairman of the ADC for the quality and lateness of the report, because she purportedly was supposed to be totally responsible for providing the annual report when evidence did show that it was the responsibility of the general manager or the acting general manager and that the operational responsibility fell on the manager of public relations. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point that as a result of our inquiries-the Chairman referred to this in his tabling statement-what really did help us was the initiative of the chairperson designate of the Aboriginal Development Commission, Lois O'Donoghue, instructing investigations into two important matters that surfaced during our inquiries. The first matter-this was referred to by the Chairman-was the purported forging of a signature of the general manager's overview which was reported upon by an officer from the office of the Australian Government Solicitor. I think the Chairman has already stated that the review that this officer carried out did clear the person involved, but it certainly did not help the report. The other inquiry was conducted internally on the evaluation of the report. This inquiry certainly confirmed the concerns of members of the Committee. Some of those concerns were that work on the report did not effectively start until the Chairman sought a draft copy in November 1988. It also came to our notice that there was very little evidence that preparation of the report was pursued in a cohesive, planned and purposeful manner after that date. As I said previously, it was proved to us beyond doubt that in overall terms the general manager was responsible for the production of the report. It was also brought to our attention that the Chairman had directed that the report not be cleared until it was finalised with the commissioners. That was not done. It was also proved to us that the operational responsibility lay with the manager of public relations during part of the compilation of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Chairman summed up the matter when he quoted from one of the Committee's findings. It became clear to us that the people responsible certainly did not give the report the appropriate level of priority that they should have done and did not give it as much attention as they should have done. There were several specific procedural defects in the arrangements for the preparation of the report. Paragraph 98 of our report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Aboriginal Development Commission Annual Report 1987-88 fell short of meeting the ADC's accountability obligation to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>As the Chairman has said, it was well known at the time that the ADC had severe internal problems. I think that is really understating the situation. `Internal feuding' I think was another phrase that was used. Quite frankly, even allowing for that, it certainly was not any excuse for this inadequate report. However, as the Chairman said, we investigated this report in a very searching manner. If the same effort went into some of the other reports that come to this Parliament, perhaps we could make the same complaints. That does not get away from the fact that this was a very poor report. It certainly did not measure up to most guidelines that we would see as necessary for good annual reporting. One of the recommendations of the Committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that the Government immediately commence development of a handbook of external reporting to consolidate annual reporting requirements. The Committee further recommends that the Government declare its commitment to the introduction of an annual reports act in the medium term. </PARA>
<PARA>I know that my colleague Senator Hamer also has a notice of motion before the Senate to strengthen the power of the Parliament to ensure that annual reporting becomes a more important issue as far as this Parliament is concerned and as far as the requirements that should go into good annual reporting are concerned. This exercise was well worth doing. It has been a case study of the types of things we have been looking at in our previous inquiries into annual reporting. I know from what we have been told already that the report for this year is well in hand. The ADC seems to be complying and putting its best foot forward in this case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also will address the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on the annual report of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) which has just been tabled. Unfortunately, I have to do so without having seen a copy of the report as it is not available to the chamber at this time even though it has been tabled. Therefore, I must rely on the comments that have been made by the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Coates, and Senator Calvert. The comments they have made compound some of the issues and problems that I believe arose at the very time we called for the inquiry to be conducted. In fact, on 1 June this year I moved a motion in this place to set up this reference. I would like to refresh the Senate's memory of the issues that we asked the Committee to address. The motion stated that the issues were:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) the timeliness and the quality of the report;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) its consistency with guidelines for the preparation of departmental and/or statutory authority annual reports;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the omission of a Chairman's introduction or comment of the kind that has appeared in previous years;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the omission of any reference to Commissioners holding office from the period 1 July 1987 until their removal from office by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the omission of any recognition of the significant contribution of the Commissioners referred to in paragraph (d);</PARA>
<PARA> (f) the omission of any reference to Mr Charles Perkins who was a Commissioner at 30 June 1988; and</PARA>
<PARA> (g) the omission of any reference to ADC proposals for an alternative to ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA>I think I picked up from the remarks made by Senator Coates and Senator Calvert that most of those issues have been addressed. I look forward to reading the report, which has just now been handed to me. I will be looking for recommendations across all of those terms of references because they are very important. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that there was a civil war in the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio throughout 1988 that was caused largely by the actions of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand. The Aboriginal Development Commission was subjected to tremendous pressure and problems because in May 1988 the Minister sacked eight commissioners of the ADC and replaced them with a new group of appointments who were there particularly to do his bidding and to carry out a lot of his work. I am well aware that a number of those commissioners have since done a very satisfactory job and I pay credit to the present Chairman of the ADC, Mrs Lois O'Donoghue, who stepped into a very difficult task. She is performing particularly well. There are a number of other commissioners who, I am sure, have accepted their responsibility. But when I called for this inquiry in June I was aware that a number of other commissioners had different objectives. Both Senator Coates and Senator Calvert have commented that the Committee ascertained that the quality of the report was of a poor standard. I think that was the phrase used by one honourable senator. They also commented that consideration of issues such as the Chairman's introduction, the use of the Mr O'Brien's signature under questionable circumstances, the omission of any reference to the Commissioners who had served for some 10 1/2 months of the financial year under report, and the fact that the report omitted any reference to the activities of the ADC with regard to alternatives for and consideration of the Government's proposal for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) demanded much of the Committee's time and they required close attention. </PARA>
<PARA> In perusing this report I note that it extends to some 34 pages. It therefore must have considerably taxed the Committee. Each of the terms of reference will demand our particular attention. The Senate Estimates Committee E has continued to conduct a very careful scrutiny of the financial overview of the Aboriginal Development Commission, and honourable senators will recall that the report of Estimates Committee E made some very trenchant remarks with regard to the ADC, the commissioners, the management and the staff, particularly with regard to the future proposals for the creation of ATSIC. It is a pity that since July 1987 the Minister has not exercised the appropriate control and involvement that we normally expect of a Minister of the Crown in such an important area. That there have been so many inquiries-commissioned by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), by the Government, by the departments or by this Parliament-that have all insisted on major areas of further recommendation is an indictment of the conduct of this portfolio by Mr Hand. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like Senator Tambling I have only just received a copy of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on the annual report of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC), so it will be very difficult to offer many comments on the report in the few seconds I have had to peruse it. I have noted with considerable interest the statements made by the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Coates, and by my colleague Senator Calvert. I shared the concerns of Senator Tambling and others earlier this year when the ADC report for 1987-88 came to the attention of the Parliament. I fully concurred with the proposal which followed to refer the matter to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration for examination. The report that has been produced obviously is an endorsement of the Senate's making that referral in June this year. I congratulate Senator Tambling for initiating that work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This report will be debated on other occasions, I guess. One of the problems that we have always had with organisations, both departments and statutory bodies, reporting to Parliament is the adequacy of their reporting. As Senator Calvert said in his remarks, the whole question of annual reporting to Parliament is a very important issue because it is frequently the only opportunity that the public, through the Parliament, has of coming to grips with the activities and operations of the huge number of government departments and statutory bodies that go to make up the public sector. It is those organisations and bodies that are responsible for the expenditure now of almost $100 billion a year of taxpayers' funds. So the whole question of annual reporting is very important, as is the consistency of reporting. Guidelines have been established for departments and statutory authorities to follow in their reporting, and I note that that aspect is covered on pages 21 through to 25 of the report. Just glancing quickly at those pages, I note that the Finance and Public Administration Committee used the less rigorous of the two sets of guidelines to judge the 1987-88 annual report of the ADC. The less rigorous set of guidelines was laid down in 1982 and applies to statutory authorities. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The statutory authority guidelines are not legally binding but are stated to be the policy of successive governments since 1982. </PARA>
<PARA>The more rigorous guidelines are those currently applying to the reporting of departments. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The current annual reporting guidelines for departments were adopted in 1987 and are legally binding on departments through the effect of section 25 of the Public Service Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee, having judged the ADC annual report against the less rigorous of the guidelines, namely, the 1982 statutory authority guidelines, found the report wanting in several important respects. It found the report wanting in areas in which one would not reasonably have expected that there would be deficiencies. It also found that the lack of meeting the guidelines adequately led to a very serious problem in judging the operations and work of the Commission. One area in which the Commission could have been expected to get it right but in which it was deficient was with respect to the membership and staff guideline which, according to the Finance and Public Administration Committee, was breached. This was one of the things that drew the report to the attention of the Senate. On page 23 of the report, which deals with membership and staff, the Committee states:</PARA>
<PARA> The report . . . did not list 8 former Commissioners who had held office until May 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>This report recovers the financial year 1987-88. On any reasonable view of the matter, one would have to say that it was a deliberate deficiency that those names were omitted. That is a very serious matter because it obviously smacks of bringing politics into the preparation of the report. </PARA>

It is a major fault and my own view is that political motivations obviously were behind it. Given the fact that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) had sacked those eight Commissioners in May 1988, he wanted their names somehow or other expunged from the record so they did not appear even in the annual report for that year.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I briefly comment also on the Finance and Public Administration Committee's statement in relation to the problems with the ADC's annual report in the area of activities and reports. The Committee's report states:</PARA>
<PARA> A description of the principal activities was provided. A number of programs and related activities were noted. Overall, a large amount of useful information was provided but the lack of a strategy or overview section discussing the broad direction, purpose and rationale for the programs made it difficult to assess the quality of reporting on programs and activities. </PARA>
<PARA>That deficiency, which is pointed out in the report, makes analysis and examination of the ADC as a whole an extraordinarily difficult and impossible task to do adequately. An annual report ought to enable the Parliament to make such an examination. Therefore, that finding of the Committee is a very serious one. I am sure that many other points are relevant to the Senate in this important report of the Finance and Public Administration Committee. I am interested to note that the report was a unanimous one. It deals with a very important subject, one that has been debated here at length over the last 12 or 18 months. I am sure there will be more debate on it in the future. I am pleased that the report has been produced and I expect and hope that the Senate will return to further consideration of this matter at an appropriate time. </PARA>

I want to make particular note that Senator Tambling did not repeat the allegation that he made some months ago about ministerial interference in the preparation of this report. In view of his continued gratuitous criticism of Mr Hand in the comments that he made, I should make particular note that the report specifically emphasises that there was no evidence even suggestive of ministerial involvement in the reporting process, other than the proper exchanges of correspondence relating to tabling dates. As was indicated by the comments I made on the report as a whole, the evidence suggested strongly to the Committee that the omissions and deficiencies resulted from the acts and omissions of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) and its officers. It is important, especially in view of the suggestion about political considerations that Senator Short made, which could be interpreted as meaning ministerial interference, to make it clear that the report does not substantiate any such suggestion.

<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry into the organisation and operations of the Federal Airports Corporation and the Civil Aviation Authority showed that as two relatively newly created authorities, they are both still in the process of developing and reviewing their structures and functions. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence the Committee received also demonstrated that in the aviation industry there are sectors, particularly the General Aviation sector, which disagree with certain policies and operations of the authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Two aspects of both FAC and CAA operations which the aviation industry finds unpalatable are the level of charges imposed and the perceived lack of consultation with the industry before new charges are introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> During the conduct of the inquiry the Committee referred to the FAC and the CAA the matters of concern to the industry and in response both authorities acknowledged that there were still operational problems to be resolved with their clients. However, the Committee was assured by both that these matters are under review and the task of finding solutions is being given a high priority. This report deals with the various aspects of FAC and CAA operations which require attention and resolution and the Committee, accordingly, has drawn conclusions and made recommendations on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> It is evident that both authorities have organisational and operational problems to overcome and it is vital for them to improve their relations with the aviation industry. Until this is achieved progress and growth in the aviation field will be hampered. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that a healthy aviation industry is vital to this country's social, economic and strategic needs. The FAC and the CAA have prominent roles to ensure the viability of the industry. To fulfil their obligations they must establish sound working relationships with the industry based on mutually acceptable policies and procedures. These policies and procedures must be fair and justifiable and must be evolved through open and full consultations with all their clients. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has just had tabled the report entitled The Organisation and Operations of the Federal Airport Corporation and Civil Aviation Authority, which report is a result of an inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. I was the person in the Senate who moved the motion to set up this inquiry. I was seconded to the Committee, along with several of my colleagues, to increase its size for the duration of the inquiry, and I thank the Senate for the courtesy it showed me in having me as a member of the Committee on a temporary basis. I also thank my colleagues for the help and courtesy they showed me while I was on that Committee. It is rather strange that, as a guest member, I was the only person to make a dissenting report as part of the main report, and I wish to speak to that later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason that I moved quite a long while ago that we look at the organisation and operations of the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) was my knowledge of the great concern in the Australian aviation industry at the way these two bodies were going about their tasks. The Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation are two new creations, relatively speaking, within the last three years of the present Labor Government. The aviation regulatory system in this country has been allowed to run down very much in the seven years that the Australian Labor Party has been in power. Very little money has been devoted to, ploughed back into, the industry and very little of that money has gone on maintaining the infrastructure-navigational aids and the rest of it-on which aircraft depend for accurate and safe navigation around the country. </PARA>
<PARA> The fundamental problem is that the Labor Party simply does not have any policy on aviation. It is not interested in aviation and just did not want to know what was going on. In the face of mounting criticisms, it decided to sidestep the issue by setting up the Federal Airports Corporation and the Civil Aviation Authority as statutory bodies, allegedly free of political interference, although in reality, of course, the Minister for Transport and Communications can direct and guide the bodies in what they do. It was most important, of course, to get aviation off budget, and that is really the key to what the Government set out to do. The Treasurer, Mr Keating, with his usual accounting sleight of hand, thought that this was a way of avoiding some costs and transferring costs from the Budget to the general community. That was the real reason behind it. </PARA>
<PARA> But a change was made to the pre-existing aviation section of the old Department of Transport and Communications, a body that was in very poor shape. Starting in the Whitlam years, back in the 1972 era, the old Department of Civil Aviation, which was a very good professional body with a very high professional esprit de corps and a very good standing around the world as a regulatory authority in the aviation field, was merged with what became the Department of Transport. Later on it again became the Department of Aviation, then it went back to being the Department of Transport, and ultimately it became the Department of Transport and Communications. There have been five changes of title since the Whitlam years. This had an absolutely devastating effect on morale in the old Department of Aviation because people did not know for whom they were working. They would come to work one day and find a different sign over the top of the door, and it just went on and on. The morale of the body just ran down. </PARA>
<PARA> In setting up the FAC and the CAA, which are statutory authorities, the Government said to them, `You will be self-funding', and the way they discharged that self-funding capacity was by using the user pays doctrine. One of the great mythologies in Australia is that aviation is a very select pursuit followed by a few very rich individuals. Nothing could be further from the truth, because aviation is an integral part of Australian society. Quite enormous indirect benefits flow to everyone through an efficient and effective aviation service. One has only to look at the hundreds of thousands of people who lost their jobs as a consequence of the pilots dispute, and the billions of dollars that the Australian economy has lost as a consequence of the pilots dispute, to recognise the very great importance of aviation to Australia and its indirect effect on the food suppliers, the moteliers, the people building motels, the transport industry on the ground and many others. Aviation alone in Australia as a section or sector of the economic pie has been carved out and subjected to this user pays doctrine. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not do that with other forms of transport. We very heavily subsidise road transport. In this city of Canberra, the last time I looked at the reports for the Australian Capital Territory in the Estimates committee, I believe that buses were losing-and this would go back five or six years-$15m or $16m a year, and the buses have a straight subsidy from the taxpayer. What the railways lose in Australia runs into hundreds of millions of dollars a year, and no-one worries about that. We subsidise health care through Medicare and through the hospital service. We subsidise education, despite the fact that some tertiary students pay fees. Of course, social services are a straight subsidy. Almost everything in Australia gets some degree of support, but the poor old aviation industry does not get a cent, and I think that we can see that most clearly with respect to education. Pilot training, which is enormously expensive, has to be done out of an individual's own pocket. It gets no support from the tertiary sector at all under the education programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Whenever the aviation industry questions increased charges being put on it, the industry is told that it enjoys a massive subsidy from the taxpayer-and nothing could be further from the truth. Just to give one example, honourable senators would be aware that aircraft use relatively huge amounts of fuel. Avgas-aviation gasoline as opposed to avtur-has a high excise component, all of which goes into Consolidated Revenue, and there is no compensation for that under the user pays doctrine. The user pays doctrine really is not a user pays doctrine at all. We have two monopoly services in the form of the FAC and the CAA, and they are providing services which are not cost efficient. In fact, they are quite dictatorial and rapacious in their charges. If we have a user pays service in place, the user should say what he or she wants and be prepared to pay for that. But the inverse situation applies with the CAA and the FAC. They decide what the user needs and then charge for a very inefficient delivery of a service-and one really has no choice because the CAA is a monopoly. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to spend a moment looking at the Federal Airports Corporation before I turn to the Civil Aviation Authority. The Federal Airports Corporation started off very badly because it was saddled with an enormous debt. The Government transferred to the FAC the assets for about 17 airfields originally-now up to about 23-at grossly inflated prices and said, `That is what you are starting with. You have to earn a return on it'. That was a very dishonest move. It was dishonest because those airfields were paid for by the Australian taxpayer and, furthermore, having been paid for, have been depreciated over the years. If they were to be transferred to the FAC the correct accounting procedure was for them to be transferred at the depreciated value. Had that been done, it would probably have been done at $200m, $300m or $400m, not the figure in excess of $1.2 billion that the FAC picked up to start with. So the FAC had this very large debt, or asset capitalisation, to start off its operation. </PARA>
<PARA> The second difficulty the FAC faced was that hardly anyone in it has any knowledge of how the aviation world in Australia operates commercially. That is not to say that there are not people on the Board of the FAC who have good commercial backgrounds. Some of them have, but they have very limited experience at a personal level of how the aviation industry goes about earning its living and paying its bills. </PARA>
<PARA> The third problem for the FAC was that the Board decided that every one of its airfields would be individually profitable. Given the commercial facts of life, that was not possible at all. Some airfields never can be profitable. They just do not have the traffic through them and they will never generate the funds in the fullness of time. Other airfields, such as the primary airports in the capital cities-Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane-do have the potential to make a profit. As I will argue later, they should cross-subsidise the less financially successful fields because the less successful fields have a very important place in the overall scheme of the provision of airports in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The FAC set about raising money by putting charges on everything. It has gone to really absurd lengths. The most absurd example I have ever heard was of an electronics technician on one of the airfields in this country who operates from his home, who has his office and workshop there, who drives onto the airfield with a van on occasions and who probably spends about four hours a week in total time on the airfield. When he is on the airfield he is working in hangars, the lessees of which pay rent to the FAC. Yet he got billed a very high amount to get a certificate to be a supplier to the airport. That is absolutely absurd. </PARA>
<PARA> The most contentious thing that the FAC has done is to introduce the general aviation infrastructure tariff (GAIT), which is probably illegal and which is yet to be challenged in the court, but I do not intend to waste the time of the Senate debating the legality of that. Basically what the GAIT scheme did was to put a tax, according to the weight of the aircraft, on users of FAC airports on a daily, weekly, monthly or annual basis. That is very difficult to police. It is manpower intensive and cost intensive to police. It is also very inaccurate. It is grossly unfair because one can have aircraft owners or operators who lease hangars from the FAC on an airfield and who are paying a very high rental for that hangar. Their aircraft might not be used-they are locked up in the hangar-yet they have to pay the same fee for being on the airfield as if they were flying continually and using the runways, the taxiways and all the other services that the airfield supplies. </PARA>
<PARA> The GAIT scheme has been a failure. When the FAC went to the industry and tried to debate it, all the meetings they had around Australia-and they had a series of meetings; there must have been more than six or eight of them-rejected the idea. All the users, or the people who would be affected by the GAIT scheme, told the FAC that they would not accept that system. All the FAC did was to halve the figure it had been talking about originally, and then it went ahead and imposed it. At present, the great majority of people who pay GAIT are those operators who are fixed on the fields in the commercial world, doing things such as running flying training schools or charter operators where they are in the public eye and cannot avoid it. The great majority of the users of the airfields, the business community, people flying themselves around the place in small company aircraft, simply will not pay. The whole problem is that it is unenforceable. It is a nonsense from an administrative point of view. But that does not avoid the problem that somewhere or other the FAC has to get some money to run its operations. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that, instead of looking at every airport on an individual basis, the FAC should look at the whole lot. If it is not prepared to look at the whole lot-and I said this in my dissenting report-it should at least look at capital city aggregations. In the capital cities there are both primary airports and secondary airports. The throughput through the secondary airports simply cannot generate the base to be profitable in the forseeable future. The primary airports can because they have tens or hundreds of thousands of fare-paying passengers going through them all the time with the airlines and it is quite possible to put a small tax on each person to generate enough money to supply enough profit to cover both the primary and the secondary airports. </PARA>
<PARA> The secondary airports are important in the system. They are places where a lot of the charter and supplementary airline operators can operate into and take the pressure off the primary airports. We all know the confusion and overuse that occur in Sydney at present. The secondary airports are the places where flying training takes place. The great bulk of Australian flying training takes place at the secondary airports, as do a whole lot of other things. They perform a very essential function. If the fees for using those airports escalate in the way they have under the Federal Airports Corporation, people will just go away from them. A vicious circle will be set up and we will not be able to maintain secondary airports at all. There will be a whole heap of problems downstream as a result of the loss of those airports. Not the least will be the proliferation of small private airfields with the difficulties of enforcing standards on them and, more importantly in this environment-conscious age, the noise pollution and things like that which would result from a multitude of small private fields scattered around the capital cities' perimeters. </PARA>
<PARA> My proposition is that the Federal Airports Corporation should be combined with the CAA. We have two authorities now which provide complementary services to the aviation industry. They are not discrete, independent services. The fact that we have two of them leads to a huge explosion in costs. Both bodies have boards. Both bodies have senior executives or a management stream in place. Both of them have major headquarters. When one gets to the airfield side of it, one finds that the CAA has an office structure and the FAC has an office structure. If one goes to Bankstown today and drives into the main part of the field, one will see the great big structure that is being built by the CAA. The FAC and CAA will share nothing. There is dual involvement in capital equipment, in buildings, in plants, in typewriters and in everything else. All of this leads to a great deal of waste through duplication. It is all unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, there is a lot of bad feeling between the two bodies. In my judgment, that bad feeling stems principally from their different salary structures. The Civil Aviation Authority, although it is a statutory authority, is still confined to Public Service pay scales and promotion procedures. The FAC, allegedly, is on a free commercial basis: it can pay its employees whatever it likes. The Civil Aviation Authority's traffic controllers, airworthiness surveyors, examiners of airmen and all the rest of the people who move around the airfields naturally feel disadvantaged when they see FAC employees driving around in new, air-conditioned cars doing the sort of work that a parking attendant would do, a traffic attendant in a city, seeing whether aeroplanes are paying their GAIT charges and things like that and being paid a great deal more for doing a job that carries a lot less responsibility than the CAA has. </PARA>
<PARA> The long term solution to the problem with the FAC is not only that it should be combined with the CAA, in my judgment, but also that it should go out of business. The best and most successful airfield in Australia today is Cairns Airport, which is run by a local group, the Cairns Harbour Trust. It is the most progressive and modern airfield in this country and by far and away the most efficient. I believe that all the primary airports in the capital cities of Australia should be run by corporations drawn from a local community and answerable to them. If that happens, then we will get a modern, efficient airport service in this country with airports competing, particularly for international traffic to come in, as gateways to this country. The whole of the Australian community will benefit from that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Civil Aviation Authority is a much bigger body than the Federal Airports Corporation and it has much more onerous responsibilities. The sad thing about it is that it is very badly run down at the moment. It has lost direction and lost a huge number of its experienced staff, particularly on the piloting side-examiners of airmen and airways surveyors-and, on the engineering side, engineering surveyors. These sorts of people are the heart and soul of what the CAA is about. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Australian Aviation industry is vastly over-regulated. Last week Mr Dick Smith appeared before another committee I was on. He said that Australia has one of the most outdated, illogical and incomprehensible regulatory systems in the world. He is a board member of the CAA. I agree entirely with his views on that matter, as anyone who has listened to my speeches over the years on aviation regulation in this country would be aware. I do not agree with Mr Smith's views on safety, but that is another matter. We are vastly over-regulated. The consequence is that the Australian community must bear some very high costs. There is hope in the future. The CAA has initiated some inquiries such as that into the legal framework for air safety regulations. If the findings of that committee are implemented, they will do a great deal to streamline and modernise the regulatory system with respect to safety in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems with the Civil Aviation Authority is that it tries to do everything. To give one example, it grants approvals for modifications which require a degree of engineering expertise. If someone wants to change an aeroplane and the manufacturer does not have an approved modification for it, approval has to be sought from the Civil Aviation Authority. That involves a very tedious and high cost program, because the CAA charges very highly for its services. I believe strongly that the Civil Aviation Authority should not be in the field of trying to work within the aviation industry. Those sorts of things should be done by consultants or specialised people within the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Civil Aviation Authority should only do two things. It should set standards like safety standards, airfield standards and so on, and should see that those standards are applied. The Authority should audit the industry. It should delegate powers to commercial interests in the aviation industry to perform the functions that need to be performed to guarantee the standards that are laid down by the Civil Aviation Authority. It should have enough staff to run an effective audit system on the whole industry to see that maintenance is carried out as per the laid down standards, that air traffic control procedures are followed and that other necessary things are done. They are the only two fields the Authority should be in. It should leave everything else to the industry, with the sole proviso that it should set up realistic and attainable access paths so that other people can come in and do the things that need to be done in the industry. At the moment the CAA is trying to do everything and some enormous costs are involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give the Senate an example of a case that has recently been brought to my attention by one of my constituents. He has three children, all of them pilots. One son had a student pilot's licence. He learned to fly, passed all his exams and flying tests and was entitled to get a restricted private pilot's licence. The only barrier to him getting that licence was his age. On his birthday, as he was entitled to do, he went into the CAA office-it happened to be on a Friday afternoon-presented all his documentation, paid his $20 fee and said, `Will you issue me with my restricted pilot's licence?'. The clerk behind the counter said, `Yes, we will do that but there are 14 people ahead of you and you will have to wait two or three weeks'. This is absolute nonsense. This is a fee for service matter. The boy's father happens to be a pharmacist who gets paid $4.50 by this Government to dispense a prescription yet the boy could not get a rubber stamp-which is all that is required-on his pilot's licence to transfer from a student licence to a restricted licence. This is the sort of thing people meet all the way along the line. They are being charged very high fees but must wait a very long while for indifferent service. </PARA>
<PARA> My constituent, the boy's father, wanted to transfer one of his aircraft from one company to another. He had to pay a fee of $80, which again is just a matter of money for old rope because the form is filled in, submitted to the Department with a cheque for $80 and the Department just transfers the name from one company to another. That sort of business could be done even by professional accountants for a fee of about one-third of the amount charged by the CAA. So it goes on. There is no commercial reality in what the Civil Aviation Authority is doing. It is involved in so many fields that it is dissipating its efforts and creating a bad climate between itself and its customers. The constituent I have just mentioned would have over $1m tied up in aircraft in Australia for his own personal use. He has three children who all fly. He flies a lot. The Civil Aviation Authority is saying that it is a commercial authority. If that is true, it should look after its customers. But here is one customer who has been given the run-around. </PARA>
<PARA> But the biggest problem the Civil Aviation Authority is facing at the moment is the loss of specialised staff. For example, it has only 12 examiners of airmen for regular public transport out of an establishment of 21. This gets back to the point that I made earlier about paying Public Service salaries. The CAA has never paid the salaries it needs to pay to attract and retain examiners of airmen, who are pilots by profession. Because the CAA has paid them so little, the most common applications for positions in these postings are pilots who have retired from the Royal Australian Air Force, who, with their service pension, can afford to accept a lower income than they would get in other appointments. That shortage of pilots is now quite acute. The answer to the problem is for the Civil Aviation Authority to be able to be free of the restraint of the Public Service salary scales and to be able to pay engineers and pilots what the market demands. </PARA>
<PARA> The Civil Aviation Authority also needs to get into its senior management ranks people who are involved in the aviation industry as pilots. I have never before known a time in my life when fewer people with personal experience in the aviation industry are employed in the upper echelons of the civil aviation department. Sir Richard Williams, who was one of the first directors of the department, would turn in his grave if he saw the bureaucrats who now infest the highest ranks of the Civil Aviation Authority and saw their lack of personal experience in an area that requires a high degree of personal involvement to understand and regulate properly. </PARA>
<PARA> We will always need a Civil Aviation Authority. I do not believe we will always need a Federal Airports Corporation, but we need a CAA to define standards and maintain them through an adequate audit program. The report before the Senate today is very comprehensive and shows the problems being faced by the two authorities. We received something like 122 written submissions. While I did not count them, well over 100 of those would have been highly critical of the two statutory authorities which were the subject of the inquiry. That speaks for itself. I commend the report to the Senate and to the general public because it gives people an insight into how the two authorities operate and it makes some suggestions as to how problems can be alleviated in the future. Australia must have an efficient transport industry. Within that efficient transport industry the place of an efficient aviation industry is absolutely paramount. One cannot have an efficient aviation industry unless regulatory bodies such as the Federal Airports Corporation and Civil Aviation Authority are running at a much higher level of efficiency than they are at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the Senate is dealing with a package of six Customs Bills: the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping) Bill 1989, the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1989, the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1989, the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1989, the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, and the Bounty (Photographic Film) Bill 1989. The final Bill, the Bounty (Photographic Film) Amendment Bill, will be dealt with by my colleague Senator Lewis later in the debate. There is a longstanding view that customs Bills are always run through in the dying hours of a session so that no one can get a chance to examine them.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I see the Whip confirming that. I can assure the Whip that, as shadow Minister for customs, I have examined all these Bills in considerable detail and I certainly have a view on all of them. The first point to be made about these Bills is that they continue the practice of this Government of legislation by press release-a practice that this Government has made into an art form. A press release is put out indicating a change and months or even a year later the legislation is introduced. The consequence is that the Parliament becomes just a rubber stamp. Also of concern to me-and these comments relate to much of the customs legislation-are these three things: first, the amount of discretion given to the Comptroller-General by the Government; secondly, the difficulty associated with working under customs legislation because of the complicated nature of the definitions involved; and, finally, the ever-increasing amount of litigation being caused by poor drafting and ineffective definition. On the matter of poor drafting, I just instance for a moment the valuation provisions of the May customs legislation. Properly defining a transaction value involves working through over 140 subdefinitions, about four of which involve reference to other statutes. In the same legislation, the valuation provisions alone allow for about 90 instances of discretion for the Australian Customs Service, a practice which is growing and to which the Opposition is opposed. The discretionary powers of public servants should be limited and confined to the smallest number possible. It is for the Government to incorporate in legislation how an Act and the Public Service should operate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Customs Service has been subject to greater public accountability for its actions since the administrative law package was introduced in the mid-1970s. That accountability has meant that the actions of Customs officers have been questioned. Customs has been required to explain its decisions and engage in reviews of its decisions by external authorities. Customs has not been coming off too well in these encounters. Recently in the Federal Court, in an appeal for a refund of duty paid which the Australian Customs Service had refused to pay, Customs' action was labelled not as `high-minded' but rather as `a shabby thing or a dirty trick which the court would not allow'. In the Corinthian Industries case the judge made the comment that a couple of sections of the Act which were under scrutiny were `not ambiguous' and that `they should be applied having regard to the words used, not according to some background philosophy'. Let us be perfectly clear where the blame for this lies. It does not lie with the conscientious officers of the Australian Customs Service but with the poor management and poor policies of this Hawke Government. The question of litigation will be very important if the Government's amendments to the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) proceed. But I will deal with that Bill later. </PARA>
<PARA> The first of the Bills in this package which I wish to look at is the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2). This is a straightforward matter and gives legislative authority to the decision announced in March that excise duty on naturally occurring liquefied petroleum gas is to be at a rate of free. This decision reflects the fact that the excise threshold of $147 a tonne has not been reached through the preceding six months. The Opposition supports this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The next Bill-the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill-owes its existence to the Air Caledonie case in regard to section 55 of the Constitution. Whole sections of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 are transferred to the Customs Act 1901 by repealing them under this Bill. These sections are then transferred using the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping) Bill 1989 as the vehicle. </PARA>
<PARA> These Bills seek to remove any difficulties which might occur as a result of the High Court's deliberations during the Air Caledonie Case. This is done by transferring sections of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 to the Customs Act 1901, by repealing them under the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill. The High Court in Air Caledonie International v. the Commonwealth, which case arose when the Government sought to impose a fee for immigration clearance in respect of international airline passengers entering Australia, dealt at length with section 55 of the Constitution. Section 55 of the Constitution provides that laws imposing taxation deal only with the imposition of taxation. It was considered in the past that the prohibition on mixing taxing and non-taxing acts was not infringed when an Act dealing with the imposition of customs duties amended a principal Act which contained provisions concerning non-customs duty matters. The High Court decision in this 1988 case now construes section 55 as extending to laws in the form in which they stand from time to time after amendment with the requirement that such laws deal only with the imposition of taxation or duties of customs. The companion Bill also allows a profit margin to be included in the matters considered when a normal value is being constructed-that is section 269tac (2) (c) (ii)-except where sales in the country of export have been at a loss for an extended period of time, covered by new section 269tac (13). </PARA>
<PARA> Dumping occurs when the export price is less than the normal value of goods in the domestic market in the country of export. Sometimes, because the goods are not sold on the domestic market of the exporting country or because of a centrally planned economy, the normal value on the home market is not available and a normal value has to be constructed. The Opposition supports these Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> Next in the package is the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1989. This Bill amends the Customs Tariff Act 1987 through a series of amendments contained in nine schedules of the Bill. These amendments to the 1987 Act reflect a housekeeping of the tariff. A number of the amendments relate to correcting anomalies created through the adoption of the harmonised tariff. Some of these amendments are Australia's obligations under the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement are being met by a number of amendments which implement unrestricted duty free access for footwear of New Zealand origin; duty free importation of certain New Zealand fabrics; the removal of tariff rates applicable to tender extension provisions for goods from New Zealand; and an acceleration of the move to free trade in apparel. Additionally some changes recommended by the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority are implemented through schedules 4 and 6. These amendments basically correct the effect of sloppy classification by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Also under this Bill the metal parts for footwear have their quota removed and a 15 per cent duty rate imposed. Following the November 1986 decision these goods were joined in with other footwear parts, which meant they were subject to quota and attracted a base rate of 40 per cent. A similar situation arose in regard to certain protective garments used by firefighting bodies and persons involved with harmful chemicals. Prior to 1986 these goods were subject to a classification order and as such were imported at minimum rates. However in 1986 the Australian Customs Service changed its classification. The result was that those suits without breathing apparatus were entered under quota and at a base rate of 55 per cent. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill also makes changes which relate to the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission report into the mining, construction and agricultural equipment industries. A number of products are afforded duty free entry. Items of major interest include mining shovels, electric walking draglines, rock cutters, tunnelling equipment, certain loaders and excavators. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to comment on some of the existing anomalies. We still have the situation in Australia where some fully assembled imports of machinery are duty free or come under a speedier regime of tariff reduction. But when they are imported as components, or if components of them are required for Australian manufacture, they either attract a heavy rate of duty or are programmed for a slower rate of reduction. This is absurd and has a significant consequences for a number of Australian manufacturers, such as Waltanna Tractors. The Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) seems to be intent on driving that company to Canada by giving it no support at all. This tractor manufacturer is producing a crawler tractor, but a crawler with rubber tracks instead of metal tracks. It is regarded as being a world class tractor-better than the Caterpillar design, which is the only other rubber-tracked crawler tractor on the market today. </PARA>
<PARA> Waltanna produces in Victoria and some of the components required for the manufacture of these tractors have to be imported from overseas. It pays a very high duty on those. If it imported an entire tractor it would pay no duty at all. The Government has been aware of this anomaly for years and it simply has refused to do anything about it. That is one of the irritating things about the present policy of this Government in relation to customs, which manufacturing industry in Australia finds quite intolerable. However, reverting to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill, the Opposition will support it. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I turn to the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1989. This is an omnibus Bill which proposes changes to six pieces of customs and excise legislation. The amendments contained in the Bill cover the termination of manufacture in bond; new requirements for bottling bulk potable spirits; the repeal of various unproclaimed sections of the Customs Act; and changes to the commercial tariff concession system. Manufacture in bond was introduced to assist local manufacturers by allowing them access to imported goods without paying import duty. Manufacturing must take place in Customs-licensed warehouses. However, little manufacture has been undertaken under this scheme. Over the past couple of years the number of warehouses using this system has fallen from 14 to only four. There will be alternative schemes available to manufacturers to import those goods duty free. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment covering the bottling of bulk spirits creates a requirement that first of all limits the availability of spirits in bulk. It also requires bottling in licensed premises and therefore under supervision. Both the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) and the Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts have recommended these changes, principally on the grounds that they ensure that there is no evasion of excise duty. The Opposition supports these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not prepared to support in their entirety the changes to section XVa of the Customs Act which deal with tariff concession orders. In the past, Australia has erected high tariff barriers to protect its own manufacturing industry. Tariff concession orders have been granted by Customs to allow entry of goods which are not produced in Australia. The principal beneficiaries of the tariff concessional order have overwhelming been manufacturing industries, because in respect of goods they need in the manufacture of products in some cases they can apply and get a concession granted to import those duty free. </PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary to go back a little in history to understand how we got to the present system. I said that we had high tariff barriers in the past and that was true of the era after the Second World War. It is now Government policy, and it is the policy of the Opposition, to reduce those tariff barriers that we have in place to levels that apply in other countries. Steps have already been taken in that direction and they will be continued in the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA> About 10 years ago we had a system which, unlike the system under section XVa of the Act at the present time, was really a set of by-laws, controlled very stringently by the Australian Customs Service. Of course, in the operation of those by-laws guidelines were used. It was a very difficult system to administer and it was very hard to get consistency and predictability. There were a large number of anomalies and manufacturing industry was not very happy about it. In 1982 the Fraser Government set up an Industries Assistance Commission inquiry to investigate the by-laws system that had been in operation up to that time. It recommended some radical changes, which came into effect in 1983 and really form the basis of section XVa of the present Customs Act. If honourable senators have not read that Act, it is really quite large, at about an inch thick. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes recommended by the IAC that were incorporated in the legislation were a series of very precise requirements that had to be met before goods could be imported duty free. It talked about definitions for things such as identical goods, particular goods, goods serving similar functions, cross-elasticity of demand, and goods capable of being produced or repaired in the normal course of business. In the old days when someone sought a tariff concession to enter goods duty free, a manufacturer who had the capability of producing those goods, even though he was not prepared to produce them and had never produced them in the past, could block the importation of goods by saying, `Look, there is my plant and equipment. I can produce the goods'. The amendments that were incorporated into the Customs Act after 1983 dealt with that matter very specifically. They defined `normal course of business' in words that stated that the manufacturer had to be in the position where he was ready to take orders for those goods. The notional concept that he could provide them if he needed to was not adequate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is proposing to get rid of the whole of section XVa. I concede that the current legislation has its problems-that is undeniable-but it is workable and it has been in place now for something like six years. It is accepted by Australian industry and by those people who have to use it. Furthermore, we now have a body of case law developing to guide people into how it should be interpreted. Over and above everything else, it is an infinitely better system and an infinitely better piece of legislation than that which preceded it prior to 1983. Defined in the Act are a series of requirements that have to be met, and very clearly defined, before someone gets a tariff concession entry. Apart from that, there is a provision that the Comptroller-General can grant, in the national interest-and the national interest is rarely invoked; it is a very special case with special connotations-a tariff concession order to someone to import goods duty free if he believes the circumstances are so exceptional that it is justified in the national interest, even though it does not meet the requirements of the Act. So there is a safety valve to these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> If the proposals before the Senate today are passed, the very basis on which tariff concession orders are at present granted which are precise, predictable and stable, will disappear. All the definitions which define the circumstances under which a concession may be granted are going to disappear. What we will get in their place is a system of guidelines. Under the proposed legislation, the guidelines will be proclaimed by the Minister but they will be written by the Australian Customs Service and its officers. So they will write the things, the Minister will proclaim them, and then the Australian Customs Service will act as judge, jury and arbiter on the implementation of the system. The very fact that they are in guideline form, even though there will be a disallowable instrument and it will be tabled in Parliament, leads to unpredictability and uncertainty, and, quite clearly, to enormous problems of definition and argument as to what will be required. The predictability and stability of the current legislation will be thrown out. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most important changes that will take place is the abolition of the precision of the definition of particular goods and the substitution of that for a class of goods. In simple terms, that means that using the examples of a suture needle for surgical application, if a person wants to import a surgical needle because none is made in Australia the opportunity will exist under the proposed legislation to compare surgical suture needles not with other surgical needles which might be available in Australia but with a whole class of goods, which would include all sorts of needles. The same situation could apply with earth moving equipment, where shovels may be compared with bulldozers. The very fact that we are moving from the particular to the general opens up a whole range of goods which really should not be compared with the particular good which the importer seeks to import. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government argues that these proposed changes are necessary to give the Customs Service increased flexibility so that more tariff concession orders can be granted. The logic of that evades me. I simply cannot see the point at all. My reading of the changes proposed is that the end result will be that a lot of tariff concession orders--</PARA>

I will deal with the other during the public interest debate tomorrow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the middle of last week I received a letter from the Joint House Department under the signature of Mike Bolton, Secretary. The letter pertains to some actions of mine to attempt to get the Joint House Department to acquire some photographs of the construction of this building in which we are housed. The photographs were taken by a person who worked on the House during the construction phase and who had an exhibition of his photographs in the House shortly after its opening. I refer to Jack Clarke. On the strength of the photographs that Jack took over a period, he was awarded a scholarship to the Canberra College of Art and has been studying there for the past two years. I have briefly seen his exhibition and I have a couple of copies of Jack's photographs in my office. </PARA>
<PARA> Jack Clarke attempted to get the Joint House Department to acquire the collection that he had gathered, by whatever means, over the years. He was running into some difficulty and approached me in the middle of this year to see whether I could assist in getting an answer to his queries. I in turn wrote to you, Mr President, and got a fairly speedy reply, but not necessarily a resolution at that time. The letter that I received on, I think, Wednesday of last week, did not particularly please me. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator,</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter of 8 June 1989 to Mr President concerning the photographic works of Mr John Clarke. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will notice that I have been talking about Mr Jack Clarke. I continued:</PARA>
<PARA>The Presiding Officers have considered your request and have asked me to pass on to you the advice provided to them on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Parliamentary Artworks Coordinator has inspected the sample pair of Mr Clarke's photographs which are currently located in your office. It is the Coordinator's opinion that the collection has some historical merit, however the quality of the works is not considered to be of the same calibre as Ms Sandy Edwards' works (known as the BLF Collection) which currently hang in the Non-Members' Bar. In addition, similar works exist in the Parliament House Construction Authority collection which is currently being prepared for archival action, but which will be available to Parliament from January 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>I have no problems whatsoever with the letter so far. However, it continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The Parliament needs to be mindful of the precedent which may be established in accepting works prior to the finalisation of acquisitions policy. I mention also that State galleries do not normally accept works into their collections from students to avoid the onslaught of works offered by artists who are endeavouring to make a name for themselves and to avoid being seen to give an advantage to one student over another. It must be remembered that acquisition of works from artists validates their work and the Parliament cannot be seen to be playing favourites and accepting works that do not meet its thematic and aesthetic criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> Under these circumstances I recommended to the Presiding Officers that the Parliament not accept or acquire the collection at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA>As I indicated earlier, it was signed by Mike Bolton, the Secretary of the Joint House Department. I take exception to the second last paragraph which talks about a precedent that may be established by accepting such works of art. I suppose we have here a reason or an excuse for some of the pieces of art displayed around this building. It could be interpreted from that paragraph in the latter that the works of art in this building have been acquired with the name of the artist in mind rather than on the artistic merit of the pieces involved. I am not sure of that, but I certainly put that interpretation on the paragraph in that letter. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the bad news. I want to conclude my short speech tonight with some good news. Last week the Canberra College of Art held its 1989 graduating students exhibition, which is a culmination of the work of 60 students who have completed either a two-year full time associate diploma course or a four-year course at the College. One of the schemes operating within that exhibition is the emerging artists support scheme, which is supported by a number of corporate patrons which include Mallesons Stephen Jaques, the Lend Lease Group, Canberra, the Australian National University, the National Recording Studios and the Parliamentary Library. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week the Parliamentary Library attended the exhibition. It did not look at the names of the artists; it selected the work on merit. I am very pleased to record in Hansard that the work of Jack Clarke was chosen by the Parliamentary Library under its acquisitions program. I am very pleased that that has happened and that Jack's work will get some recognition. Because of the pleasure that he has received from the acceptance of his work, he has in turn donated his collection to the Parliamentary Library. This is a very generous gesture by Jack Clarke, who put a lot of his life's work into the making of this very comfortable building. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no hidden agenda in raising this matter tonight. It may be interpreted that way by some people, because I have previously sought to take Mr Bolton to task over a particularly bureaucratic document which was circulated around the Parliament, although I understand that it was not meant to be circulated to senators. I received a personal apology from Mike and an explanation of what happened at that time. There is certainly no vendetta on my part in raising this matter tonight. But I am pleased to put on the record that a degree of justice has been done. I also record that, during my contribution tonight, I noted a number of exclamations made by honourable senators assembled in the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A triumvirate of Ministers has just issued a joint statement on pulp mills and the paper industry. There is little new in this package; it is basically a recapitulation and expansion of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) report issued in June this year and it attempts to address some of the basic needs identified in that report. The Ministers have had the benefit of the advice of the authors of the CSIRO report. Tonight I want to look at some of the likely effects of the implementation of these guidelines. We are being told that large local kraft process mills not only will replace with a domestic product the considerable volume of our paper and pulp imports but also will enable Australia to break into the international pulp market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will put aside for the moment and consideration of the barriers that Australian exporters of value-added products always seem to encounter and examine some of the domestic costs for the establishment of a kraft process pulp mill in the Grafton area. Daishowa International did indicate an interest in establishing a mill in this region but this proposal seems to have been shelved for the time being and the State Government has called for new `expressions of interest' after the completion of the New South Wales paper and pulp industry strategy and the Federal Government's environmental guidelines. There has been strong local opposition to the siting of a large world scale pulp mill in the Grafton district. A survey in July this year indicated that over 75 per cent of respondents were opposed to the construction of a mill; while fewer than 6 per cent said that they were for a pulp mill. Concerned citizens in the region formed the Clarence Valley Conservation Coalition to examine the pulp mill proposal and decided that the negative impacts of the proposal--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. I am talking about one particular pulp mill at Grafton rather than the report itself. As I mentioned, concerned citizens in the Grafton area, many of whom are National Party voters, have examined the pulp mill proposal, with the assistance of conservationists in the region, and have decided that the negative impacts of the proposal would well outweigh the benefits. At several rallies to oppose the pulp mill thousands of people have attended. At one I spoke at 5,000 people were present. Among the opponents of the pulp mill at Grafton are the Clarence River Professional Fisherman's Association, the Clarence River Fishermen's Cooperative, north coast apiarists, a number of sawmillers and many other organisations. Business people, builders, local councillors and farmers are among the cross-section of the community actively concerned about the mill proposal. One of the reasons why the fishermen are concerned can be illustrated by quoting from the June CSIRO report, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no doubt that bleached kraft mill effluent contains a variety of compounds that exhibit chronic toxicity-some at very low concentrations-to aquatic organisms. The important question is to what extent are they likely to be produced in a modern eucalypt mill, or find their way from a given pulp mill into aquatic organisms in concentrations sufficient to cause significant deleterious effects? A fully satisfactory answer is not available-nor is likely to be available-in the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA>That was taken from Fandry's document. This cannot be discounted by the new guidelines, even though the organochlorine emissions allowed are low by world standards. However, the release of organochlorines is not the only reason why the fishermen are concerned. There are many other possible effects on the marine life of the area that do not relate to organochlorines. There will also be other environmental effects even if the predictions for minimal organochlorine emission and rigorous monitoring are realised. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the concerns expressed many times by the local fishing industry that is not addressed by the guidelines is the inevitable increase in siltation that will follow large scale pulp logging. As far as I can tell from a cursory reading, the Federal Government's guidelines would allow a mill similar in scale to those previously proposed for Wesley Vale and Grafton to be built at Grafton. The locals feel that they have been getting very contradictory messages from the Government on this point. It depends which Minister one is listening to. A spokesperson for John Button was quoted in the Grafton Daily Examiner as commending plans by the State Government to establish a chemical pulp mill in northern New South Wales. But a different impression was left by Senator Graham Richardson when he visited Grafton in July this year. Locals are complaining that they have not heard much from him since then, despite written submissions and his promises of a detailed response. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most concrete indication of the attitude of the Federal Government-and the attitude of the State Government-is its permission for the woodchip quota from the north coast through the port of Newcastle to be increased from 350,000 to 500,000 tonnes per annum, and a new quota licensed through the port of Brisbane, without any environmental impact statement or the implementation of appropriate management techniques. The Federal member, Mr Ian Robinson-Mr Causley's National Party colleague-said just a few weeks ago that he continues to oppose construction of a pulp mill unless it can be proved that it will not harm the environment. It will be interesting to hear Mr Robinson's response to the new guidelines. Similar `responsible' sentiments have been expressed by Grafton's Mayor and local National Party Leader, Mr Mike Emerson. However, Federal National Party Leader, Mr Blunt, said on Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) radio that a future Peacock-Blunt government would be likely to stick with the environment guidelines established by the Hawke Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. The honourable senator opposite is quite flattering in claiming that I am reading my speech. I only wish that I had that fluency. It has been claimed by many that the proposed mill at Grafton would provide considerable employment for locals. However, the reality is that modern pulp mills are highly automated and provide few jobs. Numerous statements by proponents of the Clarence mill have greatly exaggerated the employment possibilities. For example, Mr Peter Went, Daishowa's Eden Manager, claimed on ABC radio 2NR on 1 February this year that the mill would create up to 1,000 direct jobs. Dr Wal Gentle claimed in the Daily Examiner of 11 February 1989 that up to 3,000 jobs would be created. The Sydney Morning Herald of 18 March this year reported a similar claim by the local member for Clarence, Mr Ian Causley. On radio 2NR on 11 November 1989, Mr Causley stated that such a mill would provide 4,000 jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Aanekoski mill in Finland, which is a prototype for mills such as this, provides permanent employment for 280 people. A slightly more realistic assessment came from Tasmania's Wesley Vale consortium which claimed that it would provide 410 direct jobs, even though 200 were to be lost at Longreach and elsewhere in the sawmilling industry under an agreement with the Tasmanian Government. That means a total gain of only 210 jobs. The reality is that likely job losses in existing industries, including fishing, tourism and sawmilling, would more than offset the few jobs that a pulp mill would provide. </PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales pulp and paper strategy was drawn up by a task force comprising industry representatives, including Harris-Daishowa and Amcor Ltd; two industry union representatives; and two industry departments-that is, Wal Murray's Department of State Development and Ian Causley's Forestry Commission. The task force failed to include any of the Government's own environmental planning authorities or any community or environment group. There was no consultation with industries such as fishing that have registered strong concerns. The terms of reference failed to refer to environmental considerations, the likely impact on the community or the losses that the pulp industry would impose on existing industries, such as sawmilling, which is already in decline in this region. </PARA>
<PARA> Without any comprehensive study of timber availability, the report calls for the establishment of a `world scale' chlorine bleaching mill on the north coast and in other locations throughout New South Wales. The strategy stresses that subsidies will be needed and that the Government should educate the public to understand the benefit of these mills-in other words, that the Government should put out propaganda to persuade the public of the desirability of having these mills, despite all the arguments against them. A good deal of public money has already been spent by the Forestry Commission and Messrs Causley and Murray attempting to do just this. The report also makes it clear that the industry expects to continue to consume our forests and despoil the environment at a very low cost. With the present industry thrust, it seems Australia will be internationally competitive only when we are willing to treat our forests as poorly as the worst international performers and continue to subsidise the industry by the pollution of our environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed mill at Grafton would require some 1.6 to 1.8 million tonnes of timber feedstock annually. This would be drawn from a 250 kilometre radius of Grafton-that is, an area north of Taree to the Queensland border and west into the tablelands. The total tonnage of all timber types from crown and private land on the north coast was approximately 450,000 tonnes last year. To suggest that this tonnage could be quadrupled without major environmental damage strains credibility. This is about twice the tonnage presently being taken from south-eastern New South Wales forests for woodchipping and it would be, at best, a massive ecological experiment and, at worst, an environmental disaster. Half the timber would come from private land. The 1975 north coast woodchip inquiry found that there were very few environmental controls for the removal of timber resourced from private land. This is still the situation today-14 years later. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems that the fishing industry is particularly concerned about is that, when the trees are removed from private land, the siltation caused by the removal of the top soil will be massive and there will be no redress by the fishing industry. This year we have heard a lot about the severity of the land degradation problem, and it would be naive to assume that this vast quantity of timber could be removed without really severe impact. There is already considerable erosion along the Orara River, which borders on private land, and that shows very clearly the consequences of private land degradation. It can be seen from aerial photographs. </PARA>
<PARA> The fishing industry on the north coast employs 700 to 800 people, and fish products from Coffs Harbour to Ballina earn approximately $26m annually. The north coast timber industry provides 1,500 jobs and has an annual turnover of $40m to $50m. There are approximately 860 north coast apiarists, with total annual earnings of $7m. The fishing industry-not normally a radical greenie industry-is concerned about chemically laden mill effluent and the increased siltation, as I have already mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the sawmillers are apprehensive that the huge amount of timber required to feed a pulp mill would deplete their resource almost entirely and threaten their livelihoods. The sawmill industry in the region is already operating at 30 per cent less than capacity. It seems extraordinary that the needs of the existing industry are not being met before the introduction of a huge competitive industry. The contrast between a forest industry with a large sawmilling component and one based primarily on woodchips can be illustrated by Forestry Commission figures for the north and south coast industries. At a time when there were 1,512 people employed in the north coast region with a 450,000 tonne output, 416 people were employed in the south coast region with a 750,000 tonne annual output. Meanwhile, the apiarists on the north coast are complaining that the destruction of the mature age forests will ruin their industry and that Mr Causley, supposedly their protector, is doing nothing to protect their interests. Growth industries, such as tourism, are also increasingly concerned about the likely adverse impact of such a highly polluting industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Noise and traffic would also be a problem. At least 72,000 laden vehicle journeys each year would be required for the supply of timber feed stock to the mill. Input and output would mean that, if the mill operated day and night, there would be at least one truck to or from the mill every two or three minutes around the clock. The local roads have not been made for this type of usage. There will be a high additional cost for road maintenance and replacement. A common estimate puts road damage by one truck as equal to 10,000 times the damage done by a single car. </PARA>
<PARA> Estimates based on the Wesley Vale mill proposal indicate that the Clarence mill would have a solid waste dump of approximately 35,000 tonnes a year. This is equivalent to the garbage output of a town of 20,000 people. The solid wastes would include numerous chemicals that could leach and run off into the watertable and waterways. Such problems would be compounded by the frequent high rainfall and flooding experienced on the north coast, which appears to be getting more serious year by year. </PARA>
<PARA> Emissions are also a major concern. Not only are these mills foul smelling, but also the experience in British Columbia-which I saw on the ABC television program 7.30 Report on 8 February 1989-and elsewhere indicates that acid rain results from such mills unless very expensive scrubbing plants are installed. This does not seem to be anticipated by the guidelines, and whether the odour can really be controlled is another matter. The Swedish consultant to the Tasmanian Government has reported that it is impossible to have a smell-free pulp mill. Finnish expert Kaj Granberg says of such mills: `You can taste them on the wind 40 or 50 kilometres away.'</PARA>
<PARA> The siting of the mill and the prevailing atmospheric conditions would influence the severity of this problem. If the emissions are not strictly controlled, the sulphur dioxide alone could have a substantial impact on agricultural production throughout the Clarence district and possibly beyond. The solution proposed for Wesley Vale was to construct a 100-metre tall chimney to help disperse the problem, that is, to get rid of it further up in the atmosphere. These emissions have led to an increase in respiratory ailments near mills overseas. The usual burning of sludge to generate power at such plants can release organochlorines as well as sulphur compounds in the emissions. The new guidelines do address this area of operation, but I am yet to be convinced that the problem can be controlled completely with current technology. Mr Trevor Brown, who is the Director of the Tasmanian Department of the Environment, admitted that it was possible that dioxin may be formed at Wesley Vale. The Tasmanian Government decided not to monitor for dioxin in the emissions, but said that if there were effects it would look into them. </PARA>
<PARA> There are still considerable problems in monitoring these toxic outfalls. Until a eucalypt processing plant is actually in operation, the impact on indigenous marine life cannot be established. The processes involved cannot be adequately reproduced in the laboratory and the reactions of individual marine species to minute traces of toxic materials are very variable, so the experience of large kraft processors of eucalyptus overseas can be only a partial guide. Particular conditions prevail in Australia and we need to do our own research for Australian conditions. The Wesley Vale consortium was unable to give an assurance that toxic effluent from the mill would not adversely affect marine life in Bass Strait. The question is: How much harm will they do? The onshore currents which affect the New South Wales north coast make it likely that any adverse effect from the proposed mill outfalls would affect the proposed marine park area south of Coffs Harbour and possibly areas north along the coastline up to Byron Bay. </PARA>
<PARA> There are indications that the chlorine bleaching process will soon be superseded. Tetra Pak (Australia) Pty Ltd, part of the world's largest packaging manufacturer, and Proctor and Gamble, the United Kingdom nappy manufacturer, have indicated that they will no longer use bleached board because of concerns regarding dioxins. There are other examples of a change in attitude towards the use of paper products produced by non-chlorine based mills. The original CSIRO report and the new guidelines underestimate the strength of this development. Unbleached and recycled papers are becoming more generally available, as Senator Vallentine said earlier today. Bleaching with oxygen is an option that is becoming more competitive economically. Studies on this are currently being done overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Do we really need to use all the paper and packaging that we now consume? I think it was Senator Sanders who made the point today that perhaps some male members of this place are not aware of the unnecessary packaging of many products because it is their wives who do the shopping for their families. </PARA>
<PARA> Once established, it would be virtually impossible to win the closure of such a plant even if our worst concerns were realised. The failure of governments and environmental agencies in North America to monitor and force compliance with environmental standards there adds doubt to the situation here. The likely impact of the mill on existing industries in the Grafton district would serve to greatly reduce the economic diversity and resilience of this region's economy, which is flourishing. It may also restrict the future growth base of the local economy. That is why the locals are so very concerned, and that is why they are going to vote Mr Causley out of office at the next State election. </PARA>
<PARA> Woodchip operations at Eden have received large sums of Federal and State moneys. During an interview on the ABC radio program AM on 14 February, Senator Richardson revealed that the Wesley Vale mill would have received over $100m of direct and indirect Federal Government subsidies. State and local government infrastructure provisions would have accounted for further tens of millions of dollars. Our taxes should not be used to bolster up the profits of overseas multinational companies, be they from Japan or elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has been made of the potential export earnings from such an industry. The extent of our foreign indebtedness will not be reduced by government subsidies to foreign corporations, which have a propensity to contribute little to the local economy and to decimate our existing industries. We will merely inherit the debt burden of a company such as Harris-Daishowa an be further strained by the need to expatriate profits to the foreign owners. The Business Review Weekly dated 21 April 1989 indicates that Daishowa is a highly geared corporation that already owes 339 billion yen in bank loans. In the year to September 1988, 80 per cent of its net earnings went to paying off loan interests. The need for caution is furthered by the fact that the pulp and paper industry is highly cyclical and is going through its longest sustained expansion since the 1960s. Once a mill was established, our local economy would be subject to the future booms and busts of the pulp and paper industry. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another troubling aspect about new, large mills. Australia will find it hard to escape from its commitments to provide woodchips to the Japanese market. This may mean there will be pressure both to fulfil existing quotas and to provide the feed stock for new Australian mills. This means that the strain on the existing old-growth forest resources of this country would be massive, and we would still not have the plantations to supply them. The question of plantations needs to be addressed by the Federal Government as a matter of urgency-and it seems to be one point on which the Government, the Opposition, the Australian Democrats and the independents all seem to agree. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I trust that I raise a subject close to your heart, Mr President. As a long time visitor to the African continent, you would be acutely aware of the conflict that has been raging in the Horn of Africa for about 28 years and which, hopefully, is getting much closer to resolution than it has ever seemed before. I want to speak in my capacity as a sponsor of the Eritrean Relief Association generally to express approval and encouragement for the peace process, which I think has already produced some very significant results. What was resolved in Nairobi on 28 November last is very positive. Following on from the Atlantic conference only three issues were outstanding issues: the question of chairmanship; the status of the observers; and the extent of the secretariat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All of those issues having been resolved, there would not seem to be very much left to divide the parties, but one should not express premature optimism. I note from correspondence that I have received that there are still allegations of lack of good faith which, on their face, need to be taken seriously and particularly given that, once again, there would be seem to be an imminent threat of drought which in the past across the Sahel has wreaked enormous devastation and extensive loss of life. It has been suggested to me that there is still an unwillingness on the part of the Ethiopian authorities to discuss common measures that might be taken to alleviate that suffering. That is a matter of concern, and I hope that the Australian Government will be prepared to urge the Ethiopian Government to enter into sensible discussions about long term development and short term assistance and not simply address the mechanics of the peace process. Ultimately, if assurances can be given about the future in terms of assistance, both internationally and domestically, there is much more likelihood that the parties will resolve those final outstanding difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> One other matter which seems to have caused some agitation is the participation of the United Nations as an observer. It seems to be quite clear that the United Nations has agreed to accept that role and that both sides have made it clear that they will accept a United Nations nominated observer. Again, there are some allegations that the United Nations has declined to accept the proposed role and that some undermining is going on. From the information available to me, I simply want to say that that does not seem to be the case. I hope that the Australian Government will fervently urge that both sides accept the status of any United Nations appointed observer and encourage the United Nations through the General Assembly to ensure that that observer is well received. We should be grateful for the roles being played by a former President of the United States, Jimmy Carter, and former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere. I hope that their involvement will mean that all of the outstanding concerns can be speedily resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been a very long and bloody conflict. If one can draw any consolation from a struggle as protracted as this, it is that the spirit of the Eritrean people remains undiminished. They have certainly shown amazing courage and ingenuity. All of those people who have visited the region, from Thomas Keneally in recent times through to Senator Schacht, who was there last year, and a number of other people with whom I speak from time to time, are continually amazed at the positive approach that is adopted in the face of unremitting attack from the Ethiopian army and air force. As much as one could ever imagine it, life seems to go on almost as normal, even though most of the education, which is compulsory, is conducted under ground; most of the eating and sleeping is conducted under ground. It is only the fighting that seems to be done up in the real world. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems amazing to me-I just felt the need to put it on record-that the Eritrean people can have been so united through such a very long crisis, in which the majority of the population probably were not born when it started. I hope that the Australian Government will do all that it can to expedite the conclusion of that conflict. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, upon notice, on 10 October 1989:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to a study of Australian exporters by the Australian Trade Commission (AUSTRADE) which reveals: (a) that only 2 per cent of Australian exporters can be described as global competitors; (b) only about 100 companies have sales of $50 million or more and exports of at least 25 per cent of turnover, even including the large agricultural and mineral commodity exporters; and (c) 75 per cent of exporters have total sales of $10 million or less than in general reflect low commitment, in that domestic surplus capacity is allocated to export from time to time on an opportunistic basis.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In view of the seriousness of the position revealed by the report and subsequent comments made in a media release dated 31 August 1989 by the Chairman of AUSTRADE, Mr Bill Ferris, what options are open to the Government to bring about an improvement in the position, given the urgent need to increase exports.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am aware of the profile of Australian exporters by the Australian Trade Commission (AUSTRADE). This profile is set out in AUSTRADE's submission of May 1989 to the Committee for Review of Export Market Development Assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Government is addressing the need to improve Australia's export competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA> AUSTRADE is charged with developing and delivering services to exporters. This assistance is directed at all stages of the export process, starting with motivating Australian firms and industries to the profit potential of export and other forms of international business. It continues through export planning assistance, market intelligence, support in the field and progressing the internationalisation of Australian business, including encouraging two-way investment.</PARA>
<PARA> Fundamental to Australia trading its way out of its present trade imbalance is the inculcation of an export culture in the manufacturing and services industries. It was one of the recommendations of the report of the Committee for Review of Export Market Development Assistance (the Hughes Committee). The report stated that the importance of international competitiveness in the production of goods and services for Australian living standards needed to be understood in the community.</PARA>
<PARA> AUSTRADE is playing a major role in developing an export culture through strategies designed to promote the importance of export in key, interrelated audiences and fostering new networks of key players in business, government, unions and the community.</PARA>
<PARA> AUSTRADE is representative of the Government's determination to create an environment in which Australian companies become and remain internationally competitive. The Government recognises that macro and micro economic policies are important determinants of the long term success of Australia's export performance. It is pushing on both fronts to improve macro economic management and micro economic reform.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's international competitiveness is dependent on internationally competitive companies. The Government is committed to developing new programs and tailoring existing support measures to meet this objective.</PARA>
<PARA> The internationalisation of Australian business, involving as it does the two-way exchange of management skills, capital, technology, distribution and marketing, is an important part of the Government and AUSTRADE's efforts to integrate Australian industry into the global economy. It is integral to the Government's thrust to make Australia a nation with a commitment to export, a nation imbued with an export culture.</PARA>
