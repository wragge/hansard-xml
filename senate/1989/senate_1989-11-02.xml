<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and the senators in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The Humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That every abortion kills an unborn human baby.</PARA>
<PARA> That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Government's first duty is to protect this right to life.</PARA>
<PARA> That the most defenceless and threatened lives are those of unborn babies for whom the Government is duty bound to take extra steps to protect.</PARA>
<PARA> That in 1987-88 taxpayers funds through Medicare provided Medical Benefits for 61,879 abortions totalling $6.4 million.</PARA>
<PARA> That in the same year Commonwealth grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State Public Hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will carry out its duty to protect the right to life of Australian babies by ceasing to fund abortions through Medicare, restricting grants to the States and by all other means at its disposal.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth, that:</PARA>
<PARA> At present all Australians, including those who conscientiously object to war and the preparation of war, are required by law for a portion of their income tax to be spent on military use.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray.</PARA>
<PARA> That you support the Peace Tax Trust Fund Bill 1989 which has been presented by Western Australian Independent Senator, Jo Vallentine. This Bill does not propose that anyone be permitted to withhold tax, but that the law should be changed to allow conscientious objectors to divert the military portion of their tax into more positive and socially useful programs.</PARA>

<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth, that:</PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned about the increase in violent television programmes for children and particularly those programmes promoting violent toys that are available for sale in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners, therefore humbly pray:</PARA>
<PARA> That you support the Broadcasting (Prohibition of Violent Programmes for Children) Act 1988 which has been presented by Western Australia Independent Senator for Nuclear Disarmament, Jo Vallentine.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I present to the Senate the following petitions from 184, 110, 631, 624, 115, 121 citizens, which are not in conformity with the Standing Orders as they are not in the correct form:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Mining and Illegal Killing of Penguins</PARA>
<PARA> Please sign this petition to help stop the mining and illegal killing of penguins. If we let them mine the area, there will be even more disasters like the latest oil spill, and therefore it will kill the living animals, and destroy our environment. This petition will be sent to: Senator Graeme Richardson, Minister for the Environment, Parliament House, Canberra ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA> Please make sure you sign this petition to save Antarctica.</PARA>
<PARA>Antarctic World Park</PARA>
<PARA> We, the undersigned citizens, congratulate the Australian government on its decision not to sign the Antarctic Minerals Convention and urge the government to explore the prospects of implementation of an Antarctic World Park.</PARA>
<PARA>World Heritage List: Shark Bay Region</PARA>
<PARA>To the Honourable R. J. Hawke, Prime Minister of Australia</PARA>
<PARA> We, the undersigned are deeply concerned at the West Australian government's plan to develop the region of Shark Bay. It possesses natural habitats of world-wide significance and is home to numerous rare and endangered species of marine and terrestrial animals.</PARA>
<PARA> It contains one of the largest dugong populations left in the world.</PARA>
<PARA> It is an important wintering area for the humpback whale.</PARA>
<PARA> It is a nesting area for several species of turtle.</PARA>
<PARA> It contains the world's only flourishing population of thick-billed grass wren.</PARA>
<PARA> The floristic diversity is of particular importance, the southern area containing a unique tree heath and several as yet undescribed species known only from recent collections.</PARA>
<PARA> Monkey Mia is the only place in the world where wild dolphins, of their own volition, come daily to interact with humans for hours at a time.</PARA>
<PARA> The land features of Shark Bay make it ideal for conservation reservation. We therefore ask you and your government to recognize Shark Bay as fulfilling the criteria for World Heritage listing and to take immediate steps to have the Shark Bay region included on the World Heritage list.</PARA>
<PARA>Importation of Hardwood Timber</PARA>
<PARA>Ban the import of rainforest timbers from Sarawak Malaysia.</PARA>
<PARA> We the undersigned ask the Australian Government to stop the import of timbers from Sarawak, Malaysia. We by importing, are involved in destroying the home and culture of indigenous peoples, the Penan Kelabit, and Kayan tribes who live in harmony and at peace with nature.</PARA>
<PARA> We are destroying the homes of thousands of species of animal and plant life, which benefit man in many areas including medicine and agricultural varieties. We are ultimately destroying the lives of our children in the long run, as the loss of the rainforests the lungs of planet Earth, has a Greenhouse Effect. You ban the import of game products including ivory and antiquities in the interest of other countries cultures and wildlife. The import of hardwood timbers from Sarawak should be banned for the same reasons.</PARA>
<PARA>Importation of Hardwood Timber</PARA>
<PARA>We, the undersigned call on the Australian Government to place a ban on the import of rainforest timber. Our Government has been instrumental in protecting Australia's tropical rainforest. It is hypocritical to allow rainforest destruction to continue in other countries. Australia must act now in leading the way for protection of tropical forests globally.</PARA>
<PARA>Proposed Tourist Development in Repulse Bay</PARA>
<PARA>We, the subjects of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, do pray that you acknowledge the following petition and request you to give this matter earnest consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> Re Proposed tourist development in Repulse Bay at Midge Point.</PARA>
<PARA> It is with regret that we, the undersigned, have become aware of the proposed multi million dollar tourist developments planned for the Midge Point area. This is the Aqua tourist developments planned for the Midge Point area. This is the Aqua Del Ray project to the north of Midge Point and also Whitsunday Golds proposals for the surrounding areas of the township.</PARA>
<PARA> As participants of the annual northern migration to Tropical North Queensland, we are horrified at the thought of another beautiful, natural and serene piece of this magnificent coastline being swallowed up in the race for progress and the almighty dollar.</PARA>
<PARA> We ask you Sir, what value can you place on one of the fine natural havens left along our coastline? The majority of us have travelled the length and breadth of this country only to find each year that more of our tranquil resting spots have been sacrificed for 5 star concrete jungles. As members of the vast touring public, we do not seek this kind of sophisticated accommodation. We love Midge Point just as it is with its fine balance of steady progressive development and increased residential qualities.</PARA>
<PARA> If resorts are to be built in this area, we urge you Sir, to confine the construction to freehold land only. We fully realise that access would be required to the foreshore, but to allow the destruction of many hectares of mangroves and approximately 7 kilometres of coastline (Aqua Del Ray) and up to 2 kilometres out into Repulse Bay is not acceptable. (Esplanades are for public access to the sea).</PARA>
<PARA> We, whose signatures appear on the attached petition, strenuously object to development leases and investigation leases being granted to any company in Repulse Bay. Investigation leases would not be required if developments were confined to freehold land.</PARA>
<PARA> Please help us to preserve this already popular tourist attraction, Midge Point.</PARA>

<PARA>Kakadu National Park</PARA>
<PARA>To the Minister for the Environment Senator Richardson.</PARA>
<PARA> I heard about the threats to Kakadu National Park posed by mineral exploration and mining.</PARA>
<PARA> I know that in addition to the existing Ranger mine, the mining industry is proposing large new uranium mines at Jabiluka and Koongarra.</PARA>
<PARA> I know the Australian Government can stop both mines by incorporating the project areas in the park, as legislation prohibits mining in Kakadu National Park and so I hope the Australian Government will:</PARA>
<PARA> Prohibit all mining in Kakadu or the Conservation Zone;</PARA>
<PARA> Put the Conservation Zone into Kakadu National Park;</PARA>
<PARA> Put Koongarra and Jabiluka in Kakadu National Park.</PARA>

<PARA> Re Ozone Protection Legislation</PARA>
<PARA> We the undersigned request that the Commonwealth Government amend the Ozone Protection Legislation so that Australia will achieve a complete phase-out of C.F.C. and halon production, export and consumption by 1995.</PARA>
<PARA>Cigarette Advertising</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator,</PARA>
<PARA> It is with great satisfaction that we, the undersigned residents of the Central Coast, notice that Senator Janet Powell of Victoria is introducing a Private Members Bill into Federal Parliament with the objective of having all cigarette advertising banned in the Press, on billboards, and in shop fronts throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> This will be of incalculable benefit healthwise and otherwise to those who live here and to those who as tourists visit to obtain a breath of fresh air after leaving the polluted atmosphere of the smog-ridden cities.</PARA>
<PARA> To be confronted by cigarette advertising every time one opens a newspaper or magazine, travels the highways or visits a shop is intolerable.</PARA>
<PARA> Please count on our support for anything you do that will facilitate the passage of this Bill through Parliament to the desired end.</PARA>
<PARA>With many thanks,</PARA>

<PARA> (ii) that specific allegations made in documents signed by Captain Segan and Captain Lewino, and tabled in the Senate, were unable to be tested due to the ruling by the Chairman of the Committee that these documents were subject to the sub judice rule in that he was informed by the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) that legal action was pending,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) that the Chairman ruled that as he was an inexperienced Chairman he was unwilling to allow questioning of witnesses which might be held to have prejudiced a future legal action and that despite advice received from the Clerk of the Senate as to the practice in the Senate and other legislatures, he was unwilling to vary his ruling,</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) the questionable legality of the Chairman's ruling in that the written advice of the Clerk to the Committee was that:</PARA>
<PARA> `for the rule to be invoked</PARA>
<PARA> there must be proceedings on foot or in near prospect,</PARA>
<PARA> there must be a substantial danger of prejudice to the proceedings . . . The danger of prejudice is regarded as small unless there is a jury impanelled or the proceedings are likely to be before a jury in the near future',</PARA>
<PARA> (v) that this was not the case in pending actions being brought by Ansett and Australian Airlines,</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) notes that the report of Estimates Committee B omitted any reference to the usage of the sub judice rule and calls on the Chairman of the Committee to explain this omission and to explain why the previous practice of the Senate was not followed and should not constitute a proper course of action in the future, and</PARA>
<PARA> (vii) that despite an invitation to the Senate to determine the application of the sub judice rule, no action has been forthcoming; and</PARA>

<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>GRAPE RESEARCH LEVY AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to increase the maximum rate of the levy that may be imposed under the Grape Research Levy Act 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> The Grape Research Levy Act 1986 imposes a levy on fresh and dried grapes and grape juice, delivered to wineries and other processing establishments. Dried grapes which are leviable under the Dried Fruits Levy Act 1971 are exempt. Levy is payable by grapegrowers and by winemakers who grow their own grapes. </PARA>
<PARA> The proceeds of the levy represent the grapegrowers contribution to the financing of research on winegrapes and other processed grapes. The Commonwealth matches industry expenditure under the program. A Grape and Wine Research Council established under the Rural Industries Research Act 1985 administers the grape research program. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently the maximum rate of the levy under the Grape Research Levy Act is 50c per tonne. The operative rate of the levy was increased to this level with effect from 1 January 1989. This amendment will provide flexibility for the levy to be increased in future but only if industry so requests. </PARA>
<PARA> In May 1988 the Government re-affirmed its commitment to matching rural industry research expenditures up to a ceiling of 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production (GVP) of the industry concerned. Subsequently the Winegrape Growers' Council of Australia requested that the maximum rate of the Grape Research Levy be increased to $2 per tonne to enable a phased increase in grape industry research funding. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill implements that request which was supported by each of the nationally representative winemaker organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to emphasise that this Bill does not increase the operative rate of levy currently paid by grapegrowers. Increases in operative rates will continue to be set by regulation under the Grape Research Levy Act. There is a specific legislative requirement for industry to be consulted before such increases are implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> Increasing the maximum rate of the grape research levy will not in itself have a direct impact on government expenditure. The extent to which outlays for grape research increase in the future will depend upon the level of levy increases implemented over time within the higher maximum rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Growers' funds provided by this levy and matching Commonwealth contributions have placed grape research on a secure long term financial basis. An initial relatively modest expenditure program of about $270,000 in 1987-88 will increase to a budgeted level of $522,000 in the current year. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will facilitate further development of the program commensurate with growers' willingness to contribute additional funds for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>WINE GRAPES LEVY AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to restructure the levy which funds the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. The new levy arrangements will improve equity in levy contributions between small, medium and large winemakers and provide increased funding for the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is part of a package of measures to promote further development of the wine industry An associated Bill amends the Grape Research Levy Act to introduce a higher maximum levy rate and a third Bill amends the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act to implement a program to enable wine labelling claims to be verified. </PARA>
<PARA> The Wine Grapes Levy Act 1979 imposes a levy on fresh and dried grapes and grape juice used in the manufacture of wine. The levy has two components-a marketing amount to finance the promotional and regulatory activities of the Corporation and a research amount which provides industry funding for wine research. The levy is payable by winery proprietors using the equivalent of 20 tonnes or more of fresh grapes per year in winemaking. </PARA>
<PARA> The current marketing component of the levy is a flat rate of $4 per tonne of prescribed goods with a cap of $20,000 on levy payments per levy payer. This levy structure has resulted in a disproportionate burden of Corporation funding falling upon smaller and medium sized wineries and considerable potential levy income from larger wineries has been foregone. For example, a proprietor of a winery crushing 5,000 tonnes of grapes pays $4 per tonne of $20,000, but a proprietor of a winery crushing $80,000 tonnes of grapes also pays $20,000 because of the $20,000 levy ceiling. A further weakness in the present levy system is that because of the levy ceiling corporate amalgamations have the potential to significantly reduce levy revenue over time. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments proposed in this Bill address these issues by abolishing the levy ceiling, introducing a tiered levy system and reducing the threshold tonnage below which levy is not payable. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the structure proposed, the levy to fund the Corporation will consist of a flat amount of $200 for each levy payer plus an additional amount depending on the tonnage of grapes used in winemaking. To calculate this additional amount a sliding scale of levy rates will be used. Progressively lower rates will apply as tonnage crushed increases. The maximum rates and initial operative rates of the levy are set out in clause 6 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> At present proprietors of wineries crushing less than 20 tonnes of prescribed goods per year are exempt from both the marketing and research components of the levy. This Bill proposes to reduce that exemption threshold from 20 tonnes to 10 tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA> The levy will continue to be payable on fresh and dried grapes and grape juice used in winemaking. Provision will remain for the operative rates of levy to be changed by regulation. In respect of the marketing component, this will occur only after consideration of any recommendation made to the Minister by the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. The Corporation must first submit its recommendation to an annual general meeting of the industry and advise the Minister of the voting on any relevant resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes provided for in this Bill were requested and are strongly supported by the wine industry. A motion recommending the changes was approved by an 84 per cent majority of votes cast at the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation annual general meeting in February this year. The proposal to reduce the exemption threshold from 20 tonnes to 10 tonnes in respect of the research component of the levy has the support of each of the three national winemaker organisations. It will retain consistency in the exemption level for each component of the levy. </PARA>
<PARA> The levy changes proposed will also provide substantially increased funding from the Corporation. In 1990-91 estimated levy income will be about $1.16m compared with approximately $750,000 in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1987-99 the Corporation has incurred significant deficits financed through reductions in its reserves. The Corporation has budgeted for a further deficit of about $176,000 in the current year. The increase in levy receipts expected from the changes being implemented through this Bill should arrest the erosion of Corporation reserves and be sufficient to cover increased program expenditure by 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation was reconstituted in 1986 to improve its accountability to industry and to enable it to operate more effectively and efficiently. The strong industry support for an increase in the level of its funding for the Corporation reflects industry confidence in the Corporation and the programs it has implemented and intends to implement for the industry's benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation has allocated a high proportion of its resources towards encouraging and servicing, through its export promotion and inspection arrangements, the rapid increase in exports which has occurred in recent years. The value of exports of Australian wine has increased more than fivefold from $20.5m in 1985-86 to $113m in 1988-89. Exports in the current year are expected to be worth $133m. </PARA>
<PARA> The wine industry, supported by the Corporation, is working hard to further increase awareness of the quality and value of our wines and to protect the reputation of the industry as a supplier of consistently reliable products. In addition to its promotional programs the Corporation has implemented a compliance monitoring program under which wine samples are analysed for non-permissible additives. Introduction of a label integrity program will further enhance consumer confidence in Australian wine. </PARA>
<PARA> Funding changes embodied in this Bill will enable the Corporation to maintain these and other programs from a more secure financial base. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains appropriate transitional provisions for implementation of the new levy rates from 1 January 1990 which is midway through the normal levy year. This has been done so that the new levy system can apply to the 1990 grape harvest, thereby making additional funding available to the Corporation as soon as possible. The existing levy will apply until 31 December 1989, but a winery proprietor's maximum levy liability in 1989-90 will be limited to what he or she would have incurred had the new levy rates applied throughout 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments will have no net effect on government expenditure. The levy which funds the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation is paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund and an equal amount is appropriated from the Fund for payment to the Corporation. The revised levy has no additional cost implications for the Department of Primary Industries and Energy as levy collection costs are fully recouped from the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN WINE AND BRANDY CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The main purpose of this Bill is to provide the legislative basis for implementation of a wine label integrity program by the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. It also makes amendments to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980 consequential on amendment of the Wine Grapes Levy Act provided for in an accompanying Bill. In addition this Bill amends penalties in the principal Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The wine label integrity program will require wine manufacturers to keep records to support labelling claims of the vintage, variety or region of origin of wine and to make those records and the stocks to which they relate available for audit upon request by the Corporation. The purpose of auditing is to help to ensure truth in labelling, thereby increasing consumer confidence in the reliability of wine label claims and enhancing the reputation for quality and value of Australian wine in domestic and export markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The label integrity program has been devised and developed by the Corporation at the request of the wine industry. It has the support of each of the three national winemaker organisations and was recommended for adoption by a substantial majority of votes cast at the Corporation's annual general meeting in February 1989. The Wine and Grape Industry Advisory Council comprising representatives of winemakers and grape growers, considers that the program will contribute to meeting the need for regular systematic monitoring of compliance with wine labelling requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for legislation by the Commonwealth arises from concern within the wine industry, the Corporation and the Government to protect our reputation for producing sound, good quality wines with accurate product description on labels. Exports of Australian wine have grown from $20.5m in 1985-86 to $113m in 1988-89 and are expected to reach $133m in 1989-90. Continued export expansion is now a key to the industry's future growth and prosperity and protecting the reputation of our wines is essential to achievement of that objective. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian wine industry also holds a 97 per cent share of the domestic market for wine. I believe Australian consumers will welcome the implementation of a label integrity program as a further initiative by the wine industry to enhance consumer respect for the local product. </PARA>
<PARA> The price which winemakers can obtain for premium wines may invite spurious labelling claims by any producer who has little respect for accuracy in product descriptions. Experience overseas has shown that, in the event of fraudulent winemaking practices and product description by the irresponsible few, export customers tend to avoid wine from all producers of the country affected. Australia's winemakers wish to pre-empt any such damage to their industry, by implementing their own program of industry self-regulation. Knowledge that a system is in place to facilitate detection of breaches should be a strong deterrent to any potential transgressors. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that all wine manufacturers engaged in the manufacture of wine for commercial purposes be required to keep a record of the vintage, variety, region of origin, source of supply and quantity of grape products received for use in making wine. This will enable the Corporation to trace a wine back to the point where grapes from which it was produced were first harvested or juice was first processed. </PARA>
<PARA> Wine manufacturers who sell or dispose of their wine without any claim as to its vintage, variety or region of origin need not maintain any further records in respect of such wine. For example wine manufacturers who sell their wine as claret, burgundy, moselle or chablis, once they have made records of their intake of grape products, can dispense with further record keeping. </PARA>
<PARA> Wine manufacturers who make claims about the vintage, variety or region of origin of a particular wine will need to keep records relating to the production, sales and disposal of all such wines, thereby establishing an `audit trail'. This will enable verification of claims made by wine manufacturers about the pedigree of the wine and enable the Corporation to determine whether or not more wine described as being of a particular variety-say, chardonnay-is being sold than could possibly be produced from the available grape supply. </PARA>
<PARA> Relevant clauses in part 3 of the Bill take account of typical transactions occurring in the wine industry-which include blending of wines, sale of wine to other wineries, transfer of wine between the producing arm and marketing arm of related companies, winemaking under contract, relabelling of wines without labels and cellar door sales. The clauses in each case impose obligations on wine manufacturers to keep records, not on grapegrowers or bottling firms. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for record keeping arises from a circumstance believed to be unique to the wine industry-that there is no known technical means of assessing a wine to determine its vintage, variety or region of origin. For most other primary products, it is possible to verify contents by technical means-for example by species testing or by other analysis of the physical or chemical characteristics of the product. </PARA>
<PARA> As a matter of normal commercial practice most winemakers already maintain the records they will be required by this Bill to keep. Where winemakers do not already maintain intake, production, sales and disposal records, the Corporation will assist them to establish simple and appropriate record keeping procedures. The Corporation will be providing a guide to wineries on the requirements of this Bill and will be visiting wineries to further explain the requirements of the label integrity program and to ensure that producers are familiar with the record-keeping requirements appropriate to their particular operations. </PARA>
<PARA> Labelling requirements concerning vintage, variety and region of origin are enshrined in food laws administered by State and Territory governments. This Bill does not change existing food laws or introduce new labelling requirements nor does it encroach upon the authority and responsibilities of the States and Territories for administering those laws. In consultations, these governments have indicated that they would welcome the assistance of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation in monitoring compliance with wine labelling aspects of food laws. Evidence of any apparent breaches detected by the Corporation will be brought to the attention of the States and Territories for appropriate action, or action may be brought under the consumer deception provisions of the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The wine industry does not seek through the label integrity program to emulate the European appellation system. There are no attempts to limit the types of grapes which can be grown in a specific region, to limit the yield which can be obtained from a vineyard or to prescribe certain methods of production. All that is required is that winemakers who make labelling claims of vintage, variety or region of origin, maintain the records necessary to substantiate the claims. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains appropriate provisions necessary for effective administration of the program. These include standard provisions relating to the powers of inspectors, access to premises and the gathering of evidence of label offences. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequential amendments to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980 contained in part 2 of the Bill will maintain the existing arrangements concerning voting rights at annual general meetings of the Corporation, payment to the Corporation of levy money collected by the Commonwealth and refunds of any overpayments back to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The up-dated penalty rates specified in the schedule to the Bill relate to offences against provisions concerning the coverage of grape products, provision of information to the Corporation, export of grape products and offences against regulations made pursuant to the principal Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME><ELECTORATE>(New South Wales)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.10)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill and allied Bills and to support the amendment moved by Senator Stone. These Bills basically reduce the revenue that would have been received by this Government as a result of enormous bracket creep that is, of course, still pushing Australian taxpayers into even larger and larger tax bills, despite this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Total taxation revenues in the last year of the Fraser Government, 1982-83, totalled $41 billion. They are budgeted this year to total $91.3 billion. That is almost a 120 per cent increase. The significance of that increase is that over that time, from 1982-83 to 1989-90, the consumer price index (CPI) is estimated to have risen by 64 per cent. Tax revenues are up by almost double the rate of rise of the CPI. There can be no more dramatic instance, no more clear evidence, of the justification for the nickname `bracket creep' for this Treasurer (Mr Keating) than this evidence of bracket creep. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government, through its relaxed, casual approach to inflation, an inflation that is destroying Australia's competitive position in the world, is destroying our export industries and making our import replacement industries incapable of competing against the burgeoning volume of imports to this country. This Government's approach to that disastrous inflation has been so lax, its management so incompetent, that it has brought about this massive increase in government revenues. It makes one wonder whether in fact inflation suits this Government. It is what this Government wants. It is so easy for this Government, when there is a high level of inflation, to pay its bills and to come out with the respectable looking surpluses by which it seeks to ingratiate itself with the business community. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that this Government's lax, incompetent approach to the secret killer of the Australian economy-inflation-has brought this Government significant revenue benefits which these Bills purport to give back to the people of Australia, but which in fact do not give back anything like the volume that is necessary to provide any kind of fair go to taxpayers as a whole and Australian families in particular, who have been suffering unbelievably as a result of the economic and taxation policies of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I go back to this rise in total taxes of something like 120 per cent, while the cost of living, as measured by the CPI has gone up by only about 64 per cent since 1982-83. Not only have we seen that huge rise in taxes with net pay as you earn tax up something like 103 per cent, about one and a half times the rise in inflation, but also we have seen other taxes, such as those paid by unincorporated provisional taxpayers, go up by something like 115 per cent. During that time the Medicare levy has been introduced-a phoney system that theoretically pays for Medicare but of course does not and is simply a hidden tax, totalling this year something like $2.6 billion. There is also the prescribed payments system. We must add all those things on to the total tax bill. If we do that we see income tax on individuals up by 124 per cent under this Government. As I said, it is just about double the rate of inflation. Taxes on companies are up by 135 per cent over that period. The Government could well say that this is because companies are doing better, and that is true: company profits have risen. But when we add all these taxes together we find a horrendous rise. </PARA>
<PARA> But the most interesting, dishonest and disgraceful rise in taxes is in the sector of the tax regimen which this Government said would not be increased-consumption taxes. In fact, it said that there would be no consumption taxes. Do honourable senators remember the dishonest attack that the Australian Labor Party waged in the last two election campaigns against the coalition on the question of consumption taxes? `There will be no consumption taxes', it said. It claimed that the only people who were talking about consumption taxes were the coalition. That is totally phoney and crooked. The figures demonstrate the extent to which this Government behaved in its typical dishonourable and disgraceful way because the fastest rising taxes in Australia are consumption taxes, the very taxes the Labor Party was not going to introduce, the very tax system the Labor Party said was a disgrace when it alleged that the Opposition was going to introduce one. </PARA>
<PARA> So what has happened to these consumption taxes that do not exist according to the Labor Party but which are eating money out of the pockets of Australian families? Under the Fraser Government sales taxes totalled about $3.49 billion-well under 10 per cent of total taxation revenue. What are they in the current Budget? They total $10.5 billion. They have trebled. There has been a three-fold increase in sales taxes while the cost of living has gone up only 65 per cent. It is incredible that this Government can come in here and show no embarrassment, no shame, no humiliation about this deceptive increase in the one tax it said would not exist under a Labor Government. The classic Labor lie is manifested here. Sales tax totals $10.5 billion and is the biggest single consumption tax that exists. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, that $10.5 billion is out of a total tax revenue of $91 billion-well over 10 per cent of total tax collections. How did the Labor Government get this increase? It was not, as the Labor Party would have us believe, just because of the indexing of excise-for example, beer excise going up automatically as the CPI goes up. That would only account for a 65 per cent rise. We have not had a 65 per cent rise; we have had a 200 per cent rise in consumption taxes. How has the Labor Party done it? Very simply. It has put a tax on orange juice, ice cream, kids' flavoured milk and snack foods. What are the sorts of things that Australian families tend to consume in fairly large quantities? Exactly those things on which the Labor Party has imposed the non-existent tax, the tax that it does not believe in and would not introduce. That is where the tax rises have taken place. </PARA>
<PARA> I am totally in favour of a correction, a fixing up, of the mess that has been made of the sales tax situation by successive governments. I believe it should be made fairer. I do not believe it is fair to do what this Government has done, which has been to put a tax on kids' orange juice and ice-cream but to leave pornographic magazines tax free. Thousand-dollar ball-gowns are tax free under this Government, but kids' ice-cream and orange juice are not. What sort of standards does this Government have? It says that it is totally opposed to consumption taxes. I wonder, when it avoids putting a sales tax on pornographic magazines, whether it is paying more attention to and having greater concern about the interests of the publishing houses of this country than the welfare of this country. I believe the vested interests that this Government seeks to serve consistently are evident from the nature of its laws, particularly in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, we have had a 200 per cent increase in sales tax revenues and a 64 per cent increase in the cost of living. On top of that there are all these additional taxes like the fringe benefits tax-you name it, and they have taxed it-and on top of all that, we have had the magnificent bracket creep that this Treasurer has specialised in and which has enabled him to produce such substantial surpluses in the Budget. As was pointed out by Mr Ian Wilson in the other place only last week, when one looks at the impact of bracket creep-this Government's subtle, sinister, underhand increase of the tax burden on Australian families-one sees a particularly distasteful sight. And this is after the so-called tax cuts that this Government is introducing in this legislation. The Treasurer claims that this new tax structure `more than offsets what is known as fiscal drag or bracket creep'. The Treasurer in his April economic statement went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, personal income taxpayers will now be paying less than if we had indexed the tax scales for inflation since 1983. </PARA>
<PARA>That is simply deliberately misleading. It deliberately distorts the truth. The truth is that tax revenues have increased far faster, as I have demonstrated from these figures, than the cost of living and the index that would be applied. The Treasurer is getting away with basically saying that, because there is a one-year delay in applying the impact of indexation, that one-year delay may well-and I have not checked the figures-have started to offset this enormous bracket creep. The fact is that, so long as inflation increases at a far lower rate than personal income tax, bracket creep is taking more and more out of Australian taxpayers' pockets. </PARA>
<PARA> This can be demonstrated quite clearly. This year, taxpayers on average annual earnings who have a dependent spouse and two dependent children will pay an estimated 16 per cent of their income in tax under Keating, under the so-called lower tax rates. According to Keating, people will be doing better than if the tax scales had been indexed as his tax cuts will more than offset bracket creep. People will be paying 16 per cent this year. What did they pay in the last year of the Fraser Government? They paid only 14.1 per cent of their income. In other words, a worker on average annual earnings, with a dependent spouse and two dependent children, has had his or her tax burden increased from 14.1 per cent to 16 per cent. That means that the tax burden on such a family has been increased by Labor by almost 14 per cent. Yet the Treasurer has the gall to make claims that are clearly deceptive and misleading. He claims that the tax burden on families has been reduced under this Government. That is simply untrue. </PARA>
<PARA> The same applies to taxpayers without dependants. The tax payable under the new Keating tax formula for someone on average annual earnings of $28,216 would be $6,813. Such a taxpayer on average earnings will pay 24.1 per cent of his or her income in tax. Under the Fraser Government in 1982-83, when average earnings were about $17,630 that taxpayer would have paid $4,038 in income tax, or only 22.9 per cent of his or her income. This is not simply an isolated case that I have selected. It is a universal truth that under this Government, despite its highly publicised tax cuts, the average family and the average taxpayer are paying far more of their income in tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Total tax revenues have massively increased. They are far higher-almost double the rate of inflation. Yet we are told by the Government, or at least by one of its senior Ministers, `Don't worry, we are going to have a big $5 billion tax cut next year, too'. The comments of the Minister for Social Security, Mr Howe, were reported in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on Tuesday this week. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government would probably repeat this year's $5.8 billion tax and family package next year, a senior Cabinet Minister revealed yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> In an interview with the Herald, the Minister for Social Security, Mr Howe, said it was likely that Labor would deliver a similar tax and family assistance package to the $5.8 billion handout announced in this year's April statement. </PARA>
<PARA>One would need something like a $5.8 billion handout next year to go at least part of the way in giving back to the taxpayers what this Government has raised in taxes. </PARA>

The only integrity that has been dented has been that of the Treasurer, in his asinine attempt to demolish this plan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the Labor Party's most senior Ministers is saying that the Government is going to provide a huge, apparently unfunded, tax cut next year. When challenged about it he went to water, but it was not merely a figment of his imagination. When Mr Howe was challenged about it he did not deny that such a matter was in the mind of someone in the Government. All he said was:</PARA>

<PARA>The Government may not have formally done so as a government, but one should not think that Mr Brian Howe dreamt this up one morning on the way to work. This is clearly being discussed within the senior Ministry. It is clearly a matter that is on the table. It is clearly a matter that deserves very close public scrutiny. If the Government is serious it will have to provide some costing. If the Government goes ahead with the crazy notion that it has had in the past, that tax cuts can be provided out of nothing, it will perpetuate this disastrous inflationary situation that is now destroying this country. Unless tax cuts are funded, those tax cuts are totally and absolutely worthless. They are ephemeral; they will disappear next year, and they will disappear largely through the very bracket creep that has already under the Hawke Government brought about a rate of rising taxes almost double the rate of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that the Australian people are prepared to put up with the phoneyness of that kind of transaction any more. I do not believe that the Australian public is prepared to believe the Government in this area. If the Government is going to do this at the expense of reducing the surplus rather than reducing its own expenditures, that will represent a loosening of fiscal policy. As the Reserve Bank of Australia has pointed out, a loosening of fiscal policy imposes a greater reliance on monetary policy, which simply means that the pressure is kept on for higher and higher interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the consequences of the Government's total failure to approach economic policy in a rational, coherent and competent way. We have seen it having to rely on interest rates going through the roof, pushing people out of their homes, destroying the viability of Australian families. We have seen the Government using the inflation rate to push people into higher and higher tax brackets, increasing the burden on Australian families. We have seen the Government in its incompetence destroying Australian export industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Our balance of payments is now a total disaster and we now have $2 billion a month deficits on our current account, and we have to borrow more and more from overseas, selling off more and more of the farm because there is nothing else for us to do. This has meant the forced sales of Australian assets so that we can keep paying the bill-and that bill is a huge one because of this Government's incompetence. It has set out on a clear pattern of economic policy which has resulted in higher inflation, which brings higher government revenues. Of course, those higher taxes help undermine the stability of the Australian family and the higher interest rates they bring undermine the stability of Australian business. It has bought whatever successes it has been able to claim at an untenable and appalling cost of putting Australia perpetually in debt in a way which will present the next government-which will take office whenever this Government gets around to having an election-with enormous problems. How fortunate we are that the present Opposition has the competence, the talent and the policies to resolve those problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Every Budget time, over the full period of this Government's mismanagement, we have outlined exactly what it was doing wrong. There is nothing new in what we are saying now. We have consistently warned it against proceeding down this track, against continuing with excessive government spending. That excessive spending was clearly evident in its first, second and third Budgets. Then it started to pull the reins in, but it was too little and too late. We have criticised every Budget on the same grounds. Every criticism is now being substantiated by what we see in the Australian economy right now. We warned that when Government did what we wanted-freed up the money markets, freed up the foreign exchange markets-it would impose a discipline on government that Mr Hawke and Mr Keating were not prepared to respond to. That discipline has not been imposed on this Government. It has dumped every tough decision. Mr Keating says, `But we have done some things'. But, as I said, that has always been in response to pressure from this side of the chamber. It is always too little and it is always too late. As a result, we have this awful situation from which Australia will find it so hard to emerge. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all very well to criticise the Government, but what will the Opposition do about it? As I mentioned earlier, the Reserve Bank pointed out that we cannot just rely on monetary policy, as it simply will not work, that we cannot restructure the Australian economy in the face of excessive inflation. Clearly, the thrust of the Opposition's policy is to get inflation down. We are determined in our fiscal policy to provide for smaller government, not the excessive government and the huge spending that has been the hallmark of this Government. It is all very well for people on the Government's front bench to point to reductions in the last couple of years. Those reductions became doubly necessary after the profligate, reckless, nonsensical behaviour of the first two or three Budgets that this Government introduced. In its first one, as I recall, having with great publicity announced a $1.3 billion cut in a May mini-Budget in 1983 it came out with $2.5 billion in extra spending. It hoped that people would notice that, instead of cutting spending, as its propaganda had it, it was in fact massively increasing government spending. And so it went on. </PARA>
<PARA> What will we be doing? We will be offering smaller government, privatisation of major government business enterprises and a larger Budget surplus. That means a tighter fiscal policy. That means taking the heat off interest rates and taking the heat off inflation. We will have the largest Budget surplus since comparable records have been kept. We will have tax relief that is fully funded by expenditure restraint, and that will exclude the proceeds of privatisation, which will go towards reducing the debt. In these difficult economic times tax relief will have to be limited to assisting those most disadvantaged by the Hawke-Keating Government, such as Australian families with children. Expenditure, including the proceeds of privatisation, is to be reduced to 22.5 per cent of gross domestic product, the lowest since 1964-65, the lowest for 25 years. Tax revenue is to be reduced to 24.3 per cent of GDP, the lowest for six years and there is a commitment to forego the increase in revenue because of bracket creep. That represents about $2.5 billion or so a year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to say a few words in this debate without unduly taking the time of the Senate. The Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill, the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill are in their own right matters of considerable importance because they relate to revenue and, more particularly, to taxation measures. The content and background of the Bills once again leads us inevitably into the whole question of where this nation of ours is going economically under the policies of the Hawke Government. During this week we have had lengthy debates on this during debate on the Appropriation Bills. Many of my colleagues and I have spoken about the economic crisis facing Australia not only in the period ahead but also now as a result of the quite massive economic mismanagement of the economy and related policy issues during the almost seven years of the Hawke Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not propose to go into the details of the Bills in the way that some of my colleagues have. I fully endorse the remarks that my colleague Senator Michael Baume has just made about the massive increase in revenue collections by this Government, a Government that has somehow or other held itself out to the Australian community as a lean, efficient Government that has managed to get revenues down. When one looks at the raw figures and takes account of the massive bracket creep that has occurred under the Government, one sees that the increase in taxation take has been unprecedented in this country's history. Far from having a government which over recent years has managed to keep taxation down, we have a government under which all forms of taxation, both direct and indirect, have increased massively. Senator Michael Baume mentioned the 150 per cent increase in sales tax take in recent years. The number of wage earners who are paying the 40 per cent rate of tax has increased staggeringly. The economic crisis facing small businesses, in particular, is positively horrendous due to the effect of taxation and interest rate increases. </PARA>
<PARA> In debate the other day I referred to statements by leading bankers in Australia who said that, if the present interest rate regime continues, over the next year we will see literally thousands of small businesses, efficient and otherwise, go to the wall because it is not possible for business to operate for any lengthy period under the interest rate and inflationary regime that is the hallmark of the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely. As my colleague Senator Stone says, we on our side of politics are proposing the abolition of the capital gains tax and its replacement with a very sensible, rational but reasonable speculative gains tax. We are being pilloried by the Government for doing that. The Government is really trying to pillory us for saying, `We want to do something about small business in this country. We want this country to grow again. We want to give incentive back to businesses to engage in a bit of effort and enterprise and produce a better result for us all'. Somehow or other this Government seems to think that there is something wrong with business making a profit and keeping some of the reward of that effort.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, as my colleague Senator Stone points out, the relationship between the Government and certain areas of the big business community-at the expense of every other section of the community-requires the closest investigation. If as much investigation were put into that as the Government puts into running around trying to protect its flanks, there would be some very interesting revelations indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not generally realised by many in the community just how serious are the problems facing Australia. Not only in the short term but, even more so, in the medium and longer terms, as a result of the cumulative policies of this Government during the past six and a half years, Australia faces the biggest economic crisis that it has ever faced, certainly since World War II. There is no doubt at all about that when one considers the basic underlying position of this economy. </PARA>
<PARA> For some time Australia has had the highest level of interest rates in the whole of the Western world, together with the highest inflation rate of most Western countries for a period of years. In fact, during the period of the Hawke Government, Australia has had a record for having the highest level of inflation relative to its major trading partners that it has ever had in its history. Australia is now more uncompetitive on a cost and price basis with its major trading partners than it has ever been for such a lengthy period. That is some record. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's record in the interest rate game is exactly the same. It is no wonder that the major international credit rating agencies have down graded Australia's credit rating twice in the past three years. The implications of that for the future, as well as for the present, are very significant indeed. It is not just a down-grading of the credit rating of the Government as a borrower; it is a down-grading of our credit rating as a nation, and that affects every borrower in the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> If there were any sign that we were getting out of this malaise-this crisis-perhaps one might take some comfort from that. However, the sad, the serious and the staggering thing is that, after those years of economic mismanagement, the situation shows no sign of improving. Indeed, it shows every sign of getting worse. Australia is running a balance of payments deficit on current account of an average of $2 billion a month. When the Hawke Government came to office, if our balance of payments deficit had been $2 billion a year on a regular basis, we would have said that we had a problem. The absolute and cumulative increases in our balance of payments deficit has created for us a debt to the rest of the world which is five times higher than it was when the Hawke Government came to power. At that time, our debt to the rest of the world was about $24 billion. Now, our debt to the rest of the world is $108 billion, which is almost a 400 per cent increase. It is five times as large now as it was then. </PARA>
<PARA> Our ability to grow as an economy and to raise our living standards is enormously impacted because it now takes about 20 per cent of our exports to service our gross foreign debt-20 per cent of every dollar from the wool, wheat or what have you that we sell goes simply into servicing our foreign debt. When the Hawke Government came to office-that is, in the last year of the Fraser Government-the figure was 5 per cent. There is a huge difference between using 5 per cent and using 20 per cent of one's export income to service one's foreign debt in terms of the capacity to raise, or for that matter maintain, basic living standards. If we cannot pay our way to the rest of the world, something has to give and what has been giving progressively has been our living standards and our capacity to build for the future. Our savings rate is abysmally low. Our real level of investment is abysmally low. So not only are we having current problems but also we are storing up future enormous problems because we are not putting ourselves in a position to be able to take the next leap forward as we should be doing. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only is the volume of our debt to the rest of the world of major concern but so is its composition. About one-third of our foreign borrowings are supplied by short term lenders who are coming to Australia only because of our excessively high interest rates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. When we look at the totality of the Government's economic policies over the last seven years and when we look at where we are as an economy in the world today compared with where we were in 1982-83, despite the fact that that was a year of major world recession and despite the fact that we were therefore having to live in a much more difficult international environment than we do today, we see that there is no denying the fact that as a nation we have gone backwards very significantly in world stakes in both absolute terms so far as our standard of living is concerned and relative terms compared with our major trading partners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no doubt at all-it cannot be denied and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is making a dreadful mess of trying to deny it-that the problems and the major crisis we are now facing are due wholly and solely to the mismanagement by, and the disastrous economic and related policies of, this Government. They are due to the refusal by this Government to make the necessary decisions not only in the area of macro-economic policies, but also in the area of micro-economic reform, where the rhetoric has been huge and the performance has been nil. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the reasons why we have the fundamental problems we have today. Those are the reasons why the coalition has proposed a set of taxation and related economic proposals-both macro and micro-to tackle those fundamental problems. It has been very encouraging to see the Treasurer running around with the coalition's Economic Action Plan in his hand during the last three weeks. He has been trying to shoot it down and has not got within a kilometre of the target. Hopefully, at least, he might be reading it because, if he does, he will learn something about the way that economic policies ought to be proposed and conducted if we are to tackle those fundamental problems that face our community. </PARA>
<PARA> Of all the sections in the Australian community that have been most bludgeoned by the policies of this Government-and every section has been-the two that stand out above all the rest are families and small businesses. The basic thrust of the proposals contained in the coalition's Economic Action Plan is directed at those two groups and, through them, the wider community and, therefore, the wider economy. If we do not specifically tackle the problems facing families and small businesses in the short term, we will not allow them virtually to survive in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA> The major proposals that the coalition has put forward to assist families will cost the revenue a little over $2 billion. Those proposals comprise a system of child tax rebates designed specifically to help parents with young families, at a cost to the revenue of $1,000m. That is assisted, in turn, by a system of tax rebates for child-care at an estimated full year cost of $820m. On top of that, there will be changes to the dependent spouse rebate to give benefit to families with a dependent spouse through a rebate system, at a cost of $200m. That is the main package of proposals for assistance to families in the short term. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as small business is concerned, the coalition will abolish the Australian Labor Party's enormously damaging capital gains tax and replace it with a tax on certain capital gains-because we realise that a tax on certain capital gains is important and equitable. But the coalition will not be saying, as this Government has, to a small business or any other investor who has worked hard to build up an asset, `If you work hard and build up a productive asset and you want to dispose of it several years down the track, we will take most of the results of your hard labour by capital gains tax at the marginal rate of tax'. We will say that only speculative gains will be taxed, in the first year at 100 per cent of the real realised gain, phasing out by 20 per cent a year so that after five years there would be no capital gains tax on the realisation of an asset. It will cost the revenue, compared with the present situation, $450m in a full year, but it is an equitable decision. It is a proposal that is designed to encourage business to invest, save and build-particularly small businesses, and particularly small businesses that are being crippled at the moment by the high interest rate regime. That will give small businesses an incentive to get themselves up and, through doing that, get the economy growing again. </PARA>
<PARA> The significant thing about the coalition's Economic Action Plan package is that it is very carefully costed and is fully funded, which is a fundamental point. That should be compared with the outrageous statement made earlier this week by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) that this Government will give the taxpayers and wage earners of Australia another $6 billion deal next year without 1c of it being funded. If that were to happen, the already enormous economic problems we have would be compounded. Obviously, that cannot be done with any measure of responsibility at all. That is not to say the Government will not do it, because everything the Government has done over the last six years has been irresponsible. If the Government were to do this, it would blow this economy even further out of the water. </PARA>
<PARA> I bet it will not do it because what Mr Howe was doing the other day was trying to join the Treasurer in the propaganda stakes race, because they are desperate about the electoral prospects of the Government during the next few months as it faces an election. Indeed, Mr Howe's outburst was absolutely typical of the actions of this Government in its decision-making processes during recent months. The whole decision-making process of this Government seems to have gone completely off the rails in recent months. The decisions that have been made are nothing more than cynical, vote buying, populist actions. As far as Coronation Hill and the handling of the pilots dispute--</PARA>

But the airline has not had a word with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) because the Prime Minister is telling us, `There ain't no dispute at all'. What absolute nonsense. Who does the Prime Minister think he is fooling? It is typical of the whole process of the Government's decision-making machinery at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This was highlighted by a speech made at a conference in Sydney yesterday by a senior Minister of the Government. Actually I happened to be there, and it was very interesting. Mr Kerin made a speech essentially related to the Government's decision making in the area of not the environment but industrial development. The title of Mr Kerin's speech was, `The Government's Role and Responsibility in Safeguarding Industry Development'. He was really saying that the environmentalists have captured the Government and have captured the debate in the area of industry development, and that the Government has gone to water in front of them and in the face of them and is taking decisions without any due and proper regard to all the factors involved. Let me quote one paragraph from this speech, which I commend to all honourable senators as a speech that we ought to read. This paragraph in particular struck me. Mr Kerin said:</PARA>
<PARA>To my mind, governments need most of all to have consistent policy responses to the environmental puzzles they are faced with, rather than be seen to be reacting to each and every environmental group and its demands. If they don't, they are not acting as a government, nor are they engaging in the debate in the most responsible manner. People want governments to set the agenda and take balanced decisions. Politics is not just about the art of the possible, it is also about the peaceful resolution of conflict and it is also about giving leadership. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kerin was saying, very rightly-and he could not have made it any more overt-that this Government, of which he is a senior Minister, has not given leadership; it has caved in to individual groups in the community and it has adopted a populist, soft options approach in a blatant attempt to buy votes for the next election. As we on this side of the chamber have said time and time again, that is not going to work for the Government. In the process of it not working, the Government is taking decisions which are leading Australia down the road to economic ruin. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, the Coronation Hill decision relates to an area in which no mining will now be allowed. It is an area whose mineral wealth is estimated at something of the order of $7,000m. This Government has bowed to pressure groups and refused to allow the mining of Coronation Hill to go ahead. Of course, this is an area in which mining took place right through the 1950s and the 1960s. We are not talking about some pristine, virgin bit of land; we are talking about something that was mined for two whole decades. I am told that it is one square kilometre of land in a non-environmentally sensitive area, anyway, of 25,000 square kilometres. I am told that the area of land in question at Coronation Hill is something like a tenth of the size of the Parliament House precinct. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I realise that I am not on the list of speakers, but I just want to say a few words about the third Bill in this trilogy, the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1989. I do agree with the previous three speakers, Senator Michael Baume, Senator Jim Short and Senator John Stone. I know it is a mixed metaphor, but it is becoming increasingly obvious that the ship of state is running off the rails.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Medicare Levy Amendment Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on 6 October and debated, if it could be called that, on 24 October. The Bill itself is simple enough. All it does is fix the levy at 1.25 per cent of taxable income and it raises the threshold below which people will not be levied for Medicare. However, the Opposition's amendment itself was substantive. I note from Hansard of 25 October at page 1854 that when it was brought into the House the debate took up a well-spaced half of one column. The record indicates that the debate was resumed from 6 September, on motion by Mr Peter Morris that the Bill be now read a second time. Mr Shack moved:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after ``That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> ``whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) expresses its concern that despite its increasing cost Medicare is delivering a lower level of health care, particularly to the poor and needy;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) condemns changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme which will rob the community of high quality pharmaceutical services;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) calls upon the Government to ensure that all Australians receive the high quality, affordable health care to which they are entitled''. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr McGauran seconded the amendment. The next line states, `Amendment negatived'. The original question was resolved in the affirmative and the Bill was read a second time. That is the most cavalier treatment of legislation that one could imagine. It is happening with increasing frequency in the House of Representatives. It is leading to a deluge of legislation that is being rammed through the House over there and piling up here in the Senate. It is a virtual rape of the democratic process. That is the reason why this Senate is so busy and has to sit for so long. It is also the reason why all our committees are saturated with Bills that have to be examined. A lot of the legislation is ill-prepared and is likely to have unintended consequences, as we have seen in the past. At the moment the Senate has a select committee inquiring into medical insurance. That is an enormous job. It will probably take until next March to conclude that inquiry. In the meantime, Medicare marches on. </PARA>
<PARA> Although this Medicare Levy Amendment Bill will be welcomed by people in the lower income brackets, it certainly will not do anything to help Medicare. In fact, it will be a hindrance to it because at the moment the levy does not cover the cost of Medicare. So the Bill will not help Medicare but it will help a few people. I am concerned about the treatment that such Bills are receiving in the House of Representatives. They are obviously not allowing any debate on amendments. All the Opposition can do is table its amendments, and then the Bill gets rammed through the House. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not moving that particular amendment in the Senate that the Opposition moved in the other place. The Democrats, I note, have an amendment which picks up the central point of our amendment and, as I understand it, the Opposition will support the Democrats' amendment in relation to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> At the end of listening to the debate, though, I must say that the Government cannot agree with the amendment that has been moved by the Opposition to the motion that the Bill be now read a second time, nor is it persuaded, having listened very carefully, that it might support the amendment that has been moved by the Australian Democrats to the same motion. Therefore we will oppose each of those amendments and seek the support of the chamber in giving a second reading to the package of Bills before the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition I wish to move an amendment to the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1989, which has been circulated to all honourable senators. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Page 4, clause 4, after proposed subsection 221ec (9), add the following new sub-section:</PARA>
<PARA> `` `(10) This section does not apply to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a public hospital;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a public benevolent institution;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) a public university.''. </PARA>
<PARA>Speaking to that amendment, I point out the rationale for the inclusion of clause 221ec in the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill. The first part of this Bill deals with group employers who have group remittances totalling $5m or more in a financial year. Applying Mr Keating's rationale that these people pay their group tax twice monthly rather than once monthly, as is currently the case, he said that it is wrong that public funds should be used by companies or other organisations for company or private purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, has always been very strong on adopting a consistent rationale or logic in pursuing legislation and legislative claims in this House. We wish to take up that assertion. In doing so, we acknowledge in our amendment that the organisations named in our amendment use public funds for public and community purposes. By applying that logic, it is only reasonable that the Government should agree with us and the Australian Democrats, who are joining with us in this amendment, by voting for this reasonable amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of organisations and people, not surprisingly, have said to us that we should extend it to, say, private hospitals, which are non-profit making organisations, or maybe to local government and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, which is a public body. But to do so would be to depart from this strict rationale or criterion which we are told is the logic or purpose behind the legislation in the first place. Therefore, it is only reasonable that the Government, applying its own logic and criteria, should agree to this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government fails to acknowledge this amendment to a machinery Bill that does no more than rearrange the collection of the money-and the Government is treating it as a taxing Bill-it would be quite abhorrent, because the Government would be using a backdoor approach. The Government acknowledges that, as a result of these new arrangements, there is an interest saving of $20m per annum. We acknowledge that sometimes in a rearrangement these sorts of situations can occur. But at the same time, if one applies purely strict logic, as Senator Cooney and all other people who use logic and reason would have to apply in a consistent approach to the reason for the legislation in the first place-and we do not walk away from that approach but would ask the Government to acknowledge that in these amendments-we believe that it is unreasonable, unfair, unjust and in fact preposterous not to include public hospitals. After all, there are about 70 public hospitals all around Australia. There are not many benevolent institutions, so the Government is not going to lose much money there because they will not be big enough. It is only the big institutions and universities, is it not, because they gain Commonwealth moneys for public purposes? I think it is very difficult for the Government to deny these worthy institutions-applying its logic to the reason for the Bill in the first place-and not support this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, I hoped that we might have had a bit more time to persuade the Government. I think the Government is likely to give a knee-jerk reaction and say, `No, we will oppose the amendment'. In opposing the amendment, the legislation will go down to the other House and will then come back again. It is not a taxing measure. We are not taking money away because, as I mentioned, it is a machinery Bill; it is just rearranging the collection of tax. It has an indirect effect. If the Government is using this measure as a taxing Bill, then it is a disgrace. It is morally wrong and outrageous to use the back-door methods that it will be attempting to apply to get extra revenue from public hospitals and public universities which, according to its logic, the Government should not be doing. </PARA>
<PARA> I now wish to draw the Committee's attention to a second feature. Unfortunately, this second feature does cross the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill. It concerns me that in the financial impact statement-and we have one financial impact statement for the package of Bills, although at the present time we are debating them in the committee stage separately-there is a lack of consistency in the criteria that are being applied to that financial impact statement. I seek the indulgence of the Committee, therefore, to draw comparisons between the application of financial impact criteria in this Bill and the other two Bills which were a part of a cognate debate. In this package of Bills, inconsistency and a lack of standards apply to the presentation of the financial impact statement in relation to the legislation before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I am grateful for a briefing that I received from my friend and colleague in the other House Mr Allan Rocher, the honourable member for Curtin. He has been pursuing this matter for quite some time. In pointing out the different criteria which apply to the financial impact statement, I address first the issues in the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill. The financial impact statement, for the year 1989-90 the gain to revenue, as a result of the introduction of these twice-monthly pay as you earn remittances, is $550m. This will enable a $20m reduction in public debt. When we pursue the next part of this section, which deals with the changes to payment of provisional taxes, we are not given an estimate of how much less revenue will ensue. It will be less because we are told that the public debt interest for 1989 will as a result increase by $20m. If we express this in commercial terms, the effects of the first two changes to the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill, which is the Bill currently before us, will be in the first case an additional $500m principal, accompanied by a saving of $20m interest, and in the second case, where we are not told the amount of principal although principal there must be, interest on that unknown amount will be an additional $20m. So there is a lack of logic there. </PARA>
<PARA> When we come to the second Bill, we note that the financial impact statement sets out a reduction of $160m in revenue anticipated as a result of the uplift factor. One might recall that the uplift factor has been dropped to 10 per cent. In my speech during the second reading stage I said that I thought there was a better case for that uplift factor being no more than the projected or budgeted current rate of inflation. But that is not the point. In relation to this provisional tax figure for 1989-90, no public debt interest figure is given. The third measure in this package of Bills will have a notable financial impact. By reducing the amount to be added on to the assessable income of taxpayers subjected to provisional tax to 10 per cent from the present 11 per cent or 12 per cent, the explanatory memorandum stipulates only an estimated reduction in revenue to be collected of some $160m. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, in the first case, the effect on public debt interest is given; in the second case the effect on revenue and public debt interest is given; and in third case only the effect on revenue is given. Therefore, even though we are dealing with a package of Bills which have a common theme, we are looking at different criteria and providing different information to the taxpayers and the Senate. This is unfortunate as it could be quite misleading. If we continue to do this, I submit that the financial impact statements are not having their intended meaning. Instead of providing useful and meaningful information, we are providing misleading information because we do not have a standard by which to present the same criteria. This is unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to draw attention to another aspect in this committee stage. The Opposition finds it is very difficult to support legislation which is drawn up in such a loose fashion; in other words, legislation is not drawn as tightly as it should be. If this legislation is passed-and it will be passed, with the amendment I have proposed, thereby excluding public hospitals, public benevolent institutions and public universities-companies will nevertheless be able to drive a chariot through the thin fabric of this legislation. Companies will pay their people, not on or before the fourteenth of the month, because under the legislation payment has to be remitted within seven days, but on the fifteenth of the month. Therefore the companies will be given 22 days in which to pay. Some companies will be caught up in the mesh but the more astute ones will rearrange their payments in such a way as to avoid much of the so-called savings that this Government intends to make. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation could have been drawn much more tightly to overcome that situation. If something must be done, the Government should propose income tax legislation that is so complex that nobody can understand it, but legislation that is going to hold up. It should not allow the astute and clever boys, the people with the good accountants, to be able to get around it while others get caught. I hope that the Government will think about this further. I think that it might come back, in the not too distant future, with some amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise very briefly to state again, as we did in the second reading stage of the debate, that the Australian Democrats are convinced by the arguments that Senator Watson has advanced in relation to these three specific amendments to clause 4 of the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1989.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has listened very carefully to Senator Watson's proposal, but it is not really persuaded of the desirability to accept the amendments. In general, I think it is understood that the money deducted from the salary or wages of an employee obviously is not money belonging to the employer. I am sure that Senator Watson would agree with that. The employer could be said to be in the position of a trustee holding the employee's money in order to ensure that the Commonwealth gets its money. In a sense, it is the employee's money in transit to the Commonwealth, whose money it is, because the tax has been levied.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Watson" NAMEID="VJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator Watson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We don't dispute that. That is not the point.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is the point. The real point is that the money at issue could probably be properly characterised as the Commonwealth's money. It is the employee's money being held by the employer on the way to the Commonwealth. It is the tax that is due to the Commonwealth under the laws passed by this Parliament. I understood Senator Watson to be saying that, since most of these institutions are recipients of Commonwealth funding, why do we not take advantage of the fact that they can use the moneys that they are holding on behalf of their employees and make a few dollars by way of a few short term investments or something like that? The argument is that this will help those good institutions, be they universities, hospitals or some other public institution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think Senator Stone would agree that if the Commonwealth is to make money available to public institutions such as hospitals, universities or whatever, it should be very much up front; it should be easily identified by the community. It should be well understood that the Commonwealth is making $200,000 more per year available, for instance, to the University of Tasmania, to a public hospital in Perth, or whatever it may be. There should not be this sort of indirect means of Commonwealth funding which Senator Watson seems to be suggesting should continue to be countenanced, whereby these institutions can hold funds for a period which would allow them to invest and, therefore, as I understand it, either have some extra money made available to them or, at the very least, reduce the necessity for the Commonwealth to provide direct funding to help that institution undertake a particular expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that is good public policy. I am sure that when Senator Stone puts the National Party's point of view he will make it clear that he does not think that that is good public policy. It should not be done indirectly in this way. The money should be paid to the Commonwealth. If the Commonwealth deems fit, in full public view and open to public scrutiny, it should make those moneys available to the public institutions concerned. That is why I do not find Senator Watson's argument as convincing as, apparently, the Australian Democrats have at first blush. I think that when they read the Hansard record of my remarks over the next few weeks if the legislation returns to this place, they may think that my refutation has some merit. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter raised by Senator Watson was a bit more technical. I hope he will excuse me if I read a comment that has been provided by the advisers. They say: concerning the quarterly provisional tax, this change does not have an effect on the Budget revenue for the year. Provisional tax money is collected in the same year of income. Instead of being collected by four instalments, the provisional tax payable is collected in a lump sum. The collection occurs in the same income year. The public debt interest cost occurs because of the timing of the collection-a lump sum in April-June, instead of payments in August, November, February or April. I pass that to Senator Watson for his consideration. As I say, it is a technical matter which I cannot argue very convincingly, but I hope that it is of some assistance to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to say something in response to Senator Tate's comments regarding what might, in normal circumstances, be thought to be an appropriate manner of structuring Commonwealth accounts. Ordinarily, I would be inclined to agree with him, when one has to choose between providing finances to, in this case, public hospitals or public universities by a specific appropriation up front-I think those were the words used by Senator Tate-in the Budget. Therefore, it is discernible when one examines the outlays side of the Budget, and, in a sense, it is accountable. I think that was the core of his point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would, in general circumstances, tend to agree with that view, as distinct from the process of providing some hidden subsidy or, in this case, what might be called a tax expenditure form of financial assistance to the bodies concerned. I think that we should note that what we are dealing with is not a generality of that kind. We are dealing here with a specific piece of gimmickry by the Federal Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the 1989-90 Budget. In order to make the Budget figuring look better, in order to make it appear that he was after all tightening fiscal policy by increasing the size of the surplus, at the last moment the Treasurer has brought into the Budget a couple of major gimmicks, one of which is the matter we are discussing in the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1989, namely, the decision to require what one might loosely call large employers-that is, employers with a pay as you earn deduction payroll amounting to more than $5m per annum-to remit to the Commissioner of Taxation payments twice-monthly rather than once-monthly. As the financial impact provisions of the explanatory memorandum spell out, and indeed as the Budget spells out, this will bring in $550m this financial year. The financial impact statement quite rightly describes it thus:</PARA>
<PARA> This gain is in the form of a one off bring forward of revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, as I said before, it is a piece of gimmickry, designed to make the Treasurer's Budget for this year look fiscally more responsible than it is. That is the situation that we are dealing with today. I hope that the Minister does not get up in this place and quote to me general statements of fiscal principle about how a government should present its accounts, when what we are dealing with is a piece of non-principled fiscal policy from the Treasurer of this country, who once again this week has demonstrated his total lack of principle with his infamous behaviour in the House of Representatives in bringing forward charges which he cannot substantiate and which indeed he knows cannot be correct. </PARA>
<PARA> In the instance in question concerning the charges over the manner in which the Opposition came to formulate its capital gains tax policy, the Treasurer knows, because it is a matter of public record, that the decisions in question had been not only taken but also publicly announced 12 months before the share dealings which he alleges to have been the basis for those decisions were even contemplated. Yet we have a Minister in this place standing up and asking us to affirm our views of principle about how a government should structure its accounts-when we are dealing with a government which in this area is led by a Treasurer who only this week has demonstrated his total lack of principle and who has not yet had the courage to get up in the House of Representatives and apologise, as any man would do. </PARA>
<PARA> I make no bones about saying to the Senate that I feel deeply about that, having served for 30 years Treasurers of this country of various political persuasions who all had their good points and their bad points; and I do not recall that any one of them, from either side of politics, would have behaved as Mr Keating has behaved this week. I can assure the Government that this is not the last it will hear of this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the Bill, I simply want to say that, for the reasons I have stated, we are not dealing with what one might normally call a question of principle about the presentation of the Government's accounts; we are dealing with a piece of gimmickry by the Treasurer. Unfortunately, this piece of gimmickry will this year have the unfortunate result-no doubt another one of those unintended consequences for which this Government has become notorious-of impacting in a strongly adverse manner upon the finances of a number of bodies, details of which Senator Watson has quite rightly brought to our attention: in particular, public hospitals, public universities and, indeed more generally, public benevolent institutions. Perhaps not many institutions in the last category will fall within the $5m criterion but, nevertheless, the Opposition considered it wisest to include that category also on the assumption that some might. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply say to the Minister that, notwithstanding in the general sense the quite proper point which he made and which in other circumstances one would probably not want to contest, the Opposition believes that there is a real problem here. Since this is a one-off matter we believe that the matter should be addressed. I note the Minister's statement that the Government will not accept the amendment. However, I hope that the Government will reconsider the matter before the Bill comes back from the other place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must despair at the quality of the advice that has been given to the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), because the Minister, as a highly principled man, would on reflection know that the majority, if not all, of the public hospitals operate under what are known as deficit financing arrangements-that is, they are always in the red, with funding from government being in arrears rather than in advance, and that they are therefore faced with making interest payments on that overdraft at interest rates currently between 20.25 per cent and 24.75 per cent. I say this in all good faith because I think on reflection the Minister would realise that they operate thus-but the Minister is telling the chamber that these organisations are investing this group money for their benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The whole effect would be to reduce the interest payments, if they are operating under deficit financing. With respect, I ask the Minister to give some further consideration to this matter. I do not ask the Minister to withdraw the measure, but I think that as a principled man he would realise that these public hospitals, perhaps about 70 of them around Australia, actually do operate under this deficit financing arrangement, which requires overdraft accommodation. They are public institutions serving the community and they do follow that rationale. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I formally table amendments to the Privacy Amendment Bill. These amendments are the result of consultations with the credit reporting industry and consumer and privacy groups. They are also the result of peak representative groups sitting down with the Government to fine tune the Bill so that a statutory framework of regulation could be developed for the industry which protects individuals' privacy and, at the same time, permits legitimate commercial practices in relation to credit information handling. These amendments have been discussed since June and were made available to the Opposition parties and to the public formally on 5 October.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before moving to some brief comments on the more significant amendments proposed, I must say that we should not forget why the Bill was originally introduced back in June. Its prime purpose was to prevent the development by the credit industry of a system of credit reporting called positive reporting. The industry had announced that it would be introducing that system this year. It was incumbent on the Government to move speedily to clarify its policy position in relation to positive reporting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The industry said that it would, and after discussion we got it to defer. It deferred until next January in fact. The Government did not want the industry making an unnecessary capital investment. The introduction of the Bill clarified that position. I consider that the term `positive reporting' is misleading. I prefer the term `personal profiling' because I consider that that really reflects the intrusion into individuals' lives which would have occurred if that system had been allowed to develop in Australia. As I stated in my second reading speech, the Government does not consider that there is any proven substantial benefit from the positive reporting proposals and that in view of the strong privacy concerns held by the community this massive expansion of the extent of information held about individuals should not be allowed to develop.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill has received considerable critical attention. The amendments which are to be moved will clarify aspects of the proposed regulatory scheme. In addition, I consider that the code of conduct to be developed by the Privacy Commissioner, in consultation with the credit industry and consumer groups, will provide a blueprint for the daily operations of industry practices for the handling of personal credit information. </PARA>
<PARA> A considerable number of the amendments are technical amendments which will clarify the rights of individuals and the duties imposed on credit providers and credit reporting agencies in relation to their responsibility for the proper handling of individuals' personal information. The classes of business that will be able to obtain access to a credit reporting agency under the Bill will be widened. Credit information will be able to be used to assist credit providers in combating serious credit infringements and in collecting debts. Commercial and consumer credit reports will be able to be cross-referenced by credit providers when making lending decisions. A number of other technical amendments will significantly lessen the regulatory burden placed on the central credit reporting database. I indicate that I have tabled the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to say a few words about the handling of the Privacy Amendment Bill because it has been handled as badly as any legislation in the eight years that I have been in this place. This morning the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) brought into the chamber wholesale amendments that changed the whole structure of the original Bill that he introduced. In effect, we just heard from him a second second reading speech to deal with the huge package of amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister was correct when he said that a copy of the amendments was forwarded to the Opposition last month, but the amendments were not available to individual senators who are interested in the matter until this morning. They were not available in the Table Office last night and, on inquiry, it was found that they had not yet been authorised by the Minister. I looked at them briefly this morning and they appear to be much the same as those circulated previously, with some small alterations, but obviously we need to assess them carefully. </PARA>
<PARA> In effect, the Minister has sought to merge two Bills into one Bill. We have had two second reading speeches, the second one having been given this morning in relation to the package of amendments. It will not therefore be surprising that the chamber is very much confused about what is occurring. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is so. The original Bill was introduced without any consultation with the industry. It was believed to be politically opportune. There was a chance of winning some political points from some of the civil liberties organisations and the Government rushed in in an effort to gain what was therefore seen as a political advantage. It lodged its Bill in this place and then the industry pointed out to the Government how unworkable the whole scheme was and how it should have been given proper consideration in the first instance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of that, the Government then went back to the industry, did what it should have done before introducing the Bill in the first instance, and then said, `Put us right'. In some instances, the industry has now put the Government right-as far as I could work out from this great package of amendments-and some of the changes are in accordance not only with the industry's wishes, but also with what we said should have been included within the original Bill. We will argue that it does not go as far as it should. It is now a mess. The proposed legislation should be withdrawn and the Government should sort out what it wants in the area of privacy and put into the chamber one Bill which covers the matters that it wishes to cover and which the chamber can then debate. </PARA>
<PARA> From glancing at the second explanatory memorandum, which relates to the Government's foreshadowed amendments, it seems to me that it is even longer than the first. That is not the way in which the Government should operate. It is not its function to introduce a second Bill, in effect, in the form of amendments at the committee stage. It does not allow for a proper debate by the Senate, which should be appalled at the way in which the Government has handled the matter. The Government could have expected a complex committee stage consideration of this matter; it will now be much more complicated and the new issues raised by the Government's amendments will have to be explored at that stage. The end result of poor handling such as we have seen exhibited today is that the debate will take longer. As I said, it becomes more confusing and it does no-one any good, least of all those seeking to follow the debate or who have a particular interest in the subject matter. An enormous number of people in business and industry, in particular, have an interest in what the Government is seeking to achieve by the proposed legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill-I refer principally to the first Bill, not the Government's amendments-deals with credit reference reporting. As I said, we find it unsatisfactory. We found it absolutely unsatisfactory in the first instance, we still believe it is unsatisfactory, and we will oppose it. As I indicated, there will be a comprehensive committee stage consideration when we will move extensive amendments to the Bill; in other words, if it gets a second reading in this place we will then do our best to put it into a satisfactory form. </PARA>
<PARA> To put the Bill in context, it is necessary for me to say something about the process of credit reporting with which the Bill deals. I will then explain in more specific terms our objections to the Bill as it is presently drawn. Credit reference reporting is the process of keeping information about the creditworthiness of individuals and businesses so that commercial enterprises may decide whether to give credit to them or have other commercial dealings with them. Banks and financial institutions, for example, regularly get a credit check on potential borrowers before lending the money. Firms that hire out vehicles and equipment check on potential hirers. Real estate agents, who do not seem to have been covered by the amendments foreshadowed, obtain checks on potential tenants. Sellers of goods and services make similar checks before they extend credit. Debt collectors use such services to locate missing debtors. Insurance companies use them to prevent fraud because, if an insured person is making a claim and is heavily in debt or has a long line of similar claims, the claim may be a fraudulent one and, at least, one that should be looked at closely. </PARA>
<PARA> Credit checking is so widespread that it is now a regular and essential ingredient in all commercial activities. I understand that about 98 per cent of credit reference reporting on individuals in Australia is done by a company known as the Credit Reference Association of Australia Ltd, CRAA. The CRAA is owned by its 4,800 members who are the major public utilities, banks, finance companies, department stores, credit unions, building societies, insurance companies, credit card companies and many manufacturing and trading companies. Credit reference reporting was originally done by manual means, keeping handwritten card indexes on customers. Over the years it has expanded to the extent that CRAA now operates a sophisticated computerised system in all States. Its database now holds records on over 10 million individuals and businesses. Its members make about seven million inquiries a year about people or businesses to whom they are thinking of extending credit or lending money. In October 1988, for example, 534,000 inquiries were made, an increase of 80 per cent since October 1984. I have demonstrated the very widespread industries and commercial undertakings in this country that are dependent upon the system, the very extensive use that is made of the system, and the fact that the use is increasing at a rapid rate. </PARA>
<PARA> I will say a few words about CRAA's method of operation because it becomes important when looked at in terms of the Government's Bill. The CRAA has gradually built up files on people and businesses to whom credit has been extended. The files, which are really print-outs, are based upon information sent in from CRAA members on defaults, public record information such as bankruptcy orders and judgments, company records and insurance claims. In addition, when members of the CRAA make inquiries about individual debtors, those inquiries are also recorded. From all of that information files are built up on credit customers so that, when a member comes to make an inquiry about a person to decide whether to lend money or to extend credit, that member has access to a lot of accumulated information. Access to that information enables CRAA members to make a more enlightened decision on whether or not a person is a good credit risk, which is really what the whole process is all about. The CRAA also makes the point that having access to that information enables the lender to make a decision in the best interests of the borrower. In other words, it can prevent a borrower getting too far into debt and, sometimes, into a situation in which the borrower will be unable to repay the debt. That is not only in the interests of the credit provider but also in the interests of the debtor. </PARA>
<PARA> Who may have access to the files is an important question that was raised in the public debate before the Bill was introduced. It was raised also in the nature of the draft legislation. Of course, members of the CRAA have access to the files. They effect that access by telephone calls to the CRAA, by computer-to-computer links and by personal computers using the telephone network. Most access these days is obtained by computer links rather than by telephone calls. The CRAA operator or the computer brings up the individual's file and provides the member with a copy of it. The member then has to make his own commercial judgment based on the information that is provided by the CRAA. Members who improperly use information on the files or who do not comply with the secrecy rules of the CRAA face expulsion. </PARA>
<PARA> Consumers who have been refused credit also have a right to access their own files, which is worth emphasising particularly. They have the right to access their own files free of charge to see what it is on their files that has led to credit being refused. Quite apart from that, any person on whom records are kept has access to his own file at any time. That access is given upon payment of a fee of $5 for a computer printout of one's own file. </PARA>
<PARA> The insurance information service that is also operated by the CRAA holds information on approximately three million insurance claims. Its function is to give insurers information about claims that have been made in the past together with other credit information, thereby reducing the possibility of fraudulent claims being made in the future. The CRAA maintains that access to that information prevents insurance premiums from rising, because fraud is a major component in the cost of insurance premiums. </PARA>
<PARA> The CRAA maintains that its security is good because it has strict limits on who may gain access to the database. It claims also to have good physical security over its operations and an extensive system of verification of the data that it holds. It also examines closely applicants for membership and monitors the way in which its members use the service. As I said a moment ago, the ultimate penalty for breaches is expulsion from the Association. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of what information is on the files is also important. The CRAA has its own rules on the information that it keeps and the information that it will not keep. It keeps records only of financial matters that are relevant to the decision of whether to extend credit or relevant to other commercial decisions that its members have to make. It does not keep information on matters such as race; national origins; political, social or religious beliefs; lifestyle or sexual practices. It does not allow its information to be used for private investigation purposes or pre-employment checks, nor does it generate or sell direct mailing lists based on its information. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister mentioned positive reporting as opposed to negative reporting as a justification for the urgency of the introduction of the Bill, which was totally misleading. It was made clear at that conference on this subject, which a number of senators attended, that this legislation would not be introduced without a thorough and widespread public debate and that it was in the interests of the industry to assess public attitude to the extension of the existing system to positive reporting. </PARA>
<PARA> The present system of credit reporting that is used by the CRAA is known as negative reporting because it shows bad credit records, that is, non-payment, rather than good or-in the jargon of this debate-positive payment records. As I said, some commercial organisations want to move to positive reporting, which will record all or most of a person's current financial commitments and will show the good news of regular payments. Its advocates claim that positive reporting is needed to balance a bad record payment and that it will improve the decisions of credit providers because they will be able to confirm promptly whether a credit applicant has the ability to meet his new commitments. To put it bluntly, some commercial and financial enterprises want the CRAA to keep records of all financial transactions by as many people as it can locate. Clearly, that would result in a new, vast databank on most Australians. Understandably, that gives rise to new concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate on positive reporting in itself drew attention to the whole issue of credit reference reporting and to the privacy issues that it involves. Clearly, potential exists for personal privacy to be invaded if there is the possibility of extensive private financial information on citizens being stolen or improperly used. This concern led to a debate on privacy itself and, hence, to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The answer to whether or not the Government will permit positive reporting is contained in the Bill, which does not allow positive reporting. The Minister made that clear as one of the objectives of the Bill. However, in the process the Government has decided to restrict even negative reporting; that is, the reporting systems that are currently in practice. Much of this debate and much of our concern has revolved around those restrictions. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage it should be stated that it is common ground that some form of privacy legislation is needed. That is so partly because of increasing concerns about privacy. The credit reference industry would also welcome a clarification in the law as to what it can and cannot do. It seems that, if there is to be privacy legislation, one of two approaches can be used. The first approach is to set out a series of prohibitions to prohibit what are thought to be the undesirable aspects of credit reference reporting. That is the approach that the Government has taken. Not surprisingly, the Bill has become a hotchpotch of random prohibitions. The only consistent principle behind it is to prohibit much commercial access to credit reference reporting and to restrict very severely the reporting that is to be permitted. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, the Government has foreshadowed the introduction of a whole series of amendments, which will be debated in detail at a later stage. There is a vast gulf between the use of credit reports in the Bill in its original form-or what is permitted in its original form-what industry wants, and what is going to be the result after the adoption, presumably, by this chamber of the majority of the Government's foreshadowed amendments. As I said, this will be pursued. The issue of the uses of credit reference reporting to be allowed is one of the major factors of contention between the Opposition and the Government. In essence, the Opposition says that a much more liberal use of reporting should be permitted. </PARA>
<PARA> I said that I would discuss some of the defects in the Bill. The Bill is an attempt to provide rules on the information that a credit reference agency may keep on its files: how long the information may be kept; the accuracy and security; access to the files; alterations in incorrect information; disclosure of information in the files; the uses that may be made of the information; the penalties for including false or misleading information in files; a code of conduct for the detailed operation of the system; and enforcement via the Privacy Commissioner. However, in our view, when considered as a whole, the Bill is heavily slanted against business and commerce. It severely limits the use of credit reference reporting and prohibits, outright, some uses of the process that are clearly legitimate. The CRAA estimated, before the Government's amendments were announced, that over 90 per cent of its members would no longer be able to use its services. Even with the amendments that have been foreshadowed, many members of CRAA will not be able to use its services lawfully. Not surprisingly, therefore, many business members are still concerned about the Bill, even in its foreshadowed amended form. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is, as I indicated, that the Bill was introduced with no consultation at all. The consultations that have taken place are still inadequate. The Bill, in the form in which it will be debated in the committee stage, is still inadequate. Just to give this chamber some idea of the extent to which industry is opposed to the Bill, even in its amended form, I seek leave to table a list of approximately 20 major organisations of the Credit Reporting Forum which are still expressing objections to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since the Credit Reporting Forum was established, many other organisations have joined it so that virtually the entire business community is now ranged against this proposed legislation. Their argument, supported by a financial impact report commissioned by the Business Planning Group, is that if the Bill is passed in its present form many companies will not be allowed to use credit reference reporting at all; others will be severely restricted in their use of it; the costs to business will escalate; insurance premiums and interest rates will rise; there will be overcommitment by debtors and borrowers and many socially disadvantaged people will be hurt as businesses will be forced to make subjective judgments instead of relying on reasonable, objective information supplied by credit reports. In the view of the Opposition there is considerable merit in the arguments that are being put forward by these business organisations, and our view remains firm notwithstanding the Government's foreshadowed amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not only the business community that is expressing concern. Firstly, as we have read in the press, a number of Ministers have been very concerned about the consequences of the Bill and, in particular, the cost that it will undoubtedly add to industry. Secondly, no doubt we have all read the views of the Australian Labor Party Minister for Consumer Affairs in Victoria, Mr Roper, who is opposed to the Bill. He particularly refers to the exclusion of insurance companies and real estate agents from credit information. Thirdly, we know that the Business Regulation Review Unit warned the Government about the danger and the cost of imposing more burdens and controls on business. Unfortunately, it seems those people have lost and the Labor Left has won. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the bottom line of what the Minister has put before us. I will now detail our major concerns a little more fully. The first concerns the meaning of `credit' and `credit provider'. The Bill provides that a credit reference agency may not-with exceptions which I will not deal with at the moment-disclose information on its file about a person unless it is disclosing it to a credit provider. `Credit' is defined as a loan, and then only as a loan for domestic, family or household purposes. We submit to the chamber that this is a major fault in the Bill. It follows that if the Bill is passed without amendment, CRAA would not be able to provide credit reference information to a real estate agent checking on the solvency of a tenant-I do not think that is even picked up in the amendments-to a company trying to collect a debt, because it would not be making a loan; to a creditor trying to locate a debtor; to a business selling goods on terms or credit, because it would not be making a loan but extending credit in the normal sense of the word; to an underwriter of a mortgage, because it would not be making a loan; to firms that hire out goods or equipment, because they would not be making a loan; to a credit provider to review an account because of slow payment or to advise him of the new address of a missing debtor. All of these uses of reporting are outlawed by the Bill in the first instance at least and, it seems to us, even after the amendments in a number of these cases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, the Opposition is concerned about insurance. The same limitation seriously damages the effectiveness of the large insurance service provided by CRAA. Insurance companies will be prohibited from checking on the credit default record of claimants because the insurance company, of course, will not be making a loan to the insured. This can only give rise to an increase in insurance fraud and a consequent increase in insurance premiums. It should be noted that the Government has not proposed any amendments to remove or limit the severe effect that the Bill will have on the insurance industry and the cost of insurance to the community as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, in relation to debts, bad debts may be recorded on a file-in the Bill's initial form-only if the debt is 90 days overdue. I think that might have been reduced to 60 days in the foreshadowed amendments. Even so, the Bill severely restricts the type of default information that a credit reference agency may collect and keep, and we find that objectionable. In relation to business and personal credit, the Bill makes an unrealistic distinction between personal and domestic credit and business credit. The Bill first says that an agency may disclose information in a file only if it is to be used to assess an application for a domestic, family or household loan. Thus, access to personal credit reference files for business finance is, in effect, outlawed. The Opposition finds that very foolish. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to privacy, it is ironic that, although the Government prides itself on furthering the cause of privacy, the Bill does not provide much protection for the citizen. Certainly it gives no more protection than is presently given. We will pursue that in the committee stage, particularly in relation to accuracy, security and matters of that nature. The Bill does not adequately reflect the information privacy principles as set out in the Privacy Act 1988-the Government's own legislation-and this is one of its principal defects. Concerning the use of information by credit providers, the Bill prevents credit providers from passing on news of actual defaults to other credit providers without the debtor's consent. Credit providers regard this restriction as obnoxious because it may not even be known where the debtor is in order to obtain his consent. The debtor may not give consent until after the default has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition says there is a better approach. The defects in this Bill so contaminate it that it should be withdrawn, redrafted, put to the industry and the community and looked at carefully. The Government should acknowledge that there is not the urgency it sought to imply there is to this chamber. The Government should take this Bill away and do the job properly. Instead of the approach adopted by the Government it would have done better to state clearly the principles on which any such legislation should be based, and fashion the Bill on those principles. </PARA>
<PARA> The two basic principles are that commercial organisations should generally have access to financial information that enables them to make sensible, commercial decisions; and that there should be a mechanism by which consumers are advised that commercial organisations have had access to this information about them, and there should be an opportunity for them to obtain redress for improper use of that information. This Bill, even in its foreshadowed amended form, does not measure up against either of those two principles. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Opposition I move the following amendment in relation to the motion for the second reading of the Bill:</PARA>
<PARA> Leave out all words after ``That'', insert ``the Senate declines to give this Bill a second reading as the Senate is of the opinion that the Bill:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) imposes excessive and unjustified prohibitions and restrictions on the collection and use of personal financial information;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) fails to provide that credit reference agencies be able to give commercial organisations reasonable access to appropriate financial information they have collected provided that the information is reasonably required by a commercial organisation to assist it in making commercial decisions;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) will place obstacles in the way of the detection of fraud, add to the cost of insurance, goods and services, increase interest rates and impose additional costs and inefficiencies on business, its customers and the community;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) falls short of the Information Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act 1988, particularly those principles designed to ensure that individuals are made aware that information concerning them has been disclosed;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) will have many unintended consequences to the detriment of consumers, credit providers, credit reference agencies and the community as a whole; and</PARA>
<PARA> (f) has been introduced without adequate consultation''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition will seek to have that amendment carried, in which case the Bill will not be given a second reading in its current form, and the Government will have to take it away and draft a proper Bill. If we are unsuccessful in that, as I have indicated we will do our best in the committee stage to put the Bill in a form which we regard as satisfactory, consistent with the basic principles that I have outlined in this speech. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Privacy Amendment Bill has been introduced into this chamber by a government that is entirely in disarray and in the process of disintegration. In the last little while, Bills have come before this chamber requiring many amendments, particularly the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) Bill, which required something like 120 amendments, 40-odd of which were moved by the Government in this place. That obviously shows a lack of drafting skill or a lack of preparation by the Government. The Privacy Amendment Bill has now been introduced into this chamber with 41 amendments proposed by the Government and a supplementary explanatory memorandum which takes up some 18 foolscap pages to explain some more amendments. This Bill has been very badly handled. In fact, it has been shockingly handled in this place, in the other place and in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I did not intend to make many remarks about the Bill except to reiterate that it has been badly handled. Even with all the amendments that the Government has brought to this chamber, it has not done anything to make the Bill worthwhile for the community. We in the Opposition are strongly opposed to it. Senator Hill has already mentioned the amendments that he will move. At least the Opposition amendments have been produced at the correct time, not like those of the Government, which nobody had the chance to look at until this morning. For one to look through 41 amendments and the explanatory memorandum and understand what is going on in this Bill, one would have to be a genius. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is anti-business. It is commercially unrealistic. It is a totally impractical Bill. It is against the interests of consumers as much as it is against the interests of business. It will lead to higher interest rates, that is, of course, if interest rates could go any higher. This Government has stung the community so hard with its policies of high interest rates to dampen consumer demand that one would wonder whether interest rates could go any higher. This Bill will lead to higher interest rates for the people who will lend money in certain areas where a great risk is involved and they will not be able to check things out. It will push insurance premiums through the roof. We are being told that landlords, those who lease cars, equipment and other things and those who offer hire purchase or other credit will need to ensure that they are protected against unscrupulous people in the community. We are told that is the reason why this Bill has been introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> How would a person feel if he owned a house, rented it out and his estate agent was not allowed to run a credit check on a prospective tenant-somebody who walks in off the street and wants to rent the house? I would not like it. I am quite sure that you would not like it, Mr Acting Deputy President. I am quite sure that the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) would not like it. I bet he looks after the shekels in his pocket. The shekels in his pocket would be put in jeopardy because he could not do a credit check on somebody. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, there is understandable concern in the community about credit reference reporting, but people have a right to expect their privacy to be looked after. Nobody denies that; nobody doubts that. They do need protection from just anyone finding out about all their financial dealings. There is no question that legislative guidelines need to be established for such things. But this Bill allows checks to be made only for personal loans, and it contains disadvantages which I have already brought to the notice of the chamber. The Minister knows it. It is all right for him to walk around shaking his head. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators are aware of the fact that I have been using this opportunity frequently to pursue a matter of public interest concerning the abuse of Australian citizens by our banking system. For almost a year I have been tabling in the Senate affidavits by ordinary Australians who believe that they have been grossly disadvantaged at the hands of their banks. I have been attempting to do this as evidence to the Senate that indeed there is a need for a public inquiry into banking in this country. Twice the Senate, by the combined vote of the Government and the Opposition, has denied a Senate inquiry into banking practice in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose that raises the question of why one pursues this matter any further when the Senate has twice denied an inquiry. In fact, in recent days the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the relevant committee of the House of Representatives have also backed away from their responsibilities in this matter to the Australian people. I am continuing and will continue this practice as long as it is necessary to table affidavits and evidence presented to me by concerned constituents. I seek the leave of the Senate once again to table a further six affidavits and associated documents that build upon the previous 50 or more that I have tabled over the last 12 months or so. One of the affidavits which I seek leave to table relates to a dispute between Kenneth Host and Thomas Australia Finance, which is acting as agent for the Bank of Amsterdam and Rotterdam in one of the 1,400 reported cases in the foreign loans fiasco during 1985-86. The other affidavits are from one Kevin Webb, who is in dispute with the Commonwealth Bank; Oswald George Phillips, who is in dispute with the State Bank of Victoria; Stanley Aliprandi and Griffith Vintners Pty Ltd, who are in dispute with Partnership Pacific Ltd; Douglas James Nicholas, who is in dispute with the Challenge Bank; and Edward Harvey, who is in dispute with the Westpac Banking Corporation and the Commonwealth Bank.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I thank the Senate for the leave to continue this process which I believe is vitally important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question arises, of course, of what avenues are open to ordinary Australians if they believe that they have been treated unjustly by their bank. The banks say, of course, that their doors are open and all that one needs to do is to present oneself to the officer who is responsible for disputes resolution within the branch, the State branch or even to the national headquarters of the bank. Of course, that begs the question. Inevitably there is bias because the referee represents one of the disputed parties. It is very seldom that matters of serious dispute are resolved in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been argued in debates in this chamber that there is access to the courts and that if one is in serious dispute with banks one simply takes the matter to the court and it will be resolved in due course. The due course could be a decade, assuming that the person who is in dispute-the victim so to speak-is in a position to proceed to the courts anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of these people are in dispute because they are financially destitute. They have been broken by the process that is in question. Not only have they have broken financially, but often they have been broken maritally, emotionally and domestically. They are confronted with the challenge of taking banks to courts. Banks, of course, have unlimited access to the best legal minds and unlimited resources and usually settle out of court if there is anything of conjecture. But they do this right at the last minute; often years after the process of disputation began. </PARA>
<PARA> If one loses in the courts, of course one has the right of appeal. Some very courageous people have over a period of five or six years actually carried their appeals right to the highest court of the country. But it takes a very special person to do that. It needs very special and very costly advice to do that successfully. One could take the matter to a senator or to a member of parliament who may in fact pursue it on one's behalf. In fact, many of the people whose affidavits I have tabled in the last 12 months have come to me after having approached other senators or members. I may have been the fourth, fifth or sixth person they had spoken to. However, these members of parliament, because of the position taken by their parties in relation to a bank's dispute, have not been able to represent them. I have brought these disputes into this chamber only to find that there is not sufficient moral courage here to challenge the banks, the most powerful institutions in the land. Of course, these attempts to have these matters dealt with in the Parliament of the land have failed also. But, of course, one can continue with those attempts. </PARA>
<PARA> The banks are putting in place a new procedure whereby, theoretically, people can take their disputes to a bank ombudsman. On first appearances, it would seem that this process is a sound one. I believe that Australians should take it at face value, subject it to a very hard test and challenge its efficiency, viability and credibility. Already, quite serious reservations have been expressed concerning the role and terms of reference of the bank ombudsman and I have conveyed them in this place on behalf of those who hold them. The first and obvious reservation is whether this is a case of banks looking at banks. Certainly, the ombudsman will be in the employ of the Australian Bank Council, which is funded by the major banks and, therefore, he is employed by the banking industry in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an old adage that he who pays the piper calls the tune. I suppose the wisdom of that adage has been acknowledged over the centuries and it may well be that that observation could possibly be valid in the case of this process. A valid observation has been made that under his terms of reference the bank ombudsman will focus on petty cash issues and that the sums in dispute that can be resolved or compensated will be relatively small. The upper limit is $100,000. That sounds a lot of money but of the now almost 60 cases that I have tabled in the Senate-and they are only 60 out of hundreds-very few involve disputed sums of less than $100,000. So a disputant who goes to the ombudsman, obtains a successful ruling and attains compensation of $100,000 will perhaps have to pursue the excess of the disputed sum in the court context once again. So, really all that happens is that there is a partial resolution of dispute and the person has to go before the courts again, with all of the limitations that that involves. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that there have already been indications that the bank ombudsman, when he or she takes up that position, will not consider any cases that are retrospective. In other words, it is now being hinted that anybody who is now in dispute with the banks will not be able to take his case before the bank ombudsman. As a result, the assurances that I have given to people that I will immediately put before the bank ombudsman cases that I have already tabled in this Senate may be truncated. These people, who are in genuine dispute-they are just as seriously in dispute as anybody who is in this position with the banks on day one of the ombudsman being positioned-may, in fact, be denied access. In other words, those who have contributed to the build-up of evidence which partially has created this process will be denied access to the referee. </PARA>
<PARA> There are those cynics-and I must admit that I am fast becoming one of them-who see this exercise as being essentially a public relations one by the banks. After all, it is costing them $2m a year to put this process in place. Of course, that is absolute chicken feed alongside the billions of dollars of profit that are enjoyed annually by the four major banks. So it remains to be seen how credible and how viable the bank ombudsman procedure proves to be. </PARA>
<PARA> I have asked to be the first to appear before the bank ombudsman. It is my intention to table all of the affidavits that I have tabled in the Senate, place them before the bank ombudsman and say, `There is your first year's work, perhaps'. I am now beginning to feel that perhaps they will be pushed back across the table at me and that I will be told, `We are not interested in those because we are starting with a clean sheet as from today'. So, perhaps the credibility of the so-called procedure to obtain justice from greedy banks in this country may virtually, on day one, be legitimately challenged. This remains to be seen. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that raises in the minds of Australians, who quite clearly see the whole issue of banking in this country as being one of grave concern, the question of `Where do we go to now?'. If people have been unsuccessful before the court and in their approaches to the Parliament, the Government and the newly appointed bank ombudsman, I think this quite legitimately raises in the minds of Australians affected by greedy banks-and that is all of us-the question as to how do we really, in fact, challenge the almighty power of these extraordinary institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> My concerns have been recently described as obsessive. I do not think they are obsessive at all; they are just a commitment to a task which I am prepared to carry through. If people wish to say that in some way that is obsessive, there is no way in fact that I can do anything about that. But I am fairly convinced that most Australians are certain that at least one person in this place is committed to this task. I reserve the right, perhaps week after week, to continue this process of tabling affidavits and continuing to present what I consider to be credible evidence, provided to me by concerned Australians, that there is a real need to bring the banks of this nation to heel. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer to an aspect of the chaos in the airline industry which is having an impact upon Norfolk Island. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has said that the dispute has ended but, in fact, everybody knows that that is not the case. The Government has said variously that there have been 50 per cent and 60 per cent of flights available. That also is not the case in many places. It is certainly not the case in Norfolk Island. If it were the case, one would have expected by now that the military aircraft would have been sent back to where they belong and commercial aircraft would be in the skies. But that is not the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Norfolk Island continues to suffer and, in fact, most of its businesses are being crucified. I want to ask the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), who is in the chamber, to please take this matter up with the Government because there are particular concerns. Air New Zealand is flying to Norfolk Island, I understand, three times a week from Auckland. The only way of getting to Norfolk Island at present is to fly from Sydney to Auckland and then to catch one of these flights. I am told that Air New Zealand has applied to the Government for permission to fly the route from Sydney to Norfolk Island on a daily basis. But, for some reason that really defies imagining, the Government has not allowed this to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that, in every other respect, Norfolk Island appears to be an international destination. It certainly was once regarded as such. Qantas Airways Ltd flew and operated the only air service to Norfolk Island until the later 1970s. Since then East-West Airlines Ltd has been operating the service from Sydney and, I think, Brisbane. Air Norfolk also operates a light twin aircraft service from Brisbane to Norfolk Island and I divert briefly to refer to that airline. This carrier has not been allowed into Sydney. One would have thought that, at a time like this when the Government is allowing all sorts of international carriers to fly all over the country with passengers, this carrier would be allowed to fly into Sydney from Norfolk Island. </PARA>
<PARA> Air Norfolk has purchased an additional aeroplane of 40-seat capacity. It has been refused permission to fly the aircraft from Brisbane to Norfolk because apparently its range is some 10 minutes short of the overfly requirement that is normally regarded as necessary. It might be thought that that is serious but I would point out that, although an aircraft operated by East-West was some 20 minutes short of the overfly fuel supply that it ought to have been carrying, it was not grounded and was allowed to continue to fly to Norfolk Island. It would seem, on that basis, that this new plane with a 40-seat capacity also ought to be allowed to fly to Norfolk Island and should not have to sit in Brisbane as it is at present. That would make a considerable difference to the service to Norfolk Island. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, Norfolk Island ought to be regarded as an international destination which other carriers should be able to service. Passengers travelling to Norfolk Island leave through the Sydney international terminal and pay a departure tax. They are required to have a passport and are subject to passport regulations and quarantine inspection. It is in every respect treated as an international flight. When returning to Sydney, passengers also go through the international terminal and are subject to the same regulations as other international travellers to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I think everybody in the chamber knows that tourism is virtually Norfolk Island's only form of income. Since this airline chaos, the occupancy rate there has dropped by 50 per cent. The business done by the banks has dropped by 60 per cent and many of the accommodation houses in Norfolk have had their bookings for Christmas-their busiest and most important time of year-cancelled. By way of arrangement, the dole or the unemployment benefit is not paid on Norfolk Island. The Islanders do not pay income tax and do not receive that form of social security. Norfolk Island is in a state of chaos, with many businesses already having closed. The accommodation available is empty. The banking business that I have referred to is down considerably and the level of unemployment, which is perhaps not fully assessed as yet, is undoubtedly growing. The shops and restaurants are in difficulties. Somehow, the Government does not seem to think this is important and it will not listen to the representations that are being made on behalf of the islanders. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate: Air New Zealand would fly from Sydney to Norfolk Island. I cannot see why Qantas cannot resume the service that it used to offer between Sydney and Norfolk Island. The strangling of the islanders and their industry has to stop. I appeal to the Government to look at this matter. Aircraft which are flying around the mainland could easily be directed to service the routes to Norfolk Island. I cannot imagine, for the life of me, why it is that Norfolk Island is being treated in this way. I ask the Government to have a look at the request by Air New Zealand; to look at the possibility of asking Qantas to provide a service; and to look into the matter of the plane purchased by Air Norfolk so that it can start operating and provide the service for which it is intended. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak about a matter that was addressed by Senator Cooney in this chamber on 5 September last. In a fairly measured presentation, Senator Cooney nonetheless managed to misstate several matters which need to be corrected. I have no doubt that he was encouraged to make his remarks by some mischievous and misleading statements by Wally Curran of the Meat Industry Employees Union, Mr Curran having worked himself into a lather about certain employment practices relating to the Thomas Borthwick and Sons (Australasia) Ltd meat abattoirs at Portland. The matter for principal concern has been that Borthwicks are in the business of seeking to re-engage workers who will not apply the same outrageous restrictive work practices that have been in place for many years. In so doing, it has been the practice of this firm to require applicants to undergo medical examinations in order to test their physical capacity for work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the complaints that have been made by Senator Cooney and others is that it is somehow outrageous for the employer to be able to determine the doctor of choice and that, in any event, it is even more grievous because these examinations are paid for by the public purse via Medicare. The first factual inaccuracy I think is the following proposition stated by Senator Cooney:</PARA>
<PARA>The candidates were told to use their Medicare entitlements. This caused concern because the Medicare scheme is not intended for the purpose to which it was put. </PARA>
<PARA>The first matter that needs to be corrected is this: that somehow all applicants for new employment positions are entitled to Medicare cover. That is simply not correct. The provisions of the Health Insurance Act make it clear that a ministerial direction has been issued in respect of certain categories of health screening services to enable Medicare benefits to be payable for in this case, a medical examination provided to an unemployed person at the request of a person to whom the unemployed person has applied for employment. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Cooney has any criticism, it ought to be directed at the Government for issuing those ministerial directions. The fact, of course, is that it is highly desirable that the Government, via Medicare, should subsidise the employer's cost of conducting examinations for unemployed persons. If a person is in another job and applies for a position, the cost of that is not borne by Medicare and quite properly so. But I do not think that point was appreciated by Senator Cooney or, indeed, Wally Curran, if he ever understood what the issue was. But, in relation to unemployed persons, I do not have any doubt that the policy rationale for Medicare picking up the tab is the Government's concern to help the unemployed get jobs by defraying the costs to employers of pre-employment medical examinations. That, I think, is not only reasonable but also highly desirable because otherwise employers would be inclined to give preference to others or would not be inclined perhaps to give unemployed persons quite the same consideration that is available under this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The suggestion that somehow people are forced to use Medicare entitlement is simply not so. It is clear from what I have detailed to the Senate that this is all according to the Act and the practice as provided for by ministerial directions. On that basis, there is no element of compulsion. I find it passing strange that there can be complaints that somehow it is wrong for employers not to disclose the contents of medical reports. That is, as we would all know, a time honoured practice. There is a privilege that attaches to such examinations. Quite clearly, the purpose of the exercise is to enable the employer to make a sensible and proper judgment on the basis of expert medical advice. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cooney managed to give an example of one investigation which he says showed that the original diagnosis had been wrong. I suppose no doctor is infallible and, to the extent that there are errors, they do need to be corrected. But it is overwhelmingly not the case and I would have thought it is certainly not sufficient justification for questioning the system. Therefore, I wanted to take issue with Senator Cooney's assessment of the situation, particularly in relation to the Borthwick plant which has been controlled by Elders IXL Ltd for quite some time. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cooney's final remarks were:</PARA>
<PARA> A situation has been created where people looking for work must use Medicare to pay for a report from the single doctor to whom the company sends them. This fits awkwardly with the concept of a caring employer. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a fairly cheap and nasty parting shot because it does not do justice to the situation. Clearly, this employer is like any other employer seeking to have a medical examination of an applicant conducted. Therefore, I think the sting in Senator Cooney's remarks was misguided. Certainly, I commend his restraint in not indulging in the sort of vitriolic abuse that Mr Curran used about those that he believes are in control of the plant. Nonetheless, I do think that, to the extent that Senator Cooney was under a misapprehension about the reason why employers' costs are Medicare funded, he was also in error. I trust that the matter will be suitably rectified at local level. I note that one of the leading orthopaedic specialists in Portland attempted to have the matter corrected by the Warrnambool Standard but as at 8 September the letter had not been published. Therefore, I take this opportunity in the hope that somehow the matter will be rectified at local level. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly to say in regard to the current pharmacy dispute that I believe Senator Cook has clearly misled the Senate in an answer that he gave to a question asked by Senator Devereux on 26 October this year. In that answer Senator Cook said that of all prescriptions issued 83.7 per cent were overcharged on an average of $1.15 per prescription. One wonders whether or not the research was accurate because what he said was refuted the day before by his more senior Minister, the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples), who actually said that 85 per cent of pharmacists' dispensed prescriptions were charged at above the agreed maximum patient contribution on a range of pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) medications costing under $11. That is a very different story to that which Senator Cook conveyed to the Senate on 26 October.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the survey was accurate in the first instance, and we have no idea whether it was, Senator Cook should have, in fact, accused the pharmacists of overcharging on only 16 to 20 per cent of all prescriptions, not 83.7 per cent, because PBS medications costing under $11 constitute only 20 to 25 per cent of all prescriptions. So how can the Minister for Housing and Aged Care say on the one hand that it is a percentage of scripts under $11 and yet Senator Cook comes in here and says that it is a percentage of all prescriptions? I believe that Senator Cook has clearly misled the Senate, and I wish that he would make clear exactly what he meant and why he misled the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is all about research into goat produce, Senator Teague. The importance of the Bills, as I say, is not reflected in the Government's decision to debate them at this stage of the day. A five-minute speech or thereabouts could not possibly do justice to them. But to accommodate this mass of legislation which the Government is trying to push through-and it is keeping us sitting here until 22 December-means that we have to agree to deal with these Bills in this fashion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The goat levy package Bills will establish a levy to be collected on the sale of goat fibre to finance research similar to that which is in operation in other rural industries. The industry has requested the passage of these Bills and the amount of the levy to be collected. The goat fibre industry comprises mohair, cashmere and cashgora sections, and the industry is growing and has the potential to be a major export industry for Australia. This year the figure will be about $10m and it should rapidly increase over the next 20 years. The coalition parties welcome that development. On top of the fibre, there is the extra income from the meat and hides as well as the export of live goats. Again, the opportunity is there for downstream processing with regard to both the fibre and the hides. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for research in this rapidly growing industry is so great that the industry has requested a levy of 1.5 per cent of the gross value of sales of goat fibre to commence on 1 January 1990 and that a maximum of 5 per cent be allowed for in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills-and I am sure Senator Tate will note this-raised a number of concerns over the slopping drafting of these Bills and the Minister's response is in the gobbledegook which was one of the things that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee sought to rectify. I sought from the Minister the reason that the definition of leviable amount and exemptions from such amounts could not be set out in a manner which makes them more easily accessible to people reading the legislation and more understandable. I draw the Minister's attention to the need for legislation to be more readily comprehensible to users and urge the Government to give much more weight to the recommendations of committees of the Senate such as the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. If Minister were to give proper heed to committees, I am sure that the legislation would improve in quality, as regulations have improved thanks to the actions of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances.</PARA>
<PARA> While the Government has allocated $50,000 a year to this growing export industry, it has yet to take the goat by the horns, if I might say, and agree to the import of genetic material from South Africa which would provide a quantum leap for the quality of Australian goat herds. The goat industry in South Africa, I understand, is far in advance of Australia's goat industry and although there are diseases in South Africa, our belief is that the careful use of the latest biotechnology of washed embryos implanted into Australian stock, which could be on Cocos Island, would enable offspring to be born in a secure quarantine area and then brought back into Australia in order to improve the quality of our herds. </PARA>
<PARA> The pasture seed levy package is to establish a levy for pasture seed research. The industry, through the Grains Council of Australia, which represents pasture seed growers, has requested the passage of these Bills to enable it to join other rural industries in a joint Government and industry dollar for dollar funding of research. This package is straightforward legislation similar to the goat levy package, and we welcome it. </PARA>
<PARA> The wine grapes levy package of Bills restructures the levy which funds the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation to make it fairer and to provide more funds for marketing. It is part of a package to promote further development of the wine industry by imposing a levy on fresh and dried grapes and grape juice used for wine manufacture. The current ceiling is abolished and a tiered levy system introduced with a sliding scale of rates with progressively lower rates as tonnages increase. The Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill provides a legislative basis for a wine label integrity program by the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. It also makes amendments to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980 and the Wine Grapes Levy Act. The program will require wine manufacturers to keep records to support labelling claims of the vintage, variety or region of origin of wine and to make these records and the stocks to which they relate available for audit by the Corporation. The purpose is to ensure truth in labelling which will increase consumer confidence and thus improve our opportunities for domestic and export sales. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition welcomes the legislation. It should enhance Australia's wine reputation and, therefore, its markets. The program was developed at the request of the wine industry and has the support of each of the three national winemaker organisations. We wish the Bills a speedy passage through this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal first with the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Bill 1989. In recent times, it has become all too obvious that it is possible to be too complacent about the possibility of corruption in the public sector, whether it be government officials, the judiciary, politicians and police alike. This Bill is proposed as a weapon in the fight against corruption. Its purpose is to prevent the payment of Commonwealth funded superannuation benefits to any Commonwealth employee who is convicted of a corruption offence. Not only will payment of such benefits be prevented but benefits which have already been paid may be recovered in the event of subsequent conviction of a corruption offence committed during the term of Commonwealth employment. The employee contribution and the interest accrued on it would not be affected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation will come into operation where a Commonwealth employee is convicted of a corruption offence punishable by imprisonment for at least 12 months. `Conviction' is broadly defined to include circumstances where a person has been summarily convicted, convicted on indictment or has absconded. A `corruption offence' is defined as one involving abuse of office committed for a purpose involving corruption, or to pervert the course of justice. The proposed legislation will apply to all employees of the Commonwealth and its authorities as well as members of parliament, judges and Defence Force personnel. Therefore, this is an important Bill, which might not necessarily be evident by the interest in the debate today. </PARA>
<PARA> The court will have power to make superannuation orders preventing the payment of the Commonwealth contribution, recovery orders where the contribution has already been paid and restraining orders to prevent the disposal of property which may be needed to ensure the recovery of an amount owing to the Commonwealth. So we recognise that the powers are significant. For the purposes of recovery of property, the Bill includes a provision similar to that of section 120 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966. The definition of property in the Act we note to be extremely broad and covers property in which the person has a beneficial interest and any gifts made within the two years preceding the date of the charge or the restraining order. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also, we have observed, contains provisions similar to sections 9 and 9a of the Proceeds of Crime Act to prevent people trying to escape the effects of the legislation by taking property out of the country, giving it to another person or dealing with it in such a way as to diminish its value. Pursuant to these provisions, the court will also be able to pierce the corporate veil to get at property subject to the effective control of a person. The legislation will only apply to convictions recorded after it comes into force. </PARA>
<PARA> We note that the Act will work as follows: the police will notify the Minister when they charge an employee with what they think may be a corruption offence. They then notify the Minister as to the outcome of the charge. If the Minister thinks it is a corruption offence, he or she may tell the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to apply to a court for a superannuation order. If the person absconds, or is sentenced to a period of imprisonment of more than 12 months, the DPP must make an application for a superannuation order. If the court is satisfied that the person was convicted of a corruption offence or has absconded, the court must then make a superannuation order. Employee contributions that have been paid into a fund are returned to the employee. As in the case of recovery orders, the court calculates the amount to be paid. As of the day the order is made, the amount payable by a person is a debt to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The DPP may apply for a restraining order against specific property of the defendant or another person where a person who has received superannuation benefits from the Commonwealth may be the subject of a recovery order. The purpose of a restraining order is to ensure recovery of the amount payable. Property which is under the effective control of the defendant can be the subject of a restraining order. Pursuant to clause 35, it will be an offence knowingly to deal with property in contravention of a restraining order. The provisions relating to the restraining orders generally mirror those, again, of the Proceeds of Crime Act. Under clause 40, the court may treat any property under the effective control of the defendant as his or her property. </PARA>
<PARA> When sentencing a person for a corruption offence, the court must not take into account any possible superannuation order. It cannot take that into account in determining the quantum of the penalty. It is in our view important to note that the forfeiture of superannuation rights and benefits under this proposed legislation is a separate question from that of any other penalties under the criminal law, or other legislation such as the Proceeds of Crime Act, that a corruption offence may attract. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Federal Police Amendment Bill 1989 is the companion Bill to the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Bill 1989. I remind the Senate that in the last session the Australian Federal Police Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 was passed. It provided for the recovery of superannuation benefits paid to officers of the Australian Federal Police. At the time, we in the Opposition pointed out that there was a large loophole in the legislation of which corrupt officers may have been able to take advantage. In essence, a corrupt officer could have resigned, collected the superannuation owing to him or her and then disposed of it, for example, by giving it to a relative. This Bill closes the loophole that we brought to the attention of the Government by introducing the concept of effective control so that when a recovery order is made it is not only applied to property in the officer's physical possession. Similarly, when a court makes a restraining order it may be made against the defendant or another person. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, we support this legislation. We think it will be a useful tool in the fight against corruption which, as I said, we have become only all too much aware of in recent times and we commend the Government on its introduction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Bill 1989 and the Australian Federal Police Amendment Bill 1989 deal with an essential item from the Government's viewpoint in terms of the fight against crime. The Australian Democrats do not cavil with the Government over the increased penalties, as it were, for corrupt public officers. There are not only penalties for whatever crime is committed and penalties relating to the proceeds of crime but also it is now proposed to take away from corrupt officials their superannuation benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to point to one problem that I think is emerging in this move. As honourable senators well know, many judgments that have been given over recent years in the Family Court of Australia actually are based on the claim of a spouse of a superannuant to part, and sometimes all, of a superannuation benefit. The moral right of a spouse to part of that superannuation benefit is strengthened, particularly in light of the productivity trade-off exercise in the last 12 months whereby 4 per cent of salary is now paid to many workers by way of a productivity superannuation bonus arrangement. In other words, quite directly the Government has recognised in its own industrial relations and wage policy area a direct link between salary and superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), who is at the table, well knows, it is a standing rule now in terms of the Family Court that where only one wage earner in a family unit has paid for an asset such as a home, that asset is part of the package for distribution between the spouses. In other words, assets are not considered by the Family Court as being owned wholly and solely by the person who earned that salary that paid for them. That is perfectly correct. It is a recognition that in a partnership of marriage each spouse is entitled, in terms of whatever the agreement is between the couple, to a fair share of the accumulated assets of which superannuation is morally a part and of which court judgments in the Family Court have declared it to be a part. </PARA>
<PARA> I admit that at the moment there is not an overall legal entitlement to that. I believe that in terms of development in this area of the distribution of assets and who actually owns assets within a marriage contract, in a very short time indeed superannuation will be seen as an accepted part of that whole arrangement-not as peripheral to it but as an essential part of it. The difficulty then that I see with these two pieces of legislation is that we are assuming totally the opposite viewpoint, that the superannuation is totally and completely owned by the person who has the superannuation arrangement. As I say, the Government in its own industrial relations and wages policy has espoused the opposite view. It has espoused the opposite view in the Family Court. Yet this legislation is really in contradistinction to that movement. </PARA>
<PARA> I am afraid that I am not able to offer many constructive views on how one might resolve that dilemma. How we might disentangle the various entitlements is a difficult problem. But it seems to me that if the spouse of a corrupt police officer-and I use that example in terms of one of the Bills before us-has not committed a crime, if it is not able to be proven in court that there was collusion between the couple and if the partner who was not the serving officer was not an accessory either before or after a crime and, in other words, is innocent, I think what we are doing is visiting a direct penalty on the spouse. That does not seem to me to be a good principle to enshrine in law. </PARA>
<PARA> The children also have to be considered. When one thinks of the other types of penalties that will be visited upon a corrupt officer in those circumstances, it could very well be that the family structure itself will almost be reduced to penury. On top of that, we will be depriving the spouse and children of their moral right to part of that superannuation. I do not press this matter any further in terms of a legal right, because there is not any at the moment. I think the family could be said to have already suffered a vast penalty because of the actions of the corrupt officer. To visit upon them yet another penalty is a very harsh exercise indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge that it could be a very effective penalty. But, then again, I think most exercises where one visits a penalty on a spouse or children tend to be fairly effective in the eyes of the other spouse. This sort of thing was used during the Second World War with regard to torture. I accept the point that effectiveness in terms of the fight against crime will certainly be enhanced because it will affect an officer's family. However, I do not accept that the effectiveness of this area is an argument in its favour. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Government really ought to review the situation. I can express on behalf of my party support for the current legislation because, as I say, that legal entitlement is not enshrined elsewhere in legislation. But I would hope that the Government in terms of developing an overall policy position with regard to the ownership of superannuation benefits will bear this element in mind. I hope that it will not simply put it to one side on the basis that this is an effective way of fighting crime and ignore the moral and legitimate rights to those benefits of the spouses and children involved in these cases. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make one further point. I am not seeking to draw any analogy, and neither do I believe is there any analogy, between this operation and the proceeds of crime. The proceeds of crime is a totally different principle which depends upon the receipt of ill-gotten gains. Since the person who commits a crime has no right and no legal entitlement to those ill-gotten gains, fairly obviously a spouse could not assume a right to them. Even the most recent amendments that have been made to legislation which put the onus of proof on the criminals themselves to show that the assets they have were derived from activity other than crime, do not in any way invalidate the point that I have made that the Proceeds of Crime Act is based on the notion that the criminal does not have any legal entitlement to those assets, income, money or whatever and, hence, the assets cannot be passed to his spouse or children. This, however, is a different matter. This is an earning, a salary, in as much as we have not sought, for example, to take all of the salary that a corrupt officer earned. It seems to me that, in keeping with that principle, we also ought not seek to take in total that part of the salary which the Government has set aside as a superannuation benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> I would ask the Government to consider seriously the point that I have raised. It is a policy point. It is something that needs to be taken into consideration in the further developments that will be undoubtedly undertaken in this area. These developments probably can best be handled not in this area but in the superannuation policy area in general as it develops with regard to families and other people who may seek to be the owners-at least morally and soon, I hope, legally-of the benefits that flow from superannuation cover. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I thank the Opposition and the Australian Democrats for their support for the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Bill and the Australian Federal Police Amendment Bill. It is not surprising support because indeed the Bills continue to embody the intention of the Parliament that those persons who are employed to serve the public should not benefit from Commonwealth funded pension entitlements or superannuation entitlements if it is discovered that during that period of public service they were in fact corrupted and obviously acted in a way detrimental to the general interest of the public. The Commonwealth takes the view that the pension entitlement, in so far as it is Commonwealth funded, should be made available only to those who have served the public in a non-corrupt fashion; that is, those who have truly fulfilled their contract in that sense. It is only when that is the case, that is when they have fulfilled their contract in a non-corrupt fashion, that the entitlement really arises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am pleased that the chamber is indicating its support for these Bills but I do think the matters raised by Senator Macklin deserve very serious consideration and I can assure him that the Government will give it to them. I suppose it is worth just making the point that we are not talking about the whole of the superannuation available to the former corrupt Commonwealth employee; the lump sum payment that might be obtained, which is a refund of employee contributions, will be available and unaffected by this particular legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, in relation to the Commonwealth funded portion of the benefit Senator Macklin raises a very interesting point that indeed there might be a legitimate expectation on the part of the spouse that the benefit which had been accruing over the period of the employment of the corrupted official might be available in some proportion for that spouse in the event, for example, of the dissolution of the marriage. There is some analogy, I believe, with the continual accrual of income over the period of employment of a public official, which of course can be transmuted into capital, such as the matrimonial home. It is quite clear that the Family Court regards the matter in the light that Senator Macklin put forward. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that there is a matter there for consideration. I am advised that the Family Law Council is indeed looking at this area and I understand that the Family Court is edging towards and trying to develop some principles in relation to the matter in general, indicating that perhaps where divorce occurs prior to confiscation and the employee is close to retirement, the likelihood of superannuation is taken into account as a financial resource available to the person and the property settlement is adjusted accordingly. For example, in the knowledge that the superannuation benefit might be available in two or three years time to one of the parties to the marriage the other party, the non-earning party, may in fact have, let us say, her proportion of the matrimonial home or entitlement to the general property shared by the partners up to the divorce increased in view of the likelihood of the superannuation accruing to the employed party. In that situation, as I am advised, the spouse who takes a greater share for example in the matrimonial home or in property would be unaffected by any subsequent confiscation. Senator Macklin has raised some very important and interesting matters. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a difficult area. There is no doubt about the deterrent effect of being able to say, for example, to an Australian Federal Police officer that he will not be able to hedge his bets, that he will not be able to say, `I will try to get away with this corrupt practice and if I do not, well, at the end of the day my wife and kids will be looked after because they will have the super'. To take away that particular possibility will, I think, be a very real deterrent to the police officer and, in the light of these Bills, other public servants concerned. Whether it is given too much weight in the sort of argument that Senator Macklin has raised today is, I think, a matter for consideration and I undertake that I will certainly try to find out what the Family Law Council is doing in this regard, and he suggests other forums to deal with a review of superannuation more generally. I think that that is a good prop- osition. So, Mr Deputy President, I thank the Senate for its support for these Bills and commend them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Button as Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce and in his capacity as Minister representing the Prime Minister. I preface my question by referring to a speech given in Sydney yesterday by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, entitled `The Government's role and responsibility in safeguarding industry development', in which he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To my mind, governments need most of all to have consistent policy responses to the environmental puzzles they are faced with, rather than be seen to be reacting to each and every environmental group and its demands. If they don't, they are not acting as a government, nor are they engaging in the debate in the most responsible manner. People want governments to set the agenda and take balanced decisions.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kerin also said:</PARA>
<PARA> No matter how adept any government is at doing ad hoc deals or how clever in taking short term fixes or how courageous in taking a stand on environmental questions, political and economic reality demand a balance to be struck and for more comprehensive policies to be put in place.</PARA>
<PARA>First, does the Minister agree with these views of Mr Kerin? Second, if so, why did the Government not follow these views when reaching its decision on Coronation Hill? Third, will Mr Kerin be sacked for once again, for the second time in two weeks, criticising the Government's decision on Coronation Hill? If not, why not? Fourth, when will the next meeting be held of the group of senior Ministers, which is reported in the Sunday Herald of 22 October to include Senators Button, Cook, Evans and Walsh plus Mr Kerin, established to counter what they see as a growing anti-development bias in Government decision making fostered for cynical, opportunistic, vote-buying reasons by their colleague Senator Richardson at great cost to the living standards of all Australians?</PARA>

But in so far as he is making a point about governments-`governments' in the plural because this issue concerns both State and Federal governments and if one asks people in industry about it, their concern is largely with inconsistent decisions, sometimes made between various governments and so on-I agree that consistent policy responses are desirable, and consistent policy responses which reflect the concept of sustainable development.

If he does, why did the Government not follow those views when reaching its decision on Coronation Hill? In relation to Mr Kerin's criticism of the Government's decisions on Coronation Hill, I think it is correct to say that his speech yesterday ranged much more widely.

In that case, will he be sacked for again criticising the decisions that the Government has made on Coronation Hill and other environmental matters?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said in my answer to the first part of the question that I did not apprehend, on my reading of Mr Kerin's speech, that there had been any specific reference at all to Coronation Hill. I am glad the supplementary question confirms the view which I put in answer to the first question because the first question was deliberately designed to carry the implication that Mr Kerin was directly referring to the Coronation Hill decision. Again I come back to the answer I gave initially in terms of the criticisms to which the honourable senator refers, which were made by Mr Kerin in respect of governments. Mr Kerin was, I believe-and I have not discussed it with him-trying to intrude a particular view into the environmental debate in this country. That was the sort of view which is intruded into the debate in other countries. He made the point again and again that this issue relates to the behaviour of governments-plural-generally in Australia. I believe it does. So there is no question of sacking Mr Kerin on the basis of a view which he expresses which has nothing particular to do with the Coronation Hill decision.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To some extent I think my Department has been a victim of the success of this particular campaign. In the period designated as the Year of Citizenship some 119,200 applications were received, which is 45 per cent higher than in the preceding 12 months. That is a record that even exceeded that of the 1983-84 period, when the term of residence was reduced and therefore a lot more people were able to take out citizenship. I think that the standard of service declined somewhat simply because of the enormous pressure these applications placed on my Department. There were some extra staff reallocated from the review area to assist in this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1988-89 the average time for processing was 2.5 months whereas I have set a departmental target of two months. This ranges, of course, from State to State. I can understand Senator Colston's interest in this matter, as Queensland had the longest delay period of four months. However, we are implementing procedures now to have that length of time reduced as far as possible, remembering that in this area the fee for application for citizenship is $35 and the processing cost is $70. There is not full cost recovery. If there is a massive upsurge in applications, as there was in the year of citizenship, that places resource problems on any department concerned. As I said, we are almost a victim of our own success in getting so many people applying.</PARA>

Let us not have the big party discipline argument, given all the moves right around Australia in the Liberal Party to tighten discipline. This is the Party that expelled Francis and Jennings in Victoria in 1979 for voting against the Government. Time and again, one can bring up examples of the Liberal Party trying to increase discipline. But do not distract me with interjections. Senator Brownhill has asked a question and would like an answer. He asked me whether there may be a basic difference of opinion between Senator Richardson and Mr Kerin. I remind Senator Brownhill, as I know he takes a great interest in philosophy, of the Hegelian system, under which an antithesis is used to bring about a synthesis. That is exactly the way the Cabinet operates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to say two other things to Senator Brownhill. First of all, Mr Kerin's speech should be read carefully. Mr Kerin criticised extremists in the environmental movement. He did not say that the whole environmental movement was wrong or extremist or anything else. I am quite happy to criticise extremists in the environmental movement when they deserve to be criticised. Any movement has its extremists. One has only to look at the New South Wales branch of the Liberal Party to understand what extremists are about. Is it not interesting that in this debate the Opposition is desperate to focus on a slight or major, whatever it is, difference of opinion within the Government? One has to ask: What is the policy of those opposite on the environment? They are the great `gonnas'-`Well, we would like to protect the northern rainforest, but Senator Boswell stands over us and makes us not do it. We would like to protect the forests in Tasmania, but no, we cannot do it'. They would like a mill in Tasmania at any cost, despite the absence of proper environmental studies. They would like to mine Kakadu. In criticising extremists, it is this mad rush opposite for development at any cost that is more open to criticism than any action of this Government.</PARA>
<PARA> This Government has taken the environment on an issue by issue basis. It has spent a long time evaluating each project, whereas the herd instinct of those on the other side of the chamber, led by Senator Boswell and company-they have a shadow Minister for the environment who has never had one win inside their party room, who is only up there as a front man--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Alston cannot have it both ways. He cannot, on the one hand, complain that the requirement is being increased while at the same time acknowledging that the requirement does not represent an increase over what the stations have in fact been doing in the way that I have just described. That inability to recognise that one cannot have it two ways at once is one of the things that have characterised Senator Alston's hopefully short-lived tenure in the job that he is presently occupying on the front bench.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The standard does require an increase in Australian transmission of children's drama, reflecting the very strong community interest in this matter contained in the representations received during the ABT's inquiry process. But the networks are given substantial flexibility on how they meet the rest of their total point score against that background. The Tribunal has signalled that it intends to take into account network submissions, on the phasing-in of the proposed 50 per cent Australian content transmission rule. This will be reflected in a revised draft of the standard to be released next week.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Alston's claims that the network will have to spend at least $20m more a year on programs to `satisfy someone's social prejudice' is both false and offensive. He may be a hero of the American film and television industry, but he is certainly no friend of the Australian industry, nor of those in the community who want to see as much Australian content as is reasonably possible and, in particular, those who want to see an increase in Australian content in children's drama.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the subject of violence, of which Senator Ray just reminded me, Senator Alston's suggestion that the ABT is pre-occupied with hand wringing over violence is a comment which ignores, among other things, that it is not a self-initiated ABT concern. It was the product of a specific reference to it by the Government-by me when I was Minister-and a reference last August which generated a very wide degree of community support at the time and not, as I recall, any expression of opposition from the Opposition benches. In fact, it was widely applauded. That inquiry has made substantial progress. It has been characterised by full cooperation and bipartisanship between the Tribunal and the networks. The networks are now working on a draft joint self-regulatory code on the portrayal and presentation of violence. For Senator Alston to assault the ABT for the work it is doing in trying to come to grips with this obvious and manifest problem shows how out of touch with community sentiment the Opposition is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take this opportunity once again to express the Government's full confidence in the members of the Broadcasting Tribunal. Nobody is compelled to agree with everything the ABT proposes.

If the instructions were carried out, why were these issues dismissed with only a few lines in the CSIRO report which forms the basis for the Government's draft guidelines for pulp mills?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If one needed an illustration of what Mr Kerin was referring to in his speech, a spooky example has now been provided by Senator Sanders. When the CSIRO mission travelled overseas to look at the pulp and paper industry following the Wesley Vale decision, the mission was specifically instructed to look at the market for unbleached paper products and technology in respect of producing unbleached paper. It did so. I do not know why it dismissed that issue with a few lines, as Senator Sanders puts it, in the CSIRO report. Governments are not in the business, and cannot be in the business, of providing capital and other means of support to establish large industries. A test of whether there is a potential market is best supplied by those who operate in the market. There are no proposals from the industry, unless Senator Sanders wants to provide the money himself, for establishing an unbleached paper pulp mill in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It appeared in the Port Lincoln Times of 31 October 1989. That statement is so incorrect that it raises a question as to the motive of the person who wrote that letter. The ratification, if it does occur, can only be done by the Government after the terms of the Convention are settled and further consultation with State and Territory governments takes place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the substance of the correspondent's complaints, it appears that a central element of the scaremongering approach is to suggest that the Convention will somehow permit the Federal Government to crash through the doors of the family home and tear a child from the arms of his or her parents. It is also suggested that the Convention removes the entitlement of any parent to make some contribution to the moral and spiritual development of the child. Those fears are entirely ludicrous and mischievous. Nevertheless, for the edification of the Senate I will refer to a number of provisions in the Convention. For example, article 5 expressly acknowledges the critical role of the parent in the raising of a child. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>States Parties shall respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents . . . to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights (recognised in the Convention).</PARA>
<PARA>I have paraphrased some of that article. As to the question of religious and moral matters, article 14 properly acknowledges the right of a child to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. In so doing, however, the Convention expressly provides that:</PARA>
<PARA>States Parties shall respect the rights and duties of the parents . . . to provide direction to the child in the exercise of his or her right in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child.</PARA>
<PARA>On the issue of the state intervening to separate a child from his or her parents, article 9 provides:</PARA>
<PARA>That a child shall not be separated from his or her parent against their will, except when competent authorities subject to judicial review determine, in accordance with applicable law and procedures, that such separation is necessary for the best interests of the child.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly, but the essential theme of what Mr Kerin said was to support the concept of sustainable development. I have been espousing that concept for some time; it is a concept supported by the Prime Minister in the environment statement that he presented in July. It is the underlying thesis of the United Nations Brundtland report, Our Common Future-World Commission on Environment and Development, a report popularised under the shelf title for a book Our Common Future. It deals with the fundamental problem of resolving the issues involving legitimate environmental concerns and legitimate development concerns and how one arrives at a resolution between the two.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the case of agriculture, the most important environmental question in this country relates to the fact that we have lost production on agricultural lands of $600m a year through land degradation.

This is the issue on which we have mounted a bipartisan and cooperative effort with the non-government organisations in this country in order to combat the problem.</PARA>
<PARA> The view that we all have on this is that we should move to combat land degradation by changing the attitudes of landholders to the care and management of their land and by undertaking work on catchment models, planning and cooperation. The fact that it is a major problem does not mean that some people do not have a view which differs from the cooperative model. Some people do and they express it, and they are entitled to do so. We still have democracy in this country. The Government is committed to working through the concept in the Brundtland report, on which we now have a working model in Australia in relation to agriculture, and that is the appropriate model.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has been concerned for some time about a number of bank related issues, particularly when it comes to disputes with the banking institutions. The Government has been concerned about the number of them, the way the disputes have been handled and, generally, the problem of consumers not being able to enforce their rights in this area. In terms of the number of disputes, I am sure that honourable senators will realise that we are talking about quite a number. In relation to the electronic funds transfer area-a matter in which Senator Vanstone showed some interest some time ago-it has been estimated that some 30,000 disputes a year arise in that area of banking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of handling disputes, concern has been expressed about tardiness. As is often the case with large bureaucracies, there can be a tardiness and consequent frustration to consumers because of the way disputes have been handled. In the area of enforcement of rights there has been concern that because of the small amount that is in dispute quite often in these sorts of cases, combined with the costs of access to law, people's rights have not been all that readily enforceable.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has recognised that the small claims tribunal access offers little avenue of redress, in that quite often the jurisdictions in this area are too small to be of any meaningful use to consumers. Accordingly, over the past 18 months or so we have developed in cooperation with the Australian Bankers Association (ABA)-a very productive cooperation-a model very much along the lines of the model of the British banking ombudsman.</PARA>
<PARA> This matter has been worked on and in the development of the process we have been keen to ensure that consumers in this country are protected in having an avenue available to them which can be of some major use to them. We have been keen to ensure the independence of the body and, accordingly, the council which will be running the banking ombudsman scheme is very finely balanced with community, consumer and industry representatives, and chaired, as has already been publicised, by Sir Ninian Stephen.</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the actual power of the ombudsman, we have been keen to ensure that the structure has enough resources, and the banking sector has indicated that it is prepared to put up some $2m to ensure that the scheme will work. That is only one part of the problem. We have also been keen to ensure that the body has determinative powers and that it can work productively in making sure that all the necessary information can be called before it. Accordingly, it will have the power to call for documents.</PARA>
<PARA> We had to address the cost problem, and we have been able to get agreement from the Australian Bankers Association to make the scheme accessible to consumers free. I heard during the lunch break that Senator McLean was worried about people who have complaints at the moment. Since the scheme was first mooted in May this year it has been agreed that disputes arising as from 10 May or thereabouts would also be subject to the jurisdiction of the ombudsman scheme when it is set up. There has also been a concern that this sort of avenue might supplant or overtake existing rights.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is not a statement. I am setting out the details of the scheme. I might say that some honourable senators opposite have shown more interest than Senator Hill has over recent days; they also have been inquiring about it. A very important avenue of redress will be to ensure that consumers, once they have had their disputes handled, do not lose their rights at law and can, in fact, once the case has been determined, pursue the matter at law and through the courts if they so desire. Also, if there is a case that needs to go to court on appeal or will be referred to courts by, say, a banking institution, the banks have agreed to pay for the cost of that court process and any appeal thereafter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The coverage has also been important and, to that extent, members of the ABA will be covered. Other retail banks will be approached, but we anticipate that other institutions-not banking institutions-that handle electronic funds transfers will be joining the scheme very soon. It is a very extensive and important scheme. In terms of the ultimate decision-making function of the ombudsman, the basic consideration will be what is fair in all the circumstances. In that respect he will take into account the law on banking practices. The final criterion is fundamentally very important. As has been indicated before, it is an important initiative, one which should be able to make available access to the law to a whole range of consumers who in the past have not had this provision available to them.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Every Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development country in the world has a capital gains tax. It was recommended as far back as 1975 by the Asprey Committee, which said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the failure to tax capital gains will usually favour those who are more well-to-do rather than those who are less, since the former own more capital per head than the latter and are more likely to make investments that realise capital gains.</PARA>
<PARA>In the White Paper of 1985, the point was also made that the absence of a capital gains tax opens up the taxation system to massive tax avoidance. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>The lack of a general capital gains tax represents a structural defect in the income tax system which lies at the core of many avoidance arrangements: if income can be converted into or dressed up as capital gains, income tax can be avoided completely. The imposition of a capital gains tax would, therefore, strike at one of the foundations of tax avoidance in Australia. In view of these considerations, a strong case can be made for the introduction of a general capital gains tax.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that has now been done. Sir William Cole, in an article published by the Australian Institute of Public Policy from which I quoted a couple of days ago, also made a very strong case for a capital gains tax. Every responsible person who has looked at this issue has come down solidly in favour of a capital gains tax.</PARA>
<PARA> I was asked whether the absence of a capital gains tax would benefit particular individuals. The answer to that is unquestionably that it would. Current Budget Paper No. 3 shows that for the financial year 1986-87, the last financial year for which anything like a reliable analysis is available, less than 0.3 per cent of taxpayers paid capital gains tax. One-third of one per cent of taxpayers pay capital gains tax. Who are they? They are the people with the highest incomes. Most spectacularly, if capital gains tax were to be abolished, the greatest individual beneficiary of it would be the Federal President of the Liberal Party who would pick up $17m from his 1c shares alone.</PARA>
<PARA> I was asked whether other individuals were likely to pick up a lot of money. The answer to that is yes. Another high profile Liberal, Ian McLachlan, is also a director of Elders-IXL and a recipient of 1c paid shares. I have expressed my views in this place about the commercial morality-some would go beyond that and question the legality-of this scam that Elders' directors have been running for years, watering down the capital value of the equity held by other shareholders in order to stuff it into their pockets. Now they want to get out of paying tax on it as well! It is not just the Federal President of the Liberal Party. It is also that other high profile Liberal, Mr McLachlan, who, incidentally, as President of the National Farmers Federation ran a high profile campaign against capital gains tax and fringe benefits tax--</PARA>

Public sector managers will be charged with getting value for money in purchasing for the Commonwealth.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, Senator Powell asked a series of questions about the circumstances of a defence exercise being conducted in the Beecroft range at Jervis Bay. I can confirm that the local naval authorities were aware that a protester, Ms Janet Mayer, was on the range of Beecroft Peninsula. However, that was the only aspect of the honourable senator's question that was correct. It is not correct that a naval ship-to-shore exercise was authorised in the knowledge that a protester was on the range. In fact, the exercise was cancelled because of that very fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mr Simmons, has given a very clear undertaking that the Australian Defence Force will not undertake live firing in an area where it is known or suspected that members of the public are present. That policy holds even when such presence is unauthorised or illegal. The Defence Force is complying with that policy and it continued to do so yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA> There have been media reports that the protester, Janet Mayer, did hear a series of explosions and assumed that she was in danger from shellfire. In fact, those explosions were part of a separate and tightly controlled demolition exercise being conducted by naval clearance divers. The small scale and nature of such exercises mean that the necessary safety area can be cleared with certainty and the exercise can be conducted without any danger to the public.</PARA>
<PARA> The Jervis Bay protest movement has been made aware of the above facts. While the protester who was involved yesterday may have been frightened by the sound of explosions, she was in absolutely no danger. In addition, it should be stressed that she was in the area without authorisation with a clear purpose of disrupting necessary naval training. Despite these activities, the Defence Force will continue to use Beecroft range, as it has done for nearly 50 years.</PARA>

These waivers reflect the cost to the airlines of staff who could not be usefully employed. The $3.8m is reimbursed by the Government to the CAA and the FAC in order to leave them in no better or worse financial position than if the waivers had not been invoked.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this week I was asked a question by Senator McGauran about canned fruit from Canada. I am now in a position to supply an answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the Canada-Australia Trade Agreement (CANATA), Canada is obliged to grant Australian goods listed in schedule A of the agreement rates of duty no higher than those accorded to similar Canadian imports from any other country. The Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) introduced on 1 January 1989 provides for reductions in rates of duty on many US products. The product likely to be most affected by the Free Trade Agreement is canned fruit, for which Canada is our largest export market-worth around $A30m in 1988-and the US has the potential to become our major competitor. Under the Free Trade Agreement, US rates of duty will be phased out by 1998, whereas Australian product will continue to face tariffs of 10 to 15 per cent if Canada fails to honour its obligations under CANATA.</PARA>
<PARA> Canada has continually disputed Australia's legal entitlements under CANATA and argued that, under customary international law, it has no obligation to extend the phasing out of US tariffs to Australian products. It further argues that canned fruit was removed from schedule A by Canadian domestic legislation in 1979 and is therefore not covered by the relevant CANATA provision.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has continued to reject the Canadian arguments, and the Prime Minister wrote to his Canadian counterpart in an effort to resolve the issue. At the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Kuala Lumpur in October 1989, the Australian Prime Minister reached agreement with his Canadian counterpart on the issue.</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister issued a press release on 24 October 1989 that the agreement means the Canadian tariff on Australian canned fruit will be phased down, in the context of the Uruguay Round, to a level which leaves the Australian industry competitive with other exporters. The actual rate of reductions in the Canadian tariff will be settled through negotiations in the Uruguay Round. Negotiations will commence without delay and will be completed within a year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The thrust of Senator Evans's response was that I had implied that I or, indeed, the Opposition, were not interested in local content or matters of violence in respect of television. I wish to make it quite clear that that is not the case. Indeed, in the speech which I made on Monday, from which Senator Evans quoted highly selectively, I made a special point of saying that I believed it was appropriate for local content rules to be in place, that the finances of the television networks were not a sufficient reason for removing any floor level and that, indeed, it should be raised to a point which reflected the current output. However, I was at pains to say that I thought the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal had gone too far in unilaterally-and Senator Evans, I noticed, did not quote that word-jacking up Australian content and wringing its hands over violence on television.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish it to be understood that I was saying that approximately 4,000 submissions were received by the Tribunal relating to violence. The end result was that the Tribunal has merely said that there should be a self-regulatory code put in place. That is a view that could have been arrived at some years ago. It supports my contention to the conference that the Tribunal, instead of concentrating on the main game, has been preoccupied with fringe issues. I made it clear that the Tribunal should have tackled big policy questions such as the viability of the television industry, the increasingly dubious efficacy of aggregation and its deleterious effects on localism and the finances of regional stations or, even, the appropriate regulatory regime for pay television. I wish to make it clear that the gravamen of my remarks was that there are some big policy questions to be addressed, but they are not being addressed by the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The other remark to which I take particular exception is the suggestion that somehow I was pandering to the American film industry in wanting to reduce or dispense with local content rules. The fact of the matter is that in my speech I was at pains to say that the Tribunal's proposal constitutes an imperious gun-at-the-head approach, which predictably provoked not only howls of outrage from the networks but also a united opposition front from the entire film and television industry, sufficient to cause the Tribunal to put its gun away and commence negotiations which are still continuing. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the fact of the matter, and I wish to make very clear today that this was not in any way a response to what has been said latterly by some segments of the American film industry but, rather, the outpourings from a united Australian industry that has taken particular exception to the Tribunal for its own purposes and, for reasons which are not at all clear to any of the industry players, decided to impose a much higher standard which will inevitably place a serious financial burden on the networks. I hope this clarifies the matter and that Senator Evans will reflect upon and, perhaps, hopefully read my speech before he allows himself to be misled as he was earlier this afternoon. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the first annual report of the Australian Film Finance Corporation Pty Ltd. The Corporation was incorporated on 12 July last year. That incorporation was part of the major restructuring of the film industry and the backing of that industry which took place in accordance with the Australian Film Commission Amendment Act 1988, which was the last piece of legislation to be dealt with in the old House of Parliament. This is a report of the year's activities of the financial arm of the Australian film industry. The principal functions of the Corporation are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>to invest in feature films, mini-series, telemovies and documentaries . . . to make loans, provide guarantees and underwriting in respect of Australian programs; to lead or participate in loan syndicates . . . to form or participate in the formation of trusts and companies formed to produce Australian programs. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, as I said before, its function is to provide the financial backing for our Australian film industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It is noted in the report that the 10ba incentives are no longer able to maintain productions at a high level. Therefore, the Australian Film Commission published a set of options for reforms which included the proposal to establish this film financing body as one of the Government's principal assistance mechanisms to replace the former 10ba tax shelter provisions. Indeed, the Government will be providing financial support for four years. In this report we learn that the film industry has been given a $50m grant by the Government for its first year, and that further grants will be available for the other three years. The whole point of this step is that the assistance provided by the private sector should be increased as the years go by. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation operates primarily from Sydney and Melbourne. Of the 19 full time and one part time staff members, five are located in the Melbourne offices and the others in the Sydney offices. As far as keeping in touch with film producers in South Australia and Western Australia is concerned, representatives of the Corporation regularly visit Adelaide and Perth. Brisbane is not so advantaged; it states in the report that that city receives occasional visits. </PARA>
<PARA> During the financial year covered by this report 72 film projects were evaluated and 51 were approved for investment. A breakdown by percentage shows that features comprise 61.95 per cent, television dramas provide 31.08 per cent and documentaries provide 6.97 per cent of the productions which were approved for investment last year. During its first year in operation the Corporation was required to secure 30 per cent private sector participation as far as its supported production slate is concerned. For individual projects the minimum level of private sector investment is 15 per cent, which can be reduced in the case of children's dramas, certain other documentaries and exceptional cases. The Corporation is not permitted to fully fund projects. In future years the Corporation will, at the request of the Government, raise the aggregate level of private sector participation. The level is to be 35 per cent for the year 1989-90 and to increase in future years so that there is less reliance on Corporation funds. During this last year 105 funding applications were received. Of those, 72 were considered, seven withdrawn, 26 deferred to 1989-90 for consideration and, as I said before, 51 were approved. I commend this report. It shows us that the Australian film industry is in good shape and that, in the years ahead, it will have suitable financial backing. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General has been providing a remarkable service to this Parliament, particularly in his detailed examinations of the departments of government and the bodies which are becoming further and further removed from scrutiny of the Parliament-for example, the corporations that are publicly owned. At this stage I want to make only a few brief remarks, because many of the matters raised in the Auditor-General's Audit Report No. 20, Report on Ministerial Portfolios-Budget Sittings 1989, have in fact been dealt with in individual audit reports. But I think it is worth outlining the warning that the Auditor-General has given in this report when he deals with the general matter of reports to the Parliament. He states:</PARA>
<PARA> Our responsibility to report findings to Parliament and the associated publicity at times tend to give the impression that the public sector is always less efficient than the private; however, reports on the performance of private sector management (unless laudatory) are usually not made available to shareholders or the general public and problems and errors are absorbed in the `bottom line' result. </PARA>
<PARA>That is quite true. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The foregoing is one of the main reasons that have led some public sector bodies to seek the appointment of a private sector auditor in lieu of the Auditor-General. Quite unlike the private sector, in the public sector the organisation audited is not the client, rather it is the Parliament. In the private sector, the client has the power to recommend to shareholders that there be a change of auditors; the same is not true in the public sector. And it is therefore no surprise that some public sector agencies attempt to evade their public accountability responsibility by seeking the right to choose their own auditor i.e., one responsible only to the agency, not the Parliament. I am referring to this in more detail in my Annual Report. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not want to pre-empt discussion which will be held later today on another report dealing with this, which Senator Coates will be bringing down. But I think it is of some significance that we have discovered some devices in Senate Estimates hearings whereby proper examination, to my mind, has not been available to senators because of the corporatising of governmental bodies and the creation, to a degree, of a barrier between the senators who are seeking to scrutinise expenditures and those bodies which are in fact involved in expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Senate resumes after the fortnight break and the Appropriation Bills are debated in detail, we will be examining one report at least of a Senate Estimates committee which outlines the problems created by, for example, trust funds which hide behind a one-line or two-line appropriation a great volume of transactions which are not available for scrutiny. I am glad that procedures are in hand to bring about a correction of that. I warn the Senate that the creation of corporate entities can well be the worst of all worlds when those corporate entities are owned by the Government but are reluctant to accept the reporting responsibilities that are imposed on departments and yet do not have the public responsibilities of the corporate sector. I believe that this is a matter of great moment. </PARA>
<PARA> I want very briefly to deal with a couple of matters raised in this Auditor-General's report. I note that the Auditor-General raises once again the audit of the Australian Construction Services (ACS) relating to resource utilisation, land and buildings. In previous Senate Estimates hearings I have repeatedly asked this section for full information on any significantly underutilised resources that it had, and it has consistently failed to indicate such resources that were underutilised. We now see in this Auditor-General's report:</PARA>
<PARA> An audit of ACS's use of land and buildings in Western Australia established that ACS had not reviewed land and building requirements for its wages employee workforce on an objective basis and had maintained resources in excess of its requirements for an extended period. </PARA>
<PARA>Being misled in Senate Estimates hearings is not something that I appreciate, and it is not a particularly clever trick for the bureaucracy to seek to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> I will mention briefly a couple of other matters. Earlier this year we dealt with the Auditor-General's report on the accounts and records work at the Garden Island Dockyard, which at that stage, as I understand it, had not been completed. The Australian Audit Office now says that the audit has been completed and that it found deficiencies with the debtors and creditors system, the salaries and wages system, the general ledger system, stocktakes, stock and cash on hand not being included in the general ledger and an inability to reconcile the trust account-that is effectively the bank account-since 1986. The dockyard advised that it regarded the matters as serious and that actions have been taken to rectify the accounting deficiencies identified. I mention that to outline the significant role that the Auditor-General is playing in the proper examination of the activities of government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also interesting to note the following remarks about the Attorney-General's Department and the Director of Public Prosecutions:</PARA>
<PARA> Audit noted that as at 7 March 1989 the value of the fines and costs outstanding totalled $1,537,768. There were approximately 650 active fines and cost files, i.e., files which related to outstanding fines and costs to be recovered. It was found that certain debts related to fines and costs which had been imposed more than two years ago, and little or no recent action had been taken to recover some of the long outstanding amounts. </PARA>
<PARA>One might wonder why we bother going ahead and fining people if we are not going to collect the fines. The other brief point I want to make is that the following is said about the payment of grants under the children's services element of the Department of Community Services and Health:</PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding the implementation of corrective action, the AAO is concerned the Departmental control over the payment of grants broke down to the extent that unauthorised payments and uncertified claims were processed. </PARA>
<PARA>I extract that from a fairly wide-ranging criticism of the control of payments under the children's services element. There are many other matters of significance raised in this report. I do not want to deal with them now, as many of them will be dealt with during the Senate Estimates debate, save for noting that under the Commonwealth road funding programs on the national highway, the Auditor-General reports:</PARA>
<PARA> Some NH projects showed significant cost increases. Final costs of 44% of projects in an AAO sample of 183 varied from original approved cost levels by more than 30%, with cost variations of over $300 million in total. These results indicated limitations in reliability and accuracy of State estimates on which DTC relied for funds control and forward planning. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>This inquiry was a further step in the Committee's continuing scrutiny of the non-departmental area of public administration. Several previous reports have dealt with statutory authorities and non-statutory bodies but this is the first occasion on which government involvement in companies has come under review by the Committee. The Committee took as its starting point a firm conviction that Ministers are no less responsible for the companies within their portfolios than for their departments and statutory authorities. It follows that the device of creating a company should not be taken as a pretext for sidestepping the principle of accountability to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's interest in the Commonwealth's involvement in companies was prompted by the rapid growth in the number of subsidiary companies formed by government business enterprises (GBEs)-for example, the Commonwealth Bank and Australian Airlines; the steady growth in minority holdings in companies by bodies such as the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust and the Australian Industry Development Corporation in the course of their normal activities; the conversion of several major GBEs from statutory authority to company status-for example, Australian Airlines, Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (SMEC), Australian National Line (ANL) and Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC); the formation of Aerospace Technologies of Australia and Australian Defence Industries out of the Department of Defence by executive action without any reference to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> These developments raised four questions which the Committee saw as important. What is the extent of the Government's involvement in companies? What approvals are required for such involvement? What Government activities, if any, are suited for companies rather than statutory authorities? Are the arrangements for accountability to Parliament adequate? The first of these questions-the extent of Commonwealth involvement in companies-proved to be by far the most difficult. The simple answer is that no-one knows exactly. The Auditor-General maintains a list but does not claim it to be complete. The Committee has compiled a list itself, but even during the printing of the report we were made aware of three omissions. </PARA>
<PARA> In all, we were able to locate almost 400 companies in which the Commonwealth has a major involvement. Just over half were majority-owned companies. The remainder were divided between companies in which the Government held 20 to 50 per cent of the capital, companies limited by guarantee and incorporated associations. We had no difficulty in concluding that, without a readily accessible and reliable register, the accountability of these companies was flawed. The Committee strongly recommends the establishment and continuous maintenance of a register of companies in which the Commonwealth has a substantial interest. This is a parallel recommendation to our previous recommendation on the establishment of a register of non-statutory bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of approvals for the formation of companies, we again found a confusing situation. Subsidiary companies may be formed by GBEs-whether statutory authorities or companies-as they choose, but they should notify the Minister of all such formations or acquisitions. An earlier requirement for the tabling of this information seems to have been quietly dropped, at least in one area. We can find no evidence that it was ever carried out. </PARA>
<PARA> Parliamentary approval was necessary for the conversion of Australian Airlines, SMEC, ANL and OTC from statutory authorities to companies. But there is a gaping hole in the approval process: Ministers, acting through their departments, can apparently form, participate in and even dispose of companies in the ordinary exercise of their executive powers. They need not inform Parliament or table annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, the Minister for Defence established two companies-Aerospace Technologies of Australia and Australian Defence Industries-and transferred assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars and over 8,000 employees from the Department to the new companies. In the same way, the Department of Employment, Education and Training sponsors, joins, appoints directors to and finances more than 100 companies limited by guarantee and incorporated associations. Their existence as committees is mentioned but their legal status is not disclosed in the Department's annual report and, to the best of our knowledge, Parliament has never been informed of their existence as incorporated bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has made a series of recommendations to ensure that the government cannot become involved in companies without general or specific parliamentary approval. One can question whether there are advantages in company status as against the statutory authority form, and whether company status is necessary to obtain the greater efficiency and flexibility that everyone is seeking. It is possible to give as much, or as little, operating freedom as the government chooses to either statutory authorities or companies, as the Minister for Finance has pointed out in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee agreed that, in the event of company status being considered in the future, a criterion should be set requiring that a company be established only when clear efficiencies or other benefits arise which cannot be obtained without the use of the company structure. The Committee was also unanimous in its view that the reporting and auditing arrangements for government companies were wholly inadequate. We were astonished to learn that the two defence companies, for example, are `exempt proprietary companies', which means that there need be no public reporting, though the Minister has promised that annual reports will be tabled. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that no government companies be incorporated as exempt proprietary companies and that the existing ones be converted to public company status. Furthermore, all government companies should be required to conform to the reporting requirements of statutory authorities as well as meeting those of the Companies Code and that all such reports should be tabled in Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee strongly rejects the view that government companies should be free to choose their own private auditors. Audit is not an instrument of control; it is an instrument of accountability. The greater the degree of management freedom, the greater is the requirement for adequate accountability. The auditing standards under the Audit Act are wider than those provided by the Companies Code and the Committee recommends that all government companies be audited by the Auditor-General to Audit Act standards. This would not prevent the delegation of work to private auditors under contract, but under the control of the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that the problems surrounding this subject are sufficiently important to justify the introduction of legislation to cover the whole area of government companies. Such legislation would regulate the formation of, acquisition of, participation in and disposal of government companies. It would also cover reporting, auditing and tabling requirements and the maintenance of the register which the Committee recommends be established. </PARA>
<PARA> This Committee is unanimous in its view that the increased use of the company structure has opened up serious gaps in the ability of Parliament to carry out its functions. It fully endorses the recommendation of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts that the Auditor-General be reinstated as the auditor of all government companies. I was pleased to hear the Minister for Finance announce yesterday that the Government was disposed to accept this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank everyone connected with the preparation of this report, especially Michael Game, the Committee's research officer. I should also mention, for those who continually criticise the Australian Government Publishing Service (AGPS), that the printed copies were delivered to us less than 48 hours after the camera-ready copy was provided to the AGPS. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I mean the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration-in its deliberation of this matter dealing with government companies. The whole issue of government companies is very much tied up with the question of privatisation. Perhaps that was a Freudian slip on my part. But I want to refer to that aspect of the matter in the course of my remarks. In its inquiry the Committee discovered a most extraordinary situation that has developed in Commonwealth Government administration in recent years. We are all familiar with Qantas Airways Ltd, which is, as we all know, a company formed under what I think was the Queensland Companies Act. Qantas was acquired by the Commonwealth by purchasing shares. However, that was a fairly unique and exceptional way in which government had gone about carrying out its business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Apart from the departmental form of government administration, of course, the other method favoured by government with the approval of Parliament has been the creation of statutory corporations under special Acts of Parliament. The whole range of requirements of corporate form are dealt with in such legislation, in particular the accountability of the entity to the Parliament. The ordinary accountability of administration of the Commonwealth Government to Parliament is provided under our principle of ministerial responsibility, dealt with in section 64 of the Constitution, which enables the appointment of officers-that is the constitutional word; we refer to `Ministers'-to administer departments of state as the Governor-General may establish. Those officers are known as Ministers of State. </PARA>
<PARA> What seems to have been occurring in recent years is that, without actually deciding that an existing or new function of government will be hived off from a department and placed in a statutory body known as a statutory corporation, the Commonwealth administration-presumably with the knowledge and consent of Ministers, although that is not always entirely clear-has been forming companies under the ordinary companies codes of the State in which they are formed, or in the Australian Capital Territory in many cases. That function, which was previously a departmental function, is being carried on by the company which, in many cases, is wholly owned by the Commonwealth and the shareholders in that company are usually the Minister and/or senior officers of the department concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> In the view of the Committee, there is no doubt that these companies are accountable through the ordinary company structure to the Minister, and thereby the Minister is accountable to the Parliament under the ordinary principles of responsible government enshrined, of course, in the Constitution. Nevertheless, there are very obvious problems in giving effect to that accountability if the functions of a department are in fact carried on in that way. The report explains those difficulties. Senator Coates has already given some examples of the problem in his tabling statement. </PARA>
<PARA> One major problem is that the reason that these departmental functions have been hived off into company form is precisely because the departments are dealing with activities with which it is inconvenient in many ways for those who are carrying on that particular function to be hobbled. They do not want to be hobbled in any way with the ordinary rules dealing with departmental administration and, in particular, the accountability ultimately to the Parliament, even to the extent that the executives of these companies, despite that legal and constitutional responsibility that they ultimately have, are seeking to avoid the attention of and auditing by the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> That matter has also been considered by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. I think it should be of great note to the Government and to the Parliament that two committees now-the Public Accounts Committee and the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration-have come to the same view that certainly the Auditor-General must be responsible for the audit of these companies, even though private auditors may be subcontracted in arrangements to be made between the Auditor-General and the executives of the company. It is really quite a remarkable development that not only have these companies been formed but also, in a large number of cases, are not even known to exist. The experience that we had in the Committee was that we found difficulties in identifying them, and we do not know whether we have identified all of them by any means. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tambling, in an Estimates committee, found some company structures operating in the Aboriginal Development Commission which we had not been aware of. They are not referred to or accounted for in this particular report. Shortly after settling this report, I got an invitation to a function in Parliament House from Senator Cook to celebrate the opening of some important environmental initiative. The actual invitation indicated that the Government had formed a company called Land Care to perform a particular function. That company should be added to this list. Presumably the Minister knew all about that company, but in some cases I suspect that some of these companies are formed without Ministers knowing about them. It would be very valuable if the Government, in response to this Committee, could indicate clearly whether there is firm ministerial involvement in the formation and, indeed, the administration of these companies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One other matter I mention is the recommendation of a government companies Act. That is not intended to be an Act under which these companies would be formed. In other words, it is not as though we are suggesting that there should be a separate Act under which these entities achieve legal status as independent entities known as companies. This is simply a government companies Act, the purpose of which is set out in great detail in paragraph 3.4.3 of chapter 3 of the report. It is really designed to ensure that the Parliament is informed about the intention to form such companies, that adequate reporting is made to Parliament, that adequate auditing is undertaken and so on. The precedent for that has come from a recent Act passed in the New South Wales Parliament known as the State Owned Corporations Act. I hope that the Government will agree that that Act could be an important step to be taken by this Parliament in solving the problems that clearly arise in the proper accountability of government companies. </PARA>
<PARA> A further matter I mention is the question of the proper status of government companies at all in the political arena. Although the members of this Committee were clearly divided on party lines in their attitude to privatisation of government functions, it is interesting that the Committee has been able to put down a unanimous report. There is no dissenting report. We accepted our differences and sought to achieve a positive result about which we could agree. That has, I think, been a significant achievement of this report. Nevertheless, hanging behind this report there is the fundamental political question of whether it is appropriate to hive off what is a growing area of government functions to companies and whether it would not be more appropriate for those activities to be within the jurisdiction of the private sector and therefore be privatised. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to go into the debate for or against privatisation, but clearly one can look at the criteria that it is suggested should be adopted by both the Government in its statements on government business enterprises and by the Committee in chapter 4 of this report. In paragraph 4.4 of the Committee's report, under the heading, `Criteria for Company Formation', and in the following paragraphs, it is notable that the sorts of criteria that it is agreed should be satisfied before any government structure is considered-apart from the ultimate destination of the shareholding in these companies-are very much the sorts of criteria which would, in my view, be appropriate for the private sector to be performing rather than government. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a rather odd situation whereby the present Government, which is officially largely opposed to privatisation, has moved very rapidly in the direction of what is called in many cases corporatising; although it is really a setting up in corporate form-that is, a company-of the administration of these activities. That development is occurring by leaps and bounds under a government which is officially opposed to privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The very dangerous aspect of this course, which I think is understood by Government members of the Committee, is that bodies will be set up which are accountable to no-one. If these bodies were privatised, they would not only be accountable to their shareholders but also be examined closely by the financial press and by the financial community generally. There would be all sorts of methods of accountability and pressures upon them to perform efficiently and properly. If they are to remain as government functions, they will be subject to the accountability processes that have been so well developed, in this Senate particularly, over the years. Although ministerial responsibility these days does not extend to the point where a Minister must know everything that is going on in his department, nevertheless a Minister knows that if something goes wrong, he must put it right. He must do the best he can to ensure that things do not go wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> With the hiving off of many of these functions into a company which is not subject to the ordinary pressures of the private sector and can escape much more easily the scrutiny of the Parliament and public control-I refer not merely to the Parliament but to the whole mechanism of financial controls, such as those of the Auditor-General, the Department of Finance, the Treasury, and so on-one is letting loose beings that are totally unguided and uncontrolled. I am very happy that the Committee has been unanimous in its recognition of that point and in its proposals to do something about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to comment briefly on the report of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. I think it is very timely because of the activities of other committees of the Parliament that have been undertaking a number of other scrutinies. I have had only a very brief opportunity to peruse the report, but I can see that the coverage it has given to so many areas of government has been very thorough. It has sought to identify those areas where the Government, through various departments and statutory authorities, has sought to formalise its operations with company structures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My initial concern is with regard to the area which identifies the number of companies that have been used, and the purposes for which they have been used, by various departments or agencies. As Senator Durack pointed out, in the recent Senate Estimates Committee E hearings we identified that the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) was engaging in a practice of using shelf companies for the purchase of land to advantage Aboriginal people. Whilst I think there may be many good intentions behind that endeavour, particularly with regard to the acquisition of pastoral properties, I am concerned that the use of shelf companies without proper trust deeds and trust arrangements correctly in place to ensure the end benefit is an area about which the Government could face serious questioning with regard to the manner in which the ADC has chosen to operate. </PARA>
<PARA> I will illustrate what I am getting at. The companies of which I am aware that have been formed for the purchase of pastoral properties have usually been companies in which the shareholding has been undertaken by people who are not directly in the employ of the ADC but who are, in effect, consultants to that organisation. These people are not directly accountable or responsible to the Aboriginal communities which those companies are designed to serve. In fact, there may well be no suitable trust deed of arrangement in place. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer honourable senators to pages E238 and E239 of the Hansard record of Estimates Committee E hearings of 10 October 1989. In its evidence to that Committee ADC accepted that this is a unique arrangement for purchasing land. So it is not merely a matter of the administration of Aboriginal affairs in a portfolio sense that is under scrutiny here; it is also a matter of the Government's policy of purchasing land and the way in which that could become a future commitment of considerable financial impost to the Government. I would hope that any proper consideration by the Government of this report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration would also look further behind the issues that have been raised by the Committee. The activities highlighted by the Senate Estimates Committee E hearings last week, identifying what could be described as a sleight of hand or underhand method of the Government engaging in additional land purchasing, particularly of pastoral properties throughout Australia, needs to be properly addressed. I hope that when the Government responds to this report it is able to identify the arm's length companies that many of these statutory authorities are also engaged in. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to speak to the report of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration entitled Government Companies and their Reporting Requirements. As a member of the Committee I pay tribute to the efforts of all Committee members' which resulted in a unanimous report being adopted. Nonetheless, I think it would be foolish to pretend that this reflects a common view in the community that somehow corporatisation is the way to go. I think that the informed public would certainly be aware of the mass of ideological confusion and debate within Government ranks about the efficiency of privatisation and corporatisation. This is really an ersatz outcome. It is a compromise, as it was in New Zealand, which is designed to soothe nerves in the first instance, to mislead the unwary in the second instance, and ultimately to provide a platform from which privatisation can spring.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, of course, the Government is not interested in any of these sorts of concepts in the run-up to an election. Indeed, even the Prime Minister when he has done his best to raise the issue has been firmly put in his place. There have been a number of supposed economic rationalists in the Government who have thought that privatisation might not be such a bad idea. Even a committed public sector ideologue like Mr Willis had the temerity to raise the concept a few months ago, only to be chopped off at the ankles. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are looking at, of course, is nothing more than corporatisation. It would be easy to be misled into thinking that somehow the adoption of a whole range of commercial jargon will be a sufficient substitute for competition in the real world. The use of concepts such as performance indicators and corporate plans, and even the consumer price index minus X formula for telecommunications, should not blind us to the fact that rate of return regulation and its variance has not been a success in other countries, and that indeed there is no substitute for real competition. </PARA>
<PARA> Against that background it has to be acknowledged that, whilst there are justifications for corporatisation, they need to be scrutinised very carefully. Honourable senators on this side of the chamber certainly do not take the view that because this is a poor substitute for the real thing we can somehow ignore what the structures involve. I think it is quite clear to the public at large that our policy would involve a considerable amount of privatisation of a large number of government business enterprises (GBEs), so-called, which are indeed monopoly enterprises at present. I think what we are looking at now is an interim phase until there is a change of government at the next election when we will be in a position to implement that privatisation program. </PARA>
<PARA> For the present, let me confine my attention to some of the recommendations of the committee report. I do not quite share the view of Senator Coates that a concept such as letting the managers manage is merely a passing fad, or a current fashion, as he described it. I think there are people in the Australian Labor Party who are not happy even with corporatisation. However, there is certainly a lot to be said for proper devolution of responsibility as long as there is accompanying accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the recommendations that I think is worthy of close scrutiny is that Ministers must remain responsible no less for the companies within their portfolios than for their departments and statutory authorities. There has been an increasing trend in this place for Ministers to wash their hands of the doings of statutory authorities and government business enterprises on the basis that decisions should be made by the board and that they have nothing to do with the Government. I would have thought that shareholders would be derelict in their duty if they did not pay close attention to the way in which their funds were being used. There is no excuse at all for Ministers trying to absolve themselves from responsibility for the actions of those GBEs. </PARA>
<PARA> The absence of any comprehensible and readily accessible index of Commonwealth bodies is something that defies understanding. One would have thought that, if the Government was in the business of proper scrutiny of its own activities and indeed wanted to project an image of competence to the community at large, it would know precisely how many government business enterprises there were, how many statutory authorities there were and what their lines of responsibility were. Despite the fact that pressure has been brought to bear by a number of parliamentary committees-this being only the latest-the Government has shown no interest at all in recommendations for the establishment of a central register of companies and incorporated associations which the Government controls or in which it has a substantial interest. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that the Department of Finance would be particularly well suited to carrying out such an exercise, compiling an index and making it publicly available. I am sure that those who are seriously interested in concepts of accountability would see this as axiomatic. Many statutory authorities are required by Government policy guidelines to table information in the Parliament. It is not at all easy to identify those that have complied with these requirements. Again, I think the Committee is at one in expressing its concern that there are not adequate safeguards for companies directly owned by the Government. We certainly believe that, whilst they do remain in the public domain, Parliament should have the ability to scrutinise all their activities and that full and informed reporting should be made to Parliament on a regular basis. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the recommendations that has much to commend it is that no direct government interest in a company be established without legislative authority. That does not necessarily mean that it will be a condition precedent to the establishment of a government-owned corporation that legislation be in place specifically related to that company. What it does mean is that there should be prescribed in legislation a regime which sets out the accounting and other requirements, and reportability obligations, so that once that company has been established by government, even if the public is not immediately aware of it, it will automatically become aware of it in due course because of those reporting requirements. That is a very timely and overdue recommendation and it is very difficult to understand why the Government has not embraced this to date. For each department to be required to list in its annual report those GBEs and other incorporated bodies within the purview of the department would seem to be an obvious and desirable safeguard. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendation that government enterprises not be corporatised or incorporated unless there is `competition with the private sector, no explicit social objectives and a strong commercial culture' might be overstating the case, because there are internal mechanisms for funding community service obligations. That means that there can be competition with the rest of the private sector while still maintaining a specific non-commercial burden. There are means of funding that and I think there are a number of prime candidates for that type of arrangement. The drawing up of reporting guidelines for all companies, I think, is long overdue. I have no doubt at all that the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) would heartily concur with that recommendation. Again, it is disappointing that the Government needs to be dragged into this arena, if it professes an interest in efficiency and accountability in the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The role of the Auditor-General has already been dealt with by my colleagues. The establishment of audit committees by all GBEs is again another imitation of private sector practice which does have something to recommend it. It normally applies in the private sector to enable a proper scrutiny to be undertaken of companies where it would otherwise be left to executive officers. Therefore, I think the role of non-executive directors on boards of GBEs is particularly important. Although there is no substitute for the real thing, certainly I think the notion of an audit committee makes considerable sense, rather than simply taking the word of those intimately involved in the day to day activities that all is well. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this has been a valuable report. I hope it will contribute not only to an informed debate in the wider community but also to the Government getting its own house in order. It has gone halfway in its determination to duck the privatisation issue and to pretend that somehow there is a brave new world of competitive government business enterprises. It has forgotten to put in place the right structures to ensure that there is full accountability and that indeed we can have as much confidence about the so-called bottom lines for public enterprises as we should have for any listed public company. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend to the Senate the report of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. I also commend the hard work of Senators Coates, Alston, Black, Burns, Calvert and Durack as members of the Committee. This subject has interested me ever since I came into this Parliament. I am very supportive of the conclusions of the Committee. In particular, I commend the Committee's recommendation for the establishment of a central register of companies and incorporated associations which the Commonwealth controls or in which it has a substantial interest. Apparently, as the Committee points out, it has been very difficult to establish what companies the Government owns or controls, one way or the other. It is certain that there is very little evidence available on what some of these companies actually do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that Australian Airlines has a whole heap of subsidiaries which are registered in the Cook Islands with no revelation here of the extent to which ownership is held by it except that the shares are in the name of a trustee company but Australian Airlines controls the voting rights. The companies listed in the Cook Islands are Antacus Investments Ltd, Fenwick Finance Ltd, Hurdman Finance Ltd, Keynell Finance Ltd, Lanmartin Investments Ltd, Laroy Finance Ltd, Markby Finance Ltd, Quendon Investments Ltd, Redmond Ltd, Romeyn Investments Ltd, Safan Finance Ltd, Semkow Finance Ltd, Vandor Finance Ltd, Venton Finance Ltd, Wain Investments Ltd, Whittaker Finance Ltd, Yarnworth Securities Ltd and Zea Securities Ltd. What on earth is Australian Airlines doing having these subsidiaries registered in the Cook Islands? Presumably it is a tax dodge. I see the look of shock and horror on the face of a distinguished legal senator opposite. I can assure him that unless there was some advantage in having these subsidiaries registered in the Cook Islands that would not have taken place. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Parliament has the right to scrutinise such investments, so long as Australian Airlines remains owned by the public. There was great public distress and concern when the Four Corners program on the ABC pointed out the extent to which the Cook Islands appeared to be the home of many companies in the Bond Group, where remarkable profits appeared to be earned. The point about Australian Airlines underlines how absurd it is for the Government to continue to own an organisation which is in the private sector, for which there is no sound reason for government ownership and which, in fact, will be privatised by the coalition when it returns to government next year. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other matters that concern me in this report. I want to express my support for the Committee's concerns that there are not adequate safeguards for companies directly owned by the Government. The report points out:</PARA>
<PARA>This is a significant gap in the accountability system. There is no requirement for parliamentary approval of the initial government involvement or even for the Parliament to be advised of it. There are no legal requirements for advice to Parliament of changes in the government involvement or for the tabling of annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA>This is of particular concern in dealing with very substantial government business enterprises. On page 15 of the report the Committee does the Parliament a great service by pointing out the way in which this Government has sought to diminish the level of parliamentary scrutiny of these governmental bodies. The Committee reveals that the 1987 policy guidelines require prior ministerial approval of initial involvement in subsidiaries formed or acquired by statutory authorities. The 1987 guidelines also require a Minister to table in Parliament information on the formation or acquisition of subsidiaries within 15 sitting days of the formation or acquisition. The Committee states:</PARA>
<PARA> A 1988 revision of the policy guidelines in respect of eight GBEs within the Transport and Communication portfolio replaced the requirement for ministerial approval with a provision for the minister to be notified. At the same time, and apparently without public announcement, the requirement for tabling of information in Parliament was dropped in respect of the eight transport and communication GBEs. Although the tabling requirement remains for all other statutory authorities, the Committee can find no evidence that information on the formation or acquisition of any subsidiary company has been tabled since the policy guidelines were announced. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>The committee is disappointed at the unannounced withdrawal of the tabling requirement in the case of the transport and communication GBEs and the apparent failure of other entities to comply with the Government's policy guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a matter of serious concern which has been raised in the Senate Estimates committee hearings on frequent occasions. It has certainly exercised the minds of Opposition senators. I commend the Government members of this Committee for standing up on this matter of very substantial principle. The Committee points out:</PARA>
<PARA>ASTA and ADI-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd-</PARA>
<PARA>are examples of major enterprises taken out of the sphere of direct parliamentary scrutiny without any reference to Parliament. Further, as exempt proprietary companies-</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Coates also pointed this out-</PARA>
<PARA>their formal reporting requirements under the Companies Code are negligible. </PARA>
<PARA>It is true that the Minister has said that he would ensure that full annual reports will be tabled in Parliament, even though there is no legal requirement for that to happen. However, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Transfer of the activities undertaken by ASTA and ADI out of the departmental structure has reduced the scrutiny of these activities by Senate estimates committees. Moreover, companies, unless specifically included by regulation, are exempt from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The report also states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Government's involvement in 37 companies limited by guarantee and 67 incorporated associations through DEET has occurred without specific parliamentary approval . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is a matter of significance as well as the defence companies that I mentioned a little earlier. I admit that the defence ones are more significant because, in the case of defence companies, the transfer of assets worth tens of millions of dollars and thousands of employees were involved. The Committee states:</PARA>
<PARA>To regard the removal of such undertakings from direct governmental, and therefore parliamentary, control as a mere matter of administration is to demean the institution which is the custodian of those assets. Parliament might well have approved the changes; it should at least have been given the option. </PARA>
<PARA>On the question of the Department of Employment, Education and Training, the report says:</PARA>
<PARA>The DEET companies raise similar issues of principle as well as potential dangers. In each company, although the Commonwealth nominates one director, it does not control either the composition of the board or the decisions made. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee then deals with matters of insolvency. It is worth pointing out to the Senate that a risk clearly exists in respect of the failure of such companies. Massive liabilities, implied liabilities, may well rest on the Commonwealth's shoulders, on the taxpayers' shoulders. The report very sensibly points out:</PARA>
<PARA>It should be noted that the structure of these companies is similar to that of the now insolvent National Safety Council (Victoria). </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is proceeding with a system which has been shown to have the potential for absolute disaster for so many people and certainly for the public purse. It is the sort of disaster that took place with the failure of the National Safety Council in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> I request adoption of the Committee's recommendations that the annual reports of directly held government companies should conform to the guidelines set down for annual reports of statutory authorities; that a statutory requirement should be introduced for the annual reports of all directly owned government companies to be tabled in the Parliament as well as be provided to the relevant corporate affairs commissions; and that the same time limits as apply to provision of reports to the corporate affairs commissions should apply to tabling and that this should be included in the general government companies Act. In addition to that, I make the request that these reports be made available to senators before the sittings of the Senate Estimates committees dealing with the specific overview departments to which these government companies report, because the people of Australia own these companies. That is another reason for the Auditor-General to examine them. For proper scrutiny at the proper time, detailed information should be made available by the time of Senate Estimates committees. </PARA>
<PARA> I support Senator Coates's statement that the Auditor-General's Office should be the body authorised to audit these bodies. This underlines the urgent need, as outlined in the Auditor-General's report earlier this year which we dealt with quite recently, for the Auditor-General to have the resources, the structure and the flexibility to be able to undertake these audits. The Senate will note that the Auditor-General's Office appeared to be in a degree of crisis-I think the Auditor-General used the word-over its capacity to fulfil all the functions that the Auditor-General is basically required to fulfil and that many of these functions were not being attended to adequately simply because of a lack of staff, facilities, flexibility in employing staff, and a huge wastage rate of trained people, people trained at enormous cost on the job in the Audit Office. That drain of talent is a major problem which will have to be overcome if the very sensible recommendations of the report are to be implemented. I hope that this matter will be attended to. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, the Government has sought to hide some activities not simply behind the corporate veil of the corporations that it owns, but also through the trust funds that seem to operate in many other bodies. I hope that the Government reverses the clear trend to which the Committee has pointed. Rather than limit the amount of information available, the Government should go in the direction of making more available to the public information about the activities of the Government, as recommended by the Committee. I restate what the Committee said: these bodies are owned by the people of Australia. I commend the Committee for its report, which encourages the view that the people of Australia should have greater rights of supervision of and access to information from these bodies through their elected representatives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Telecom's annual report discloses a profit figure of $973m; in other words, Telecom has made a profit and the rest of Australia has made a loss. The essential proposition that flows from this is that it is not hard for the only player on the ground to kick goals, and that is what happened in this instance. I regard Telecom as being capable of being a very efficient fighting force. It has a very good quality board, people who would thrive in a competitive environment but who, because of the actions of the Government, are forced to operate in a range of monopoly areas. That is a trend that is going in the opposite direction around the world. For some reason best known to themselves, the anti-privateers and the Telecom monopoly preservation society in Caucus we will not see any competition under this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to look at some of the statistics that emerge from the annual report to explain why the profit figure is not a great deal higher. Telecom is acutely conscious of the political downside in returning a figure in excess of $1 billion. It has gone for gold plating rather than risk taking. It could have done a lot better. It was only because of a depreciation figure of about $187m that the figure was kept below that magic mark. There are other matters of particular concern. Apart altogether from the insensitivity of announcing increases in connection charges on the very day that massive profit figure was released, the most critical matter is the wilful and deliberate refusal by Mr Willis to release the Bureau of Transport Economics study on Telecom's community service obligations, in other words, the real cost of cross-subsidies. If we knew that we would know the justification for needing massive profits in order to subsidise those services in rural and remote areas. The industry accepts that it is a figure much less than $100m, which is chickenfeed compared to revenues in excess of $8 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to say much more about Telecom's behaviour in deliberately trying to sabotage the release of that report and to come up with another set of figures to overturn it, or, indeed, to try to persuade Government members that somehow there is some skerrick of justification for a continued monopoly on the cellular mobile system. However, I want to tell the Senate of an interesting letter that I received today from Hidden Valley Lodge which is a holiday lodge some 40 kilometres from the nearest town and hospital in the Maitland region. It is addressed to Ros Kelly, the responsible Minister. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Over the last 12 months . . . On no less than 14 occasions the phone has been inoperative. At some times for as long as 4 days . . . Should we have a bad accident and cannot reach the Hospital the resulting legal actions against Telecom could be quite embarrassing and expensive. </PARA>
<PARA>I have bad news for Hidden Valley Lodge because Telecom's Act provides it with total immunity from suit. Even in the event of obvious negligence, Telecom cannot be sued. That is an outrageous state of affairs in this day and age. The letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Since Telecom has been `fixing' our system we have-</PARA>
<PARA>Lost all phone services</PARA>
<PARA>Cannot dial out</PARA>
<PARA>Cannot receive incoming calls</PARA>
<PARA>Our Phones now won't ring</PARA>
<PARA>Our answering service (Telecom approved) will not pick up calls</PARA>
<PARA>The line drops out during a conversation</PARA>
<PARA> The only thing Telecom has succeeded in doing regularly is to send out the bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the lost business . . . we are isolated without this `basic' utility. </PARA>
<PARA> If your experts can't fix this problem please forward two tin cans and a large roll of string as the situation has become just ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA>I have a great deal of sympathy for the Hidden Valley Lodge and, I think, so have the consumers of Australia. They do not understand why a profit of about $1 billion cannot be applied towards halving subscriber trunk dialling rates, getting our local call charges, which are about the highest in the world, down to reasonable levels--</PARA>

The worst feature of all is that there is very poor quality of service. Telecom will not even publish quantitative data to let people know how long they have to stay in the queue. The Government will not even let Telecom charge for directory assistance, so Telecom is forgoing revenue of the order of $30m a year. Again, that is an example of political intervention by a government that claims to stand back and let the managers manage.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment on the Health Insurance Commission annual report 1988-89 and to note that, in the report, we are considering the Health Insurance Commission, which has just taken over the payment of pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) prescription fees to pharmacists, which was previously done by the Department of Community Services and Health. When it was announced that that was to be done, the pharmacists breathed a sigh of relief because the Department of Community Services and Health was very slow in processing their claims. From consulting with pharmacists-as I am sure most of us have been doing-I have learned that their claims are being processed reasonably quickly. I hope that that will continue, particularly because yesterday pharmacists' remuneration was reduced by 23 per cent and they cannot afford to have their remuneration take any longer than it needs to take. In fact, many pharmacists will go to the wall anyway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the issues in the report which I would like to raise is mentioned on page 59, namely, the categories of documents that are held by the Commission. For some time it has been a concern of mine that, with the introduction of Medicare, excessive amounts of information of Australians can be stored and recorded in terms of their health status. Next year, I would like the Commission to devote a section of its report to privacy. I know that the Commission has indicated that it holds documents that are not open to public access. However, it does hold data which, I believe, combined with data from the PBS on prescriptions, could be held by the Commission to provide epidemiological information about genetic disorders. Any family in Australia could be identified on the basis of Medicare records. Any family that has thalassemia, any family with PKU-phenylketonuria-or any family with fibro-cystic disease or any other genetic disorder could be easily identified by the type of medical treatment that members of that family had received or the type of medication that they had received. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians and this Parliament should be concerned about how that information is stored, for how long it is stored and what access is available to that information. The Health Insurance Commission has given an assurance that that information is not open to public access, but it is highly sensitive data. I believe the Parliament should be informed in the report of the Health Insurance Commission as to how that data is dealt with and for how long it is kept. I would like to know whether the documents are destroyed after five, six or seven years. I hope that next year's report of the Commission contains some details about that in order to allay any of our fears. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this Bill, which was introduced by Senator McGauran. At the outset I indicate that this issue requires a very sensitive analysis and a sensitive understanding of a very difficult situation that relates to Australian society, which, in the 1960s and 1970s, was split down the middle in terms of its approach to a particularly nasty and dirty war. Many issues possibly need reviving. However, other issues in relation to that war are best consigned to history so that we can learn from them and not raise them as divisive issues in today's society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 25 March 1968, a young Australian was killed on patrol and died soon afterwards in a helicopter during evacuation. He was one of the 496 Australians who were killed in the Vietnam war, in which 2,398 Australians were wounded. Forty-seven thousand American soldiers died in that war and 306,000 were wounded. For many of them, their lives were ruined completely. Approximately 400,000 South Vietnamese soldiers died and 783,000 were wounded. Close to one million North Vietnamese and Vietcong died in that conflict. I believe that indicates that the Vietnam war was a tragedy all round for this region as a whole: Australia, Vietnam and Asia. I believe that many of us can learn a lesson from the politics that surrounded that issue. </PARA>
<PARA> That young soldier was one of many who were killed during that conflict, which was a nasty and disgusting war that needs to be remembered for only three things: first of all, we remember those who helped to end it; secondly, we remember those who had to fight in it-either those who were conscripted on either side or those who chose to fight in it; thirdly, we remember those civilians who were maimed and killed in that conflict-remembering that more bombs were dropped on North Vietnam, for example, than were dropped during the entire World War II. </PARA>
<PARA> Second Lieutenant Fraser was one of the second group who had to fight in that war. As I indicated, whilst on patrol in 1968 he trod on an M16 jumping jack mine and was mortally wounded. He died later while being evacuated in a helicopter. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the background of why Senator McGauran introduced this Bill. Some people such as Senator McGauran say that the subsequent actions of Second Lieutenant John Fraser should have justified his receiving a posthumous award for bravery. There are conflicting reports about this. Senator McGauran puts it in his particular way. He says that John Fraser was either a war hero who is worthy of a posthumous bravery award or another Australian soldier killed. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to the Senate that every soldier who died in Vietnam and who fought in that dirty war is entitled to recognition. This Government has recognised them. For example, the Agent Orange royal commission was an attempt to examine a major issue that concerned Vietnam veterans. The recommendations and the final judgment of that commission are a matter for this Parliament to record. I believe that each of us individually has his own view about what is in fact the real issue and whether or not the truth about that could ever be discovered. Probably the major issue, apart from normal rehabilitation which faced the Vietnam veterans, was that problem with Agent Orange and the fears that we installed in them as a result of finding out more at a much later date about the effects of the pesticides that were used during the conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McGauran is right about one thing: he mentioned in his second reading speech that he was too young to fight in that war. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . I am one such person who was not even born when the atrocities occurred in the Second World War. So it is significant for me to add that my generation has never been asked to go to war. We have been privileged with an era that has not challenged our beliefs to a point where we must take up arms and defend them in war. </PARA>
<PARA>In indicating that he was too young for the Second World War, Senator McGauran also indicated that he was too young to fight in the Vietnam War. I was one of those people whose name went into the second ballot during the Vietnam War. Two of my friends were killed in that conflict. One of them was totally opposed to the war in terms of its aims and the way in which we were fighting it. In fact, he had views about the strategic politics of what it was all about. He did not come back. As I said, he was one of those 496 young Australians killed. I would like to think that any young politician who is too young to have been chosen for or conscripted into any conflict would try not to make political capital out of this issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not saying anything about Senator McGauran. Senator Boswell may have written his speech, but should try not to be so touchy about it. In other words, I would like to think that none of us here will try to make political capital out of this issue and will not lift the expectations of those families who, as a result of reading about this Bill, may be thinking that their dead sons or other young people who died in that war may, in some way, be recognised through a posthumous award. The passage of this Bill would not necessarily make that occur, and I think they ought to understand that very clearly. Turning the death of young men into a political issue would be an extremely dangerous thing for this chamber to involve itself in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My one criticism of Senator McGauran on that issue goes to a comment he made during his second reading speech in which he referred to an `unfinished chapter'. He says this whole thing is part of an unfinished chapter. He refers to the failure of the Whitlam Government to bring in an end of war list. I must set the record straight on that point. I presume that Senator McGauran has made a mistake or has been carried away with some enthusiasm. It is a justifiable enthusiasm, but not one which is a vote getting or vote seeking exercise. He neglected to indicate that the proposition that there should be an end of war list was put to the Liberal Minister for Defence, Mr Fairbairn, who approved and endorsed the proposition that there should not be an end of war list. In fact, two successive Ministers of Defence-the Liberal Minister for Defence, Mr Fairbairn, and the Labor Minister for Defence, the Deputy Prime Minister, Lance Barnard-both took the advice of their Chiefs of Staff at the time, who recommended that there should not be an end of war list. That is the situation as I see it. </PARA>
<PARA> The recognition of young men who went to war should be an established principle. I do not necessarily believe in the Victoria Cross, particularly when VCs and other awards are awarded on a monthly quota, which, I understand, is the current system in most countries. Who is to say that, for example, in one month 30 should be awarded and, in another, 30 again, despite the fact that two totally separate battlefields could have been in operation at the time? Most of my interest in this Bill revolves around the way in which Senator McGauran is able to explain to me some of the issues that flow from it. I will certainly be asking some questions in relation to that. </PARA>
<PARA> I finish on a point that has moved me particularly. On a recent visit to Europe with a parliamentary delegation, I went to a very small cemetery in Louvain in Belgium. It is not one of the massive cemeteries like Ypres or Passchendaele, which by their sheer vastness bring home the tragedy of wars that have passed backwards and forwards across the Flanders region. It was a very small, neat and tidy cemetery. There were about 40 young Australians buried there. I use the term `young Australians' deliberately, because as one walks down the rows of crosses in that cemetery-this little cemetery stuck away in a very ancient town somewhere in the backblocks of Belgium, if I can put it that way-one cannot help but be appalled by two things. The first is the age of the young people, and the physical proximity of those people who died. Obviously, a Lancaster bomber, or something, was shot down and there are five or six Australian graves in a row. They were all aged 18 to about 31, and there was one man of about 46. I thought that these young people would probably never have gone overseas. They would not have known where Louvain was, yet here they are, buried 12,000 miles from their homes and relatives. That was hard enough-the thought of those young people ending their lives at those ages miles away from home. </PARA>
<PARA> Then I had a look at the visitors book, and the comments in that visitors book were probably the most moving things I have ever read. A lot of the comments had been put in during the last 30 years. They were from the parents and relatives of those young men. In some cases they were expressing gratitude for the way in which the cemetery was kept and the memories of their nephews or sons were maintained. Others were dealing with war itself. If ever one looked for an anti-war document, that particular book was it. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, with that and the memory of those people I knew who went to Vietnam in my mind, I would like to look very closely at this Bill brought forward by Senator McGauran. I hope that in a spirit of cooperation this House will examine it and make it a better Bill. I look forward to Senator McGauran's presentation during the committee stage of particular issues that will come out of it. As I said, I hope that at this stage there will be no politics made out of the deaths of young men in conflicts, not only in Vietnam but wherever those conflicts occurred. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an honour for me to be able to support Senator McGauran's End of War List Bill 1989. I know this is a sensitive issue and one that worries a great many people. Let me reject out of hand the suggestion that there is anything political in this Bill. I will not accept that. I know the debate will flow and ebb, but I want it to flow and ebb in the right spirit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In technical terms, Senator McGauran's private member's Bill seeks to set up a tribunal which would consist of three members, one from each of the three arms of the Australian Defence Force. These appointments would be made by the Minister for Defence. The purpose of the tribunal would be to investigate acts of valour performed by the people who did not receive awards during the conflict. I believe the tribunal would go on for any further conflicts. The Senate is indebted to Senator McGauran for having the initiative and foresight to bring forth this private member's Bill to honour the 49,211 men and women who served in the Vietnam conflict. My figure is slightly higher than the 511 put forward by Senator Aulich as being the number of men who paid the supreme sacrifice with their lives. Whether it is the 500-odd that I mentioned or the 400-odd that Senator Aulich mentioned, it is certainly a very high price to pay, as it would be even if it was only one. </PARA>
<PARA> That conflict lasted from 1962 to 1973. That decade shaped many people's lives, particularly the lives of people who would be in the age group of those who are in this Senate now. It challenged many young Australians, particularly those in universities. I know many members of my own Party were so challenged that they marched in protest against the conscription and our involvement in the Vietnam war. The people who would have traditionally supported our side, or the conservative side, of politics changed their political alliance and have probably carried that right through to now. That is the effect that that war has had on many people. </PARA>
<PARA> The events of that decade had a changing effect on the formative years of countless thousands of Australians. Whether senators and members of Parliament believe that Australians should have been involved in that conflict or the question of conscription really has nothing to do with this private member's Bill. The Bill seeks only to honour the men and women who served either in a voluntary or a conscriptive capacity in Vietnam. It does not seek to condone the conflict or honour war in any way, but simply to acknowledge the hardships and sacrifices that many people made. That is where Senator McGauran and I differ from Senator Aulich. We want to say to these people, `You did a job, you did it well, and we thank you'. </PARA>

Australia has always had a long and a proud tradition of honouring its returned servicemen. Because of the hardships they endured, including the social sacrifices of leaving home to serve and the economic sacrifices made-two years out of the game, business advancement and income halted for two years-we believe this Bill should be carried.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Each year, a public holiday is declared on 25 April, Anzac Day-not to glorify war but to acknowledge the debt we owe to the men and women who served Australia in all wars. There would be very few members of this chamber and the other chamber who do not go and stand shoulder to shoulder at the Anzac Day wreath-laying ceremonies and the parades each year. What we are doing there is paying tribute to the people who went before. In my area the Australian Labor Party Federal member for Bowman and I, the ALP member for the local seat and the ALP alderman all stand up in these ceremonies and pay tribute to those people. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McGauran's private member's legislation to establish an end of war list is merely a continuation and an extension of the way in which we honour, acknowledge, thank and respect our returned veterans. Over the past three months there has been a continuous flow of petitions signed by Australians supporting the end of war list. Everyday over the last three months, 100 or so signatures have been placed on such petitions. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians have served in two major conflicts and many small ones, including the Vietnam War. That war was not won. It divided Australians like no other issue ever has. When our men and women returned from the war they received no accolades, no welcome, no parade and no appreciation for their efforts. In some cases, these men and women were shunned and humiliated. It was a traumatic experience from which some never recovered. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourteen years after the end of the war, the olive branch was extended by way of a coming home parade. Our veterans were welcomed home in a manner befitting the effort they made for Australia. It was a belated welcome and I believe it does Australia no credit that it took us 14 years to come to terms with our responsibilities and give these people a traditional welcome home. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time, a resolution was supported by all major parties, including the Australian Democrats, who joined together in a united motion of the Senate supporting the veterans and the coming home parade. I believe that the motion was also unanimously carried in the lower House. Senator Tate said:</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that both the United States and Australia suffered terrible traumas during the conduct of that war and could not find the psychological resources to greet these soldiers as they returned, although we certainly should have . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I agree with Senator Tate. We should have given them the support that they required. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I certainly support the Welcome Home Parade concept. </PARA>
<PARA>He said he hoped it would be successful and helpful. Senator Reynolds moved the following motion:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that the Australian Armed Forces served with great distinction in Vietnam between 1962 and 1972, earning great credit for themselves and for this nation;</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>express its appreciation and the appreciation of the Australian people for the individual and collective commitment, effort and sacrifice of its sailors, soldiers, airmen, men and women alike, who took part in the Vietnam conflict. </PARA>
<PARA>On the same day, Senator McLean rose and spoke for the Democrats in support of the motion, noting:</PARA>
<PARA>What we are now doing is joining together as a united chamber to express our good wishes to those great veterans and to hope that 3 October-</PARA>
<PARA>the day of the coming home parade-</PARA>
<PARA>and what it signifies for this country was an adequate belated expression of our appreciation for what they did for our nation and the sacrifices that they made. </PARA>
<PARA>There was a unanimous vote of support in this chamber. Those statements, made in the Senate and repeated in the House, illustrated clearly that the Vietnam veterans' efforts had been acknowledged by the parliamentary representatives of all parties in this Parliament. But if these veterans are to have the same place in history as veterans who served in other conflicts, then Senator McGauran's private member's Bill must be given the same support as the unanimously carried resolution carried by both Houses of Parliament for the coming home parade. To deny this Bill passage would be to take a step backwards and would be a hypocritical move by the members of this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> During the Whitlam regime the Labor Government rejected the establishment of an end of war list on the grounds that it would be seen to be celebrating war. At that time, the Labor Party-and I say this with a great deal of sensitivity-had campaigned against the involvement in the war and there would have been a great deal of feeling against the raising of an end of war list-and I can understand that. I lived in those times. I saw what the war did to people. But after 16 years, at the end of a divisive period, it is time we put this matter to rest and gave the Vietnam veterans the same rights and privileges as all other Australian veterans enjoy. It is time we acknowledged them once and for all and put them on the same plane, the same level, giving them the same benefits, the same acknowledgment and the same honour as every other serviceman who has served this nation has received. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I saw in the newspapers a memorial to the Australian Army with two larger than life bronze statues of the Vietnam war diggers. They are massive statues, and beneath them is Mr Hawke. The ceremony marked the seventy-fifth anniversary of the departure of the last Australian Imperial Force for World War I. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that if we are to honour our veterans, dedicate statues to them and do all the things that a government is responsible for in relation to our veterans it is up to us as a chamber to combine behind this legislation and pass it for all those people who served in Vietnam. Senator Aulich raised a question that the Liberal Minister-who I think was Mr Fairbairn at that time-rejected an end of war list. I have done some research on that which shows that Mr Fairbairn left the end of war list open because people were still serving in Vietnam at that time but that he did not rule an end of war list out. I just qualify that for Senator Aulich. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If indeed that was all Senator McGauran had done in his speech, I would not even bother to canvass the history of the establishment of this list. But as Senator McGauran has chosen to use the words `political considerations' in respect of why this list was not established, it is essential that I do so. I completely agree with Senator Boswell that, in relation to whether this end of war list should be established, it really is not relevant as to who did not establish it originally. But the sponsor of this Bill, the End of War List Bill 1989, placed it on the record in the Senate in the second reading speech, and so it has to be responded to. I refer honourable senators to two paragraphs of Senator McGauran's second reading speech. They have to be read together. In the second paragraph of his speech on page 1 he says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The chapter relates to the failure of the Whitlam Government to establish an End of War List on the return home of the Australian troops from Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA>He concludes his speech by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>This aspect of the Bill would ensure that political considerations could never again prevent the creation of End of War Lists. </PARA>
<PARA>That implication cannot be allowed to stand without correction. Senator Aulich has said quite accurately that it was indeed Mr Fairbairn who made a decision not to establish an end of war list. Shortly after, that decision was again endorsed by the then Minister Barnard. Both Mr Fairbairn and later Mr Barnard simply endorsed in their decisions not to establish the list the decision that had been taken not to do so by the chairman of the chiefs of staff and the Department of Defence, which agreed with that decision.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator McGauran is shaking his head, and I look forward to him straightening me out in the committee stage and telling me that Mr Fairbairn in fact made a decision against the advice of the chairman of the chiefs of staff. Like Senator McGauran, in debating these matters in the chamber I can rely only on the information that I receive. If I have been misled in the brief that I have been given on this I would be delighted for that mistake to be pointed out to me. But I have been informed authoritatively that the original recommendation to the Minister by the chairman of the chiefs of staff of the Australian military forces and the Department of Defence was that such a list should not be established. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Aulich and, I guess, a lot of us in here come from the same generation. At the time the Vietnam conflict broke out an infamous ballot system-that was my view then and now-was established to conscript 20-year-olds like myself to go to Vietnam. I was a country boy working on a farm in north- western New South Wales. I remember clearly today the rhetoric of the politicians of the day about that conflict. I feel as bitter now as I did then and as close to the feelings of serving soldiers, then and now, in the contempt that they generally feel for politicians, who generally, with some exceptions, stay safely at home during a war whilst making decisions in Parliament to send people half their age and, in many cases, a third of their age off to be killed. Philosophers over the years have sought the answer to the eternal question of the meaning of life. One of the great unanswered questions always must remain, without waxing too philosophical this afternoon, how a species of creation, if you like, on God's earth as capable of creating the brilliant things that humankind can create can still, in 1989-and, I regret to say, probably for the next 50 years-sees no other way of resolving difficulties and conflicts than by slaughtering each other in the most appalling ways possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The Vietnam war was no different, no worse in that sense, than any other war that has ever been fought in recent history. The horror of napalm being used against civilians and the enduring memories we have of small children in particular fleeing in terror with their skin hanging off them in shreds after napalm attacks from American fighter aircraft in Vietnam is in a sense no worse than the appalling way in which, for example, chemical warfare was used in the First World War. </PARA>
<PARA> One of my memories-young as I am-from my youth was working at weekends for a number of ex-servicemen by doing their gardens, mowing grass and so on. They were disabled by gas attacks in the First World War and had spent 30 years basically in the most appalling pain and misery dying of those attacks. The big difference, of course, between all of those conflicts, and the horror of them, and Vietnam was that for the first time we had scenes from that horrible conflict in Vietnam projected directly into our living rooms on a daily basis on television. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was remark- able. The fact that I was not alive during those earlier wars does not render me unable to recognise the fact that there were no colour television sets in people's living rooms at the time of the First World War and, in Australia, certainly not at the time of the Second World War. Nor was the ability of camera crews to accompany patrols into battle and to take, while they were in action, graphic pictures that were literally beamed by satellite from the front into homes on the same night that the conflicts occurred a technical possibility. One does not have to have been alive at the time to be able to draw that distinction. In those days, news from the front was read in the London Times and various other print media, sometimes months after the conflict. The news was penned by, amongst others, such eminent people as Sir Winston Churchill, who was at the time a war correspondent. Indeed, along with many others, he gained a great reputation over the years for the reporting of conflicts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But Vietnam was unique. How many wars were there before Vietnam in which the civilian population at home were treated to the sight of daily body counts being recorded almost like a telethon on television, accompanied by graphic television pictures of helicopters lifting cargo nets full of bodies away from the front? If one has not experienced that sight on a daily basis from Vietnam, one must have led a very sheltered life indeed. I am far and away from being the first person that has ever made that distinction between the Vietnam conflict and all other conflicts. This caused a considerable difference in the way in which it was able to weld public opinion. Indeed, it has been graphically illustrated since the Vietnam War, and is in writing in many places, that many television crews were personally distraught and broken by having to record those appalling sights of little children who had been burnt to pieces by napalm when fleeing down roads, but they did record them, in their own sense of bravery and out of commitment to the serving soldiers in the field, because they honestly thought that getting those pictures and images back home would increase the political pressure to stop that useless war. The sad reality is that it was a useless and dreadful war. </PARA>
<PARA> I was lucky-and I have thanked God ever since-that my birthday was not pulled out of the barrel. Had it been pulled out of the barrel-and I remember my feelings now as strongly as I did then-I would have gone off to Vietnam filled with a desire to serve in that conflict and rid Vietnam of the communist menace, because I was silly enough to believe then, as a country boy in northern New South Wales, the nonsense that was peddled by the Government of the day that we had to kill the communists in Vietnam before they came to Australia. That was the enduring and consistent message that was delivered to us as 20-year-olds by the then political leaders of this country. Of course, it was a terrible and dreadful nonsense then as it still is. But I believed it. I was convinced that the next move after Saigon was going to be on Australia. That was the rhetoric that was peddled; and tragic it is. </PARA>
<PARA> What I objected to at the time was not that we should not be fighting in Vietnam, but that the choice of who went off to be slaughtered should not have been made by a lottery and that, if 20-year-olds had to go and die in Vietnam, then all of us should have gone and died-or at least exposed ourselves to the risk of dying-in Vietnam. That is what I objected to. Twenty years on, having read and seen a lot and having read quite extensively of the thousand-year history of conflict in Vietnam and the peculiar local, cultural and racial reasons for that conflict, I recognise that it was a nonsensical and stupid proposition to be fed to 20-year-olds in Australia that the next stop after Saigon was going to be this country and that we were under threat from a so-called communist menace. Nevertheless, that does not detract from the fact that those poor Australians who were sent to Vietnam, along with the thousands of poor Americans that were sent into that area of the world far removed from their own regions to suffer and die in that conflict, should not be given all the recognition that they deserve. </PARA>
<PARA> I put to Senator McGauran a number of points to which he could respond during this debate. In his second reading speech Senator McGauran said:</PARA>
<PARA> Nobody should doubt that because of the decision not to establish an End of War List, that there are now many unsung heroes of the Vietnam war. Two cases of young Australians who died in heroic service have been brought to my attention. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not disagree with that, but the difficulty and tragedy-and I am sure Senator McGauran knows it-is that the establishment of an end of war list is not going to resolve, and never has resolved, that particular problem. Literally thousands of deeds of extraordinary heroism, self-sacrifice and bravery in all conflicts in recent history-the Second World War, the First World War and the Korean conflict-have never been recognised and never will be recognised. All the end of war lists in the world are not going to repair that situation, particularly an end of war list that has got a quota of 30 fixed upon it, as this Bill determines. It can be varied by the Minister for Defence, but the quota is there. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know in this chamber-and, indeed, Senator McGauran knows it because it is in his second reading speech-that in awarding medals for bravery quotas are set by the military in order, to use the expression, not to degrade the currency. The difficulty, as Senator Aulich pointed out quite succinctly, is this: if one is in a terrible conflict and a terrible theatre of war where one is experiencing the most extraordinary events and the most extraordinary displays of valour and self-sacrifice are occurring every day, how can a monthly quota set by the military of how many medals are to be issued that month-and that is indeed how it is done-properly recognise the bravery and the self-sacrifice of the soldiers being slaughtered? It cannot; and neither can the establishment of an end of war list with a quota of 30 set on it ever recognise the self-sacrifice and valour of all the servicemen who served in Vietnam. It is silly of Senator McGauran to even assert in his speech that it can. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Frankly, I do not know what the validity of that comparison is. I note that Senator McGauran made it in his second reading speech, but it is lost on me. Senator McGauran said in his second reading speech:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It should be noted that the future establishment of such a list was not ruled out by Mr Fairbairn. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, I do not know why Senator McGauran made that point, because how could such a list be ruled out by Mr Fairbairn, Mr Barnard or anyone else? It is a fact of Australian political life that Ministers have an average life in a ministry of only about 12 months. They do not have a permanent hold on a portfolio once they relinquish it. So Mr Fairbairn was not capable of declaring in 1972 that there would never be an end of war list, and nor was Mr Barnard. So I am not sure of the relevance of that particular statement. It would have been nonsensical had Mr Fairbairn even presumed to have declared that there never would be an end of war list. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other matters raised in Senator McGauran's second reading speech are reflected in the Bill, so I will wait until the appropriate time during the committee stage to ask a relatively small number of questions of Senator McGauran about the detail of the Bill. Senator McGauran and other senators were perfectly correct when they said that the Vietnam war was a tragedy which has scarred this country, as it has the United States. One does not need to see movies, either good or bad, such as Gardens of Stone or other such movies to be reminded of the horror of the Vietnam war-horror in the true sense, because of the realisation of most of the troops who fought in Vietnam, very shortly after they arrived there as scared 20-year-olds, that it was a conflict that they should not have been part of and which they could never win, in the traditional concept of winning a war. Their political masters had sent them to Vietnam to be terrorised, injured or killed without declaring it as a war, so they were fighting a war that was not a war. </PARA>
<PARA> One of my memories of the conflict as a 20-year-old is of a political cartoon which highlighted the last days of that war when conferences were being held in Paris between the two sides involved in the war. One can imagine the desperate hope that must have been held by the soldiers that were engaged in that horrible conflict, in listening to the news on a daily basis, as to the success or otherwise of the peace talks so that the war could end and they could go home. I remember that one of the major conferences designed to end the conflict was held up for weeks while the politicians argued about the shape of the table around which they would sit. The table that was provided for them, when they arrived at the conference centre, was a standard rectangular table. Many of the delegates did not want to sit in direct proximity to people with whom they did not want to talk. </PARA>
<PARA> After weeks of delay in starting the conference, it was determined that a round table would have to be provided so that the delegates could be seated at the conference. An Australian cartoonist penned a cartoon showing a small group of soldiers sitting on top of a hill, being shot to pieces by the enemy, listening to the news on their radios of the arguments about the shape of the table, and discussing at the same time the remarkably consistent shape of the bullets that were killing their comrades who were falling around them. </PARA>
<PARA> For all sorts of reasons the Vietnam war was a terrible war, particularly, as I said before, from the point of view of the overwhelming knowledge of the people who were most directly connected with it of the absolute hopelessness and pointlessness of what they had been sent to do. I close by saying that the specific questions that Senator Aulich and I have about some of the content of the Bill will be reserved for the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be relatively brief in my comments today. It is interesting, and perhaps appropriate, that the End of War List Bill 1989 should be debated one day after the seventy-fifth anniversary of the departure of the last of the troops of the first Australian Imperial Force during World War I and on the last sitting day before Armistice Day. The Australian Democrats support this Bill. We congratulate Senator McGauran on introducing it. Australia has been involved in seven overseas conflicts, at the end of each of which, with one exception, an end of war list has been drawn up. The Vietnam war is the glaring omission from this list.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What are the reasons for establishing an end of war list? An end of war list is part of the healing process after a war. It is a sign that a war, which devastates all nations, is finally over. The list contains acknowledgments of the many instances of courage, inventiveness and self-sacrifice of which Australians are capable, both in and outside war. It is the view of the Australian Democrats that such a list has in the past played a very important part in the healing of the dreadful emotional wounds that are inflicted by war, on both veterans and civilians of our nation. The contents of the end of war list, and its very existence, demonstrate to us that a war is finally over. Even under the appalling circumstances of war, and sometimes because of those appalling circumstances, collectively and individually we are capable of outstanding acts. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems reasonable to ask why the Vietnam war was the exception. Why was there no end of war list at the end of the Vietnam conflict? I think that the answer probably lies in the special psyche of that time and of that particular conflict, and the reaction of the nation to it. I do not think we should be bound by the psyche of that period. I think we have an obligation to focus on the reactions of Australia now. Time brings objectivity and it brings seasoned judgment. We regard it as appropriate that that objective, seasoned judgment should now be what prevails. The justifications for the psyche and the judgments of those of the day should not prevail in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> We all remember the atmosphere surrounding the Vietnam War. In our view, we were dragged into it under very dubious circumstances. We stayed in it in the face of massive and ever mounting opposition from ordinary Australians. We pulled out of the conflict in a rather haphazard, rushed fashion, which probably was an expression of the confused and ghastly nature of that conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> Successive governments wanted nothing more than to forget that the Vietnam War had ever happened, or that Australia had ever been involved in it. Under these circumstances, it is probably not surprising that Ministers, public servants, chiefs of staff, those in the Department of Defence and, indeed, many other Australians would have been caught up in the psyche of that era. It is not surprising that those who had to take those decisions and who were approached soon after we pulled out of Vietnam declined to agree to the setting up an end of war list for that conflict. Essentially, they just wanted it behind them. I think that it is only now, in hindsight, that we can take, are taking and have taken recently some of the more important objective judgments. </PARA>
<PARA> This private member's Bill brought to us by Senator McGauran sets up a tribunal consisting of one member of each of the three Services to consider all applications for inclusion on an end of war list for the Vietnam War and later conflicts. This seems to us to be an eminently reasonable and overdue action. As Senator McGauran has said, the welcome home march for Vietnam veterans in 1987, to which Senator Boswell referred, received the unanimous support of both Houses of this Parliament. It has been said that this was the first step towards the healing of the emotional wounds inflicted upon so many Australians and, indeed, upon the nation at large, by the Vietnam War. </PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of an end of war list is a fitting conclusion to the Vietnam war. It is long overdue, and it is small acknowledgment of the massive contribution of many Australians to an unpopular and hideous conflict. The Australian Democrats have no hesitation in supporting this Bill and wishing it a speedy and successful passage through both Houses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-In closing the debate, I want to extend my appreciation to my colleague Senator Boswell for addressing this issue. His was a fine contribution; he spoke from the heart. I also extend my appreciation to Senator McLean of the Australian Democrats, who also showed great wisdom. He indicated his support for the End of War List Bill, his understanding of its thrust and what it all means. At a time when we are commemorating the Second World War 50 years on and are preparing to commemorate Gallipoli 75 years hence, I believe it is time to remember that Australia is nearing the twenty-fifth anniversary of its involvement in the Vietnam war.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not asking the Senate to debate the arguments for or against the war, but rather to put aside that argument and to pay a tribute to those Australians who served their country in that war. I am mindful of the fact that many senators were deeply involved in the great Vietnam war debate. It was a time of demonstrations and bitter divisions. Indeed, after hearing some of the debate today, it is evident that many of those emotions remain. I ask Government senators not to take a view that this is a political issue. This private member's Bill comes in another era, the 1980s, and they should not lock themselves into a 1960s mentality. Whatever feelings one might have about that time they should not affect one's outlook on this Bill. The Bill does no more than recognise those service men and women who served in Vietnam. That aim should be supported by and encompass the views of all senators in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said and it is significant to note that my generation has never been called to war, that we have never been asked to defend our beliefs to the point of taking up arms. Nevertheless, I vividly recall those times, probably because the war was covered on the news service every night and also because I had older brothers and sisters. I recall as far back as the visit of President Johnson, the Tet offensive, the Kent University shootings and the moratorium marches up Bourke Street led by Dr Jim Cairns-and so much more, up until the desperate fall of Saigon in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> They were difficult times and they left a sad legacy and exposed many truths. But the real hangover and shame of this lost war comes from the fact that society and Parliament have for so long failed to recognise and pay proper tribute to those who fought and died in Vietnam in the same way as we have paid tribute to those who fought and died in past campaigns. Regardless of the horror and evil of war, it is important that a certain spirit of Australia is maintained, that we never forget those who served and died on the battlefields. That is what every shrine of remembrance asks of us-`lest we forget'. </PARA>
<PARA> An end of war list has been established following every other war that Australians have served in. The Vietnam war is the exception. To not establish an end of war list would surely make the Vietnam veterans lesser veterans than any of those who served in other campaigns. They would never be on a par with the veterans of past campaigns. I seek the support of the Senate in not leaving the Vietnam war an unfinished chapter in Australia's history. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not until 1987, some 16 years after the Vietnam war, that, with a coming home parade organised by the soldiers themselves, the first step was taken towards bridging the gap between the veterans and Australian society. Until that day the marchers had had no victory parade, no glory and no pride in having done their duty. One could not help but believe on the day of the coming home parade that all the bitter divisions had been healed. Certainly, from my travels around Australia it is evident that the coming home parade has had a lasting effect. Veterans now wish to talk openly about their experiences of war and their feelings about that war, and Australian citizens are now warmly listening. Sadly, that was once not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> While this change has occurred in society, Parliament has lagged behind. This Bill is a step towards bringing Parliament into line with the mood of society. The passage of this Bill will send out the strongest message yet that we are finally bringing our troops home. Nobody should doubt that that is what the Australian people are asking of us. The Bill has the support of the Returned Services League and the Vietnam Veterans Association. More important than that, it has the support of the Australian people, as indicated by the thousands of petitions that have been presented to this Parliament on a daily basis over the past several months. Those petitions have come from every corner of Australia, from Mount Tom Price in Western Australia to Nagambie in Victoria. No-one should doubt that the Bill has grassroots support. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to clarify a point in relation to my interjection on Senator Collins when I mentioned the War Crimes Amendment Bill. The principle I seek to reinstate is the same principle given by the Government when it introduced the War Crimes Amendment Bill. That Bill was introduced some 50 years after the Second World War. It sought justice in seeking out war criminals and bringing them to trial. I am now seeking out, some 16 years after the Vietnam war, justice in relation to war heroes. Even though it may seem that no war crime trials will go ahead, to many people the principle of that Bill was stronger than the practice. Equally, that must be the case with the End of War List Bill, in establishing an end of war list for the Vietnam war. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also worth noting that the armed forces held the same belief, that there were unsung heroes of this war. They believe that there could have been as many as 30. Documents released under the freedom of information requests showed that the defence forces-the Army, the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force-made two requests for the establishment of an end of war list. I will go into more detail if required in the committee stage. In conclusion, I point out that the Bill has much to do with a certain spirit of Australia, a spirit borne out of the Gallipoli campaign, a spirit of pride for and appreciation of Australians who have served in a time of war. As with the Gallipoli campaign, which was a political and military disaster, even in defeat we must recognise and indeed uplift those people who served this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a number of questions for Senator McGauran, although he answered one of them in his second reading response. Although it is slightly out of order, I would like to make an observation, in passing, that that was a very fine speech from the honourable senator. I am a bit disappointed that he has not given us the benefit of his ability in that direction on previous occasions and that he saved it until literally the dying moments of his career in the Senate. It was a very good contribution. Clause 4 of the End of War List Bill 1989 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The object of the Act is to re-establish an End of War List. </PARA>
<PARA>Considering the fact that there has not been one established-and that is the point of this debate-should the word `re-establish' be `establish'? My second question, which appears to have been answered by Senator McGauran, relates to clause 7, which states that the Tribunal is to recommend not more than 30 persons. How was that figure arrived at? Why 30 and not more than 30? My third question relates to clause 7 (4), which states:</PARA>
<PARA> In making its recommendations in relation to a military conflict, the Tribunal is not to have regard to whether or not the standard quota of awards for acts of valour in that conflict has been filled. </PARA>
<PARA>Having read Senator McGauran's second reading speech, I now understand what clause he refers to. He referred to the practice of the military to establish a monthly quota. However, I think it is confusing. When I first read the Bill, I automatically associated that subclause with a previous subclause which referred to a quota of 30. I cannot find any reference to a `standard quota of awards' in the definitions section of the Bill. I am concerned that it is not defined. Is there, somewhere, a general legislative recognition of that expression? If there is not there will be no real way for a court, or anyone reading the legislation, to determine just what the definition is. Would Senator McGauran advise the Senate whether the drafting of this Bill was based on previously established end of war lists? As Senator McGauran said in his second reading speech, end of war lists were established after every conflict except the Vietnam war. In a general sense, has this Bill been drafted on those precedents?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will try to answer all those questions. The Committee must understand that handling a Bill at the committee stage is a new experience for me-I am doing it from the back bench. I suppose I base the word `re-establish' in clause 4 on the fact that prior to the Vietnam war we had end of war lists after the Korean war and the Second World War. I guess I was re-establishing the principle. I am happy to move an amendment to change the word to `establish'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Aulich asked whether I had drawn up the legislation based on past military conflicts. I have to say no because there has been no past legislation. It has always been done by ministerial pen. It is a ministerial judgment more than anything else. Herein lies the new principle of making legislation so that a list can be established not only for the end of the Vietnam war but also for the end of future conflicts. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> Page 2, clause 4, line 16, leave out ``re-establish'', insert ``establish''. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, I chose a quota of 30 because-and Senator Collins has answered it himself-the Army requested through the Department of Defence that a quota of 30 be chosen. I believe that that number has been taken from past end of war lists. That arbitrary figure has probably been taken from the Korean war list.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is one substantive point that worries me. I asked Senator McGauran whether he based this legislation on previous legislation that established war lists. I asked that question in ignorance because of my concern about clause 7 (4) which is heightened now. I suspected that the answer would be no because the lists were established by Ministers. This new legislation creates a whole new concept. I feel much more strongly now that clause 7 (4) is not properly drafted. I am not an expert in this area. I would be amazed if a standard quota of awards is a well-established and formally recognised quota which was applied at the end of the First World War, at the end of the Second World War and at the end of the Korean war. Is there any formal document which would be recognised by this Parliament and the courts in respect of the Vietnam war? I suspect that there is not.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on a point raised by Senator Collins and Senator Aulich which relates to clause 7 (4). In looking at that clause, in some sense for the first time, perhaps like others here, and I see Senator Collins nodding, I am not sure-it is a matter for Senator McGauran to decide-whether that clause serves an essential purpose in the Bill. All it seems to me to do is to say that the Tribunal is not to have regard to whether or not the standard quota of awards or acts of valour in a particular conflict has been filled. I suspect that that clause-and Senator McGauran may confirm this view-finds its origin in the fact that there is material in the freedom of information documents which says that a standard quota of awards was awarded in the course of the Vietnam conflict. In fact that was one of the arguments which at one point in the discussion led to the view that there should not, therefore, be an end of war list. I suspect that this clause finds its origin in that old debate. Thinking speculatively, I think that today we are trying to forget about that old debate. It is Senator McGauran's Bill and he may want to insist upon the clause; if he does, I would not differ with him. However, the Bill principally sets up a tribunal with the purpose of performing a particular job. The Bill provides particularly for it to have the power to recommend up to 30 awards and more if the Minister so decided and that is probably all it needs. Therefore, I do not think that the clause is necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am not sure whether Senator Stone has read Senator McGauran's second reading speech-I have to confess that I am speaking off the top of my head-but, having had the benefit of reading the second reading speech, I can confirm Senator Stone's understanding with respect to the standard quota, which I am sure would not be recognised by the Parliament in any legislation. I would be happy to be corrected by a legal expert, if Senator McGauran has access to one, but I understand that the absence of this clause would take nothing away from the Bill. Without this clause, the Tribunal would simply have an unfettered discretion to do whatever it liked. The Bill remains intact if the entire clause is deleted.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I concur with the conclusion that has just been arrived at by both Senator Collins and Senator Stone. Whether the clause remains or is removed changes nothing. The sense of it is simply to remove constraint from the Tribunal, which may have felt obliged, because of some arbitrary limitation on the number of awards fulfilled or felt to be fulfilled 20 years ago, to limit them. The clause simply removes that constraint and its presence in the Bill or otherwise seems to be fairly irrelevant.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I last spoke on the Privacy Amendment Bill, I made the point that the Bill was badly drafted and badly handled. The fact that it comes to this place with 41 Government amendments brings shame to the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) and the Government. Some Bills have required in excess of 100 amendments. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill was a conglomeration of amendments, many of which were Government amendments. The explanatory memorandum to the Bill deals with the amendments and covers some 18 foolscap pages, quite a number. I made the point that it was rather peculiar that the amendments were not available in the chamber or from the Table Office until this morning and I complained about that. I also said that this was a sign of the Hawke Labor Government being in complete disarray and disintegration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Hill made the point that we would be moving some amendments. The Bill has a great many defects. We have not yet been able to consider the amendments closely. Nevertheless, the Bill should be rejected in its present form, and with its amendments, and be drafted again. Senator Hill made these points very clearly. It is a commercially impractical Bill. It imposes unacceptable restrictions on the proper use of credit reference reporting, which now is a universal and essential part of modern commercial practice. A better approach than that taken by the Government would have been to state clearly the principles on which any such legislation should be based and then to fashion a Bill based on those principles. </PARA>
<PARA> The two basic principles are easily stated because they are common sense. Senator Hill made this point in his speech. First, commercial organisations should generally have access to financial information that enables them to make sensible commercial decisions. The second point is that there should be a mechanism by which consumers are advised that commercial organisations have had access to this information about them and an opportunity for them to obtain redress for improper use of that information. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill does not measure up to either of those principles. Therefore, it should be rejected and presented again when it has been completely redrafted consistent with those principles. When that is done, the Bill should no longer contain the embargoes and restrictions on the proper use of credit reference reporting that it presently contains. It should provide that the consumer should be informed that access has been made to his file. As I have already mentioned, Senator Hill proposed some of those principles in his amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Opposition's proposed amendment is defeated and the Bill passes the second reading, the Opposition will be moving a series of amendments in committee. One of the foreshadowed amendments is to change the definition of `credit' from `loan' to `credit' as it is normally understood. Some changes have been made in the amendments to do that. Other foreshadowed amendments allow credit reference reports to be supplied to: real estate agents and property owners to assist them in deciding whether or not to accept a tenant or to make other decisions about tenancies; debt collectors or creditors who are actually engaged in collecting a debt, but not private investigators; firms selling goods or services on hire purchase, credit or terms; underwriters of mortgages; firms engaged in leasing, renting, hire purchase or similar activities; firms needing to review an account; creditors, advising them of the new address of a debtor; and insurance companies-which have already been canvassed. As well, the foreshadowed amendments will allow cross-referencing between personal and business credit. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition foreshadows other amendments. However, our basic point is that this Bill should be withdrawn so that the Government can once again consult with the industry. The Minister said earlier that there had been consultation, but I say it is too little, too late. The Government should formulate a sensible Bill that recognises the important role played by credit reference reporting, which the present Bill does not do. The Real Estate Institute has made some points about this particular Bill:</PARA>
<PARA> While privacy is a fundamental right in our society, the Privacy Amendment Bill fails to strike a balance between the need for privacy on the one hand and the legitimate need for property owners to establish the credit worthiness of people who will occupy their property on the other. The right to privacy must also be balanced against the need for business and society to guard against fraud and reckless indifference to others' property. </PARA>
<PARA>I have already stated many of the points in this Bill about which I am concerned. I am aware that two speakers, namely, Senator Calvert and Senator Panizza, want to speak in this debate. Therefore, I close my remarks by saying that this is a sloppily drafted Bill, not so much by the drafters as by the Government of this country, which is on the way out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to add my congratulations to Senator McGauran on the passage of his private member's Bill and on the way in which he brought it forward. As has been said by previous speakers, this Privacy Amendment Bill, which has been rushed into the Senate today at short notice-it is an on-again, off-again Bill with many amendments-is just another attack on small business in this country. It is another problem that will face those small businesses which, for some time, have been on the receiving end of a non-caring Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, you would remember that, in recent debates about small business, it has been said that small businesses-of which there are approximately 750,000 in this country-employ 65 per cent of all Australians in the private sector. Today, it is interesting to reflect on the effect of recent Government decisions on small businesses. For instance, the airline pilots dispute is sending small businesses to the wall. Today I received some letters from tourist operators in Tasmania who are absolutely at the end of their tether. Some of those who are in that position because of the airlines dispute are going to be affected by this privacy Bill, which will be another nail in their coffin. I refer to small businesses such as the real estate industry, to which Senator Brownhill referred; the used car and hire industries, particularly the hire car industry, which have been affected by the airlines dispute; and sellers of goods and services-just to name a few. </PARA>
<PARA> The attack on those sections of small business follows the Government's confrontationist attitude to the pharmacists, another small business in our community. The Senate does not need reminding of the results that this attack on pharmacists will have and is having on the ordinary Australian. Up to 30 per cent of those important small businesses will be forced to close. As a result, the sick and the needy in our community will pay the penalty because of the belligerent attitude of this so-called caring Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate-if it needs reminding-of the crippling results that unprecedented high interest rates are having on small business, particularly the real estate industry and the housing and rental markets, which will be affected by this Privacy Amendment Bill. If this Bill is passed-and I hope that it is not-it will only heighten the catastrophic effect that high interest rates are having on small businesses and families in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> From time to time in this place we hear hollow statements from the Government benches about this Government's support for and the importance of small business. Therefore, it is of great concern to me that this Bill seeks to threaten the viability of so many small businesses that this Government purports to support. It is a charade. All one has to do is look at the Government's record. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned previously some of the businesses that have already been affected by the decisions that this Government has made and has put in place. I should like to comment also on the modus operandi that has been used in the presentation of this legislation. It is the same old system that we have come to expect from this uncaring Government-legislation by press release. The first that small business heard about this ill- researched Bill was when a press release was issued on 31 May 1989. The Bill was then introduced to the Senate on 16 June by a motion that was moved by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, on behalf of the Minister for Consumer Affairs, Senator Bolkus. In the opening two paragraphs of his second reading speech, the Minister proudly espoused the previously introduced Privacy Act. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Late last year, this Parliament passed the Privacy Act 1988. That Act provided for the establishment of the office of the Federal Privacy Commissioner and for privacy protection for individuals, both in relation to information about them held by Commonwealth agencies and in relation to their tax file numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Privacy Amendment Bill 1989 is the next step in the Government's program to introduce comprehensive privacy protection for the Australian community. The principal purpose of this Bill is to provide privacy protection for individuals in relation to their consumer credit records. </PARA>
<PARA>That sounds all very well. However, if honourable senators cast their minds back to the Privacy Act of 1988, they will remember that the same problem was experienced with that. This Senate had to make many amendments to make it a rational Bill that had some effect. It was the same old story, as I said earlier. It was the same modus operandi, legislated by press release. It was up to the coalition to set it straight so that it had some effect. We have the same situation with this particular piece of legislation. It purports to protect the rights of individuals when all it will do, in the form in which it has been presented, is make things worse for small business in this country. People talk about protecting the rights of individuals, but there will be very few individuals left who will have any money to be protected if we press forward with this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Brownhill said a while ago, the Opposition is again in the position where it has to move significant amendments to try to improve a faulty Bill. This is being done in an attempt to save the jobs of Australians in the many small businesses in which so many Australians are involved. There is no doubt in my mind that the main purpose of this Bill and the reason it is being rushed through is that the Government once again is over-reacting, while it is in election mode, to the minority interest groups in our community that Mr Kerin has been referring to in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> We really have to ask ourselves: What is the need to impose more red tape and regulations when we have one body in Australia, namely, the Credit Reference Association of Australia (CRAA), which is responsible for about 98 per cent of credit reference reporting in Australia? The CRAA is owned by its 4,800 members-the major public utilities, banks, finance companies, department stores, credit unions, building societies, insurance companies, credit card companies and many manufacturing and trading companies which are very reputable organisations. As Senator Hill said this morning, the CRAA has a database that now holds records on over 10 million individuals and businesses. Its members make about seven million inquiries a year about people or businesses to whom they are thinking of extending credit or lending money. For example, in October 1988 alone 534,000 inquiries were made, an increase of 80 per cent since October 1984. It is quite obvious that this reputable credit reporting association is not only successful but is being used to a great extent. </PARA>
<PARA> What is all this concern about privacy and the collection of data? Would it not be more prudent for the Government, without inflicting all this red tape and necessitating amendments, et cetera, to set up an inquiry, have discussions with this particular organisation that runs 98 per cent of the credit reference reporting around Australia, and have a look at its perceived shortcomings, if they exist? It seems easy to me, rather than inflicting this cumbersome legislation on small business. </PARA>
<PARA> This whole matter is of very serious concern to all small business. I, like many others on this side of the Parliament and probably on the other side too, have received dozens of letters in my electorate office from concerned businesses. I will briefly mention some of these because I think they sum up the major concerns these people have. The first is a letter from the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce. Naturally, being a Tasmanian, I want to be rather parochial about this. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Council and members of the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce, I am writing to urge your rejection of the Privacy Amendment Bill 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed legislation threatens the viability of thousands of credit providing businesses by severely restricting access to credit information. As a result, the practical measures which have been developed to control the cost of fraud, dishonesty and consumer over-commitment will be curtailed or outlawed . . . In our State the overwhelming majority of businesses are small.</PARA>
<PARA>I would go along with that. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>If their costs are allowed to increase in this manner, there can be no doubt that some will fail. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, some are already failing because of the pilots business. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>In addition, under this legislation, defaulting debtors cannot be reported until the account is at least 90 days overdue. This gives the debtor at least 120 days to ensure he cannot be traced-a particular problem in Tasmania where each year, a number of visitors equal to the resident population enters and leaves the State. </PARA>
<PARA>That was before the airline dispute, of course. It goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> In a carefully regulated system as presently exists, the means to check a customer's credit worthiness is not an invasion of individual privacy. It is a legitimate protection for business from fraud and dishonesty. </PARA>
<PARA>I know of many cases where visitors from this big island have visited Tasmania and incurred debts. No doubt those visitors were not checked out and skipped the country very quickly. What the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce is saying is very valid. To change the tone somewhat, I quote from a letter from the Association of Tasmanian Credit Unions Ltd, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Credit Unions believe in the privacy of the individual but we are quite sure that credit providers in the future will seek to offset the reduced credit file integrity of files held by the credit reporting bureaux by seeking increased personal details of credit applicants thus increasing intrusion into the individual's financial privacy. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Association is saying that this legislation will force credit unions into asking more questions and being more inquisitive about people's privacy. It went on as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Also it is certain that both business and consumers will face increased costs in the form of higher interest rates, insurance premiums prices, public utility charges and rents. It is equally certain that the Commonwealth too will face a double cost, first through reduced tax revenues, as a result of increased bad debt write offs and second, through higher Social Security outlays to relieve increased indebtedness. Similarly, State Government public utilities will be denied information vital to the collection of bad debts and may, therefore, expect their losses to increase. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a little different from the concerns which have been raised in this debate so far, so I thought I would mention it. </PARA>
<PARA> Typical of letters from small businesses was one I received from Frosto Distributors. Frosto Distributors was incorporated in Tasmania and distributes frozen food. The Manager wrote as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>As Manager of this Company we require this information-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, credit information-</PARA>
<PARA>from recognised credit services because in the Food Service Industry we have a high rate of business failure. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt about that, particularly at the moment. I am aware that the Leader of the Opposition in Tasmania, Mr Gray, was in Canberra this week seeking relief for Tasmania because of the airlines debacle. Honourable senators will notice I am not using the word `dispute'. There is no dispute! Two members of that delegation from private industry were engaged in the food service industry. I know from talking to them that they are very concerned about this privacy legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, perhaps the most interesting submission that I wish to speak about is that from the Real Estate Institute of Australia Ltd, which will probably suffer the most under this proposal. Without going into a lot of detail it is interesting to note that its President, Bill Woolcock, is also a Tasmanian, from Launceston. So I am being very parochial but at least it covers a cross-section of opinion from Tasmania's point of view. His covering letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA>REIA's primary concern is that the Bill does not strike the necessary balance between the need for protection of individuals' privacy and the requirements of business for information to allow it to function in an efficient and equitable manner. The legislation also has unintended consequences for both the owners of rental property and tenants. REIA believes that industry input would help quantify the significant economic and social costs of the legislation in its present form. </PARA>
<PARA>To this end we urge that it be referred to a parliamentary standing committee or a Senate select committee for review. If all else fails, that is what should happen. In fact, that is what should have happened in the first place. It is quite obvious from these hastily prepared amendments that I did not receive until late this morning-and I certainly did not receive them in my electorate office as Senator Bolkus suggested I should have-just how rushed this whole business has been. </PARA>
<PARA> As was mentioned by previous speakers, there is no doubt that there has been a terrible lack of consultation in this whole exercise. In the accompanying submission from the Real Estate Institute, from which I just read a covering letter, some of the major concerns in this whole mess are highlighted. They are matters which will affect the large majority of Australians. One of the most important concerns is the effects of the legislation on tenants in Australia. In these days, there is an ever-increasing number of tenants because, under the policies of this Government with its high interest rates, very, very few people can afford to buy their own home. I will quote some of the consequences for tenants that Bill Woolcock describes as resulting from the effect of the legislation. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>As real estate agents do not conform to the narrow definition of providers of credit, they are excluded under the legislation from access to credit reporting files. Hence there can be no credit checks performed on prospective tenants. </PARA>
<PARA> One such consequence will be an inevitable discrimination against underprivileged categories of tenants. Such categories, which include single parents and low income households, have been successful in the past in seeking accommodation in the private rental market when they have been able to demonstrate a history of meeting credit commitments. If such information were no longer available, it is inevitable that discrimination would intensify and more would find difficulty in finding rental accommodation. In times of tight vacancy rates, accommodation in the private rental market would become increasingly the preserve of the more obviously affluent and conforming members of society. </PARA>
<PARA> A further consequence of the legislation is that it would lead to delays in applications for tenancy. In the absence of a report from a reliable credit report agency, further time would be expended checking other information relating to a tenant's suitability. This would disadvantage tenants who clearly need to know as quickly as possible whether or not their application has been successful. </PARA>
<PARA>Once again, whilst trying to protect the privacy and the rights of individuals, all this legislation is doing is making it more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that if you were a prospective landlord and you were confronted by two individuals, one who looked as though he had just walked off a job somewhere and another dressed in a nice blue suit with a good tie and a clean shirt, without any benefit of credit reference I suspect that you could be talked into accepting that the gentleman who was better presented would be the one who would get the property. In actual fact, you would probably find, if you checked their credit, that the guy wearing the working cloths had a very good credit record and probably had a good background of paying his debts, whereas the guy in the suit with a tie and who looked like a politician was probably a crook. </PARA>
<PARA> Another significant problem that I do not believe has been looked at and that will be forced on real estate agents relates to their responsibilities to owners of rental properties. I will quote again from the submission of the Real Estate Institute of Australia. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The removal of access to credit reporting facilities would severely diminish the ability of real estate agents to fulfil their responsibilities to owners of rental properties. Credit reference checks are an important process in the letting of properties when little or not information on prospective tenants is available. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the most important part:</PARA>
<PARA>In the case of professional managers of commercial, retail and industrial property, access would be denied to personal credit reference data on company directors and business principals. Such information is of critical importance as there is a proven high correlation between failure of businesses to meet credit obligations and the failure of principals of such businesses to meet their own personal obligations. </PARA>
<PARA>I can say from my own experience in Tasmania that, over recent years, there have been quite a few shonky companies. Unless someone had the access to credit references from these particular companies, as I said earlier, they would be well and truly long gone by the time the proper checks were done under this new, jazzed-up version that the Government wants us to be involved in. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want to make brief reference to another small industry or business that exists in every part of Australia. I notice Senator Panizza sitting in the chamber. I know that he is pretty good at this sort of thing. I am referring to used-car salesmen. They rely very heavily on credit checks. As honourable senators would realise, the most important thing to a used-car salesman is for him to turn his cars over very quickly. Most of the vehicles he is selling are usually under hire purchase or on some sort of lease agreement. It would not be very effective for him to be in his yard when a prospective client came in, after having spent some time trying to talk him into buying a car, whether it be a Torana or whatever, to find that he had to go through some other organisation and make arrangements to do a credit check. In the meantime, I suggest, the prospective buyer may have found some defects in the car and probably may not accept the purchase. </PARA>
<PARA> If this continues and this legislation is carried, in car businesses particularly there will be all kinds of fraud. Owners of these car yards who are in the business of reselling cars and who have enough to worry about will have all the extra concern of not knowing the bona fides of their prospective clients. Of course, the end result will be fewer car sales, more bad debts and, in the end result, a more expensive mark-up on cars to offset the large amount of fraud and the bad debts that will probably be incurred. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as this Bill is concerned, the Government has already responded to industry pressure by making a number of changes. We have seen the result of these today in this huge number of amendments that we have not had a chance to look at yet. Those changes show that the Bill was not put together properly in the first place; it was created in an ad hoc fashion. As a result of that, these changes which have been introduced on the spur of the moment certainly do not reflect what could be considered to be sound thought and responsible planning but rather an attempt to put the Bill together in such a manner that it would get through the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, as I said earlier, I strongly urge the Senate to reject this Bill, as Senator Brownhill, the previous speaker, has said. If the Senate does not reject this Bill, it should at least adopt the Opposition amendments, and, failing that, at least adopt the suggestion that the Real Estate Institute has made and refer this matter to a Senate standing committee or a select committee for further review. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I stood in this chamber and spoke about the importance of the role of the Auditor-General's Office and of the Auditor-General himself. I did that in the context of commenting upon the Government's response to the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts entitled, The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It therefore accords me no pleasure tonight to rise to speak to a report of the Auditor-General which in a way fills me with great sadness. I refer specifically to a report by the Auditor-General concerning the investigation of an unofficial account operated by the Parliamentary Information Systems Office (PISO). This report was sought on 13 September when the Auditor-General, after a lapse of some time, was reluctantly asked by the Parliamentary Librarian, Mr MacLean, to investigate a secret account which was established by officers within PISO. The account operated secretly over a period of months and evidence has shown Mr MacLean was well aware of it. He was certainly aware of it by mid-July. The Auditor-General was not involved until 13 September. In the interim the Auditor-General's report was made available to the president of the Senate and passed on to Estimates Committee A and it is therefore a public document. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>On 6 September 1989 the Parliamentary Librarian signed a certificate on the Department's financial statements for the year ended 30 June 1989 in the capacity as Departmental Secretary and Principal Accounting Officer. That certificate stated, inter alia, that `the statements were in agreement with the department's accounts and records'. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to say in paragraph 8.3 on page 16:</PARA>
<PARA> The statements contained no record of the transactions of the `unofficial account' which could be construed to be an account of the Department of the Parliamentary Library, albeit a highly irregular account. Since the Parliamentary Librarian was aware of the account's existence at the time of signing the certificate, it is a matter of conjecture whether he should have required the transactions of the account to be reflected in the statements or worded the certificate to disclose the account's existence. Further, the AAO provided an unqualified report on the Department's financial statements dated 6 September 1989, not being aware of the account's existence until 13 September 1989. It is also a matter of conjecture whether an unqualified report could have been issued had the account been brought to the AAO's attention earlier. </PARA>
<PARA>The body of the report of the Auditor-General sets out many issues which raise further concerns. The reason I am speaking to this report tonight prior to the tabling of the report of Estimates Committee A is that I am concerned that the Auditor-General's summary and recommendations do not tally with his own report. In the summary of his findings he says:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . there is no evidence to suggest that the persons involved acted other than in good faith, nor is there any evidence of fraud. . . </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that that is about as valid as saying, `I didn't know murder was illegal'. In the hearings of the Estimates Committee on 3 October, one Mr Mullane gave evidence of a payment from this secret account of $1,629 for accommodation at the Sydney Hilton Hotel for three nights plus the provision of a dining room in which a workshop was allegedly conducted. Four officers from PISO who normally reside in Canberra found it necessary to travel to the Sydney Hilton Hotel for the purposes of this meeting. They were allegedly supposed to discuss matters relating to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). However, the Auditor-General finds in his report that they adjudged it was not necessary to talk to anybody from the ABC because they were apparently doing quite well themselves. The report says that it was an organisation review workshop which was `Sydney based primarily because of ABC input required on sound and vision portion'. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA>The ABC had installed the sound and vision systems in the new Parliament House. The then manager of PISO-</PARA>
<PARA>one Mr Goodall-</PARA>
<PARA>has informed the AAO that, as the Workshop progressed, it was found that there was no need to call upon the ABC for any input. </PARA>
<PARA>The people who attended that so-called workshop were the then manager of PISO, Mr Goodall; the Director, Planning and Administration (PISO); the Director, Special Projects (PISO); and the assistant project manager employed by Computer Power Pty Ltd, under prime contract between PISO and Computer Power for the work with PISO. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The Movement Requisition for the then Manager of PISO's travel was approved by the Parliamentary Librarian while the then manager of PISO approved the movement requisitions for the other two PISO officers. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said yesterday, the concern is that the Auditor-General is the essential link between public accountability-that is, the accountability for the expenditure of government's and taxpayers' funds-and the Parliament. If that link is broken down in any way, then true accountability is just not possible. It would have been appropriate had the jurisdiction been available, I believe, to have referred the Auditor-General in this instance to the Ombudsman, who, I said yesterday, has already himself written a report that he would like to be considered as part of the scrutiny process. Unfortunately, the Auditor-General is the head of one of those bodies which are precluded from investigation by the Ombudsman. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the report does not justify the summary and conclusions that the Auditor-General, under his own hand, has reported upon. There are many questions which are not answered. Who actually opened the account? Whose signature appeared on the account? Why did the PISO officers involved in establishing the illegal account claim that there was apparently a general belief among officers of the parliamentary departments that the provisions of the Commonwealth finance directions and purchasing manual, the Audit Act and the Constitution-all of which the Auditor-General found were breached-did not apply to the parliamentary departments? Can anyone explain to me how people could work in the parliamentary departments and somehow believe that they are not covered by the Constitution, the Audit Act or the finance regulations and how the Auditor-General, who is charged with the responsibility of ensuring the proper expenditure of public funds, could also somehow believe that they did it all in good faith? It is just not credible. </PARA>
<PARA> I heard early in the piece, by way of gossip, that this report was to be a whitewash. I was so concerned about that that I rang the Auditor-General and said, `I think the person I should tell that I have heard these rumours is indeed the Auditor-General himself'. I asked Mr Taylor what stage the report had reached. He said that he had not involved himself with this report early in the piece and was not aware of the situation. I suggested to him that he properly ought to involve himself forthwith and be involved in the preparation and furnishing of the report. The Auditor-General then assured me that he would do that. I can only believe that he was quite approving of the way in which this report has finally been presented. As I said, it gives me no joy at all to have to stand in this place and say that I find a report of the Auditor-General-whose office I have defended at great length, whose independence I have striven to maintain and, indeed, enhance-of such a poor standard. </PARA>
<PARA> At some stage in the future people will have the opportunity to debate the report of Estimates Committee A, which I am not able to do at this stage, nor will I. I think it is important that people avail themselves of this report. For instance, we read that moneys from this secret account were used to buy such things as a microwave oven, the framing of nine prints, two credenzas with side tables with refrigerators and other such items, quite in breach of all the regulations, and indeed, as I said, to pay those accounts for the so-called workshop conducted in the Sydney Hilton Hotel. I add that the Auditor-General recommends that reimbursement be made for those amounts of money which exceed normal travelling allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> If it is the case that other departments outside the parliamentary departments are to see that people who have clearly breached, according to the Auditor-General, the Constitution, the Audit Act, the finance regulations, at least six finance directives and the Commonwealth purchasing manual are to go uncriticised in a real sense and be told that it is all to be whitewashed because the Auditor-General says `that there is no evidence to suggest that the persons involved acted other than in good faith', then I think we have a grave concern for our accountability process, because there is abroad a feeling that somehow there is no area in the Federal public sector for misappropriation or improper behaviour. There is a feeling that that goes on only in State governments or local government. But anyone who has heard the recent evidence given before the Independent Commission on Corruption in New South Wales concerning one Mr Ross, an employee of the Department of Administrative Services, can only know that there is great opportunity for temptation in the Federal sector, where the amount of money spent on procurement is in the vicinity of $8 billion a year. </PARA>
<PARA> If this report is to be allowed simply to be a whitewash of what occurred in PISO, in the Department of the Parliamentary Library, then I think the signals that are sent out to the public sector generally are totally misleading. That standard of behaviour is clearly not acceptable either by the departmental head, the Parliamentary Librarian, or operatives within that Department. As I have said, that is why I stand in this place tonight and, with great sadness, feel it is necessary to say that a report of the Auditor-General, whose office I have steadfastly believed in and which I still believe is an integral part of the question of accountability, has simply let the side down. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I commend the report to others to read, as I commend the Hansard of the Estimates Committee hearing of 3 October and the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts entitled The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament. If the Auditor-General is to fulfil that function, then I am afraid that he has to lift his game. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the matters of public interest debate at lunchtime, Senator Alston raised issues dealing with the Thomas Borthwick and Sons (Australasia) Ltd meatworks at Portland. He took me to task-although gently perhaps-over a speech I made about two months ago on 5 September 1989. Senator Alston kindly told me that he was going to make this speech today, but unfortunately I did not hear it. I am relying on a summary of the speech obtained by Marcia O'Hara, a member of my staff, and perhaps one of the most outstanding staffers in this building. Senator Alston, for about five minutes, referred to a misstatement I had made about the employment of labour by Borthwick's at Portland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> According to the note I have, Senator Alston mentioned that ministerial directions under the health Act enable unemployed to claim medical examinations for employment applications and he generally defended Borthwicks. The note says that Senator Alston said that I had more or less sinned, which had me concerned. Today is All Souls Day, which makes one very apprehensive about one's future when it is put that I have said something wrong in a speech made two months ago which must now be corrected. </PARA>
<PARA> My speech of 5 September 1989 has roused some furore in south-west Victoria and comments have been made about me by a Mr Hughes from Queensland, who said that in the Federal Parliament I raised issues about prospective employees at the plant being forced to claim on their Medicare entitlements and that I was not really worthy of being a senator. As a result of this criticism, I thought I had better look at this speech that was so full of venom. As I had been chosen to be the person to be criticised, I thought that this speech might compare with-and I say this with great respect, Mr Acting Deputy President-one of your brilliant efforts. I thought: Is this speech of the standard of Senator Crichton-Browne's? Does it lash those it opposes so that they crawl away?</PARA>
<PARA> I looked at my speech of 5 September for the evil words where I had accused Borthwicks and Elders IXL Ltd of all sorts of wrong. The very vicious sentences-and the Minister at the table, Senator Reynolds, will appreciate the viciousness of this attack-contained in the speech say:</PARA>
<PARA> Elders IXL advertised for employees under the new award. People applied. The company sent them to a particular doctor in Portland. He reported to Elders on their physical ability to carry out the work required. Elders did not pay for the certificates. The candidates were told to use their Medicare entitlements. This caused concern because the Medicare scheme is not intended for the purpose to which it was put. </PARA>
<PARA>My understanding-at least until the time it was pointed out to me-was that Medicare was developed to help people pay for the medical care that they might need. I was pointing out here that that was not the purpose to which it was put. I did not accuse Elders IXL or Borthwicks of any criminal activity or wrongdoing. I simply said that the Medicare scheme was not intended for the purpose to which it was put. </PARA>
<PARA> This statement has produced items and caused letters to be sent to the local newspaper, a denunciation made of me from Queensland and during the matters of public interest discussion a contribution from Senator Alston. I really am at a loss to know what I can do about it. Do I withdraw the statement that it is a matter of concern when an employer sends people, including people with whom he has been in dispute, to a specific doctor where they have got to use their Medicare card for a certificate, which is then sent to the employer who keeps it to himself? Is that statement so outrageous as to call forth denunciations in the Senate, letters in the newspaper and the disturbance that this has apparently caused? It seems to me to be a reasonable statement of fact that medical examinations may be made through Medicare for people who are unemployed so that they can get certificates to obtain work, if they are allowed to go to their own doctor. But it can be a matter of concern to the people who have to have a medical examination that they have to go to a particular doctor nominated by their prospective employer. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not read the debate on the introduction of the Medicare scheme, but I would be surprised if the debate said that one of the intentions of introducing the Medicare scheme was to allow prospective employees of Elders IXL to get a medical report on their ability to carry out the work. I also mentioned Medicare. I stated:</PARA>
<PARA>But for the unions, conditions provided by Elders IXL at Portland would be poorer. A situation has been created where people looking for work must use Medicare to pay for a report from the single doctor to whom the company sends them. </PARA>
<PARA>One matter of concern is the fact that doctors in Portland, other than the doctor who conducts the examinations, feel troubled about the situation. They wrote a letter to the Portland Observer of 29 September in which they stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The following Doctors, Mr J. Das, Dr S. Jones, Dr G. Hitchman, Dr M. Martin, Dr B. Myles, Dr P. Reid and Dr T. Tierney categorically deny that at any time did they receive a `circular' from Thomas Borthwicks and Sons regarding Pre Employment Medicals or any other matter. </PARA>
<PARA> At no time had these Doctors charged Medicare for medicals performed on behalf of Borthwicks. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed none of these Doctors have recently performed medicals for this company. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Peter M. Reid. </PARA>
<PARA>That part of my speech of 5 September 1989 dealing with Medicare aroused all this concern. The interesting point is that apparently it did not disturb the company that I also alleged that it had failed to comply with an award, that is, the award obtained at the end of the case in the Industrial Relations Commission between the union, the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union, and Borthwicks. In that speech I said:</PARA>
<PARA> However, in clause 35-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, of the new award-</PARA>
<PARA>it did provide for seniority. Elders IXL did not comply with that clause. The union complained to the Commission, which said it could do nothing. </PARA>
<PARA>I accused Elders IXL of failing to comply with an industrial award. In contrast to the reaction to the very mild statement I made in my speech about the use to which the Medicare scheme had been put, which brought forth the company's rage, and the address by Senator Alston at lunchtime, there has been no reaction to the statement I made about the breach of the award. Is it fair to conclude that Elders IXL has no compunction about breaching awards, that it is quite happy to breach awards, but it is not happy to be accused-if that is the word-of using the Medicare scheme? In fact, as I read the transcript of my speech, it is not even accused of that. Is it concerned about a mild rebuke in respect of Medicare, but not concerned about the accusation that it has failed to comply with an award. If that is so it is a matter of great concern to the people of this nation that a company such as Elders IXL should not be troubled-and I judge this from its reaction to my speech-about breaching an award. It has not responded to the rebuke that it failed to comply with the law-awards having the force of law. It has absolutely no concern about that. I would have thought that the major protest would be about the accusation that it had failed to comply with an award. That it has not made one should be contrasted to the excessive reaction to the other statement I made. This says a lot about this whole dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> It would seem to follow-this inference can be fairly drawn from what has happened-that Borthwicks, controlled as it is by Elders IXL, has absolutely no compunction about breaching awards. It is disastrous that a company of its size and repute should approach industrial relations in this way. Whether or not we accept the industrial relations system, the fact is that it is the law of the land. Simply to disregard the law of the land and reject it out of hand because it does not suit one, simply to ignore it, is to take up a worrying stand. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am concerned about, arising from the reaction of Elders IXL to my speech of 5 September 1989, is the awful silence in respect of what I would have thought was the most serious of any of the accusations I made in it, namely, that the company has failed to obey the law, that it has failed to comply with the direction of the Industrial Relations Commission, and that it has failed to follow an award. It has said nothing about those things. Senator Alston has brought forward matters, as he is entitled to do, and he has done that with propriety. It says a lot about this company that it has reacted in the way it has to the statement I made regarding its use of the Medicare scheme-a scheme which is not intended to be used for the purpose to which it has been put in this case. That statement has been met with rage, while the proposition that the law has been breached has been met with silence. I did not say that the use by the company of the Medicare scheme had breached the law governing its operation. I simply said that it was of concern that people applying for jobs with this company had to use their Medicare entitlements in order to get a job. I said that the Medicare scheme was not intended for the purpose to which it was put in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of concern that people who have been out of work for months, who have been crushed by the burdens of industrial trouble, who have had to wait for a long period while the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, now the Industrial Relations Commission, decided their case-that took about six months-would feel depressed. Those people were asked to visit the doctor used by the company, who then reported back to the company on their physical condition. They were unable to see the doctor's reports, even though, as I said, the doctor was paid by Medicare. That, in my view, is a matter of singular concern, particularly when one is dealing with a company which, according to its reaction to my speech, apparently has no regard for the force of awards and no regard for the law of the land. </PARA>
<PARA> If one reads the speech I made-it took me only five minutes to make it; it has taken me 15 minutes to describe it-one sees that it refers to the tragedy that was occurring while the dispute was before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. It took too long to resolve. In my speech, I talked about the misfortune of those people caught in a situation in which the Commission took a long time to decide the issue. They were out of work for a long period. No matter what one says about the dispute, it was tragic that these people should be thrown into the situation they were. In the speech I referred to how these people had been caught up in the system and the distress that they had suffered. Yet Borthwicks, run by Elders, did not acknowledge the concern that I expressed about the situation of the people who were put through the grinder of the system. Borthwicks' concern was apparently about this one sentence, where I said:</PARA>
<PARA> This caused concern because the Medicare scheme is not intended for the purpose to which it was put. </PARA>
<PARA>That was seen by Elders as criticism and it raised a furore. It ignored completely the thrust of the speech, namely, a concern for these people so tragically dealt with by the circumstances that pertained in Portland earlier this year and late last year. It is a strange order of values, a strange arrangement of priorities, that all the elements in this speech dealing with people in these tragic circumstances should be ignored. There was not one word of sympathy in anything that was subsequently said-either by Senator Alston today or in any of the comments made by Borthwicks and Elders IXL published in the newspapers. Since I made this speech there has not been one word of sympathy for these people. </PARA>
<PARA> The company could have said, `Look, Senator Cooney, you were a bit rough in what you said there, but we do concede that the people had been tragically affected'. Although it could have said that it was not the fault of the company, it could have at least acknowledged the position of the people who had worked for the company, or who are now potential workers. These are not union leaders but ordinary men and women. One would have hoped that there would be some expression of sympathy for them. The company could have said that it was sympathetic but that nevertheless that is how the system works, that is how the cookie crumbles, or whatever other expression it wanted to use. However, it said absolutely nothing about the essential thrust of the speech and gave not one word of sympathy to the people involved. It simply extracted one sentence from the total text of the speech and caused a furore. This led to Senator Alston giving a speech about the matter today as a matter of public importance. This all seems to be a most extraordinary evaluation of what human life is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall conclude by reading what I said in the last paragraph about the present situation. The course that this matter has taken since I made this speech confirms what I said there:</PARA>
<PARA> Much has been said about the need to free up the labour market. The call has been for workers and management to negotiate enterprise agreements. Unions have been allotted a minor role in the scheme of things. But for the unions conditions provided by Elders IXL at Portland would be the poorer. </PARA>
<PARA>I think the reaction of Elders to this speech is evidence of that. It is quite clear from the reaction of the company to this speech that more than ever there is a need for good, strong unions. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>
