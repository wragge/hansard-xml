<PARA> (b) expresses concern that the practice of calling quorums during the adjournment debate effectively denies Independents one of the few opportunities to have their say in the Senate, and is particularly annoying when Independents are continually reminded that the adjournment is their best opportunity to speak, free of the usual limitations of speakers' lists which give precedence to major political groups in this Chamber; and</PARA>

<PARA> (a) expresses concern that the Government reponse to the report by the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on Visits to Australia by Nuclear Powered or Armed Vessels: Contingency Planning for Accidental Release of Ionizing Radiation was not presented to the House of Representatives while that Chamber was sitting;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) regrets the confusion which stemmed from:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the response being buried in a long list of Government papers, 83 out of 87, making it unlikely that it would be discussed in the Senate, and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the wording of the document which resulted in journalists and the Chairman of the Committee reaching conclusions other than those the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) intended;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) deplores the fact that the Minister showed little respect for either the Committee or its findings when he said that Senator Maguire would `lose at least an ear for this' because he had quite understandably concluded that the Government's response, if taken literally, would mean a ban on nuclear-powered warship visits until recommendations agreed to had been implemented;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) deplores the fact that the Government's response, written in true Sir Humphrey fashion, with the Committee's 39 recommendations being either noted (12 of them, meaning no, nothing would be done), endorsed (12 of them, meaning that the Federal Government would pass the buck to States and Territories), and agreed (15 of them, meaning that the Government would consider favourably the recommendation, which may or may not mean action), is an attempt to reassure the US Navy that it is business as usual, an attempt which badly back-fired;</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate-Mr President, I take a point of order. This is an attempt to use the notice of motion as a platform for a debate on this issue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pursuant to Senator Chaney's contingent notice of motion, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That so much of Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Crichton-Browne moving forthwith the motion of which he gave notice. </PARA>
<PARA>I will be brief. I can think of no more appropriate occasion than today for a motion of this nature to be moved formally, and no more appropriate occasion or circumstance for the suspension of standing orders so as to allow for the debate and resolution of the motion that stands in my name. I do not propose-and it would not be proper to do so-to canvass the events that have led up to the present situation. However, as matters stand, a team of 85 young athletes have been selected to represent their country at the forthcoming Commonwealth Games. Perhaps I ought to read the motion so we all understand that which I am debating. Yesterday I gave notice that, on the next day of sitting, I would move:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) notes:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) The decision by the Australian Commonwealth Games Association (ACGA) to refuse to allow Athletics Australia to increase the size of the Australian track and field team from 70 to 85 members. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) that the maximum allowable size under the Commonwealth Games rules of the Australian athletic team is 118,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) that each of the 85 athletes selected has performed to a level which, based on the last Commonwealth Games, would qualify them for the finals at the Auckland Games,</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) that the ACGA has acknowledged that there is no financial impediment to a team of 85 athletes competing, that adequate accommodation within the Commonwealth Village at Auckland is available and that uniforms and competition uniforms are available for 85 athletes,</PARA>
<PARA> (v) that, notwithstanding the great travel distances involved, the Canadians and English are each sending track and field teams with in excess of 110 members,</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) that the decision not to increase the team size to 85 athletes is a procedural matter, and</PARA>
<PARA> (vii) that there is no practical reason why these 15 young Australian athletes should not be given an opportunity to represent their country; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) calls upon:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the ACGA to reverse its decision and allow these athletes an opportunity to represent Australia, and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the Government to convey to the ACGA the view that the 85 qualifying Australian track and field athletes be allowed to compete in the Auckland Commonwealth Games. </PARA>
<PARA>Eighty-five young people have made enormous personal sacrifices. They have given years of dedication and commitment and have now been given the honour of representing their country. Few of us, perhaps, understand the agony and ecstasy of their dilemma. Few of us, I imagine, could begin to understand the hours, days, months and years of personal sacrifice and commitment that they have given in the pursuit of excellence in their chosen sport. The level of dedication and commitment is something that I imagine very few people understand. Their finest reward is the opportunity to compete and to represent Australia at the Auckland Commonwealth Games. </PARA>
<PARA> Each of these athletes has experienced the joy and exhilaration of being officially informed that he or she is a member of the Australian Commonwealth Games team to compete in Auckland in January and February of 1990, only to have that joy, that ecstasy, dashed upon the rocks of official incompetence, confusion and stupidity because of what is described as a procedural matter. Athletics Australia has been instructed by the Australian Commonwealth Games Association to cull 15 of these 85 athletes from the team. These 85 young athletes are now not basking in the joy or the pleasure, not getting satisfaction or reward for their dedication and commitment, but living daily the agony of waiting for a phone call to be told that they are no longer in the team, that they will have to hand their blazer back in, so to speak. These young athletes are suffering the pain and indecision of not knowing whether they are still part of the team. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely this Senate is capable of arriving at a resolution, capable of making a determination and capable of making a decision in this matter. I do not believe it is necessary for this Senate to wait upon the deliberations, negotiations and discussions of Senator Richardson with the various officials. This Senate is capable of arriving at a conclusion of its own. It is aware of the facts and the circumstances. We all know-no view has been put to the contrary-that there is no practical impediment or reason why 85 young track and field athletes cannot compete, as selected, representing Australia in the Commonwealth Games. There is no financial impediment, and there are no problems with accommodation, aircraft seats or competition uniforms. There is no impediment whatsoever. It is simply a bureaucratic procedural matter, because originally Athletics Australia made a bid for 70 places and not 85. That bid was based on their best guess judgment as to how many of their athletes would qualify. But given additional funding from the Drug Offensive and Mobil Oil, which allowed for further meets and further grand prix competitions, the quality and the standard of performance of our athletes increased to the point where 85 of them are now capable of winning a place in the finals of the Auckland Commonwealth Games. There is not one of the 85 athletes selected that on his or her best performance so far could not compete in the finals. What do they have to do to get in? Guarantee a gold medal? I would have thought that it is not unreasonable that this Senate conveys the resolution that I have proposed thus far. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no doubt that when any one of these 85 athletes wins gold, silver or bronze, we will all be cheering in front of our television sets and that those who are visiting Auckland will be there cheering with pride and with tears in their eyes. We will be watching on television or clapping as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) presents their medals to them-thinking to himself, `This is a few more votes for me in the ballot box'. But everybody else will live in the reflected glory of their endeavours, their efforts, their joy, their ecstasy and their success. I would have thought that in those circumstances this Senate would be capable of moving and carrying a resolution that it convey to the officials of the Australian Commonwealth Games Association the view that we believe 85 athletes ought to compete. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that Senator Richardson is finally meeting the officials this morning, as some sort of honest broker. I am sure we have all read what he has said so far. He was adamant that it was not his place to make judgments; he did not want to get involved. I am not suggesting for a moment that it is his right to instruct anybody, but he has a reputation for gentle persuasion. Under the circumstances, I would have thought it is not inappropriate that this Senate carry the motion I present. </PARA>

Mr President, you have heard one side of the story in this chamber; there is another side. The Senate should never make decisions based on ignorance. If it makes this decision today, it makes it on the basis of total ignorance when there is no need. All that this resolution can do is to hinder the process that goes on this morning, which I am very confident will result in a settlement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to oppose the motion that has been moved by Senator Crichton-Browne. Like the Democrats, I did not attempt to take a point of order on Senator Crichton-Browne when he was moving for the suspension of Standing Orders because there was no point in doing so. He may as well have got the matter off his chest then as now. When one looks at the specifics of this issue and goes back over the argument and the difficulty of the last couple of months, one can see some enormous problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first point to make is that when one speaks to sporting administrators around Australia, as I have done in the last few days as they have been queuing up to get on the telephone, one sees that a great many of them seriously question the decision regarding the 85 athletes. Those administrators include one of Australia's foremost sporting administrators who I hope will be involved in settling this issue today-someone who knows a great deal more about the difficulties than anyone else in the Senate. I really wonder how many senators here are aware of the selection criteria for Australian athletics. How many have looked at the 85 athletes and their performances and, therefore, how many senators feel qualified to make statements similar to those that Senator Crichton-Browne has made? I know a damn sight more about this matter than does Senator Crichton-Browne and I am not qualified to do so. Across Australia a number of sporting administrators and experts have been through selections of Commonwealth Games teams and Olympic Games teams and know, well and truly, that all is not perfect in the exercise that we have seen so far. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats are supporting Senator Crichton-Browne's motion. I hope that one of the Australian Democrats will explain to us now the selection criteria, how the Australian Commonwealth Games Association has made its mistakes and how Athletics Australia justifies increasing the team size to 85 athletes. When the Australian Democrats do that we will see that they have an intimate knowledge of the matter and that they understand why they are voting the way they are. But they will not do that because they do not have a clue. The reality is that today, when we are trying to settle an argument, the Senate will actually pass a motion when almost no senators have any idea at all of its substance. </PARA>

Having talked to both parties on the phone, I am very close to getting a settlement. It is going well. We can come out of this with the Commonwealth Games Association and Athletics Australia going forward to do the best for the Games and the best for those athletes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats supported the suspension of Standing Orders because we believed that it was right and proper that this matter come forward for public debate at the time. I point out to Senator Richardson that, whatever the Senate does or does not decide today, the decision making process will still be left in the hands of the Australian Commonwealth Games Association-the decision will still belong to it. The point of suspending Standing Orders means that we can at least open up the issues and this is being done. I have listened very carefully to what both Senator Richardson and Senator Crichton-Browne have said on the matter. In a debate it is not only speaking that is important; if we are to follow through the democratic process, we should also spend time listening and assessing the material brought forward in a debate. It may be pertinent that we debate the issue at the present time but do not actually carry the vote through until a later time this day. Therefore, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>

It is a pity Senator Richardson did not understand that, because if he did he would not need 25 officials in his office now telling him that one and one makes two.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I start in this debate on the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill and the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Bill by protesting in the strongest possible terms at the absence of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson. This debate was listed on the Notice Paper for yesterday but was postponed following a request to the Opposition, on the sole ground that Senator Richardson wished to be present for the debate. We were asked would we please not debate this in the absence of Senator Richardson yesterday. We therefore agreed not to debate the legislation yesterday and to wait until today so that Senator Richardson could be present in order to take part in a debate concerning the portfolio area in which he is the responsible Minister. I wish to object most strongly to our having been doublecrossed by the Government on the basis of being asked not to proceed yesterday with the legislation on the sole ground that Senator Richardson was absent and did not want the matter debated in his absence and would we please stand it over until today. We agreed to stand it over until today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a number of technical matters, particularly in relation to the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill 1989, which Senator Coulter and I will be raising, which required the Minister to be here and give explanations. Therefore, I commence with a very strong indication to the Government that if this is the way in which, during the course of the remainder of the week, it wishes to deal with us-by seeking our cooperation to debate a particular matter, on a particular day, to suit the convenience of a particular Minister, who then leaves the chamber prior to the commencement of the debate-this week is, I think, going to be one which will strain a lot of the goodwill which I would have hoped, in dealing with substantive legislation, might have been available. I protest most strongly at that cavalier attitude on the part of the Government and I protest most strongly at being asked to cooperate with the Government and being treated in this appallingly shabby fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two Bills which are now before the Senate in a cognate debate, the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill and the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Bill, and I propose to deal with both in my speech on the second reading. I shall turn, first, to the more straightforward of these Bills-the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Bill 1989. The purpose of the Bill is to establish a national scheme for the notification and assessment of industrial chemicals. It is designed to ensure that there is adequate information on any possible hazards associated with chemicals imported or manufactured in Australia. The Bill will not directly regulate the use of chemicals; that will remain a responsibility of the States and the Territories. However, under the scheme established by the Bill, the existing regulatory agencies will be provided with far better information on which to make decisions about regulating chemicals. This will encourage uniformity of regulation by the States and Territories, something which is to be greatly welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation will provide for all new chemicals to be assessed before they are introduced into the Australian market, and for selected chemicals which are already in use to be reviewed. The Bill will provide for an inventory of all industrial chemicals currently in use in Australia. All new chemicals will be notified to Worksafe Australia, which is to administer the scheme, together with a notification statement of the chemicals' intended use and properties. The information will be assessed to determine the potential hazard to occupational health and safety, public health and the environment. Worksafe will be obliged to prepare and distribute assessments of the chemicals within a specified time frame. Such assessments would normally include recommendations for the safe use of the chemical. There is also provision for the selective assessment of existing chemicals where there are particular concerns about possible hazards. It is, of course, impossible to argue with the objectives of the Bill, which are to provide more information about hazardous chemicals, to reduce health and safety problems and to limit environmental damage. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that the chemical industry, through the Australian Chemical Industry Council, strongly supports this Bill. Indeed, a press release issued I think in September by Mr Frank Phillips, the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Chemical Industry Council, States:</PARA>
<PARA>A new Commonwealth Bill to ensure that each industrial chemical in Australia is evaluated has been endorsed and welcomed by the Australian Chemical Industry Council. </PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to see, on this particular occasion, that the cooperation between Government and industry has led to a situation in which the industry is happy with a regulatory regime which is being put in place. The chemical industry is already subject to a vast array of regulations covering aspects such as storage, transportation, occupational health and safety, environmental protection and consumer protection. These regulations, however, have grown up in an ad hoc manner and vary considerably from State to State. This means that industry is subjected to a variety of inconsistent regulatory regimes leading to substantially increased costs. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill, of course, does not override the States' powers to regulate chemicals but by providing a common database it will encourage governments to develop uniform regulatory procedures and regimes. If a national scheme is not implemented, it is likely that pressure for improved environmental and occupational health and safety protection will lead to the States developing their own separate notification and assessment arrangements. This would undoubtedly increase costs both for Government and the industry and, indeed, for the consumers. Some parallel may be drawn between this and the debate which we had last week on the therapeutic goods legislation in terms of overlapping Commonwealth and State regulations. The scheme, as I have indicated previously, has been developed in close consultation with industry and is designed to minimise the cost burden. </PARA>
<PARA> The Business Regulation Review Unit-again I drew heavily on some of its comments in relation to the therapeutic goods legislation the other day-supports the introduction of a national notification and assessment scheme which it believes will lead to higher levels of public safety and lower costs in the manufacture and use of chemicals. The Business Regulation Review Unit has proposed some modifications to this scheme contained in the Bill. It argues that all new chemicals should be automatically approved where they are already included in recognised inventories of major Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. This, it is argued, would avoid duplicating work done overseas, reduce costs and release resources to develop information on chemicals already in use that are of concern. </PARA>
<PARA> The counter argument, however, is that the Bill already provides for the use of overseas assessment. Under the Bill's provisions, where a new chemical has been notified and assessed under the recognised equivalent scheme of another country, that notification and assessment will suffice provided that the assessment is assessable and relevant to the proposed use and exposure profile of the chemical in Australia. The difficulty in automatically approving chemicals on overseas inventories is that simply being on the inventory of an OECD country does not mean that a chemical has been assessed for potential health or environmental hazards. Automatic entry for chemicals listed overseas, without any assessment, would perpetuate the current situation where chemicals can come onto the Australian market without any information as to the health or environmental hazards and appropriate safety recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, the Australian Chemical Industry Council has endorsed and welcomed this particular Bill, and so does the Opposition. Rather than detain the Senate in the committee stage, I will simply raise with the Minister on duty the one matter which does give some concern as far as this Bill is concerned and seek some response; that is, the concern which is felt by the Opposition about the possibility that section 31 (2) of the Bill could lead to undue delays and costs to the applicant for assessment. The Bill clearly envisages that an assessment is normally to be made within a 90-day period. However, section 31 (2) provides for the 90 days to be restarted if further information is required. While section 27 allows the applicant to appeal against a request for further information, the appeal process itself could involve substantial delay and extra costs. The procedure therefore has the potential to lead to significant bureaucratic delays in assessing the chemicals. At this stage the Opposition does not propose to seek an amendment to the Bill, rather to seek clarification from the Minister on the way in which this will operate. I indicate that we will be closely monitoring the administration of the scheme and will seek to amend the legislation if there appear to be undue and unnecessary delays in assessing chemicals under this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the more complex and more significant Bill, the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill 1989. The legislation that we now face proposes a system for the control of the import and export of hazardous wastes by use of ministerial permits. The objective of the exercise is to ensure that such wastes are disposed of in an environmentally acceptable manner. In March 1989 the Basel Convention on the Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal was adopted and is now open for signature and ratification. This Bill would enable Australia to meet the requirements of the Basel Convention with regard to transboundary movements of such wastes. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Bill adopts definitions and principles found in the Basel Convention-that is to say it adopts them in the main; we will come back in the committee stage to the question of their adequate adoption of the definitions in the Basel Convention-it should be noted that the Commonwealth clearly possesses the power to regulate this matter in any event through existing constitutional powers over customs, exports and imports. Consequently, adherence to the Basel Convention does not, I believe, increase the Commonwealth's powers over the States, nor make what I would characterise as improper use of the external affairs power. The permit scheme provides that all decisions made by the Minister are subject to judicial review and the scheme will be self-financing as there will be a fee of up to $4,000 prescribed to cover the costs of administering the Act. It should be noted that the scheme excludes control of radioactive wastes as these are not dealt with in the Basel Convention and, in any event, are the subject of other Australian legislation already in place. </PARA>
<PARA> For the last few years concern has been increasing about the dumping of toxic wastes from major industrial producers, in particular on to the Third World. We have seen ships such as the Zenobia, the Khian Sea and the Karin-B roaming the high seas in search of a port to offload their cargoes of toxic wastes and being denied entry to ports on four continents. This particular matter was already under scrutiny, first through a proposed OECD agreement in 1984, and then by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) which took over the work in 1987. At the same time steps for a regional control mechanism were being developed within our own region and, in particular, within the Association of South East Asian Nations. I refer to an article by Amado Tolentino, the director of the Environmental Management Bureau in the Philippines, which appeared in the journal Industry and Environment in early 1988, entitled `Hazardous waste management in the ASEAN: an emerging regime'. Lengthy articles similarly appeared in popular magazines such as Time and Newsweek drawing attention to the increasing profile that this issue was receiving in various international fora. Under this pressure, and under the auspices of the UNEP, the Basel Convention was developed and in its final session was approved by 105 of the 116 participating countries. The Convention has so far been signed by 34 countries, or thereabouts, including Canada, France, the Philippines, the European Community, Belgium, Italy, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, Spain, plus several countries in Latin America and the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> Concern has also been expressed about the need to develop a stricter code within the EC and for OECD countries and a lead has been taken in this area by the new British Secretary of State for the Environment, Mr Christopher Patten. Indeed, on 21 August 1989 Mr Patten put out a statement entitled, `The movement and disposal of toxic wastes', in which he said in part:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the disposal of waste throughout the world raises questions which can only be dealt with effectively internationally. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill and the Basel Convention are an attempt to deal with those matters on that international level. Support for the Basel Convention is widespread, although it must be conceded that the Convention is drawn primarily to protect the Third World countries by casting an onus upon the exporting nations to prevent their waste producers from exporting toxic wastes to vulnerable destinations. This, for example, is apparent in the inclusion of controls of exports of what are defined as `categories of wastes requiring special consideration' so as to include certain household wastes and residues arising from their incineration. This reflects a primary concern with the dumping of ash containing heavy metals and dioxins or the mercury-cadmium wastes from batteries. </PARA>
<PARA> While Australia has major problems with the inadequate storage of its own domestic toxic wastes-for example, problems at Botany in New South Wales, or at Kingston near Brisbane-and while there are disputes about the development and location of high-temperature waste disposal facilities, the subject of a study involving the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victoria at this very time, we are not at the moment an importer of any toxic wastes. The matter is subject, as I have said, to a current tripartite inquiry involving the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victoria which I regret is taking far longer than it should have done and in which an urgent decision is required as a matter of some national significance. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent years Australian toxic wastes have occasionally been incinerated at sea-for example in 1982 on the incinerator ship the Vulcanus. However, virtually all of our significant toxic waste is exported to Pontypool in Wales for incineration. The main wastes exported appear to be polychlorinated biphenyls derived primarily from the operations of electricity commissions around Australia. Indeed, it is of interest that this trade appears to be virtually a monopoly in terms of the handling and transportation in the hands of TNT Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not deal at length with the actual proposed scheme; I will simply mention something about it in broad outline. An operator seeking to import or export hazardous waste must get a permit from the Minister, who must be satisfied that the applicant is a fit and proper person to receive a permit, that he has adequate insurance cover, that the waste can be disposed of in an environmentally acceptable fashion, and that the receiving country has agreed to accept the waste in question. Decisions on permits are subject to Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act appeals and determination. A permit may be refused if the Minister considers that, having regard to Australia's international obligations, the waste should be dealt with in another way; if it can be disposed of safely within Australia; or the grant of the permit is contrary to the public interest. A fee may be levied for the permit. I am glad to say that in clause 17 there is an absolute prohibition on the export of hazardous wastes to the Antarctic. Details of permit application and grants must be notified in the Gazette and decisions must be made within specified periods. The Minister has power to deal with illegally imported wastes and may order their export, or that they be otherwise dealt with. In these cases the Minister may seek to recover the consequential costs from offenders through the courts. Failure to operate according to this system carries a potential maximum penalty of a five-year prison sentence. Inspectors are to be appointed to run the scheme with the usual powers granted in these circumstances. An annual report is to be provided to the Parliament and regulations are made in such a way as to allow the schedule to the Act to be kept current with the provisions of the appropriate annexes of the Basel Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> When this Bill was first introduced it was presented to me as shadow Minister for the environment. I suggested a number of changes which might be made to the legislation. I simply want to acknowledge the changes that have been made between the Bill in its draft from and the Bill in its final form. Perhaps the most interesting of these was that in the draft Bill, which was first presented to the House of Representatives, clause 18 provided for a system of determining whether an applicant was a `fit and proper person'. In the light of the various decisions about Mr Bond and the definition of the term `fit and proper person', I drew the attention of the Government to the fact that I thought that the old clause 18 was quite irrelevant and, in particular, that in determining the question of `fit and proper person', the Minister should have regard to such things as-and I quote from the Bill as it was first presented:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) any conviction of the applicant for an offence against this Act committed within 10 years before the Minister received the application;-</PARA>
<PARA>which was probably fair enough-</PARA>
<PARA> (b) any conviction of the applicant for an offence against another law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory that is punishable by imprisonment for 12 months or longer, being an offence committed within 10 years before the Minister received the application . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I thought that is was drawing a particularly long bow in dealing with environmental matters that the Minister was required to take into account a conviction of the applicant for a breach of the traffic laws or similar laws and that such a conviction could be held against the applicant in determining his `fit and proper' status to operate as an exporter or importer of hazardous waste. After some discussions, the Government introduced amendments to provide that the old clause 18 be dropped entirely. In the current clause 17 (1) (c) which we now have before us under the heading `Grant of permits', the Minister has to be satisfied in relation to the granting of a permit with regard to the following matters:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the applicants financial viability; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the applicant's previous record in relation to environmental matters;-</PARA>
<PARA>which was the key that I was trying to establish-</PARA>
<PARA> and (iii) any other relevant matters . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That gives the Minister the power to take into account a whole range of extraneous matters, but subject to Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> The second change that was made arose largely from recommendations, I think, of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills to provide in clause 51 that the length of currency of the warrant be reduced from one month to seven days. There was a minor amendment to clause 17 (5) to insert the word `safely', to read:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister may decide not to grant the permit if the permit sought is an export permit and the Minister thinks that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the hazardous waste could be disposed of safely by using a facility in Australia . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That, again, is a minor amendment. There has been a change in that the original Bill only had attached to it annex III to the Basel Convention. At my request, the Government has now attached annexes I, II, II and IV of the Basel Convention as schedules to the Bill, so that people reading the Bill will be able to read it in a more complete fashion without having to refer to the very lengthy document which constitutes the Basel Convention in its entirety. Finally, in the House of Representatives a moment of history, almost, was made-it probably was a moment of history-when my colleague Mr Warwick Smith moved an amendment to the Bill which actually succeeded. Clause 10 (2) of the original Bill said:</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing in this Act permits the Crown to be prosecuted for an offence. </PARA>
<PARA>In the House of Representatives we moved to delete that provision. Despite the conniptions of the Attorney-General's Department, it was deleted. The Clause 10 now says:</PARA>
<PARA>This Act binds the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, of each of the States, of the Australian Capital Territory, of the Northern Territory and of Norfolk Island. </PARA>
<PARA>It no longer contains the exemption of the Crown from being prosecuted for breaches of the Act. That is a very valuable addition to the Bill. The Crown, after all, in terms of its own possession or its own responsibility in these matters, should not seek to come to the Parliament and ask the Parliament to say that everybody else should be subject to prosecution for breaches of the Act other than the Crown. It is only if we are particularly vigilant to ensure that the Crown in this respect stands on equal footing with any company or any individual citizen in Australia that we have adequate controls of these particular matters. I am glad that the amendment which was moved by Mr Smith on behalf of the Opposition in the House of Representatives was successful. </PARA>
<PARA> I will wait until we reach the committee stage of the Bill to deal with a matter which I know Senator Coulter wishes to raise and which, I am sure, he will indicate as being the basis of some discussion that has taken place between us in order to improve what we regard as the adequacy of coverage of this legislation. I will wait until the committee stage to talk about the amendment which Senator Coulter will be putting forward. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, this is an important Bill. Not only are countries of the Third World quite genuinely concerned but countries such as Nigeria and Guinea-Bissau are finding themselves unwillingly the recipients of noxious, hazardous wastes left on their coastlines, dumped on their shores, and often imported as a result of bribery and corruption that takes place within those countries' administrations. They will be protected by the regime of the Basel Convention, provided they are signatories to it. There is a very clear indication that people should take responsibility for their own toxic waste, that they should dump in their own backyard if they are going to dump anywhere. It is an argument which has some relevance to the point we have been making about French nuclear tests. There are certain things we ought to be able to do in our own backyard and certain things that we should not do in other people's backyards. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are some things, as the Minister says, that we should not do anywhere. This Bill does not prevent things from being done at all; it simply regulates where they shall be done. It is not a matter of simply ignoring the significant problems we have within Australia. Earlier this month a major explosion at the Diversey Industrial Chemicals plant in Seven Hills in Sydney led to massive clouds of toxic smoke being swept over large parts of the western suburbs of Sydney for a considerable time. Among the chemicals stored in that plant were chemicals such as methylated chlorine, caustic soda, chlorine, sulphuric acid, nitric acid and sodium hypochlorite. Under the regime of both these Bills, those chemicals need close attention. There are outstanding problems in the use of heptachlor and chlordane for white-ant treatment in buildings. There is increasing public concern about the level of chemical storage in our major metropolitan areas and about the effective control of their transport and disposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am disappointed that we have not yet got a final recommendation out of the tripartite government study on the location of a high temperature waste incinerator. That committee has had adequate time to get on with its work. We ought to be looking at some positive recommendations, particularly since New South Wales has made it clear that it is prepared to play host to such a facility and that as a result there will not be a brawl between the Commonwealth and State as to the establishment of the facility. We will need the time, the resources and the expertise of all concerned to establish the appropriate site for that facility to be developed. That will be no easy task. The sooner it is started, the sooner we will get a resolution of the whole thing. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation also has the support of the Australian Environment Council. It was first suggested as the correct way to proceed by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts in its first report on the inquiry into hazardous chemicals which took place and reported in 1982. The Opposition will support both of these Bills. We look forward to the Minister's response to the question I raised on the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Bill and some of the comments which I have raised during this second reading debate. I look forward to further discussion on some of those issues at the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The theme I wish to develop during the second reading stage of this debate is that, as someone who has been active as a research scientist for a number of years dealing with hazardous chemicals and also someone who has had a long term interest in the environment, I am very pleased to see these two Bills, the Hazardous Waste (Regulations of Exports and Imports) Bill 1989 and the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Bill 1989, coming forward. I recognise that they have been a long time in coming forward and that, indeed, other complementary legislation also needs to be passed. These two Bills are part of a package of Bills. The package is still incomplete. The package has been a long time coming but, nonetheless, we are pleased to see this part of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are dealing this morning with Bills relating to notification and assesssment and the import and export of hazardous wastes. The notification Bill has been a long time in coming. Indeed, for many years I was one of the substitute members of an advisory committee on behalf of the Australian Conservation Foundation dealing with this matter, and it seemed to progress very slowly indeed. The inventory to be established under this legislation will be a list of chemicals. It will be largely composed of or based on information provided by those who import, manufacture, use, market, et cetera, chemicals in Australia and will provide a basis of information, and the database will better serve the protection of the environment, workers and people in the community generally. The scheme will be administered by Worksafe Australia and, of course, that organisation has recently been created by this Government. That is another element in the program for the control of hazardous chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation, of course, does not place any controls on the chemicals as such. It will simply act as a database of information, but that database of information is a prerequisite for any controls which could be imposed later on either by the States or the Commonwealth. There has been a presumption over many years that many chemicals used industrially do not find their way into the general environment. Indeed, that presumption has been extended also in the past to therapeutic drugs and agricultural chemicals. For a long time, we suffered the ridiculous assumption that the organochlorin pesticides used on food crops, because they were used to deal with pests on food crops, did not find their way into the human food chain and, therefore, did not pose a hazard to human health and, moreover, that they did not get off-site and did not pose a hazard to the environment. Fortunately, we have gone beyond that and now recognise that chemicals used as therapeutic agents, agricultural chemicals or, indeed, industrial chemicals very often do leave the site where those chemicals are used and turn up in other situations where they pose a hazard to the environment and to human health. So this legislation, the notification scheme, will ensure that these industrial chemicals are evaluated before they enter the Australian market and that other chemicals can be called back from time to time for review. </PARA>
<PARA> I stress the point-because it has turned up a number of times in my experience in relation to the knowledge of chemicals, and the qualities of chemicals-that in the past very often particular qualities have led to chemicals being dealt with in ways which perhaps were adequate in the short term but totally inadequate in the long term. On a number of occasions we have seen spills of industrial chemicals, perhaps from road tankers. Firemen who are often called in to clean up these spills are perhaps aware of the short-term nature of the hazard. For instance, they might be aware that a particular chemical is inflammable and, therefore, they address the problem as if they are dealing with an inflammable agent which may cause a conflagration and do damage to property, but very often they are not informed about the long term hazards such as the ability of a chemical to cause mutations or cancers in those who are exposed to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, several years ago a group of firemen in Canberra were exposed to the chemical toluene di-isocyanate, often called TDI, and were ill-informed as to the extreme hazard associated with that chemical in relation to long-term health problems. Very briefly, toluene di-isocyanate is a chemical which can cross-bond naturally occurring agents in the body and make naturally occurring chemicals in the body appear like foreign chemicals, against which the body then makes an antibody. So toluene di-isocyanate is a supremely active agent in stimulating such things as asthma, eczema and chronic allergic-type skin diseases. Firemen who dealt with that spill in Canberra are still attempting to get compensation for a situation which should never have developed in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> Hopefully, as further information develops, the database which will come from this notification scheme will allow the accumulation of more and more accurate information in relation to effects still on the periphery of recognition. I am reminded that some years ago a study was undertaken in Sweden in relation to workers exposed to paint solvents at levels well below the levels which were accepted as hazardous. Nonetheless, those workers were experiencing a whole range of psychological symptoms such as headaches, insomnia, poor concentration and the like. Hopefully, the collection of data will progressively allow an improvement in our knowledge of those situations and give better protection to both the environment and human populations. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, on this Bill, it is highly desirable in this area that there be uniform controls imposed by the Commonwealth and that, as far as possible, those individual controls imposed by the States, which vary very often from State to State, can be superseded so that one is then dealing with one set of notifications, one database, one lot of information, which can be improved and that that will be to the benefit of both the regulators and regulated. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the import and export provisions in the other Bill, when populations were small and humans lived as gatherers and hunters, nomadic existence led itself to a certain amount of nest fouling. When a hunter-gatherer site because too polluted a tribe would move on and establish itself at a new site. The waste left behind, being organic, would slowly return to the soil and after a time the tribe could return to the same site without fear of being poisoned or infected by transmissible disease. But since the rise of industrialisation, and especially since the Second World War, the chemical industry has produced an increasing range of novel chemicals which had not been experienced before by nature and for which nature has no mechanism for breakdown. The whole class of halogenated organic compounds used in plastics, pesticides, refrigerants, fire-extinguishants, solvents and a large number of other applications are of this sort. When this class of compound came into widespread use it was generally reckoned to have great advantages precisely because these compounds were so stable. This was especially the case with the organochlorin pesticides. We now understand that this stability is a two-edged sword. Those compounds are very hard to destroy. If discarded into the environment, they continue to pose a hazard for very long periods. Many are acutely toxic; many are mutagenic; and many are carcinogenic. While the latter qualities may not be particularly important in nature, they are, of course, extremely important in relation to human exposure. Human populations are now so large that we can no longer leave our fouled nests and travel to fresh, unpolluted sites. Even if we did, the sites contaminated with halogenated organics and the other hazardous wastes with which this Bill deals would remain polluted for a very long period. </PARA>
<PARA> It is against that type of background that we are considering the question of the import and export of hazardous wastes. They form part, but only part, as I indicated earlier, of a package that has been a long time coming. We need the whole package to manage properly this very important matter. One very important missing element, an element to which Senator Puplick referred a moment ago, is an Australian high temperature incinerator to dispose finally of these hazardous and intractable wastes. In November 1985 a meeting of the Australian Environment Council dealt with the question of movement of hazardous waste and said:</PARA>
<PARA>The OECD of which Australia is a member, has decided that such international movements should be controlled. Australia has yet to formally endorse the Decision. Control of imports and exports is formally within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I make the point that that meeting was four years ago and it has taken four years for this legislation to come forward. The Australian Democrats are grateful that we now have such legislation, but we have been frustrated that it has taken so long to legislate in an area of such importance. A comprehensive scheme for handling these agents will involve not only a notification scheme and an import and export scheme, but also mechanisms for waste minimisation and for recycling as well as for destruction. We hope that these other parts will not be so long in coming. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has been tardy in accepting its overriding responsibility in most aspects of the control of hazardous chemicals: their manufacture, transport, storage and destruction. On several occasions I have raised questions about proposals to establish petrochemical plants manufacturing plastic precursors. Senator Richardson has consistently expressed the view that such matters are State concerns. In every such proposal, and there have been four in South Australia and one in Western Australia, there has been unnecessary exposure of populations and the environment to ethylene dichloride (EDC) and vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), two compounds which are intermediates-I stress that-in the path to the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Both these compounds are mutagenic and carcinogenic, and vinyl chloride monomer is highly inflammable. In a well-designed continuous production plant neither of these hazardous chemicals would be present in very large amounts. In every proposal floated in Australia so far, these highly toxic intermediates have been intended for export-a totally unnecessary activity-with the finishing of the process occurring in some other part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> In the most recent proposal at Kwinana on Cockburn Sound it was intended that there should be two 10,000-tonne tanks of EDC and VCM on the foreshore awaiting shipment overseas. When the question of a possible leak of vinyl chloride monomer was raised, the environmental consultant with Petrochemical Industries Co. Ltd, the company responsible for developing the proposal, naively defended the storage of 10,000 tonnes of vinyl chloride monomer by pointing out that the tanks would be bunded, that is, surrounded by a moat to collect the spill. I suspect that at that stage he did not know that vinyl chloride monomer boils at minus 14 degrees Celsius. A spill of such a magnitude of either ethylene dichloride or vinyl chloride monomer, under the usual conditions of a south-westerly wind which prevail in that area of the world, would necessitate the evacuation of the whole of the Perth metropolitan area. Yet the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, said that this is a State matter and is not to be legislated for at the Commonwealth level. We are now manufacturing some very dangerous chemicals indeed, and these are often handled in very large amounts. There is a need to minimise the risks as far as possible, both at source and at the transport and disposal end. There is a need for uniform Federal control of all stages of the manufacture, handling and disposal of these agents. The Federal Government has the power under the corporations power of the Constitution; it should use that power. </PARA>
<PARA> The volumes of hazardous wastes are very large. The United States, which has more heavy chemical industry than any other country, is accumulating such waste at the rate of 265 million tonnes per year. Some 57 million tonnes of this is organic waste. It is estimated that over the last 35 years some six billion tonnes have been generated. The United States has not handled this waste very well. Over the years hazardous chemical wastes have been disposed of into ordinary land fill and by way of deep well injection. Land fill sites have sometimes been built on and have resulted in such things as the Love Canal phenomenon. Deep well injection has resulted in very long term contamination of ground water. Disposal in land fill has also been practised in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent Four Corners program dealing with the intolerable situation in the Brisbane suburb of Kingston, in which residents had to evacuate their homes as a consequence, comes to mind. The people in Kingston were living in houses built over an old mine that had been filled with waste. The waste eventually oozed up through the ground. People were ill for quite a long time before the health authorities took action and moved the residents. Decontamination of this site is probably impossible, and the area will remain a no-man's land for the indefinite future. It seems to the Australian Democrats that this is an excellent example of what sustainable development does not mean. No generation should be closing options for later generations in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation in the United States is much worse. Some 8,660 sites where hazardous wastes have been dumped have been identified, almost a thousand in the State of Michigan alone. So serious is this problem that the United States has created what it calls a super fund to clean up the worst of these sites. In the most dangerous category, 1,177 sites have been identified. A recent report suggests that the cost of this clean-up will be some $500 billion over the next 50 years. Very few sites have actually been cleaned up, and even this estimate may grossly underestimate the ultimate cost. The real cost may be leaving future generations with permanently contaminated no-go areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Just as Alvin Weinberg a number of years ago proposed a permanent priestly class to care in perpetuity for nuclear waste, we may need such a class of dedicated citizens to care for these dangerous, chemically contaminated sites. Where deep soil injection has been practised, there is no way of decontaminating ground water. The water in situ remains unusable. Expensive chemical decontamination may make a small amount usable for human consumption, but at a very high price. A large part of the ground water in the United States is now contaminated with identifiable chemicals which have been so injected into deep wells. </PARA>
<PARA> The various Australian States have considered the problem of hazardous waste and have concluded that the problem relates particularly to chlorinated hydrocarbon wastes, in particular to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). These substances have been used for a number of years as transformer coolants. They are also used in a number of other settings, including self-copying paper used for receipt books, prescription pads and a whole range of other things. There have been cases of acute poisoning where PCBs were mixed with cooking oil in Japan and a large number of people were acutely poisoned. But the principal concern is over their persistence in the environment and in body tissues, where they accumulate-their bio-accumulation-and their mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. The many examples of chemicals of this class therefore pose a long term and delayed threat to both the environment and human health. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same general class are the polybrominated biphenyls, which have been used as fire retardants and share the properties of PCBs. These are only a small part of the enormous range of halogenated organic compounds which need to be handled and disposed of with a great deal of care. As already mentioned, compounds of this general class do not occur naturally and, therefore, all of them pose problems for the environment. It is easier-and I want to stress this point-to regard all of them as hazardous than to argue about individual chemicals. That goes to the matter of the amendment that I shall move in the committee stage of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Another group of compounds of this general class with which we will need to deal as a matter of urgency in the next few years includes the chlorofluorocarbons and the halons. As these are recalled from use in refrigerators, air-conditioners and fire extinguishers they will need to be stored safely, in many cases under pressure. I remind the Senate that freon 12 boils at something like minus 30 degrees Celsius. This underscores the urgency of the establishment of a high temperature incinerator in Australia. In the early 1970s-as I recall, about 1971 or 1972-the South Australian Jordan report made a strong call for a high temperature incinerator to dispose of organochlorine pesticides. It is an indictment of successive Australian governments that we still lack such a facility. </PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated that about 8,000 tonnes of chlorinated organic waste are in storage in Australia. Ninety-five per cent of this is in New South Wales, and 95 per cent of that is at the ICI Australia plant at Botany Bay. The rate of generation of these wastes is about 800 tonnes per year. Of this, 700 tonnes, or 88 per cent, is generated in New South Wales. These compounds often turn up as unwanted side reaction products in the manufacture of intended end products. Of course, that is exactly the situation at the ICI plant at Botany, where these materials accumulate as a result of the manufacturing process of a range of other quite valuable chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of this waste is now stored in drums, where it slowly polymerises and becomes solid. This creates further difficulties for its disposal in a high temperature incinerator. In Australia such an incinerator would need a capacity of about 1,500 tonnes per year, which is very small by world standards but essential for the safety of the Australian environment. It follows that, therefore, we need one incinerator, not two. The Federal Government should resist Western Australian plans for an incinerator on the goldfields or elsewhere in Western Australia. A well-run high temperature incinerator poses no threat to the environment or to the health of nearby residents. Disposing of wastes in this way is much safer than leaving these toxic materials lying around in rusting drums from which they must from time to time be decanted or transferred into fresh containers. </PARA>
<PARA> One principle to which governments must adhere is that the polluter pays. The cost of properly dealing with these materials is considerable and acts as a strong incentive to minimise waste generation. The present practice of exporting wastes overseas is more costly than burning them in an Australian incinerator. This may act as an incentive in the other direction-namely, illegally to dump hazardous wastes into sewers or land fill in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is to be congratulated for bringing forward these two Bills, which are long overdue and form part of a package of necessary legislation for the proper handling of hazardous wastes. This matter should be legislated at the national, not State, level. Pieces of the necessary package are still missing and there is an urgency about putting these other elements into place. Australia must have a high temperature incinerator which should be sited in New South Wales, preferably at the ICI works, so that the largest portion of these wastes do not have to be transported. </PARA>
<PARA> The former Labor Government in New South Wales mismanaged the public relations aspect of this proposal so as to make it unacceptable to the people living nearby-the so-called NIMBY not in my back yard phenomenon. Making a national decision may avoid some of this problem. Other components of the waste management strategy which need national attention are waste minimisation, standards for major chemical plants such as petrochemical plants-and I stress that these are all national requirements-and waste recycling. The Australian Democrats support the Bills, with one amendment, and express the hope that it will not be too long before we see the rest of this necessary package. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly on the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill 1989. During his second reading speech, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to control the export and import of hazardous wastes in order to protect human health and the environment. The Act will enable Australia to take part in international measures to control the movement of hazardous wastes which also have this objective. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . several of the obligations in the convention-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal-</PARA>
<PARA>such as the requirement to minimise waste production and the provision of acceptable disposal facilities, fall within the responsibilities of State and Territory Governments. Therefore the controls introduced by this Bill will be complemented by State and Territory waste management legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Being aware of the problems which have been experienced in Western Australia with regard to the transport and disposal of hazardous wastes, I welcome the introduction of this legislation which will lead to improvements in the way in which this waste is handled. Protecting human health and the environment through improving the way we manage hazardous wastes is a matter of great public interest, especially in Western Australia. The debate has been more widespread over the last two years as a result of the now defunct proposal to construct a petrochemical plant at Kwinana. That proposal has had a great deal of publicity. As well as exporting the hazardous substances, previously mentioned by my Australian Democrat colleague Senator John Coulter, the proposed plant would have also produced large quantities of intractable wastes. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposals put forward to dispose of such wastes have favoured high temperature incineration, with the Western Australian Health Department choosing a site at Mount Walton in the Eastern Goldfields in Western Australia. The proposal has been opposed by residents in the area and it seems that wherever a high temperature incinerator is proposed public opposition is sure to follow-the `not in my back yard' routine. Many Western Australians are not convinced that such an incinerator will operate to the high standards promised by the Government. A similar type of incinerator is proposed for the Eastern Goldfields by the joint task force on intractable wastes which was set up to find solutions for hazardous wastes, which originate predominantly in eastern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> While I commend the joint task force for its preliminary report of April 1988, I can not support all of its conclusions. The two-volume report summarised the serious position which exists in Australia in respect of intractable wastes. The brochure describing the report, entitled The Management of Intractable Wastes, compiled by the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victorian governments, says:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia does not have proper disposal facilities for some of the chemical wastes it produces. While these wastes are only a small proportion of the total hazardous waste stream, they are harmful to the environment because they do not break down easily. Known as `intractable' wastes, they include wastes containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), mainly from electrical equipment; hexachlorobenzene and other residues from plastics manufacture; and organochlorine pesticides such as DDT and dieldrin. It is estimated that 9,100 tonnes of this material is stockpiled, 3,000 tonnes is still in service and 425 tonnes is generated each year. It is probable that further detailed surveys will reveal significant extra quantities of organochlorines requiring destruction. </PARA>
<PARA> Only one overseas facility, a high temperature incinerator in Wales, has been prepared to accept waste from Australia and there is no guarantee that this option will continue. The cost and risk associated with transporting wastes overseas for disposal has led to large quantities of wastes being stored. Long-term storage is unacceptable because of the risk of accident through spillage or fire. </PARA>
<PARA>While I agree with the report's statement that Australia needs a safe and environmentally sound management and disposal system in Australia, in Western Australia the immediate problems arising from the stockpiles of intractable wastes must be addressed. The unsatisfactory situation with regard to stockpiles of hazardous wastes such as PCBs is a major cause of community concern in Western Australia. I refer in particular to the situation in respect of a recent proposal for the disposal of PCB waste from Mount Newman Mining Pty Ltd. The original intent was to export the waste but with very few details about the proposal being publicly available. Although this matter was referred to the Environmental Protection Authority of Western Australia initially the proposal to ship the PCBs overseas to a destination not at that time determined was to be assessed only at an internal level by the Department. However, in response to appeals by concerned citizens the Western Australian Minister for the Environment has determined that the proposal should be assessed publicly as a public environmental report. While the decision to conduct a formal public environmental assessment for the disposal of the PCBs is welcome, had it not been for the appeals by concerned Western Australians to the Minister it is unlikely that the assessment would have been public. I would like to point out that each individual citizen who wishes to put in this sort of appeal has to pay the price of $10. </PARA>
<PARA> A further concern about this proposal to dispose of PCB waste overseas is that at precisely the same time the Western Australian Government has been promoting the construction of a high temperature incinerator. I believe that the logical procedure at present is to ensure that intractable wastes such as PCBs are safely stored on site in Western Australia until an environmentally acceptable solution is found for their disposal. The transport of hazardous wastes over the long distances in Western Australia poses grave dangers which are not solved by the decision to construct an incinerator in the Eastern Goldfields. While the stockpile of PCB wastes is causing concern, Western Australia also has a problem with the storage and disposal of agricultural organochlorin chemicals. Following on from the detection of residues or organochlorin chemicals in Western Australia's beef for export, the Agriculture Department in Western Australia bought back farmers' supplies of these chemicals. I am reliably informed that these chemicals then became a storage and disposal problem for the Department of Agriculture. I am not sure that their disposal has been satisfactorily dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> The need to provide for the public to be well informed and have access to accurate information on the disposal of hazardous waste is paramount. The Bill before the chamber at present should overcome some of the deficiencies that concerned citizens are experiencing in Western Australia. Australia needs to set high standards for ensuring safe transit and disposal of intractable wastes. Equally important is the need to give more emphasis to ensuring that production of intractable wastes is, in the first instance, minimised. </PARA>
<PARA> While I believe that much stronger action needs to be taken by Australia in addressing this issue from the Western Australian perspective I support many of the provisions in the Bill. I welcome the legislation as a first step in improving accountability for transport of hazardous waste worldwide-a problem which has become more serious in recent years. However, I urge the Government, once it becomes a party to the Basel Convention, to use its good reputation to strengthen the Basel Convention so that it more truly reflects the rising community concerns about disposal and transport of hazardous waste. I join with my Democrat colleague Senator John Coulter in stating that if this is not achieved it may be that the positive aspects of the legislation will be nullified by some sections which could lead to more problems than exist in Australia at present with regard to the transport and disposal of hazardous waste. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Puplick referred to the 90-day question during his contribution earlier. I would like to address that first. I think the first point that needs to be made is that the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Bill 1989 has been arrived at after literally years of consultation between government and industry. We did not pluck the 90-day figure out of the air without considerable care. I believed that there was no real dispute about this until comparatively recently. I think some people in the industry got a bit windy that perhaps they had given too much. Obviously, it does place some burden on them in that it will be to their advantage in notifying to include in the statement every possible piece of information. That is important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When one tries to extend that 90-day period obviously the director, a senior person appointed by the Governor-General, will be responsible for making a decision. Given that any decision the director is to make is reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and subject to queries from the Ombudsman, I doubt very much whether the director will not take that sort of responsibility lightly and leave himself or herself open to a successful challenge. Written into the provisions of the Bill is a sufficient restraint upon the activities of the director in that respect. In any event, I think it is also the case that, if the notifier has included all the relevant information in the first place, there is no reason for the assessment to take 90 days on every occasion. In fact, I am advised that it can take much less. Indeed, the Government would aim to have it take much less. Obviously, 90 days is for those difficult assessments. Given the sorts of chemicals referred to in the debate there are obviously plenty of those. Every time this matter gets debated I hear about some new ones. I am very confident that the 90-day rule will not be a hindrance to industry or to those doing the assessing. Rather, it will focus their minds on the job. At the end of the day the decision is reviewable. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to the committee stage I should also like to indicate that the amendment proposed by Senator Coulter touches on the reversal of the onus of proof. I find that to be of concern. I hope that the Australian Democrats and the Opposition have considered that in indicating their support for the amendment. I am always concerned about reversals of onus. It is a point that I will make when we get to the committee stage. I certainly share most of the concerns raised by Senator Coulter and Senator Jenkins. There are considerable difficulties that we all face with chemicals in the coming years. Whether I should propose the use of the corporations power to regulate every step in the process as Senator Coulter suggests is one point on which we might disagree. I would have thought that it would be very difficult to get the sort of cooperation that we have been able to get from the States in a Bill such as this. It must be remembered that I mentioned consultation with industry; the States have been right through this process. I think I have rattled the odd sabre about Commonwealth power but I hope not without purpose. I am a long way from being convinced that the States do not share the concern of the Democrats and my concern about some of these very dangerous substances. I hope that there will be no need for us to act in the manner in which the Democrats have prescribed in the future. I have been reminded that I should have tabled the revised explanatory memorandum. I neglected to do so, so I take this opportunity to do so. </PARA>

<PARA> Page 3, clause 4, definition of ``hazardous waste'', before paragraph (a) insert the following new paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(aa) wastes that belong to any category contained in Annex 1 to the Basel Convention (a copy of the English text of which annex is set out in the Schedule), unless they do not possess any of the characteristics contained in Annex III to that Convention; or''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats have only one amendment to clause 4 of the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill 1989. The amendment, which has been circulated, deals with the definition of hazardous waste. I think it is worth while reading out the words which are in the Bill at the moment. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>`hazardous waste' means:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) waste that has any of the characteristics mentioned in Annex III to the Basel Con- vention . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill then explains that a copy of the English text is attached and it continues:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) household waste; or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) residues arising from the incineration of household waste;</PARA>
<PARA>When we turn to the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal we find a number of annexes attached to it. Annex I, which is headed `Categories of Wastes to be Controlled', lists a number of what it calls `waste streams' and it goes on to refer to wastes having as constituents certain things. Annex II, which is headed `Categories of Wastes Requiring Special Consideration', contains only two entries:</PARA>
<PARA> Wastes collected from households</PARA>
<PARA> Residues arising from the incineration of household wastes. </PARA>
<PARA>Annex III, which is headed `List of Hazardous Characteristics', has a number of characteristics such as explosives, flammable liquids, flammable solids, et cetera, and it concludes-and this is interesting-with ecotoxics under paragraph H12, which is a lovely term which I wish we used more in Australian legal circles. Paragraph H12 states:</PARA>
<PARA>Ecotoxic Substances or wastes which if released present or may present immediate or delayed adverse impacts to the environment by means of bioaccumulation and/or toxic effects upon biotic systems. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a lovely characteristic but it is very hard to prove exactly. Similarly, paragraph H11 states:</PARA>
<PARA>Toxic (Delayed or chronic)</PARA>
<PARA>Substances or wastes which, if they are inhaled or ingested or if they penetrate the skin, may involve delayed or chronic effects, including carcinogenicity. </PARA>
<PARA>Only a week or so ago we were debating the Smoking and Tobacco Products Advertisements (Prohibition) Bill. In the course of that debate I think all honourable senators were reminded about the rearguard action which has been fought for years and years by the tobacco industry over whether tobacco posed a carcinogenic hazard for humans. Also in recent weeks we have been looking again at asbestos and we have a long history of legal battles in this country in relation to whether asbestos poses a hazard to human health, particularly in relation to carcinogenicity, with companies battling very hard to attempt to establish that neither of those substances was carcinogenic. With my long experience, both in the environment movement and as a research scientist, a combination of those things has brought me into conflict with chemical company after chemical company over the years as to whether their chemicals posed precisely that sort of hazard. </PARA>
<PARA> Some honourable senators may recall my raising, in the context of agricultural chemicals, the substance dibromochloropropane (DBCP). I made the claim in this place that DBCP caused sterility in male rats and that was known to the Dow Chemical Co. as early as 1960, that it failed to make that information available and, as a result, a number of workers in the Occidental Chemical Corporation in California became sterile in the mid-1970s and this eventually led to the banning of DBCP. I have a very strong note from the Dow Chemical Co. saying that that original paper in 1960 did not show sterility in male rats. I went back and had a look at that paper and found that that paper showed that the testes of those male rats simply atrophied. It did not exactly show that the chemical caused sterility, but simply that the male rats' testes atrophied. So I have decades of experience in arguing with chemical companies as to whether their agents posed precisely the sorts of hazards that are talked about in category 3. </PARA>
<PARA> Going back to the Bill which is before us, `hazardous waste' means:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) waste that has any of the characteristics mentioned in Annex III to the Basel Convention-</PARA>
<PARA>in other words, wastes which are defined by way of characteristics-</PARA>
<PARA> (b) household waste; or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) residues arising from the incineration of household waste;</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, paragraphs (b) and (c) contain the exact words which are in Annex II of the Basel Convention. I am seeking, by way of amendment, merely to put in all the words which are in the Basel Convention; in other words, I am seeking to include Annex I. As I have said, Annex I is entitled `Categories of Waste to be Controlled'. Clearly, the Basel Convention anticipates that those substances are to be controlled. Moreover, Annex I defines those substances by way of their chemical composition. For instance, if we look at paragraph Y19 we find:</PARA>
<PARA> Y19 Metal carbonyls</PARA>
<PARA> Y20 Beryllium; beryllium compounds</PARA>
<PARA>And so it goes on down the list. We also find a reference to thallium, lead, mercury, tellurium, phenols and organic solvents. Paragraph Y45 refers to organohalogen compounds. The whole class of organohalogen compounds are included in Annex I and there is no argument then as to whether they are hazardous wastes. But if we turn to Article 1 of the Convention we find:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Wastes that belong to any category contained in Annex I, unless they do not possess any of the characteristics contained in Annex III;</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) is quite right in saying that that, in a sense, implies a reversal of the onus of proof. But, given the experience that we have had over a long period with arguments as to whether a substance poses a hazard, if we are to define things by characteristics-that is, by Annex III-surely it makes a great deal more sense to put in those classes of things which most disinterested scientists would accept as hazardous. The onus is on the person who wants to claim that those substances are not hazardous to establish that they do not have the characteristics of Annex III. For example, someone might be wanting to import or export a halogenated or organic solvent such as dioxins. Dioxins are a whole class of compounds. The one that is most well categorised is the so-called 2378-TCDD. We know a lot about the toxicity of that. But there are tens of other dioxins which are not so well characterised. I would stake my reputation on the fact that all of them pose similar threats, but perhaps to a varying degree, to human health and to the environment. Suppose somebody wants to dispose of a different dioxin, not the particular one that has been dealt with so much in relation to 2,4,5-T and other chemical processes: that substance would be included because we are wanting to include Annex 1. The onus would be on the person who wanted to import or export it that that substance did not pose a carcinogenic hazard or any of the other characteristics which are mentioned in Annex 3. That is precisely the way it should be. We should not be putting ourselves in the position that we have been in for years and years, in relation to those poor unfortunate workers who were exposed to asbestos in Western Australia-having to fight through the courts for compensation. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a reasonable situation in which we should be looking to reversal of the onus of proof, recognising that we should not be extending to chemicals the sorts of rights that we extend to human beings. We are dealing with chemicals, not human beings. Those chemicals should be categorised by class, and the onus should be on the establishment by those who would import or export those things that they do not have those characteristics which are mentioned in Annex 3. I cannot more strongly support the change which we want to make to the definition of hazardous wastes so that that definition is brought absolutely word for word into line with the Basel Convention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will support Senator Coulter's amendment. I will just recite briefly a little of the history of the development of this amendment. Some days ago Senator Coulter circulated an amendment to propose a change in the definition of hazardous waste. That original amendment read:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>categories of waste included in Annex I to the Basel Convention (a copy of the English text of which annex is set out in the Schedule);</PARA>
<PARA>I indicated at that stage that I was persuaded by some of the arguments put to me by the Minister's advisers and departmental officials that, in fact, that may involve regulation of a greater number of substances and more classes of substances than was really intended, and that, in addition, the Commonwealth was laying itself open to some difficulties in terms of being required to enforce regulations which were not really appropriate. I indicated, therefore, that in that first formulation the Opposition was not in a position to support Senator Coulter's amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> However, when we looked at Article 1 of the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, which appears on page 41 of the primary document, we found under the heading `Scope of the Convention' that Article 1 reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The following wastes that are subject to transbounary movement shall be ``hazardous wastes'' for the purposes of this Convention:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Wastes that belong to any category contained in Annex I, unless they do not possess any of the characteristics contained in Annex III; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Wastes that are not covered under paragraph (a) but are defined as, or are considered to be, hazardous wastes by the domestic legislation of the Party of export, import or transit. </PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to deal with categories of waste contained in Annex II, wastes which are radioactive, and wastes which derive from the normal operations of a ship. It was the view of the Opposition that this legislation should be brought more properly into line with the scope of the Convention as defined; that Article 1 subclause 1 (a) should in fact stand in the same words in the Bill as it does in the Convention. It is for that reason that Senator Coulter re-drew his amendment so that it now reflects accurately the words in Article 1:</PARA>
<PARA>wastes that belong to any category contained in Annex I to the Basel Convention . . . unless they do not possess any of the characteristics contained in Annex 3 to that Convention;</PARA>
<PARA>As to the second part of Article 1, paragraph 1(b)-`Wastes that are not covered under paragraph (a)'-such wastes are now defined within the legislation and therefore that is taken care of. Wastes that belong to any category contained in Annex II-which is the second major part of Article 1 of the Basel Convention-are covered in the definitional clause, which departs slightly from the exact wording of Annex II of the Basel Convention and in fact does so in a more expansive fashion, because hazardous waste is defined on page 3 of the Bill as:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) household waste; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) residues arising from the incineration of household waste;</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, the element of the wastes that have been collected, which is a test which is apparent in Annex II to the Basel Convention in its simpler form, has been refined in terms of the definition and in fact refined in a way which actually expands the definition. Annex II, headed `Categories of Wastes Requiring Special Consideration', provides:</PARA>
<PARA> Y46 Wastes collected from households</PARA>
<PARA> Y47 Residues arising from the incineration of household wastes</PARA>
<PARA>The formulation in the definition section of this Bill is slightly clearer and indeed somewhat wider in its scope. The other two areas contained in Article 1 of the Basel Convention-radioactive wastes, which I dealt with in the course of my speech on the second reading, and the wastes which derive from normal operations of a ship-are dealt with under all of the conventions which we have about pollution of the high seas, the MARPOL Convention, which is the international Convention for Prevention of Pollution from Ships, and the legislation which regulates the discharge of wastes from ships and vessels on the high seas, and are therefore adequately covered. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept the Minister's characterisation, in some respects, that this is a bit of a belt and braces job. I do not believe, however, that it in any sense detracts from the overall operation. I am conscious of some of the legal arguments that have been put about enforcement. I select the word `conscious' quite deliberately. I am conscious in that I am aware of what they are; I do not pretend for one moment actually to understand entirely what they mean. They have been put to me by a most erudite and learned adviser of the Minister. It is not her fault that after a very considerable period I am not altogether sure that she was saying anything to me other than, `You cannot trust judges'. If in fact that was what was being said, I certainly understand it, have sympathy with it and entirely agree with it. If the point was intended to be more refined and sophisticated, I simply have to apologise for my ignorance in these particular matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the amendment which Senator Coulter has moved does, I think, two things. Firstly, it brings the definitional section of this legislation more closely into line with that which is adopted throughout the whole of the Basel Convention. Secondly, it gives us the capacity to ensure that there are no loopholes created in the way in which this Act might operate. Thirdly, I do not believe that it imposes any additional burden by way of regulatory requirements on the Commonwealth or anybody else or, indeed, that it imposes any tests upon the importers or exporters of hazardous chemicals that it is not legitimate to impose. Under those circumstances the Opposition will support Senator Coulter's amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not propose to oppose the thrust of Senator Coulter's amendment. I do not believe it will ensure that one piece of material would come to our notice that would not have come under the definitions contained in the Bill. The characteristics in Annex III are more than adequate to cover every bit of waste about which Senator Coulter may have concern. I mentioned earlier my concern about the question of onus which I think should be repeated. I listened intently to what Senator Coulter said about onus of proof. Honourable senators should remember that the amendment, in part, reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Wastes that belong to any category contained in Annex I . . . unless they do not possess any of the characteristics contained in Annex III . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That represents a pretty strong reversal of the onus of proof. In spite of what Senator Coulter might feel, had the Government put this amendment the Scrutiny of Bills Committee would have jumped all over us and we would have been forced to amend. To that end I do not believe that this amendment in its current form ought to be proceeded with. The amendment should be modified to read:</PARA>
<PARA>Waste within any category listed in Annex I to the Basel Convention (a copy of the English text of which annex is set out in the Schedule), which has any of the characteristics mentioned in Annex III to the Basel Convention; or . . . </PARA>
<PARA>If that is done there is no reversal of onus. The main thrust of Senator Coulter's amendment is carried through, whatever the thrust is. I do not really think it will make any difference, but it does not do any harm so I am not opposed to it. That ought to happen. By the way, it ought to be put in immediately after existing paragraph (a) rather than just before it, for the sake of tidiness. That makes more sense as it would come after the larger class of which it is a subset. I think Senator Coulter ought to propose that; I do not think it would be a problem for him. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think I have drawn this to Senator Puplick's attention yet but a small consequential amendment to subclause 62 (2) is needed which will enable us to amend Annex I as well as Annex III. This is small beer but as long as we are to have the first amendment, we need the second. Perhaps it would be of advantage if I could get an indication of whether there is any support for not having this reversal of onus. If there is no support for it, I do not intend to press the matter. I just think it makes more sense. It certainly adds up to compliance with the procedures which the Senate has been observing ever since I have been here and I hope for the 80-odd years before that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition I will speak on the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 and the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1989. The Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, which deals with the sentencing of federal offenders, has been a long time coming. It goes back to a reference given to the Australian Law Reform Commission in August 1978 and is based on report No. 44 which the Commission released in early 1988, some 10 years later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> People who commit federal offences are dealt with by the courts in the State or Territory in which they have offended. The range of penalties available is that which is provided by the State or Territory. A person sentenced to imprisonment for a federal offence serves the term in a State prison, as there are no federal prisons for the simple reason that there are not enough federal prisoners to justify an exclusively federal institution. Because such prisoners are relatively few in number, there has been no federal law to regulate federal prisoners. They have always been covered by the law of the State in which they are incarcerated. State laws about imprisonment are continually being changed and modified, with the obvious result that administrative measures have been increasingly required to keep the terms of imprisonment of federal prisoners in line with State regimes so that federal prisoners are not disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most important themes of the Law Reform Commission's report is the concept of truth in sentencing. The rationale of this concept was explained in the report as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Under the present system, a substantial sentence of imprisonment may be imposed by the court, yet it is generally understood that the offender will be released on parole long before the period is served. Remissions further reduce this period. This had led to public disquiet and the procedure having been judicially described as an `elaborate charade'. </PARA>
<PARA>`Truth in sentencing' means that there should be a consistent and recognisable relationship between the sentence of imprisonment imposed by the court and the actual time served behind bars. This seems to be a sensible concept, and the Opposition supports it. </PARA>
<PARA> The first provision of the Bill that I would like to discuss is proposed new section 16a, which sets out the matters to which a court is to have regard in sentencing a federal offender. The Bill, as originally introduced, provided that the court must choose the least severe type of sentence, and then pass the least severe sentence or order appropriate in all the circumstances. It is interesting to note that this is not what the Law Reform Commission recommended in its report. Recommendation No. 2 stated:</PARA>
<PARA>there must be an appropriate degree of severity in the range of punishments available so that the community can be rationally satisfied that a breach of the criminal law is attended by significant consequences; and</PARA>
<PARA>the punishment imposed for a particular offence must be just, that is, of a severity appropriate to the offence. </PARA>
<PARA>This is evidently not the same as the statement made in the Bill that the court must pass the least severe sentence appropriate in all the circumstances. Therefore, we moved an amendment in the other place which, I am pleased to say, was accepted by the Government. Pursuant to this amendment a court will be obliged to impose a sentence or make an order that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence. </PARA>
<PARA> Further guidance is given to the court by way of a list of matters which it must take into account. I think it is worthwhile, on this occasion, mentioning these factors. They are: the nature and circumstances of the offence; other offences to be taken into account; the course of conduct, if the offence is part of one; the personal circumstances of any victim; injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence; the offender's degree of contrition; a guilty plea; cooperation with law enforcement bodies; a deterrent effect on the offender; the need to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence; the offenders' character, antecedents, age, means, physical and mental condition; prospects of rehabilitation; and the probable effect of the sentence on the offender's family or dependants. Many of these factors are already taken into account, to differing extents, by sentencing courts. We support the move to have the criteria set out in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> However, one aspect which concerns us is that the provision with respect to victims does not go far enough. The court is not required to have regard to what the victim says about the offence. Therefore, I will be moving an amendment to the Bill to allow the victim to inform the court of his or her personal circumstances and of any injury, loss or damage so that the court can take these matters into account when imposing a penalty. Such provisions are now part of the law in my home State of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also makes other provisions in relation to sentencing. For example, a court is required to take the financial circumstances of a person into account before imposing a fine. Also, corporal punishment may not be imposed. The non-parole period is to be determined by the court and it should be generally so fixed in cases where the offender is sentenced to more than three years imprisonment. In line with the principle of `truth in sentencing', the non-parole period is not to be reduced by remissions. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this Bill, it will still be possible for prisoners to be released on licence by the Attorney-General, whether or not a non-parole period has been fixed. We find it somewhat strange that, after having established the principle that prisoners should not be eligible for release during their non-parole period, the old system of release on licence should be retained. Since this effectively means that prisoners may be released during their non-parole period, this seems to undermine the principle. In other words, it goes against the whole notion of `truth in sentencing'. There will also be an obligation on the court when it imposes a federal sentence on a person and fixes a non-parole period, to explain the purpose and consequence of fixing that non-parole period. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of the Bill which concerns us is the provision for automatic parole upon the expiry of the non-parole period of offenders whose sentences are between three and 10 years. Where the sentence is more than 10 years, release is at the discretion of the Attorney-General. This seems to us to be contrary to the whole concept of parole. We would argue that, upon the expiry of the non-parole period, a prisoner should become eligible for parole no matter what the length of his sentence is. In this way there is some incentive for a prisoner to be of good behaviour while in prison. To put the matter quite simply, we do not believe that release on parole should be automatic. For this reason, we will be moving two amendments to the effect that release on parole should be, in all cases, at the discretion of the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Bill, the courts are given a range of sentencing options. Apart from imprisonment, they may order discharge without conviction, a conditional release after conviction or alternatives such as community service orders. The Bill also contains a number of provisions relating to mentally ill offenders. Those provisions institute procedures available in the event of a defendant being found unfit to be tried. There is also an important provision relating to offenders who are acquitted on the grounds of mental illness. The Bill states that the court is to order the person's detention in a prison or hospital for a specified period, which does not exceed the maximum period of imprisonment that could have been imposed for that particular offence. A range of sentencing alternatives is provided for offenders in cases where the court is satisfied that they are suffering from a mental illness, and that the illness contributed to the commission of the offence. </PARA>
<PARA> Hospital orders are available where the court would have sentenced the person to imprisonment; psychiatric probation orders can be made by the court, without passing sentence, requiring a mentally ill offender to reside at or attend a specified place of treatment; and intellectually disabled offenders may be required to attend a treatment or education program. The Opposition supports those measures and hopes they will provide the courts with a greater degree of the flexibility that they so desperately need in dealing with psychiatrically ill and intellectually disabled offenders. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also amends the Cash Transactions Reports Act and the Opposition is supporting the bulk of these amendments-although I must say that we have some difficulty with the provision for the Attorney-General to declare a class of persons as acceptable referees. The Australian Federation of Credit Unions Ltd has made representations to the effect that credit unions, among other such organisations, should be consulted before acceptable referees are gazetted. Its point is that some consultation would be desirable. We are pleased that the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen), in the other place, agreed with this point during debate on the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The final matter that caused us some concern under the provisions of the Cash Transactions Reports Act was that which was included in Government amendment No. 10 in the debate in the House of Representatives. That amendment set out under new paragraphs (7) and (8) a procedure that requires cash dealers to carry out a prescribed verification procedure for the purpose of identifying the signatory to an account. It was not apparent, and as far as I know it is still not apparent, what would be the details of such regulations and exactly what the procedures would be. It is suggested, I understand, that they would include a check on the electoral roll, the examination of a primary identification document and a check with the signatory's employer. We expressed concern in the other place about doing this by regulation and compromised on the basis of an undertaking by the Attorney-General that the detail of the proposed regulations would be produced to the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Brown, for his consideration and comment before the regulations were introduced into the House. I remind the Government of that, as I understand my colleague Mr Brown is still to receive details of the proposed regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> Subject to that, and subject to the amendments that I have outlined and which I will be moving in the committee stage of this debate, we support the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). We think some of its provisions should have been incorporated within federal law a long time ago; it is just that the Law Reform Commission's taking 10 years to report has somewhat prolonged the procedure. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Bill being dealt with in this cognate debate is the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1989. This Bill started off as an omnibus Bill, containing some 20 pages of amendments to a number of Acts covered by the Attorney-General's portfolio. Most of the amendments are of a formal nature and they do not require comment in this debate. Nevertheless, a number are important and I would want to make mention of them. In relation to telephone offences, two new offences are incorporated, I think within amendments to the Crimes Act, which will outlaw, firstly, unauthorised call switching devices that are used by illegal bookmakers and others to divert calls and thus prevent detection and, secondly, the actual equipment with which illegal telephone interceptions are effected. The Opposition supports those changes to the law. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to telephone interceptions, the Bill will allow designated technical officers employed by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) to give technical assistance when telephone interceptions are being carried out. We do not object to that in principle. We understand there will be circumstances in which the assistance of technical officers will be valuable. We do, however, indicate a concern that the clause is too wide as it allows, again, classes of persons to be declared as designated technical officers as well as named individuals. I propose to move an amendment in this place-an amendment was moved in the other House, but it was unsuccessful-to omit the reference to classes of persons. It seems to us more appropriate that, when we are dealing with the subject of telephone interceptions, the individuals being given special powers are named individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> I now mention changes in relation to the Privacy Act. Officers of the ombudsmen around Australia will be authorised to review and handle privacy complaints on behalf of the Privacy Commissioner to enable the Privacy Commissioner to have an Australia-wide presence. We support that. I raise also the important subject of evidence prejudicial to security, measures in regard to which we support. Nevertheless, because of its consequence we should specify our support in this particular debate. The Act allows evidence taken in Australian courts to be used in proceedings in foreign courts. The amendment proposes that the Attorney-General may make an order prohibiting the production of a document or the giving of evidence or information that would prejudice Australia's security. The Federal Court may enforce compliance with the order. That reform to ensure Australia's security has, as I indicated, our support. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the omnibus Bill, as was presented to this chamber, we had little concern except for the definition of those technical officers that are given powers to assist the AFP in telephone interceptions. The matter was then complicated, however, by the Government introducing substantial amendments to its own Bill; amendments which I do not think have even reached the other place yet. We object to this procedure. The Government has had all year to determine the contents of its omnibus Bill and there was no reason, other than a failure on its own part, to have not incorporated all that it wished to deal with in this particular calendar year within the piece of legislation that was first introduced in the House of Representatives. In fact, I am advised by my colleague, the shadow Attorney-General that he had asked on a number of occasions whether there were any further amendments contemplated, and had always been advised in the negative. </PARA>
<PARA> What concerns us more is that some of the Government's amendments to its own Bill are of a substantial nature and are not really the type of amendments that are of a formal nature or procedural nature which we normally find included within a Bill of this type. They are much more appropriately dealt with by separate legislation. We would submit that that is the correct way in which the matter should have been progressed. Nevertheless, the Government having determined to amend its own Bill in this very substantial way, we have had to address whether we can support the Government's amendments to its own Bill. Generally speaking, we are prepared to do so. We again have some amendments which I will mention in a moment. These additional amendments make changes to the Australian Federal Police Act; they set out procedures for the use of listening devices by the AFP in relation to certain offences other than narcotic offences; they make changes to the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Act 1979; they exempt the transfer of personal information from Commonwealth bodies to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation from the provisions of the Privacy Act 1988; and they make changes to the Customs Act, the Judiciary Act and the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to mention briefly the areas of particular concern that we have. The first relates to the proposed amendments to the Australian Federal Police Act 1979. The Government is seeking to insert a new division into this Act which will regulate the use of listening devices by the Australian Federal Police in the investigation of non-narcotic offences. The proposed amendments are in the same terms as the provisions of the Customs Act 1901, dealing with the use of such devices in the investigation of narcotic offences. Overall, we believe that the provisions should be supported, but we are concerned by the breadth of the definition that will permit telephone interception and the gathering of evidence by telephone interception. The fact that similar wording has been used in previous pieces of legislation does not deter us from raising the matter in this particular instance. I think it is fair to say that it has been a trend of recent times to extend very rapidly the capacity of law enforcement bodies in this country to use telephone interception devices in the gathering of evidence. There was a time when it was regarded as a last resort. We rapidly seem to be approaching the situation where it is regarded as just a normal method of gathering of evidence or the investigation of an alleged crime. We in no way wish to take any action that would in any way counter the responsibility of effective law enforcement, but we are concerned by the continuing extension of powers in this area and as a longer term issue we intend to review it in some depth. </PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned that this particular amendment gives power not only in relation to a number of very serious offences, but also in relation to what might be described as less serious offences-they are described as class 2 general offences-which carry a penalty of seven years imprisonment or more, and which involve certainly loss of life, which is very serious, right down to loss of revenue and, in the case of the Australian Capital Territory, loss of revenue to the Australian Capital Territory Government. We think the generic expression of offences that permits the AFP to use telephone interception devices is unsatisfactory and specific offences should be stated in the legislation. Therefore, in the committee stage we will be introducing an amendment that deletes this reference to class 2 general offences and we will call upon the Government to specify the offences that it claims justify giving these extra powers to our law enforcement officers. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not proposing amendments in regard to judicial immunity. This provision gives Federal judges the power to issue warrants authorising the use of listening devices and, in effect, bestows a non-judicial or administrative function upon the judicial officer. We accept that in these circumstances. With regard to the designated technical officers, I mentioned in relation to the Government's principal Bill that we would be seeking an amendment. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have noted the comments by the Executive Director of Robe River, Fred Madden, as reported in the West Australian of 16 December. I received a letter from him on 13 December in which he expressed his views on what I had said, along with the Deputy Premier of Western Australia, the Honourable David Parker, as a co-chairman of the West Australian Iron Ore Industry Consultative Council. The startling thing in what Mr Madden has put is that he has not directly answered the matter raised by me and Mr Parker, namely, that, in order to attend a meeting of this consultative body, shop stewards at Robe River sought leave without pay. They were told that leave without pay would not be provided and that they could apply for leave only if they applied for holidays. They sought to have three days of their holidays put aside so that they could conduct union business. They were then told that holidays would be granted only in five-day lots. They then applied for a five-day lot and were ruled out because, they were told, they needed to give a month's notice. That fact has not in any sense been rebutted by Robe River. Given that it has taken the trouble to write to me, to put out a flurry of press releases on the issue and has not answered that point, I guess it is confirmation that it recognises that that point is true.

Robe is an unabashed admirer of removing the dignity of ordinary workers by intimidatory tactics in the work place, of obtaining compliance by intimidation. That is a central plank in the H. R. Nicholls Society view of how industrial relations should be worked out in Australia. It is one that is not practised in the iron ore industry by any company other than Robe River. If diminishing the human dignity of ordinary workers were to catch on as a method of conducting industrial relations, this country would be diminished as well. In respect of the claims of increased productivity, in Robe's case they are true but, as we have seen in history, certain regimes can make trains run on time through the use of particular strategies of maintaining discipline in their own communities.</PARA></TALK.START>

I refer him to statements made by the Chairman of Darling Downs TV Ltd that aggregation is rapidly developing into a national catastrophe-they were his words-and that the station is seeking legal advice to prevent aggregation going ahead. Is it a fact that almost a month ago the Minister for Transport and Communications received advice from the Solicitor-General that the network affiliation agreements were illegal but, as usual, the Minister has done nothing about the issue? Is it correct that, as a result of the Minister's policy of drift, a delegation of regional operators is seeing the Minister tomorrow in a desperate attempt to have the Government at least defer the aggregation timetable? Is the Government aware that a major report on the impact of aggregation on regional television is about to be released which is believed to indicate that eight out of the 12 regional operators will make losses in aggregated markets for the foreseeable future? In view of the almost universal concern that aggregation is on the verge of becoming yet another unmitigated broadcasting disaster of this Government, will the Minister for Transport and Communications announce a complete review of this disastrous policy?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commonwealth does not have constitutional power to enact a general crimes statute, as is well known in this chamber. At present, Commonwealth criminal laws deal only with specific areas of Commonwealth responsibility, for example, drug importation, currency offences, stealing or damaging Commonwealth property, fraud against the Commonwealth, and so on. Each of the States has its own criminal statute, three States having adopted comprehensive criminal codes many years ago, and the Northern Territory more recently. The others rely on statutes which modify the common law in varying degrees. There is considerable variation between each jurisdiction, particularly with respect to levels of penalties. There are also variations in principles of responsibility, the elements of some offences and defences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While there could be considerable benefit in a uniform system, the States have shown no enthusiasm for such an approach. From time to time, particular criminal law issues are considered by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General-for example, computer offences-but it is generally left to each State to legislate in the context of its own laws. It might be noted that the question of penalties is closely linked to that of sentencing and the treatment of offenders, which are State matters.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has been giving priority to the review of Commonwealth criminal law and has set up for that purpose a review committee chaired by former Chief Justice Sir Harry Gibbs. It is expected that this project, the first comprehensive revision of Commonwealth offences since Federation, will lead to a greatly improved criminal statute book at the Federal level. It should also be noted that the Commonwealth has put considerable effort into reforming the general criminal law in relation to the Australian Capital Territory and that even after ACT self-government the Commonwealth will have responsibility for general criminal law in particular situations: for example, some other Territories, on board aircraft and in relation to Defence Force personnel. However, the development of a uniformed national system is not feasible unless the States agree to cooperate towards that end.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Government viewed with obvious interest the recent official visit to China by the United States national security adviser and deputy secretary of State, but it is not really for us to comment on that visit; that is a matter for the United States and China. The idea of a visit by Mr Whitlam was suggested following the recent visit by former United States President Nixon. The Government has no plans at this time to send Mr Whitlam to China as an unofficial envoy. However, there are at least two outstanding invitations for a visit to China by Mr Whitlam in his capacity as chairman of the Australia-China Council.

The question of Australia's low level of binding was raised at the review. That is a technical matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One week and one day ago at approximately this time, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, on behalf of Australia, signed with Minister Ali Alatas of Indonesia the Zone of Cooperation Agreement between Australia and Indonesia on the Timor Gap. As a consequence of that treaty, which means that there is now a zone of cooperation in the Timor Sea about the size of Tasmania, it falls on me, as the Minister for Resources, and Dr Ginandjar Kartasasmita, as the Indonesian Minister for Mines and Energy, to conclude the details under the heads of that agreement to make possible exploration and, hopefully, production in the Timor Sea zone of cooperation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first step for the Government in Australia will be to bring before the Parliament in the autumn session legislation amending several Acts of this Government to give force to the treaty. I understand that the Indonesians have a parliamentary session commencing in January and that they will do the same. We will put $A2.5m as a loan to a joint authority created between the two countries and Indonesia will match that as an operating basis for the joint authority, the loans to be repaid from fees gained from exploration companies. A joint Bureau of Mineral Resources-Indonesia survey will look at the prospect of taking a seismic survey over the area and we will look at how we divide zone A, the zone of cooperation, into 10 or 15 blocks. These will then be put out for bidding to oil exploration companies in Australia. It is our expectation that the first meeting of the joint ministerial council will be in the second half of 1990, from which we will call bids, and exploration ought to commence, by that timetable, in the first half of 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the other matters that I can comment on at this stage is that there were some companies, Australian in origin or registered in Australia and forming consortia with Australian companies, that had prior claims to areas in the disputed territory prior to 1975, when the seabed boundary debate began. In the case of those prior claims, it is agreed between Indonesia and Australia that favourable consideration will be given to those companies if they evince interest in bidding when the particular blocks come up at the time they are released.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been many specious claims about what is proposed for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and about this card. Indeed, Mr Matthews, speaking on behalf of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, has made allegations startlingly similar to the ones Senator Boswell has just enumerated. Perhaps not only can I tell Senator Boswell that those claims by Mr Matthews are as spurious as the claims inferred in his question, but also I can go to the detail of what is intended by the Health Insurance Commission. The HIC is simply looking at redesigning processing systems for pharmaceutical claims to overcome deficiencies identified in a report by the Auditor-General. It is because of the Auditor-General's identification of what he sees as deficiencies that the HIC is moving in the first place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The pharmacists have always submitted details of scripts filled as part of the claiming process. Over 50 per cent of claims are now submitted in computer form, with the full cooperation of the Guild, as well as the provision of hard copies of all scripts. It is difficult to see how pharmacists could expect to be paid for dispensing without providing to the Commonwealth details of what they do. All the HIC is looking at is how to improve the efficiency of this process. Indeed, one of the advantages is that it would facilitate prompter payments to pharmacists.</PARA>
<PARA> The HIC is holding discussions with the Guild on the proposed new system. The Government has made no decision on the proposal at this stage. It is waiting to look at the outcome of the consultations with the Guild before considering what it will then do.

If Senator Boswell wants to withdraw and rephrase his question he should do so. The HIC has made it clear to the Guild that the proposal involves no more data than the current long-established Pharmpay system. The proposal involves giving pharmacists the capacity to check entitlements to concessions and to process claims through devices connected to the HIC claims processing computers rather than having to send claims in floppy discs or to use computer dial-up facilities. The HIC proposals in no way change the responsibilities of pharmacists to give the Commonwealth more data. The Commonwealth has been receiving the scripts since the inception of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme over 30 years ago and the information has been used for the reimbursement of chemists.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only proposal that I am aware of is a proposal outlined in the Opposition's Economic Action Plan to cut 14 per cent off the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service's budget by reducing allocations to that Service by $10m and by changing the cost recovery provision from 60 per cent of costs incurred to 50 per cent of costs incurred, meaning in total a net reduction of between $23m and $26m or 14 per cent of the total budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was asked whether the Government is considering implementing such cuts. No, we are not. Such cuts do not recognise the fact that over the last five years, through economic stringency and fiscal responsibility, this Government has reduced total outlays to the Quarantine and Inspection Service by 30 per cent-that is a real reduction-in terms of inspection costs alone. It is harder to calculate the reduction in quarantine costs but overall there has been a significant reduction, and there is a better targeted, leaner, more efficient quarantine service as a consequence. I might add that we have conducted, by way of the Lindsay inquiry, a major review of the Quarantine Service. The report of that review has been supported by the farming interests in this country. We have implemented the report's findings in order to have a better Quarantine and Inspection Service.</PARA>
<PARA> If the 14 per cent reduction suggested by the Economic Action Plan were implemented, Australia would be at considerable risk because there would not be the financial wherewithal to mount an effective quarantine service. Thus there would be the prospect of importing exotic diseases and our rural products, be they wool, wheat, beef or horticultural, could be at considerable risk. Of course, these are Australia's major export earners. The Opposition is proposing a very dangerous policy which would have a major impact on our ability to operate not only as a world trader in agricultural products but also a consumer of safe, clean, healthy agricultural products.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator McMullan asked me whether I am aware of proposed taxation changes which, if implemented, might create the need for the cuts proposed in the Economic Action Plan. I am aware of the Opposition's proposal to abolish the capital gains tax and replace it with a speculative gains tax. I am also aware that the direct beneficiary of that would be John Elliott-to the tune of $18m. It can be said clearly that there would be a windfall gain by the President of the Liberal Party of Australia while at the same time Australia's Quarantine and Inspection Service would be put at risk.</PARA>

<PARA>MEDICARE LEVY</PARA>
<PARA> At a hearing of the Committee held on 10 October 1989 Senator Sheil asked a question about the number of people who are liable for payment of the Medicare levy but who may not be eligible for Medicare benefits. I undertook to seek advice on the matter from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) for the Committee's information.</PARA>
<PARA> The ATO has advised that it does not have the information requested. Overall it knows the number of people who pay the levy but more specific details of levy payers are not recorded. The ATO advises that it has no need to maintain such statistics for tax purposes because it has been solely concerned with the imposition and collection of the levy and not with eligibility for Medicare benefits.</PARA>
<PARA> The situation is that the Medicare levy is essentially a taxation measure which only partially finances health care in Australia, and its payment is not related to eligibility for Medicare benefits. It is an income related tax and not conceptually a health insurance premium.</PARA>
<PARA> The levy is governed by the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Medicare Levy Act 1986, whereas Medicare eligibility is established under the Health Insurance Act 1973. Liability for payment of the levy and entitlement to Medicare benefits are each determined by reference to a person's residency status. However, the respective sets of legislation do not contain a common definition of resident. I might add that the definition of ``Australian resident'' in the Health Insurance Act is substantially the same as that contained in other Federal social welfare legislation (eg the Social Security Act).</PARA>
<PARA> Circumstances may therefore arise where persons may be liable for the levy but are not eligible for Medicare benefits. Examples could include, persons visiting Australia as working holidaymakers; visiting entertainers and sportspeople; or other persons who may earn taxable income whilst temporarily in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Conversely, many people who do not pay the levy are eligible for Medicare benefits. Examples include, pensioners and others who either do not earn taxable income or whose income is below the threshold at which the levy is payable; overseas students whose studies in Australia are sponsored or subsidised by the Australian Government.</PARA>

I cannot say that I am aware that all of those are pending over national parks and reserves in Western Australia but I understand there are quite a number and I will accept her word for it. Senator Jenkins asked whether I know about the Western Australian Government closing the option of mining activity in national parks without the approval of both Houses of Parliament. Yes.

I am not actually aware of a proposal to mine inside the park. I will have to check the details for Senator Jenkins but I believe that my Department and the Western Australian Government have settled on a Western Australian Government environmental impact statement (EIS) procedure in which some of our ideas were included. I understand that that EIS procedure is still going on. I do not expect it to be completed for a few more months. That is certainly the indication Premier Dowding gave me when I saw him last week. I am not aware of any proposal for mining inside the D'Entrecasteaux National Park.

As to whether or not this Government is prepared to stand by and see national parks mined, the mere fact that both Houses of parliament in Western Australia have to approve of this occurring, and given the enormous public interest in questions of this kind, if there were to be any mining in the D'Entrecasteaux National Park in Western Australia or any other national park in Western Australia we would hear all about it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With respect to all but the last couple of seasons we have seen abnormally high prices. It can now be said that the market is likely to return to more usual trading levels. However, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) today released the December quarterly bulletin, the Agriculture and Resources Quarterly. Its forecast for wool exports in 1989-90 show a significant drop. The fall will be caused mainly by increases in auction offerings of wool as a result of large carryovers of stocks as well as increased production of shorn wool as a result of good seasonal conditions and larger sheep flocks. In addition, we have seen an increased world wool supply, combined with depressed wool demand, principally due to falling sales to China and to the Republic of Korea and Japan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Wool Corporation stocks are estimated to be at a record level of 2.1 million bales by the end of June 1990. The value of our wool exports in 1989-90 is expected to drop by $2 billion from $6 billion in 1988-89. However, significant increases in export returns for meat, dairy products, sugar and cotton will partly offset the deterioration in the wool market. When the selling season begins in late January it is expected that Japan, which traditionally takes about 22 per cent of our clip, will re-enter the market. If it does we will see an increase in prices as well.</PARA>
<PARA> According to ABARE the total value of rural exports for 1989-90 is expected to decrease by 6 per cent to $14.9 billion. On the other hand, it should be noted that minerals and energy sectors have shown considerable improvement. The forecast increase of mineral resource exports in 1989-90 is 15 per cent in September. It has been revised upwards to 18 per cent in the December quarterly bulletin. The value of total commodity exports is forecast to increase by 7 per cent in 1989-90 to $39 billion compared to a 6 per cent increase in 1988-89. Significant price rises are expected for iron ore, coal and petroleum and higher production levels are forecast for a wide range of minerals including crude oil, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, gold, base metals, nickel, coal and mineral sands. The Bureau sees the major reasons for the increase in production as due to substantial increases in new capital investment in the mining industry, reflecting the Government's view that much of the recent rise in the level of imports is due to the investment surge. While in the short term it is acknowledged that this rise in imports has a dramatic effect on the current account deficit, in the long run it will result in a better export performance as evidenced by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics forecasts.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This question deserves a fuller answer. The Government has recognised that the book trade was ripe and needed to be inquired into in terms of both the accessibility of books on the Australian market and the price of those books. The first report that we commissioned was the Shepherd report, a report on the copyright law in this area. That report came out some time in 1988. It noted the need to conduct an inquiry on the economic level of book prices. As a consequence the PSA inquiry canvassed those issues. It was made very clear from the PSA inquiry that Australian book buyers are charged more for books bought in this country than are consumers in other countries. By comparing our prices to those of books in Canada it was found that book prices may be 30 per cent more than is necessary. On the other hand, there are other arguments that Senator Puplick and the Senate are quite aware of. They are the arguments put forward quite forcefully by authors and book publishers that there is a need to protect their copyright in a real and meaningful way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those two major considerations have to be at the forefront of any Government deliberation. I am sure that, on the one hand, the interests of ensuring books are at the lowest possible price to consumers will be a major consideration. On the other hand, recognising a real need to protect authors' copyright will also be fully considered. Going back to the first part of Senator Puplick's question, I think the Government will make a decision in this area in the near future in the interests of both authors and book buyers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In order to answer this question adequately I think it is necessary to give a bit of background information. After the Department of Finance costings blew an $830m hole in the Opposition's Economic Action Plan, the honourable member for North Sydney thought up a stunt that he believed would help him get back onto the front bench, or he hoped it would anyway. He put in a freedom of information (FOI) request which implied freely that there was something improper about the Department of Finance doing the costings and that it was also most unusual for such costings to have been done. Anyway, he put in his freedom of information request, ultimately got a bill for $700 and was whinging endlessly in the House of Representatives on 28 November.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me demonstrate beyond any doubt that for the Department of Finance to do such costings was certainly not without precedent, nor was it improper. Indeed, I interpolate here to say that the Department of Finance, even without being asked, has, as a matter of course, costed propositions that have been put up by organisations other than the Opposition-by the National Farmers Federation, the Business Council of Australia and so on.</PARA>
<PARA> In order to put beyond any doubt that there were precedents and that there was nothing improper about it, I put in a request to the Department of Finance under the FOI Act for costings which had been done on the then Opposition's policies in 1980 and 1983 and I paid my deposit and expected to pay for all the rest. Mr Spender, however, made an official approach to the Department stating that the $700, or thereabouts, which he had been billed should be waived on public interest grounds. I saw today a recommendation from the Department that the request should be granted.

But it is true that, at the moment, at least people are on some warning that they do not have an automatic right to permanent residency just because they come here as visitors and subsequently marry. However, they have an automatic right to marry in this country and then migrate from another country to this country; that has not been imperilled in any way by these regulations. I stress that the great advantage that the honourable senator and others can now see of having these matters in regulations rather than in legislation is that they are readily amendable.

If the deferment of expenditure and permanent reductions in the size of a program are treated differently, what are the implications of each?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the contemporary jargon-I think it has been around for a long time; it probably stretches right back into the distant past when the Opposition was in government-a deferment is pushing expenditure, as the name clearly implies of course, which a government had at one stage planned to undertake in a current financial year into some subsequent financial year. In other words, a deferment is a change in the timing of expenditure and not a reduction in total expenditure; whereas a true savings or recurrent savings option is something that goes on, with savings accruing year after year. That is the essential difference. If a deferment, therefore, is portrayed as an ongoing saving it is a deception.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have one very recent example of this. A press release was put out yesterday by the honourable member for Bass regarding community development employment projects for Aboriginal communities. I had previously believed-along with everyone else, I suppose-that the `saving' in the Opposition's Economic Action Plan was an ongoing saving. But, according to the honourable member for Bass, that is not so. Mr Smith's press release of yesterday said:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Smith said that criticism by some that the coalition planned to cut back on CDEPs was totally unfounded. ``Payments to communities are to increase this year by $25m to a total of $98m. Our cut of $4 million will mean only a slight delay in getting additional communities into the scheme''.</PARA>
<PARA>A slight delay of the ongoing level of expenditure, according to Mr Smith yesterday, will of course be the same as is proposed by the present Government and is in the Forward Estimates. So, it is not a cut at all; it is a deferment. Many other so-called cuts, in the Opposition's Economic Action Plan have similar question marks hanging over them. As I said earlier today, an error of over $830m has already been identified. One wonders just how much that error might blow out beyond $830m-odd once everything is properly qualified and assessed. The last comment I want to make is that should something terrible happen in the first half of next year and the Opposition be elected, I wish Senator Stone well in his attempt to impose some fiscal discipline on a coalition government, but frankly, I do not think he will be able to do it.</PARA>

There are no immediate practical options for significantly improving Radio Australia's signal coverage to northern China from within Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment on two aspects of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy annual report for 1988-1989-the sections on forestry resources and water resources. The section headed `Forest resources' refers to the primary objectives of the Department's activities in the forestry area as being:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . to provide advice and manage programs which contribute to the efficient and sustainable development of Australia's forest resources and the promotion of environmentally sensitive management practices. </PARA>
<PARA>The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>It is mainly in co-operation with the States that the Commonwealth is able to advance its forest policy objectives. The peak forum for this is the Australian Forestry Council. </PARA>
<PARA>I comment on the situation with regard to the limited and over-exploited native forest resources of the south-west area of Western Australia. The Department's annual report refers to the intention to renew the export woodchip licence of WACAP-the West Australian Chip and Pulp Co.-for another 10 years to 1998 and to approve two new export licences for up to 110,000 tonnes of woodchips a year to February 1998. The renewal of woodchip licences and granting of new woodchip licences for the 10-year period is opposed by a large number of Western Australians. The clear-fell process which is associated with woodchipping is abhorrent to many Western Australians, including those who live and work in the forest areas. It has not been made clear to Western Australians whether the proposed pulp mill, which is supported by Premier Dowding-and in saying that I refer to a report in the West Australian newspaper of 10 August 1989 headed `Premier makes his stand on pulp mill'-and which is to be based on eucalypts is to be resourced by an additional supply of woodchips above and beyond that for which WACAP, Whittakers and McLeans have export licences, or whether the proposed eucalypt pulp mill in Western Australia is to replace the export of woodchips. Have the Department of Primary Industries and the Commonwealth and Western Australian governments already committed Western Australia to both? In addition, WACAP's plantations will be harvested by machines, which are imported mostly from Scandinavian countries. So I say that in an area short of jobs and in a country short on foreign exchange, this situation will not help. </PARA>
<PARA> The section of the report on water resources states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Department furthers objectives of the Commonwealth's water policy by:</PARA>
<PARA>ensuring the availability of water, adequate in quantity and quality, for all beneficial uses;</PARA>
<PARA>encouraging and enabling the adoption of measures which improve the efficiency and effectiveness of water supply and use; and</PARA>
<PARA>developing a comprehensive approach to inter-related water and land management issues. </PARA>
<PARA>As the States have the main Constitutional responsibility for the management and development of water resources, Commonwealth/State co-operative arrangements are central to advancing the Commonwealth's water policy objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, it is not unexpected that the objectives do not include the promotion of environmentally sensitive management practices. However, given the appalling water resource situation in Australia it may well be appropriate for the Department to enlarge its objectives in line with the growing community call for environmental protection. </PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia the protection of water resources, especially ground water, is inadequate and does not meet the Department's objectives. I refer in particular to recent proposals to drain the Jandakot ground water area south of Perth and the Gnangara water mound, which is north of the Perth metropolitan area. The area of environmental and conservation importance has been neglected for far too long. Already, some of Perth's ground water is polluted, and now is the time for the Commonwealth Government to act. I regret that the cooperative arrangements between the Commonwealth and the Western Australian Government can only be described as a dismal failure as far as the ground water resources of the Swan Coastal Plain are concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the annual report of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, I continue the remarks I made earlier today concerning the live sheep fiasco. Honourable senators will probably remember that in August the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC) decided to cease live sheep exports to Saudi Arabia because that country had rejected a couple of shipments on the ground that the sheep were diseased. It seems to me that the problem centres on the fact that the AMLC may have acted too hastily. The report shows the importance of this trade. It shows that Australia turns off about 28 million sheep a year, of which 13.1 million are slaughtered and 7.1 million are exported, representing annual export earnings of between $160m and $200m. It is unfortunate that the resolution of this matter is going nowhere; the Department of Primary Industries and Energy is getting nowhere; the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) seems to be getting nowhere.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I say, the Department and the Minister are getting nowhere because they have not even bothered to go there. I know that a high level delegation was sent to Saudi Arabia but when $200m worth of exports are involved, we need more than a high level delegation to go to Saudi Arabia to find out what the problem is. I am beginning to wonder what is happening. In hindsight I can now see that the AMLC may have been too hasty in cutting off this trade.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, perhaps it was at his suggestion. We all have 20:20 vision in hindsight, but perhaps the AMLC could have looked at continuing shipments to the Gulf but through another port while they tried to sort out the problem with the Saudis. The Saudis say that they have been insulted because we cut the sheep shipments without resolving the problem. Australia now cannot recommence those shipments. The people who have been forgotten in this situation are the sheep farmers who are faced with a loss this year of between $160m and $200m in sales. I repeat: nothing is being done. Why is the Minister not visiting Saudi Arabia? The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) flew over that area on his way to eastern Europe. We in this place suggested that while he was overseas he call in and try to do something. Obviously Senator Evans did not visit Saudi Arabia, or we would have heard about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Upon its return from Saudi Arabia, the high level delegation said that no progress had been made, that progress was impossible and that we may have lost the sheep export trade altogether. Having read an article in one of the newspapers last Friday entitled `Trade with Saudis doomed', I am beginning to believe that the trade is doomed. If that is the case I ask what the Minister and the Department have done to secure another outlet for the sheep. It will create a problem. Not only are numbers of export wethers already being held on properties, but the numbers are increasing to the production levels to satisfy the usual demand for exporting wethers, which is at its peak in July or August. That is not that far down the track. We will be in government by then and hopefully our Minister for primary industries will do more than the present one is doing. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an important issue that has to be addressed immediately. We should not have to wait continually. We have been told to be patient because the Saudis are people who are easily upset when they are not spoken to nicely. We have given the Government enough time to resolve the problem but still nothing has been done. I have a few suspicions that within Australia we may have been sabotaged as we were with the kangaroo meat scandal. Because the animal liberation groups have been very active I ask whether the problem is that we might have been sabotaged by people within Australia with respect to the diseased sheep issue. I know that this is a big accusation to make; but it is time that we got some answers. Perhaps the answer lies in that direction. We certainly are not getting answers from the delegation that went to Saudi Arabia, from our Ministers or from anyone else. The producers are sick and tired of being told to hang on and be patient while nothing is being done. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that this will be the second last report of the Joint Coal Board. The final report will be for the current period, following which the new Government will dismantle the Joint Coal Board. This is no reflection on Mr John Wilcox, the Chairman of the Board, for whom I have the highest regard. I do not have the same regard for the judgment of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) in pressing to maintaining an anachronistic body which simply wastes taxpayers' money without getting an adequate return. Like so many of the Government's activities, the Joint Coal Board fits into that pattern comfortably. It also provides a position of status to some members of the union movement who can be appointed members of the board. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem with this body is that it no longer has any reason to exist. It did have a reason to exist. The Board has done a couple of things well, for which I commend it. However, they could have been done in a totally different and much more efficient structure. The Board at present has no justification to exist. There is no doubt that in workers' compensation, for example, the Board has done an excellent job. Some assessments are that the Joint Coal Board has performed better than other workers compensation funds around Australia even though there is evidence of some cross-subsidising, which is inappropriate. The Board has also been very effective in its rehabilitation program which I know has been of significant benefit to the Burragorang Valley area that falls within my area of responsibility in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is that the Board's other activities simply do not justify its existence. As a result I am glad to say that the coalition parties intend to wipe out the Board after they win the next election. That is what the industry wants. The industry says that there is no reason for the continued existence of this body. As usual, the Government has taken no notice of the people who know what they are talking about and is determined to maintain the Board. The Chairman of the New South Wales Coal Association in his recent report on profitability results of the industry in the latest financial year said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the challenge for both the State and Federal Governments is to rationalise the outdated institutional framework involving the Joint Coal Board and the Coal Industry Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>The Joint Coal Board relates to no more than New South Wales any more, in any event. It is not joint in the sense that it involves joint State Government activities; it is joint only in the sense that it involves the New South Wales and the Federal Governments. The big question is whether or not the industry would do better without it. A massive submission from the industry asked the Government to wipe out the Board for a range of very sound reasons. If only we had the opportunity, we could debate these reasons. It is something that should be debated in the near future. It will certainly be debated when we introduce legislation to wipe out the Joint Coal Board in the New Year. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry recognises that the Joint Coal Board played an important and valuable role historically, contributing much to the industry; but the circumstances which justified that role have now changed significantly and the regulatory structure which existed in the past is no longer appropriate. The industry is just struggling out of serious losses into very modest profitability; I stress that it is modest profitability. That profitability would not have existed in New South Wales if it had not been for the fact that approximately $157m in non-interest bearing loans are held by coal companies operating in New South Wales. If normal interest rates had been applied to those loans, the industry would have incurred an overall loss. The reason is that average wage rates rose strongly in the second half of the year, rail freight charges rose by 5 per cent, port loader charges rose by 15.5 per cent at Balmain and 6.7 per cent at Port Kembla in June and the standard royalty rate rose by 25 per cent in August 1989. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This very important report relates to a whole range of Customs activities. In particular, the anti-drug activities are of enormous importance. I note that, as part of its anti-drug and other activities, the Australian Customs Service will make an announcement today about the contract for coastal surveillance. It has been reported in the press today that Skywest Aviation Ltd has won most of the five-year contract-estimated to be worth more than $70m-to run the Federal Government's expanded coastal surveillance service. That no doubt brings to an end the period of controversy that arose from the Amann Aviation fiasco. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not certain what this contract is really all about because, to my knowledge, the announcement has not yet been made. But I hope the Government will take the Senate into its confidence totally on this matter in view of the special sensitivities involved after the Amann situation. As the Senate will recall, Skywest took over the Coastwatch service two years ago after the Government cancelled its contract with Amann Aviation, after alleging that it had failed to meet its contractual obligations. Of course, we also remember that Amann won a Federal Court decision against the Government and was awarded $410,000 in damages. It had sought $23m in damages and is appealing against that decision. Naturally, I do not want to canvass that matter as it is now before the court. However, I think this dramatises the special need for the Government to give the Senate very full details about this contract. </PARA>
<PARA> It is vital for us to know whether the Hudson report, entitled Northern Approaches-A Report on the Administration and Management of Civil Coastal Surveillance in Northern Australia, which was brought down as a result of the problem with Amann Aviation, is being followed. Many deficiencies were identified by that report, including the lack of night-time surveillance. It is important that the Government should let us know about this as soon as possible-hopefully before we rise. As I said, the Customs Service will apparently be making an announcement today. This is a matter of very grave significance indeed. We will not be meeting again after this week until February and the Parliament ought to be given an opportunity to discuss this very significant matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to refer to responses which Estimates Committee E received about the Customs Service. I want to apologise to Customs officers who were in the chamber when I asked why I had not been provided with answers to my questions. Since then, the clerk of that committee has apologised to me because, in fact, those replies were with the Committee but had not been passed on to me. I have since discussed the matter with the Customs officers, and I thank them for their courtesy. </PARA>
<PARA> However, a clear problem emerges from those replies about security at Sydney Airport, and many of the answers-which I do not have time to deal with today-raise matters of major concern. For example, one vehicular exit gate can be opened without supervision simply by driving over a sensor pad at Sydney Airport and there are instances of large numbers of mail bags frequently being left out in the open overnight close to gates and fences. The Customs Service says that that is absolutely true. There was a request to the Minister that all documents relating to a Customs study of security at Sydney Airport-in particular, any report prepared by Customs staff at Sydney Airport, and copies of all correspondence between Customs, the Federal Airports Corporation and the Department of Transport and Communications relating to that report-should be released to the Committee. The Minister at that committee meeting declined that request. I think he ought to change his mind. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The election funding report in respect of the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly election of 4 March 1989 is remarkably small. In fact, it consists of four pages. Nonetheless, it is extremely interesting. It states as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Australian Electoral Commission is required to prepare, as soon as practicable after polling day in the first general election, a report on the operation of the election funding provisions relating to that election . . . To be eligible for public funding, a registered political party or an independent candidate must obtain at least 4% of the total formal first preference votes in the election they contested. </PARA>
<PARA>A table on the final page of the report sets this out. From the table one sees that nine claimants-that is, seven parties and two independents-obtained more than 4 per cent of the first preference votes. Of those nine claimants, five succeeded in returning elected members to the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Legislative Assembly. What is particularly interesting is the first preference votes and the number of members returned by each of those five parties. The Australian Labor Party obtained 22.82 per cent first preference votes and returned five members; the Liberal Party of Australia obtained 14.87 per cent first preference votes and returned four members; the No Self Government Party received 11.47 per cent of votes, and returned three members; the Residents Rally obtained 9.62 per cent first preference votes and returned four members; and the Abolish Self-Government Coalition obtained 7.5 per cent first preference votes and returned one member. </PARA>
<PARA> What is particularly interesting about the modified d'Hondt system is that, although the threshold chosen in the electoral system is a Droop quota-that is, the same type as that used in the Senate and the Tasmanian Hare-Clarke system-that quota is treated in a different way. In the modified d'Hondt system any party or candidate which falls below that quota is excluded immediately. This means that a very different result is reflected by using that system. It also means there is a grave unfairness in the system because the final result is that members are elected to the Assembly who actually achieve a lower percentage of votes than those who had been excluded when the quota is first assessed. </PARA>
<PARA> Anybody who has seen the video distributed by the Australian Electoral Commission which describes the count of that election will appreciate what a complicated matter it was because two processes had to be entered into. First there was the exclusion, and secondly the final count of the votes. At the moment the situation is under review in the ACT Assembly and in the Federal sphere, and it is to be hoped that a fairer system can be devised. In fact, if we look past the percentages and at the number of actual first preference votes required to elect a person in the Assembly, we see that whereas it took 3,412 first preference votes to elect each of the four Residents Rally members, the Abolish Self-Government coalition obtained 10,641 first preference votes and elected one member. There are inequities in the system, especially when the surplus votes of people who have been elected, who have received their quota, cannot go beyond the party line because, in effect, any d'Hondt system is a party list system. But, modified as it was, it misfired very greatly. In Australia we can regard it as an experiment which failed dismally. </PARA>

<PARA>I wish to comment on the Management and Investment Companies Licensing Board's annual report 1988-89. The most notable aspect of the report is the effect of outside economic influences on management and investment companies (MICs). The objectives of these MICs are, firstly, to promote the development of a private sector venture capital industry in Australia and, secondly, to encourage the provision of management skills and equity finance to young, fast-growing, export-oriented businesses using innovative technology. However, the report notes the success in achieving these two objectives was well down on previous years. The poor showing of the MICs referred to in this year's report is revealed by the following figures: applications for certification of new businesses was down to 16 from 34 in 1987-88 and 82 in 1986-87; the capital raised was well down from a high of $69m in 1986-87 to less than $16m this year; and there was a further decline for the second year running in the number of new investments for the year and a further decrease in the number of new businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet when the overseas high risk venture capital is examined, an opposite picture is to be seen. In Australia, 1988-89 can be viewed as a disappointing year. The overseas venture capital raising companies were an outstanding success. In 1987-88 the United Kingdom saw $699.3m raised as venture capital while in Europe $2.5 billion was raised, and similar successes can be seen in the United States and in Canada. Why is there a difference between those countries and Australia? The overseas companies are flourishing while the Australian Government is set to phase out the tax deductability benefits for MICs, and thus the demise of government encouragement for high risk, high technology, high capital venture industries. The difference is in the style of government. That is where the difference is. There is a difference between the style of government in Australia and elsewhere. Here we have a government that is naive in its handling of the economy, naive in its knowledge of how a business is run. </PARA>
<PARA> The causes of the demise of this industry in the last two years are the general economic conditions and, in particular, the high interest rates. The MICs are the forgotten casualty of this Government's interest rate policies. Access to investment funds is crucial to the survival and growth of these MICs. Our present investment climate, particularly the capital raising environment, is dominated by nervous and cautious investors. The safer available high interest rate bank bills, short term investments and various other safer short term money market investments attract the investor much more readily than high risk, high venture capital raising companies where one's money is tied up for about four years, with the possibility of a capital gains tax being payable on the sale of the company shares. This has placed a formidable obstacle in the path of the MICs. It is regrettable that the 1988-89 lack of capital caused the existing MICs to concentrate almost all of their limited energies on shoring up existing portfolios and, consequently, they have been unable to take advantage of the many new market opportunities being offered at reasonable prices. It should be noted that the taxation system was completely different in 1983-84 when the MICs were being set up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before lunch I was just completing my contribution to the second reading debate on the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 and I was running through the amendments that we intend to propose at the committee stage in order that the Senate might be aware of them now. There were two remaining amendments. The first concerned designated technical officers. I outlined a concern earlier, in relation to the principal Bill that is the subject of this debate, about giving permission to technical officers to carry out telephone interceptions to assist the Australian Federal Police. They were to be defined according to a class of persons and I indicated that we were dissatisfied with that description. We believe that they should be named individually if they are to be given this particular responsibility. This amendment introduces another area of concern to us; that is that proposed new section 12j (3) purports to restrict the powers of these officers to providing technical assistance only in installing, maintaining, testing, using or recovering a listening device. We are concerned about the expression `using' because it seems to us that it virtually gives the technical officer the power to use the equipment in the way that that power is being given to the Federal Police officer. We believe that there is an ambiguity in there that is unsatisfactory and that by a rather simply amendment it can be overcome. Basically that amendment is to remove the word `using' so that it becomes absolutely clear that what the technical officer is doing is assisting the police officers in relation to installing, maintaining and testing the equipment, not acting in lieu of the police officer in using the telephone interception equipment. It is a small matter; nevertheless, we think it is important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The last amendment I want to mention is the amendment to the Judiciary Act 1903. The effect of proposed section 55e (9a) will be to provide that when the Australian Government Solicitor gives advice to two or more government bodies on non-litigious matters he will not be acting in a conflict of interest situation. For the practical administration of government the proposed amendment should, in our view, be supported. However, an amendment is suggested by us to cover matters which, at the time of the giving of the advice, could be reasonably contemplated as giving rise to litigation. Thus we would amend the Government's amendment which refers to matters that are not the subject of litigation by adding to it, `nor matters which may reasonably be expected to give rise to litigation'. It seems to us that if there is a reasonable expectation of litigation, it would be better if the Government engaged a private solicitor rather than got itself into this potential conflict of interest situation. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated, we will be supporting the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill. We will be supporting most of the Government amendments to its own Bill, but we have outlined, by virtue of my contribution, a number of amendments that we intend to make in the committee stage to improve the legislation. I hope that our amendments, which I would not have thought are particularly controversial, will receive the support of the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The Australian Democrats will support both pieces of legislation: the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 and the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1989. The points that are at issue I think are probably better discussed in the committee stage, particularly a number of items that appear in the second list of amendments circulated by the Opposition on phone tapping. In the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill the Government has, for the first time, really made an attempt to codify what has been an area of enormous concern to people who have civil liberties as a main pursuit in this country. Indeed, we are lucky that we still have a very large number of people interested in the protection of civil liberties. There is always a reason why civil liberties can or should be eroded in the interests of some or in an attempt to fight crime. There is a difficulty of balance that is often hard to judge particularly when one becomes aware of the extent of crime within our community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not wish to canvass those items at length now, but I indicate that our general view is to have a reasonably rigid exercise on the topic of phone taps. Any extension that is sought-this Bill does seek an extension-has to be argued for very strenuously and it has to be shown why this ought to be the case, not on the basis simply that the crime may, might or possibly could be committed. If that were the sole basis upon which phones could be tapped, there would be open slather with every crime. Hopefully nobody in the community has suggested that, or ever will. The privacy of an individual must be respected. The destruction of privacy in a society in an endeavour to prevent crime could very well generate the type of society that one is trying to avoid by combating crime. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill, we are dealing with a matter that the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) in his second reading speech and Senator Hill have pointed to; that is, a series of reforms that are long overdue. On this particular proposition, the Opposition has moved only two amendments. Again, I will defer my comments on those amendments to the committee stage so that we can at least raise the specific items involved in each amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senators who have spoken for their indication that these two important pieces of legislation have their in principle support, although I acknowledge that some matters of detail need to be worked out in the committee stage. As for the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill, the various matters that are covered there are many. It is necessary that from time to time the portfolio review those accumulated instances where some amendment is thought desirable and is brought forward in this particular form in the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill. I thank those honourable senators who have indicated that they are willing to support those particular provisions. The most interesting is the further set of amendments that have been circulated by the Government to do with listening devices. I believe that it is extremely important that this legislation be passed for the sorts of reasons indicated by Senator Macklin and which lie behind some of the concerns which led to the drafting of the Opposition's amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important that we put in place for the first time a provision which would make it unlawful for members of the Australian Federal Police (AFP) to use a listening device anywhere in Australia in the investigation of any Commonwealth or Australian Capital Territory non-narcotics offence otherwise than under a judicial warrant. I think all honourable senators would agree that from a privacy point of view-it is an important consideration in the type of society which we hope to construct in this nation-this represents a major improvement in the current position especially in those jurisdictions such as Tasmania, my own home State, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory where there is no control on the use of listening devices in investigation of the offences that I mentioned by the AFP. </PARA>
<PARA> The attempt has been to take up the code to be found in the Customs Act which allows for the issue of warrants in relation to both persons and premises, and contains a number of safeguards designed to minimise the adverse effects on an individual's privacy. A judge would not be able to issue a warrant to use a listening device unless satisfied that information about the relevant offence that is likely to be obtained by using the device cannot be obtained by alternative methods of investigation. Other safeguards include a requirement that the Commissioner of the Federal Police ensure that those under his control do not breach the prohibition on the use of listening devices; that a warrant be revoked where the Commissioner is satisfied that the grounds on which the warrant was issued have ceased to exist; a prohibition on disclosure of information obtained from the use of a listening device except in specified circumstances is to be found; the destruction of material derived from the use of a listening device where it is not required for specific purposes is provided for; and copies of warrants and reports by the Commissioner on the use of such material are to be provided to the Attorney-General. These controls will apply in all parts of Australia, irrespective of the requirements of any local State legislation that may exist. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate will be considering a very important piece of legislation this afternoon. For the first time, it provides the Australian Federal Police-both in its role in the Australian Capital Territory as the community police force here and as the premier law enforcement investigative agency throughout the Commonwealth-with a comprehensive regime which will apply to it whenever it attempts to enforce the laws of the Commonwealth or the laws of the Australian Capital Territory. It is an important advance and, as we come to the committee stage, I believe we will see that there are sufficient privacy safeguards built in to perhaps make it unnecessary for Senator Hill to press his amendment at least in the form in which he originally indicated he would bring it to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The other most important piece of legislation is to do with sentencing. Two major reforms are being undertaken by this Government. One tends to overshadow the other, so I will mention the overshadowed one first. For the first time we have reviewed, in a very practical and humane way, the laws governing Federal offenders found unfit to be tried or not guilty on the grounds of mental illness. These sections of the Bill, whilst not provoking any controversy amongst those who have considered these provisions, will be found, as they are worked through over the years to come, to be an important part of this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the major reform being undertaken is in relation to those Federal prisoners whom we house in the various State and Northern Territory prisons. When we look at the total prison population throughout Australia we see that on 1 July this year there were 12,429 persons in prison, of whom only 517 were federal prisoners. These people tend to be the importers of drugs, those who commit fraud against the Commonwealth, particularly against the tax laws, and social security offenders who are found usually by a magistrate-to have received a benefit to which they were not entitled. There are some 517 Federal prisoners in State prisons at the moment. Up to this time the Commonwealth has greatly appreciated the fact that the States undertake the incarceration of these persons who have offended against Federal laws and has accepted that if, in a particular State, a sentence can be discounted for a State prisoner-in other words, remissions granted on the time to be spent in prison-the same system or regime should be available for a Federal prisoner to take advantage of. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give an example. A few months ago I came across a case where a Federal prisoner, who received a 15-year maximum sentence for conspiracy to import heroin, was given a five-year minimum term by the judge but, with State remissions, he served only three years and one month of his sentence. I am quite sure that throughout Australia there is a growing concern that where a judge pronounces a term of imprisonment-and he or she should do so only as a last resort-both the public and the prisoner ought to know that that term of imprisonment will be served. The time to be spent in custody pronounced by the judge in open court should be acknowledged by the prisoner and known by the public to be the time that actually will be spent in prison. Under the scheme of this new sentencing proposal, the judge will be encouraged to explain in clear language to the prisoner that he or she, the judge, is setting a gaol term and a parole period. They are two distinct concepts. I think parole is extremely important as it helps a released prisoner to make the transition into community life under supervision. Certainly, parole periods should not occur before the expiry of the time set by the judge for a particular offender to spend in gaol. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe there is a general feeling in the community at the moment that there is something of a fraud against the public in respect of those cases where a prisoner is released before the minimum term set by the judge is served. This sentencing legislation will address that concern. In other words, I believe that the community's confidence will be restored, certainly in respect of Federal prisoners, and in many other jurisdictions around Australia. State governments are coming to the same conclusion and introducing similar laws. </PARA>
<PARA> It needs to be made clear-and I am sure that the Senate, in supporting this proposal in principle, will understand-that we are not looking for more draconian penalties, we are not looking for greater severity; we are looking for certainty. That is the aim of this proposal. Senator Hill brought up the question of the `release on licence' provision, which he indicated might undermine this principle to some extent. That is to be used in those cases where, for example, a prisoner is found to be suffering a severe illness, such as cancer, which may lead to death. Of course we would not want such a person to linger in prison. The opportunity is there to grant a licence in those cases. But it is meant to be used in those exceptional circumstances and certainly not in the automatic way where remissions are known to the prisoner as he walks into the prison from the court. That automatic entitlement, which is calculated and known virtually from day one in prison, is what we are attacking and, I believe, will have the firm support of the public. </PARA>
<PARA> There are matters of concern which can be dealt with at the committee stage in relation to both the pieces of legislation. In the meantime, I thank those who have indicated their support for the second readings of these Bills. I commend the second readings to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) Page 7, clause 6, after proposed subsection 16a (2), insert the following new subsection:</PARA>
<PARA> `` `(2a) Before imposing a sentence or making an order, the court shall invite the victim of the offence and any other person who has suffered injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence to inform the court of his or her personal circumstances and of any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence, and the court shall, in imposing the sentence or making the order, take into account any such information so provided to the court.''. </PARA>
<PARA>I dealt with the argument for this amendment in my speech on the second reading and I do not wish to repeat it. However, there is a growing community view that, in sentencing offenders, the court not only should take into account the circumstances of the victims but also should give the victims the opportunity to put those circumstances to the court. The legislation that the Government is seeking to pass today sets out very detailed criteria that the judge is to take into account. Most of the detail concerns the nature of the crime or the status of the offender. By this amendment we seek to make it clear that the victim has the opportunity to put the victim's case to the court to be taken into account in the assessment of sentence by the judge. We have, therefore, moved the amendment accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The amendment moved by the Opposition, as Senator Hill said, speaks to a widespread community concern about whether or not the criminal justice system tends too much towards the support of people accused of crime. Indeed, under our system, hopefully, that will always remain part and parcel of the operation of our criminal law so that we can, as much as is possible, guard against the unlikely event of an innocent person being found guilty of a crime. However, we have some difficulties with the amendment moved here by Senator Hill. If we look at the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) itself, on page 7, `Matters to which court to have regard when passing sentence etc.', we find this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In determining the sentence to be passed . . . a court must impose a sentence or make an order that is of the severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence. </PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Hill has already said, that was partly amended in the House of Representatives at the end of the second reading debate. It then goes on to say this:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the court must take into account such of the following matters that are known to the court:</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph (d), interestingly enough, reads:</PARA>
<PARA> the personal circumstances of any victim of the offence;</PARA>
<PARA>and paragraph (e) reads:</PARA>
<PARA> any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the substance of the Opposition's amendment is already in the Bill. Indeed, it seems that the phraseology used by the Opposition has been taken directly from the Bill. The Opposition has suggested that at the other end of the exercise this ought to occur again. The court will already have heard the personal circumstances of the victim of the crime. The court now needs to be acquainted with those personal circumstances, and if the court is not acquainted with them, it is obvious that the judge is going to have to be acquainted with them. </PARA>
<PARA> `Any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence' would normally be made known during a criminal trial. So, interestingly enough, I think that a lot of the items that the Opposition is maintaining ought to be dealt with in fact have been dealt with by the Bill itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I think there is a problem with the introduction at the Federal level of the amendment which the Opposition has chosen to draft. The amendment, in part, says:</PARA>
<PARA>Before imposing a sentence or making an order, the court shall invite the victim of the offence and any other person who has suffered injury, loss or damage . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I am not at all sure what the legal fraternity will make of that when dealing with the tax law. I presume that `any other person who has suffered injury' with regard to a tax offence would be everybody within the Commonwealth. It would not in fact, because the amendment is dealing with a person; presumably, it is not dealing with the Commonwealth as the Crown but rather with the injury caused to people. In some way, one might feel interested in going into court with regard to some of the frauds committed on the public purse and actually having a say about what should happen to the person. Be that as it may, I think we might find ourselves in some considerable difficulty on that. I am quite sure that that interpretation is not the intention that the Opposition wanted to achieve in that amendment, but it does seem to be something of a problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The third problem is that this particular arrangement in my understanding is novel. Senator Hill said in his speech during the second reading debate that it is in operation in South Australia. By way of private comment to him afterwards, I did say that that had not been the advice given to me, and I hope that at least we can have some clarification now as to whether this is in place in South Australia. My understanding was that it is at least possible and, indeed, under the rules laid down in the crimes legislation and the operation of the Federal Courts, certainly no judge would be constrained in any way to call upon the victim to make a statement if he felt constrained to do so with regard to the provisions set down in the sentencing principles. If a judge felt in any way that the information was deficient, I would imagine that is precisely what a judge would proceed to do. It is not that one wants to rule out the substance of the amendment, but I do have great difficulty in actually putting the amendment into the legislation in the way in which it is drafted and at the particular time that it occurs. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose my last feeling of some reticence to deal with this matter is a feeling-and it may be a conservative feeling-that it has been the established practice of the courts to allow out all the items that are relevant to any particular crime, for the jury to make its deliberations and then, upon that deliberation, for a determined process of the court to proceed. Of course, there is a possibility of a plea of mitigation where the prosecution, if it is in that criminal context, is able to disagree. So the items to which Senator Hill alludes are in some ways already performed, although not necessarily, as I understand the Opposition's amendment, by the person themselves. I am not at all sure how many people will actually want to take this particular option. Senator Hill did allude to the interest that the community has in making sure that the victim of a crime is not, as it were, shuffled off into a corner as at least it has appeared in the past. Quite frankly, I think that is probably what compelled the Government under its sentencing principles to actually state that personal circumstances and injury ought to taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Hill might well know, it is not only that which has to be taken into account. Indeed, if one uses the widow's rite argument, stealing the total wealth of a widow and stealing $100 from Senator Hill are materially the same crime, but in effect, of course, would have quite different circumstances. Of course, many criminals when committing crimes would not necessarily know what the outcome of the crime would be. So we cannot just simply say that it is the effect on the victim that is the only thing to be taken into account. Other principles are to be alluded to, including the quality of the offence, as it were, of itself and in itself. It is for those reasons that we have reservations, not about the principle that Senator Hill is seeking to enshrine, because that is, on my reading of if-and I would be interested in hearing Senator Hill's response-already enshrined in the legislation which we are currently passing, but rather about the way in which Senator Hill, in his amendment, has attempted to go about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government cannot accept this amendment moved by Senator Hill on behalf of the Opposition, and for basically some of the reasons which Senator Macklin indicated. First of all, I think we have to understand that the number of Federal offences that have an identifiable victim are relatively small. It is not impossible but it is very difficult to actually envisage a victim, in terms of Senator Hill's amendment, who would come forward. Most Federal offenders are drug traffickers or people who commit a fraud against the Commonwealth-against the tax laws, as mentioned by Senator Macklin, or the social security system and so on. While there is a general range of victims, really almost every Federal offender who faces a term of imprisonment would not be being convicted with respect to an offence against an identifiable victim. Admittedly, there would be a couple of exceptions: for example, where the murder, kidnapping and assault of internationally protected persons, heads of state or diplomats, or the hijacking of aircraft and so on are dealt with. But, thank God, these are very few and far between in our country. I believe that we have to deal with the general situation, which is that there are no identifiable victims in most cases of Federal offences which have led to convictions in our courts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also important to give due weight to proposed section 16a (2) (d) and (e). If it is an appropriate case, the court must take into account relevant matters known to it, such as the personal circumstances of any victim of the offence and any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence. Of course, that would be made known to the court by the prosecution at the sentencing stage. Perhaps Senator Hill is more conversant than I with the system in South Australia, but I believe that there the victim does not come before the court. That is a crucial difference between Senator Hill's proposition and the situation in South Australia. In that type of jurisdiction, where quite clearly crimes of violence are being prosecuted and convictions recorded on a daily basis, I commend Mr Chris Sumner, the Attorney-General, for his very real interest in and pursuit of the question of victim impact statements. But once again, I do not think that in South Australia the victim is invited to appear. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether or not that is the case, that would certainly accord with the general understanding of the criminal law in our system of common law as modified by statute and sometimes by a full code of criminal law. In the old days, the prosecuting of the criminal law was under the general title of `pleas of the Crown'. Indeed, when one looks at a criminal case it is entitled `The Queen against' or in the United States, for example, `The people against'. In other words, whilst a crime obviously has a particular victim in the case of murder, rape, assault or whatever it may be along those lines, nevertheless the offence is characterised as criminal because it is seen as an offence against the whole community. Indeed, it is the community which has an interest in prosecuting and securing the conviction of an offender because it is an offence against society's well-being-against the peace of the Queen, if you like, and against the well-being of society in a more general sense. In the title to an indictment one might see that philosophy underlying criminal law well displayed. </PARA>
<PARA> We certainly do not want to get to the situation in this country where, perhaps, the type of sentence awarded depends on how articulate a victim is in recounting to a court the suffering experienced at the time of an attack and subsequently. If an inarticulate person is perhaps overawed or simply does not want to come forward because of the trauma of recounting a matter, will that lead to a lesser sentence than in the case where a person has come forward and with great descriptive power recounted the horrors of the attack and outlined the subsequent suffering that was caused? There are very real difficulties here. I believe that we must not turn our criminal law or court system into one where revenge on the part of the victim becomes part of the sentencing process. It is important that the court know of the personal circumstances and any injury, loss or damage suffered by a person who is the subject of an attack. That can be made known through the prosecutor in the way I have indicated. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, for all those reasons, cannot accept this amendment, but I emphasise that it is not out of a lack of interest in the question of victim impact statements. Their application in the case of Federal offenders would be minuscule. I believe that at the Australian Police Ministers Council, which is to be held in Darwin in March, this matter is on the agenda, put there by South Australia. It concerns, particularly, how the United Nations statement in relation to victims of crimes, adopted at the seventh United Nations congress on the prevention of crime and treatment of offenders, might be more generally applied in different ways to the various jurisdictions around Australia. That will be a most interesting discussion and a useful forum for discussing the way in which victim impact statements might be made available to court. But I do not believe that the Opposition's way of making them available should commend itself to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate that the Government and the Australian Democrats are not going to support this additional reform we are suggesting. Whilst I am disappointed in that, I nevertheless recognise, as Senator Macklin has indicated, that the provisions of the Government's Bill require the court to take into account the personal circumstances of any victim of the offence. We are pleased that the Government has been prepared to go that far. We certainly were not looking at it as an opportunity for revenge, but we do believe that the common law position, as outlined by Senator Tate, has already been departed from and, in effect, including the provision to take into account the particular circumstances of the victim demonstrates that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question now is how the court should obtain or seek that information. In some circumstances-for example, where there has been a plea and the judge has not been exposed to the circumstances of the victim-simply to be handed up some form of brief by a prosecution counsel does not, in our view, give the judge a sufficient understanding in some cases of the costs and consequences to victims of crime. Therefore we have sought in this amendment to take the process of reform one step further, that is, to invite the victim to put to the court his or her case as to the particular circumstances of injury, loss or damage. We cannot see that any damage to the system would be done by that. We can only see that it would enhance the system. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the reference to another person who suffered such injury, loss or damage, we had in mind that it might have been, subject to the difficulty the Minister has outlined of a Federal offence, an assault on two persons but the charge for one reason or another is brought only against one person. Nevertheless the circumstances of both victims, we would have thought, should be able to be taken into account by the judge. Therefore the judge should have the opportunity and, in fact, under our amendment, would be obliged to hear those victims as to the circumstances of the offence that was perpetrated upon them. I recognise the numbers, and at least I am pleased that the amendment the Government has brought does, in our view, take a step in the right direction. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendments relate to the question of the non-parole period. As the Bill stands at the moment, the Attorney-General does not have any discretion, for an offence with a sentence of more than three years but less than 10 years, to so act at the end of the compulsory period of imprisonment as to avoid release of a person. We say that there will be circumstances where there may be additional information that was not known at the time or there may be questions of the behaviour of the prisoner during the term of his or her imprisonment where this extra discretion would be useful and, in fact, important to the Attorney-General and should be contained. We think that additional discretion is important and should be included. Therefore, we seek to make the position consistent, whether the penalty is for a term in excess of 10 years or a term between three and 10 years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -These amendments pose another difficulty when one is looking at a question of balance. We are dealing here with the Opposition, which wants to go back, as I understand it, to the three-year exercise and onwards, where the Attorney-General would then be involved, and the Government, which wishes to restrict that to a post-10-year sentencing period. In many ways the normal operation of parole might be said to be reasonable until one is dealing with more serious crimes. I presume that the Bill, as the Government has introduced it, leans on the notion that after a certain period one is dealing with extremely serious criminal offences that could warrant the intervention of the Attorney-General in addition to the normal procedures by which parole is set by parole boards and the various appeal mechanisms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has not made out its case as to why we should depart from the Government's original proposal. It is reasonable that, in the less serious cases, normal procedures ought to take place. I read the debate in the House of Representatives, where the Opposition argued these amendments, and also I have listened to Senator Hill. But I have not heard yet a compelling argument as to why one would pursue the Opposition's amendments in place of the Government's amendment. The Government amendment has the advantage of fitting in with the overall structure as it is set out in the Bill. There needs to be a serious reason to destabilise that by supporting amendments. At the moment, the only reason to do so is that undoubtedly there is community concern about a lot of early releases. In part, that has driven the Government to adopt, as it were, truth in sentencing proposals to try to get some more consistency and stability into the process. That is what a significant part of this Bill is about. In that sense, I think the Government has gone a long way-certainly a lot further than we have gone to date-in dealing with this matter. That is why I say that the Government's proposal fits into the framework better than do the Opposition's amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's proposal seems to come from a slightly different tack-that the Attorney-General will be involved in almost the entire panoply of the exercise with regard to parole. I am not at all sure that the obvious advantages in having a general parole mechanism and, certainly, the general parole exercises should be lost. It would be more appropriate at the moment to continue with the framework set out in the Bill. It is possible that at a later stage this will be reviewed. I presume Senator Hill will tell us that the Opposition will review it when it comes into government in a couple of months time, so we probably will not have too long to wait before this Bill is re-presented with that change in it. In the meantime, it might be better to stay with the framework set out by the Government rather than dropping in something which is slightly alien to the general concept of this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government does not accept the amendments moved by Senator Hill on behalf of the Opposition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, but the prisoner is entitled to know that at the end of that gaol term he or she will be able to take advantage of the parole system. There is something of a balance to be struck between all the parties in this exercise-society, the court and the convicted person. I believe that it is important that the prisoner be told, as he or she will be, by the sentencing judge or magistrate that serving a sentence will entail a period of imprisonment for a certain time and, in addition, a parole period of a certain time, and that a person will have served his or her sentence only when that is all completed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the sentencing range of three to 10 years of imprisonment, that certainty and predictability for all parties is important. I do not believe that the Attorney-General should exercise a discretion to vary that certainty. In regard to sentences of 10 years or more, an ability is vested in the Attorney to delay the release of the prisoner. That has been put in as a matter of some cautious anticipation, I suppose, of a situation developing in the case of a person in gaol for longer than 10 years for a very serious offence which would make the release of the person on the due date something which society should guard against. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst one could assume that the Attorney, even in instances of a person who had served a sentence of 10 years or more, would wish to ensure that the person is taken under the wing of the parole system as soon as possible so that reintegration and rehabilitation into the community can be supervised and facilitated, there may be instances where something comes to light which would lead to some delay in moving the prisoner into the parole system. I concede that that is somewhat arbitrary. But in relation to those who are imprisoned for a period of three to 10 years, the Government believes that its certainty principle need not be adorned with the sort of discretion which is vested in the Attorney in regard to sentences of 10 years or more. This is an important underlying principle. I concede that a line had to be drawn somewhere. We drew it at 10 years. Senator Hill's amendments would undo what is sought to be achieved in principle by this legislation as voted for at the second reading stage-that is, to introduce at the sentencing stage the certainty which I think the community requires. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to have one more attempt at persuading Senator Macklin because I think there is a strong argument on consistency alone. Therefore, it's worth a go. The Minister acknowledged that the difference between subclause (1) and subclause (2) is somewhat arbitrary. In fact, it is totally arbitrary because the Minister has included in the Bill two separate punishment regimes which totally differ, depending on whether one is sentenced to nine years imprisonment or 11 years imprisonment. We have said that there should be one system. Our preference is for the subclause (2) alternative, which is what Senator Macklin might have described as the more traditional mode.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was interested to hear the rationale of punishment as expressed by the Minister. I had not heard it quite in those terms-that is, that when someone is now sentenced they are sentenced to a fixed and specified period of incarceration, the non-parole period, and a fixed and specified period of parole. We have never seen it quite in those terms. We have envisaged a person sentenced to imprisonment for the fixed term as determined by the judge-for the purpose of this debate let us say that it is 10 years-and an obligation on the judge under this legislation to set down a period of those 10 years which the person must serve in prison; that is, the non-parole period. Let us say for the purpose of this example that the non-parole period is six years. We argue that nevertheless the term of imprisonment was to be 10 years, as specified by the judge. When a person has served the prescribed minimum non-parole period as determined by the judge, in this case six years, probably in most cases he will be released under parole. However, some circumstances could come to light afterwards, as I indicated. The Minister acknowledged that that is a legitimate factor to be taken into account in the case of imprisonment for a period of over 10 years; I believe it is equally legitimate to be taken into account for a term under 10 years. That might lead the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) to consider that in all the circumstances the person is not ready for parole. There could, as I indicated, be evidence that was not available at the time of sentencing-evidence that has come to light since. It could be something to do with the behaviour of the person in prison. Whatever it may be we believe that it is a better system of justice that allows the Attorney-General to have that discretion. </PARA>
<PARA> We are conscious of the very difficult job that those who administer the prison system experience and the concerns that they have in circumstances where a prisoner knows that he will be released on a specified date, whatever might be his behaviour. In other words, they argue for some incentive for good behaviour to make the prison system manageable in circumstances which are always difficult. Therefore, they would prefer-we support them in this instance-that the Attorney-General have some continuing discretion, a continuing capacity to force the prisoner to serve the initial sentence set by the judge or at least a greater part than the judge thought at the time was necessary before that person was released on parole. We urge Senator Macklin to consider the value of giving the Attorney-General that extra discretion, the flexibility that it allows, so that we will have consistency in the legislation and, therefore, an improved system upon that which the Minister has outlined. </PARA>
<PARA> We commend the fact that there will be a fixed non-parole period, in other words, that there will not be early releases as we have experienced in the past. I note the comments made that the licensing system would be used only in extreme circumstances. That debate is now behind us. The debate that we are addressing now is: what is the correct position upon completion of the non-parole period; should the Attorney-General then have a discretion upon the release of the prisoner or should the prisoner have a right of release at that time?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The point made by Senator Hill is a reasonable one with regard to proposed subsection 19al (1). We are probably setting a fairly firm exercise, one that does not provide a great deal of flexibility. But further on in the clause we have to note that we have more flexibility than Senator Hill was prepared to acknowledge. The difficulty in proceeding with what Senator Hill is suggesting is, as I said before, that we are taking one particular item in a general context. It is not only on this page. If we go through the rest of the Bill in terms of its structure we see these particular items built in. In terms of the amendment as it was drafted, I am not at all sure, but for example, under subsection 19ap relating to release on licence I think it would involve some consequential amendment. In terms of a parole order being automatically revoked, which is the next section, we would be dealing with some consequential amendment. Undoubtedly there are some other parts of this Bill which would involve consequential amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The difficulty that I have is that, while the proposition may be reasonable in terms of its different philosophical framework, I must admit that I would prefer that we put in place a Bill on this particular matter at this time. I am not sure whether Senator Hill will disagree with that; I think he will probably agree. I do not know whether Senator Hill is able to assure me 100 per cent, absolutely, that there are no consequential amendments. I happen to think that there are probably some. We are faced, in terms of the pre-Christmas context, with no time available. For all his eloquence I am afraid I must desist from taking the bait that he offered. I would much prefer to actually proceed with the legislation before us in the hope that in its implementation the difficulties that Senator Hill alluded to will be overcome. Quite rightly, there could be some difficulties; I have a sneaking suspicion that one of the propositions that he raised will bring forward an amendment at some stage with regard to one or other person. We will suddenly find ourselves in a fair amount of difficulty-at least the Attorney-General will-and an amendment may come back at that stage. It is not that I cannot see some validity in the argument that Senator Hill is pushing. It is because of our desire to have intact a Bill that is able to be passed into law at this particular time that we cannot support the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA> No. 1.-Proposed new section 12b, definition of ``class 2 general offence'', paragraph (b), leave out the paragraph. </PARA>
<PARA> No. 2-Proposed new section 12b, definition of ``class 2 general offence'', paragraph (c), leave out ``or (b)''. </PARA>
<PARA>Both amendments deal with the question of class 2 general offences. We also touched upon this debate in the second reading stage of the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 and, therefore, I want to limit discussion at this time, particularly bearing in mind the time of year. Whilst we accept the right of the Australian Federal Police to use the telephone interception method as part and parcel of its investigatory capacities in serious criminal activities-serious criminal activities beyond those of narcotic offences-nevertheless we are concerned that the amendment the Government is seeking to enact into law today goes too far. We have no concern with that part that deals with class 1 general offences, which speak of murder, kidnapping and aiding and abetting of the same. We have no concern with the first part of class 2 general offences, which are specified in the Government's amendments which list section by section of the Crimes Act, the Secret Commissions Act or the Crimes (Offences Against the Government) Act 1989, but we are concerned with the next part, which simply gives a generic description of offences; in other words, it gives the terms of the penalty for offences with a maximum period of at least seven years, plus general detail of the type of criminal activity. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of some of those areas of general activity my concern would have been less. For example, the first is `loss of a person's life' but, as I have indicated, murder is already covered within the class 1 general offence. But as I move down this list of the types of criminal activity I become more concerned. For example, if I go to the last type of criminal activity on the list, involving `serious loss to the revenue of the Commonwealth or the Australian Capital Territory-I certainly will not argue that an offence that causes a loss of revenue to the ACT is not necessarily serious-we, on this side of the chamber, are concerned as to whether it is of such a nature that it warrants giving police officers the power to intercept telephone calls. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, whilst we do not want in any way to inhibit effective policing, nevertheless, we are concerned by the continued movement to extend the power of telephone interception. I know that that is a little irrelevant to this debate; but we can reflect momentarily on press reports over the last few days that have been referring to alleged illegal telephone interceptions by the Australian Federal Police and, in the case of the Bond companies, to another set of illegal telephone interceptions. I think the whole area is one of growing community concern. I touched on that argument only momentarily-it is not strictly relevant to this debate-because clearly, those interceptions were illegal. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are talking about here is the extent to which the power to legally intercept should be extended and I am submitting to the Committee that the Government has taken this a little too far. For example, as I am advised, this description of offences would include offences such as stealing postal articles, failing to renew an export or import licence, providing false or misleading information regarding agricultural chemicals and damaging data in Commonwealth computers. Obviously, those offences are serious-I will not argue it-but I question whether they are the types of offences that should justify the police having what most of us would regard as an enormous capacity to invade privacy through telephone interception. We would like to see that capacity left to what the community would generally interpret as very serious crime to be utilised when other more traditional methods of policing prove unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> We are surprised by the way in which the Government has moved to these amendments. For example, the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) said in the other place that these amendments are to be an interim measure. We do not understand that. The Government has had many reports and considerable time within which to determine a fixed and settled position in this acknowledged difficult debate. It has had the report of the Joint Select Committee on Telecommunications Interceptions dated 30 January 1987; it has had Australian Law Reform Commission reports into privacy and criminal investigations, which are found in the Law Reform Digest of 1983; and it has had volume 1 of the report of the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Alleged Telephone Interceptions, which Commission investigated the Age tapes. So a lot of carefully prepared material has been put on the public record. What has happened, though, is that this Government has said that, at this stage, it can only put before this chamber an interim measure. We do not understand that. We cannot see why the Government cannot have a final and conclusive position. If we look to the Law Reform Commission's report as the basis for the Government's justification of this move, we find that it sets out a whole series of recommendations, one of which concerns the seven-year penalty; but many of the others are not picked up, and we do not understand why the Government has picked this up without picking up the other protections that are included in the Law Reform Commission's report. I could take the Minister through all of those protections, but I will not do so; he can read the report. I would like to know why, in these circumstances, the Government has picked up this provision which extends the power of police officers without looking towards the additional safeguards. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should specify offences that justify the Australian Federal Police having this unusual power of telephone interception. It should not talk about classes or types of offences; it should be specific. Only in those circumstances should the Parliament be asked to give to the police force these additional powers. Our amendments Nos 1 and 2 to the Government's amendment have the effect of removing class 2 general offences under subclause (b). Certainly, that would force the Government to go away and come back, if the Parliament sits again under its authority in the new year, and bring a specific list of offences that it wishes us to pass into law in relation to this extended power. I think that better law would result from that course of action than from adopting the amendment that the Government has put. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing with listening devices, not telephone interception. This was a confusion of language which I do not think was entirely intended by Senator Hill during his contribution. His general theme was that we would need to justify giving the Australian Federal Police the capacity to install listening devices in order to gather information and intelligence relating to the commission of an offence. However, what has to be understood is that it is happening every day now without a statutory regime. There is nothing unlawful about the Federal Police using listening devices in relation to their investigation into the commission of a crime at the moment-for example, in the Australian Capital Territory in the instance which Senator Hill alluded to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I could have allowed that situation to continue. But instead of allowing for an unfettered ability to use those listening devices-always, of course, within the law relating, for example, to their installation in particular premises-it has, nevertheless, been thought wise and proper, for the very reasons that Senator Hill put forward, to bring into this Parliament a regime to regulate the obtaining of permission to use these listening devices from a judge. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, of course. I have mentioned premises because obviously it would be unlawful to break and enter a premises in order to install a listening device, and that could not be permitted even now. The sorts of concerns that Senator Hill brings forward are, of course, the reason for dividing the particular classes of offences into class 1 and class 2. Class 1 offences are the sorts about which there would be no argument. Class 2 offences are those which are very serious, and that is indicated by the need for a possible term of imprisonment of seven years or more to be attached to the commission of an offence. But class 2 carries with it further protections over and above those which apply where one applies for a warrant in relation to a class 1 offence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one looks at proposed section 12g (2) (b) (iv), one sees that, in addition to the various matters which the judge needs to take into account when dealing with class 1 offences, he has to have regard to matters mentioned in sub-section 7, which states that for the purposes of the relevant subparagraphs, the matters to which a judge is to have regard-and this is in class 2 offences only-are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) how much the privacy of any person would be likely to be interfered with by the use by officials of a listening device in relation to the person or premises concerned;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the gravity of the conduct constituting the offence;</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate there that that would probably deal with the minor interference with the postal articles matter that Senator Hill pointed to. And:</PARA>
<PARA> (c) to what extent information of a kind mentioned in subparagraph (2) (b) (ii) or (4) (b) (ii), as the case may be, would be likely to assist in connection with inquiries in relation to the offence. </PARA>
<PARA>They are additional safeguards specifically put in. I remember the debate in our Caucus committee-led in a most vigorous way by our friend and colleague Senator Barney Cooney, who insisted that further protections be placed in relation to these other offences than was already the case in general. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That covers both class 1 and class 2. That is an essential in both instances. But in relation to class 2 offences there are those particular provisions inserted in proposed section 12g (7). I think they amount to an answer to Senator Hill's concerns. There is a much greater responsibility on the judge to satisfy himself as regards the gravity of the offence, the invasion of privacy concerned, and the sort of assistance that might be obtained from the use of the device.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It might be that some further amendments may be required in light of the practice that evolves, but I believe that we have here an attempt by Parliament to regulate the way in which the Australian Federal Police use these listening devices. It is most essential. It is important that the safeguards that are indicated there be given due weight. </PARA>
<PARA> The list of the class 2 offences deals with matters where I believe the community would agree to seeing police forces use listening devices-for example, serious personal injury or serious risk of serious personal injury. It would be an intolerable matter if there were a serial rapist or a serial basher of old women roaming around the Australian Capital Territory and the police force could not use a listening device in order to help nail the attacker. In relation to trafficking in narcotic drugs it seems to me to be very sensible that one would be able to use a listening device, as one can in relation to the importing of such drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe we have here an indication of the types of offences that are involved. They are serious offences. The offences are punishable by a term of imprisonment of at least seven years. I believe that in these situations and with the sorts of protections and safeguards that I have outlined, which are additional to those relating to class 1 offences, the Committee could safely reject the amendment moved by Senator Hill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With regard to this section, I ask the Minister whether, if the Opposition's amendments were carried, the Government would proceed to proclaim this particular piece of legislation. The reason I ask is that fairly obviously, if we have an unregulated situation at the moment and we seek to bring in regulation, what this Bill is in fact doing is making much more specific and constrained the operation of the police force. Since one of the items is with regard to trafficking in narcotic drugs, it does not seem to be sensible, in the case, for example, of a person who has a tape-recorder strapped to him in an endeavour to gather evidence of a drug offence, that we should move to prevent that sort of practice occurring. Although we would like to see a regulation in this area, we accept the general thrust of what the Opposition is saying. The difficulty I am having now is that if this amendment is accepted we may end up preventing the Government from proceeding because it will impose such a restriction on police in a number of areas-I referred to narcotics, but the restriction would also apply to other areas such as extortion, threats and the like-that it would prevent them from taking the action which they are currently taking and which is totally acceptable to the community. It would certainly not be our intention for that to occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are in somewhat of a dilemma. The Bill itself is acceptable in terms of a restriction by putting in place a regime of control in an area where it is necessary. Yet if we subscribe to Senator Hill's amendment, which follows much the same philosophy which induced the Government to introduce the Bill in the first place but takes it a bit further, we could end up killing off the Bill. I seek the Minister's response to that point before I continue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposition which the Minister has set out is the one that I assumed might be the case. That is why I asked for clarification. I acknowledge that since I had not discussed this matter previously with the Minister, he did not have the opportunity to consult prior to this time. In perusing the list that Senator Hill wishes to delete, it seems to me that there is a very strong analogy between class 1 general offences, particularly those in paragraph (a)-murder, or an offence of a kind equivalent to murder-and class 2 general offences, subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) dealing with serious matters. The legislation sets out such matters as involving cases where a person could either lose his life or is in serious risk of loss of life. Class 2, subparagraph (iv) offences-trafficking in narcotic drugs-is the one in which the community has expressed itself very clearly in favour of wider powers for police forces to be able to deal with what the community perceives as being an extraordinary attack upon itself. However, I must admit that the last two subparagraphs, (v) and (vi)-serious fraud and serious loss to revenue-of class 2 offences seem to be somewhat at variance with those. I seek Senator Hill's indication as to whether or not he wishes to push ahead with the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I indicate that we would support the deletion of subparagraphs (v) and (vi), but could not support the Opposition with regard to deleting the ability of police to deal with a range of matters that are likely to cause a person's loss of life or to undermine in any way the ability of the police force to deal with trafficking in narcotic drugs, having quite clearly in mind that under the Customs Act dealing with the importation and operation of narcotic drugs, the police force already has the ability to use listening devices. All we are talking about here is the next step down the track. It would be passing strange if we said, `You can use all of these devices to catch people bringing drugs into the country but you can't do that in regard to what often is the very lead item to that type of importation-the trafficking that goes on within the country'. Senator Hill well knows this from his service on the Joint Statutory Committee on the National Crime Authority. I seek Senator Hill's comments as to whether or not it is his intention to press ahead. I indicate that a restriction of the deletion to offences in class 2 subparagraphs (v) and (vi) would be a totally different matter. Taking those out would leave those more serious and equivalent crimes to class 1 general offences in the legislation. I am not at all sure that offences in the categories of subparagraphs (v) and (vi) should have been in the legislation in the first place. They seem to me to be of a totally different kind, possibly class 3 general offences. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While Senator Hill is looking at the proposition which has just been put to him, I will speak for a moment. I do not understand-probably because I have not focused from the outset as carefully as I ought to have-why there is a problem with the Bill if it is simply required by amendment to specify the offences. I will just return to something that Senator Hill said earlier on. I understand the point being made by Senator Tate that much of the legislation has sought to lay down some penalties and some provisions to deal with the question of unlawful intercepting of telephone calls and of recording of conversations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was from that point that the legislation originally moved. In recent times telephone interceptions and recordings of what normally would be private conversations have not been the last resort of those acquiring evidence or demonstrating prima facie evidence of an offence or the likelihood of the commission of an offence. There has been a temptation for it to be the first resort, rather than the last resort. We all understand that. It is a great deal easier for people in the business of law enforcement if they can use the facilities at their disposal. I acknowledge the point that has been made by Senator Tate that the granting of a warrant for the planting of a device should be available only when other investigative procedures have been tried and failed or where they would be impractical-or words to that effect. I would have thought that is the least that should be provided in terms of a safeguard. </PARA>
<PARA> The great problem with privacy-and it is sad that it is not debated often enough in this Parliament-is that it is a rather abstract, esoteric concept. When we are dealing with law and order, this concept has to compete with the harsh reality of what is defined as the common good. In this day and age, when we regularly read on the front pages of newspapers about organised crime-whether of a white collar or drug related nature-there is a capacity for the public to imagine that such crime has to be dealt with in the most draconian way. In that environment, it may be that society can be tempted by the emotion of the debate to trample on the individual and personal rights of people on the basis that the common good will be better served if those rights are sacrificed. This debate cannot be dealt with objectively and reasonably in that sort of environment. Therefore, it is incumbent upon governments and legislators-of whatever part of the Parliament they come from-not to allow the emotions of the moment, the emotion of the debate or temporary circumstances to be used as a forum or platform for a more intrusive form of invasion of privacy. </PARA>
<PARA> I well remember, as we all do, the height of emotion that was reached with the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union and the wild allegations that were made, many of which fell to the ground. Indeed, references which were transferred to a new authority were found to be of no consequence. In that environment it is ter- ribly easy for a government to come to the Parliament and say, `We must deal with this terrible, insidious, pernicious disease that is corrupting us. We must cleanse ourselves of it and take whatever steps are necessary. If it means, just for the time being, subjugating the rights of individuals, so be it, because there is a greater common good to be had'. As I say, it is incumbent upon governments to make decisions in the long term with a measured reflex and consideration, and not simply to accommodate short term concerns that we might have. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope I have given the Minister sufficient time to negotiate with Senator Hill. I always find it interesting in these debates-and this is not a reflection on anybody who has participated today-that there seems to be a contrast as to what the definition of a `civil libertarian' is. I can give a bad example: I well remember that when Michael Chamberlain came to my office to plead the case of his wife, Lindy, I selected the names of several people who I thought would be receptive to his appeal-people who had held themselves out as caring for individuals' rights and the preservation of those rights, and having a compassion that is unparalleled by right wing, fringe lunatics such as me. I found, when I contacted these people, that he could not even get in the door to see them. </PARA>
<PARA> They had judged. I do not say that in an abstract and unkind way. I simply say that nobody has got a mortgage on these things. One does not have to be a refugee from East Timor to need protection in this world. An ordinary John Citizen in Australian society deserves the same consideration as those other people deserve. I hope that, as we look at this legislation, we will consider those things. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask myself: Why the measure of seven years? As Senator Hill quite properly pointed out, there are some offences that would not be judged, by definition, to fall within the category of `serious'. The concern I have is that expressed by Senator Hill-that the Government has not defined the offences. I suspect that will make it much easier, at a later date, to amend the legislation. Let us remember that whatever is passed in this Parliament is, in the future, always judged to be right. When we seek to amend legislation we always work on the premise that the legislation before us is the benchmark of what is right and what is wrong, and we just try to adjust it accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA> Proposed new section 12b, definition of ``class 2 general offence'', subparagraphs (b) (v) and (vi), leave out the subparagraphs. </PARA>
<PARA>We are still of the view that this would be better legislation if it specified the offences that come within this definitional provision. Nevertheless, realistically, it is impossible to do that from this side of the chamber at this stage of the debate. On the other hand, Senator Macklin was quite persuasive in his comments about not wanting to exclude the provision in relation to trafficking in narcotic drugs. Therefore, we would be excluding the reference to serious fraud or serious loss of revenue of the Commonwealth or the Australian Capital Territory. If this amendment attracts the support of the Committee, I would not want it to be thought that there may not be, within that description, offences which should be specified in the legislation. There may well be. We invite the Government, during its last few months of office, to consider amending this provision so that it specifies the offences which it wishes to be covered by this regulatory regime. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sorry that I confused the listening device provision with the telecommunication interception device provision. The latter is referred to in the Bill and the former is included within the amendment to the Bill which the Government has put today. In those circumstances, I hope that my confusion can be forgiven. In fact, I have amendments to both, so that makes it all the more complicated. I seek leave to amend my amendment in the way I have outlined, and that would also include not pursuing my amendment No. 2. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate that the Government will, without dividing, oppose Senator Hill's amendment. I understand the reasoning which Senator Macklin put forward which has proved attractive in negotiation between the Opposition and the Australian Democrats. I think that Senator Crichton-Browne hinted at a reason why it should not be accepted; that is, since the time of Mr Frank Costigan QC and his revelation of the terrible damage that is done to society by persons who engage in fraud against the tax base of this country, which provides the money for the elected governments of this country to carry out their programs, it has been found not to be as easy as it was thought 10 years ago to distinguish between serious criminal activity, being that which affects individuals and which involves identifiable crimes such as assault, battery or rape, and those cases where the whole of society is greatly damaged by major fraud carrying severe penalties, as indicated by the Parliament saying that the offence if proved could carry a term of imprisonment of not less than seven years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst there are true distinctions between an offence which leads to a personal injury and one that defrauds the general revenue, I do not think they have the significance which would allow the dropping of clauses (5) and (6) out of the paragraph relating to the definition of class 2 general offences. I might also, as a matter of good faith, say that I will undertake, in relation to the comprehensive legislation which we hope to bring forward next year in relation to this whole area--</PARA>

<PARA> Proposed new subsection 12j (3), leave out, ``, using''. </PARA>
<PARA>I foreshadowed this amendment in the second reading debate. It concerns technical assistance being given in relation to listening devices. We accept that technical assistance might be given in relation to maintaining, testing or recovering listening devices but we argue that the Government, by including the word `using', has confused the issue and may well allow an interpretation that such technical assistance goes to operating the listening device, whereas that should clearly be limited to the police officer. Therefore, I have moved the very simple amendment that the word `using' be deleted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will not be supporting Senator Hill's amendment. The problem I have with the amendment is that it seems to me that, of all the things relating to technical assistance, using it may be the most important issue. Maintaining and testing is all very well, but if one is confronted with some of the devices that Senator Hill and I have seen, knowing how to use the thing would be of great assistance. Without that I cannot see why one would bother. The reference here seems to be straightforward enough. We are talking about technical assistance, and it is covered under the exercise of powers under the warrant. Under sub-clause (2), a designated technical officer may provide technical assistance to a member. This merely says what type of technical assistance one is going to get and the basic one, I would have thought, would be using it, otherwise there would not be much point in having it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was wavering but I am compelled by Senator Macklin's argument to respond. It must be the case that obviously ensuring that the device is functioning properly, at the time that one needs it to function properly, is the key to securing the assistance of a technical person. I think a couple of things ought to be said. Firstly, it ought to be very clear from proposed section 12j, on page 7, that it is always the case that the warrant is obtained by and is authorising activity by a sworn police officer. It is not as though the technical officer can go on a frolic of his or her own; it is always in assistance to a member. For example, proposed section 12j (2) reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . a designated technical officer may provide technical assistance to a member who is exercising the authority conferred by the warrant. </PARA>
<PARA>It is always the sworn member who is exercising the authority conferred by the warrant and the technical assistance is rendered to that member. I believe that that is an additional point which might weigh with the Committee in considering the amendment that Senator Hill has proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> The technical assistant is also a member of the Australian Federal Police; I think that also has to be remembered. We are not talking about a technical assistant brought in on a contract or somebody who is phoned up at the local electrician's to come in and give some assistance to the sworn police member-it will be another member of the Federal Police. In that situation we have, particularly with the unified work force concept, a very real protection against the abuse of this situation which perhaps Senator Hill feared. For all those reasons, in addition to the compelling reason put forward by Senator Macklin, I would ask the Committee to reject the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am just looking for a piece of paper which indicates that what the Federal Government is attempting to do here has already been done in the case of New South Wales over the last two years. The Legal Profession Act 1987 No. 109 of New South Wales provided that the Crown Solicitor may act under subsection 2 with or without charge, or for a party in a matter that is not the subject of litigation even if also acting under that subsection for another party in the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I understand it, the Opposition amendment would have the effect of requiring an Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) officer, who is asked by one client for advice on an issue that involves another entity for which the AGS may act, to consider whether the issue might be expected to give rise to litigation. It would not suffice for him or her to confine himself or herself to the content of the request for advice and conclude that as he or she simply has no means of forming a reasonable opinion on the prospect of litigation the situation is one which is not reasonably expected to give rise to litigation. The officer concerned would be obliged to make some inquiry as to the prospects of litigation and would need for this purpose perhaps to consult both the client and the other possible party or parties. For each of those consulted the issue would turn primarily on the, as yet, undetermined content of the advice to be given. Furthermore, the issue of whether to litigate an issue arising between Commonwealth agencies would commonly not be decided without prime ministerial consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the sort of simplification of the situation, as attempted to be achieved by the Government amendment, ought to be accepted. I believe that the Opposition amendment would be extremely difficult actually to operate. But, as I have said, I think that we have already had some experience in another jurisdiction, in New South Wales, where a similar provision to that which is proposed has been operating successfully for two years. I believe that in that situation the Committee could feel able to accept the Government amendment and reject that proposed by the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposition that the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) puts seems to us to be a reasonable one. The difficulty I have with the Opposition's amendment is identical to one of the reasons raised by the Government; that is, the difficulty of being able to ascertain whether or not something may give rise to litigation. Those types of circumstances certainly would not be known to the officer and, in some circumstances, could very well be a delicate matter that resides in some other area. Senator Hill, quite rightly, proposes to substitute the words `are not reasonably expected to give rise to litigation'. That, as it were, softens the blow and suggests, to all intents and purposes, a thorough and conscientious investigation. The Minister does raise a rather intriguing idea that the matter becomes a conundrum inasmuch as what might give rise to litigation might actually depend on the advice which is being asked about in the first place. That would be an impossible situation to disentangle. I think that it might be best, therefore, to stay with the Government's proposition, the more restricted and certainly definite context, because we know whether the litigation is under way. We should trial that exercise. The proposition put forward by Senator Hill might make it more restricted. It might not turn up even in the New South Wales system, which the Minister has referred to, or even under this system. I think that it might have been more beneficial to do it in the way that Senator Hill has suggested. The difficulty that has been raised is sufficient to indicate that we should not go down that path and that we should stay with the certainty of at least knowing about the matter which is being litigated.</PARA></TALK.START>

Therefore, I must say that I do not launch into this with great confidence. Nevertheless, whilst I have great respect for Senator Macklin, I think that he did misinterpret the technical assistance provisions of the previous debate. What we are doing here is defining what amounts to technical assistance. Once we have so defined that expression, then we give that power to designated technical officers. It is so defined by this provision to include use. Therefore, I stand by the position that I argued earlier that by virtue of this definitional provision--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No; the technical assistance we are speaking about is having the capacity to do this work. Technical officers can only conduct technical assistance. Technical assistance is defined by the Government's provision to include use. We would like to presume that the Government and the police officers will not utilise the provisions in that way, but I do not think that as a legislature we should so assume and, therefore, it is our responsibility to legislate language that is unambiguous and in this instance there should not be a confusion that would allow in our view-on a strict reading of this language-a technical officer to carry out the function or operation of the telecommunication interception device which should be reserved for those designated police officers who have that responsibility.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the time-honoured manner, and with great respect to Senator Hill, I think the suggestion that we should completely redefine the word `assistance' is not on. It is assistance with use. What has occurred in the last amendment occurs here. Which button should be pushed? Having been confronted with this huge array of buttons, a person wants to know which button to push to get the silly thing started to actually record. In one part of Senator Hill's speech he spoke about technical officers using the equipment. This is not a definition of technical officers; it is, in fact, a definition of technical assistance. It still has to be assistance. A person cannot in any way operate in an assisting fashion if he takes over the role of the operator; he has to assist. A person could be sitting in this desk with a warrant and next to him could be a person with technical assistance showing him which button to push. That would be technical assistance. It would be perfectly legitimate under the Act to sit in the back of a car doing a mobile surveillance exercise. I do not think that any of the people who have a warrant to undertake these exercises ought to have any understanding of how the machinery works.

It cannot be emphasised enough that the technical officer is a member of the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and is, under the unified workforce concept, working alongside and part of the team which constitutes the Australian Federal Police. Nevertheless, it remains true that the execution of the warrant can only be undertaken by the sworn police member, but the designated technical officer is as much a member of the AFP as is that sworn police member.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There need not be the sort of concern which seems to underlie Senator Hill's amendment that would lead one to have to specify each technical officer who might be involved in ensuring that the equipment operates successfully.

I acknowledge the point raised by the Minister that this amendment will make things more difficult. However, one of the advantages of Senator Hill's amendment is that it makes things more definite. The Government's philosophy throughout this exercise has been to make things definite, predictable and understandable. I hoped that we would not go to the other extreme and have a warrant with a large number of names on it, hoping to catch everybody who may attend as a technical assistant. I suppose that is legally possible but it certainly would be an abuse of what I hope the Committee is about, that is, knowing quite definitely and in writing-after all, the Government has not sought this information verbally; it has sought to have the information in writing-the names of the people involved. That would provide, in terms of litigation that may arise, a certainty that would be useful.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure Hansard will manage. As honourable senators would be aware, I spent quite some considerable time today in conference with officials from Athletics Australia and the Australian Commonwealth Games Association to try to reach a settlement of this dispute. The important thing to note about this dispute in the last few weeks is that there are many things, of which I am aware, that I have not made public and have quite deliberately not done so because I sought a solution. I never sought simply to take sides or to try, as the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, to make decisions which, quite properly, belong with the sporting groups themselves. Today it has been agreed that Mr John Coates, one of the foremost sporting administrators in the country-he managed the last Olympic Games team, is the chairman of the selection review panel of the Australian Olympic Federation, has had a long and distinguished career as an administrator in rowing and was also vice-chairman of the Sports Commission; he has a pretty impressive line of credits to his name-should step in and settle some real questions that have been raised about the 85 athletes and whether or not all 85 of them ought to be going to the Commonwealth Games.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I said when speaking to the motion this morning that it would be inappropriate for and remiss of the Senate, unaware as honourable senators must be of some of the goings on in this dispute in the last few weeks, let alone the selection criteria which need to be met for these athletes to go, to make a decision. I put it to the Senate that as we now have agreement between the parties, we have an expert in the field of selection and management of sporting teams-I might say the foremost expert in this field in the country-now arbitrating upon this decision in the certain knowledge that his decision will be accepted by both sides, why do we need to pass any resolution of this kind? The reality is that Mr Coates could recommend 40, 50, 60 or 85 athletes. It will be up to him, as he talks to Athletics Australia, to go through the records of the athletes, to go through the selection criteria, and then make a recommendation to the Commonwealth Games Association. Naturally enough, it is in the position of okaying the teams, so a document will have to be produced for it, and that is proper. But it has indicated-and has said so publicly today-that it will accept his recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of all that, any statement here that says `We accept the 85' really is the height of folly. It may be that the 85 athletes go, and it is certainly true that I and a number of others have kept out of the public arena a great many things that have happened in this area in the last few weeks, because to canvass them then-indeed, to canvass them now-would only have exacerbated a situation which I have spent a great deal of time and effort today sorting out. It would give me a thrill in some respects to stand up and go through some of these arguments, but it should be enough for honourable senators to know, as is acknowledged by Athletics Australia as well as the Commonwealth Games Association, that selection criteria certainly have been an issue in the last few weeks. Obviously, when one gets into personal disputes, it is all about who said what to whom, on what day, was there a telephone hook-up or not, who said there should and should not be, et cetera, but behind those sorts of spats real questions have been raised, and I think today I came up with the only real way of resolving that, short of the continuation of a brawl that is doing Australian sport great harm. </PARA>
<PARA> Having managed to get the agreement of the Commonwealth Games Association and Athletics Australia to this process, I think it would be much more appropriate for the Senate to defeat Senator Crichton-Browne's motion and endorse what has been done today. That is the only course of action that makes sense for the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I raise a couple of points in closing the debate on my motion. The first is that I did not have an opportunity to respond this morning, but I want to say that I find it offensive for Senator Richardson to suggest that he is the only one who has any knowledge of these things. I think there is a touch of irony about the portly and corpulent Senator Richardson telling us that he is the expert on sport in this country or that he is the font of all wisdom. Senator Richardson said at his press conference that the Senate does not select the team. This motion does not seek to select the team; it simply expresses a view about a whole range of things. No doubt when the team comes back with gold medals the Government will be first on its feet moving motions congratulating the athletes on their endeavours.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can assure Senator Richardson there will be no race with us. The truth is that this Senate is simply expressing a point of view, which is that 85 young Australian athletes, both men and women, have had to fulfil criteria set down for them by Athletics Australia, the body that controls track and field events for the Commonwealth Games. It has selected 85 athletes. Athletics Australia looked at the performance at the last Commonwealth Games of each one of those athletes and used that as its criterion to decide that they would have qualified for the finals. In fact, it would go further than that and say that on the best performances thus far of the athletes they are capable of qualifying for the finals of these Commonwealth Games.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can only tell it as it is. I can think of no more cruel fate than for 85 young men and women, having been told that they are going to the Commonwealth Games, now to find that they are going to be culled and some kid is going to have to hand back his blazer as a result of some bureaucratic mess, some disagreement between Athletics Australia and the Australian Commonwealth Games Association. It has never been publicly suggested before, to my knowledge, that anything has been wrong with the selection criteria of Athletics Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let it be understood that each sport has its own panel of selectors. The Australian Bowls Council selects its own bowlers; badminton's governing body selects its own badminton players; the swimming federation selects its own swimmers; and Athletics Australia selects its own athletes, and that is what it has done. It is the first time that the question of selection has been raised publicly, and it would be a bitter disappointment, of course, to any kid now to be denied a place. To my knowledge, there has been no question about the selection procedures for any other team. If my memory serves me correctly, every other team will have filled its quota. In the case of athletics, Athletics Australia is entitled to fill 118 positions, and it has selected but 85 athletes whom it has judged fill the criteria. It will not serve any purpose to explain why it originally selected 70, but it was in part thanks to the help of the drugs offensive funding that these kids were able to produce performances which raised the number of those fit to be in the category. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply conclude by saying that it would be heartbreaking now to dismiss any of these athletes, who on their ability have been selected by the panel of selectors given the responsibility by the Commonwealth Games Association to select the track and field team. The Senate is simply expressing the point of view that those young men and women, having been selected, ought now to be entitled to represent their country in Auckland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is now dealing with a package of three primary industries Bills which the Government has programmed as absolutely essential for passage this session. The first Bill, the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, was in fact introduced into the House of Representatives on 8 March and is an omnibus Bill which amends 10 Acts and repeals 13 within the primary industries and energy portfolio. The second Bill, the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1989, is also an omnibus Bill which seeks to amend 11 Acts and repeal four Acts within the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio. This third Bill, the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Bill 1989, which was introduced into the other place on 4 October of this year, proposes to establish research and development corporations in respect of primary industries, including energy, replacing the present research councils and committees which administer the allocation of research and development program funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We support the thrust of these Bills as far as they go. In particular, we support the removal of redundant legislation and the improvements in funding of primary industries research and development to increase the economic, environmental and social benefits to the rural and wider community. That is consistent with the aims of the coalition's Economic Action Plan. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is first and foremost a trading nation. The living standards of all Australians depend on our success in world markets across the board-agricultural and mineral products, manufactures and services. These Bills address some of these concerns. To develop new products and diversify markets we must ensure that our major export industries are as competitive and innovative as possible in world terms. We must come up with new and better products and concentrate on quality. The decisions to corporatise councils and increase involvement in the determination of long-term research and development strategies and facilitate the commercial exploitation of the results of research and development efforts is a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA> Even though on the farm or in the mine we rank amongst the most competitive producers in the world, we often pay away much of that competitive advantage as we move products via domestic transportation, especially road and rail, clear products across the waterfront or put them on a coastal ship. This is due to the significant cost inefficiencies in those infrastructure industries. We wish that the Government would turn its mind to reform of those infrastructure industries. That is a nettle that the Government simply refuses to grasp. The problem, of course, is the relationship between the trade union movement and the Hawke-Keating Government. Nevertheless, the Government seems to be prepared to grasp some nettles in relation to primary production. Our producers have found themselves having to operate with excessively high interest rates, volatile exchange rates and other disadvantages due to labour market costs and practices. The coal industry is particularly exposed and, in addition, has to compete in a highly competitive and cut-throat international market. </PARA>
<PARA> The third Bill of this package is complex. It is deficient in some areas and it imposes on the coal industry an unwanted Coal Industry Research and Development Corporation. I will be moving a series of amendments to meet industry concerns and to clarify the intent of the legislation. Concerned industry and my colleagues in the other place have engaged in protracted discussions with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) in an endeavour to correct the deficiencies in the research and development Bill. Counsel spent some 2 1/2 days preparing our amendments, which industry perceives as essential. I have been told that the Minister recognises the justification for these amendments but has been unable to persuade his ministerial colleagues to accept them. </PARA>
<PARA> The first in the package is the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 which, as I said, is an omnibus Bill designed to make a number of amendments to existing legislation and to repeal outdated and unused legislation. The six related petroleum (submerged lands) Acts are amended so as to allow for the determination of fees and securities for petroleum exploration by way of regulation rather than by amendment of the principal Act. The amendments incorporate what are called Henry VIII clauses that will permit a fee to be set by regulation without an upper limit being provided in the Act. The Minister claims that the changes will allow for timely adjustment of fees to more closely reflect actual administrative costs. With the high inflation generated by this Government's policies-in particular, its accord with the Australian Council of Trade Unions-the Minister's response to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee's criticisms of this clause is understandable. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Departments should be able to set a level of fees which allows sufficient flexibility to ensure that Parliamentary scrutiny is maintained without the necessity of fees being amended at too frequent intervals. </PARA>
<PARA>That was a predictable but unsatisfactory response by the Minister. The Committee said, rightly, that it was `of the opinion that the inclusion of maximum fees in a Bill need not involve the lengthy period envisioned by the Minister, and that it is possible to include appropriate formulae in legislation to reflect changes in administrative costs over time'. It should not be beyond the wit of the Minister and his Department to devise a legislative measure to cover the Committee's concerns rather than using the repugnant Henry VIII clause. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government and these Ministers do not seem to understand our objection that the Parliament cannot amend a regulation-it can only disallow it. By adopting this form, the Government puts the Parliament in a position where ultimately it will have only one choice-accept or reject the Government's regulation. The Parliament will not be allowed to amend it. Let me explain this by giving a practical example which even members of the Australian Labor Party might understand. When we were in government I recall Senator Cavanagh coming to me about a proposed change to workers compensation legislation whereby the amount of compensation provided for, say, a broken leg or an amputated finger, or whatever it was, was to be determined by regulation. Senator Cavanagh pointed out to me that that meant that if, for example, the compensation for the particular injury was increased to, say, $10,000 from $8,000 and the Senate was of the view that $10,000 was not adequate, the Senate would not be able to amend the regulation to increase the amount from $10,000 to, say, $12,000. All the Senate could do would be to reject the regulation which increased the amount from $8,000 to $10,000. Of course, that would mean that the compensation would go back to $8,000, which would be directly contrary to what the Senate wanted to do. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the objection which the Parliament has to putting these sorts of things into regulations instead of into a Bill. This practice takes away the opportunity of the Parliament to vary the figure in accordance with what the Parliament thinks is proper and leaves the Parliament in a position where all it can do is reject the regulation rather than vary it. That is our objection to this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> The only significant change made in this Bill is to the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987. The present Act does not recognise the practical difference between propagation from seed and the faster process of asexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction of plants can take place from either cuttings or tissue culture, and reproduction is much faster via this method than it is through the sexual propagation of plants from seed. At the moment, people can buy a few protected plants and asexually propagate dozens or even hundreds of plants in a short time. While these cannot be sold, what they produce-their flowers and fruit-can be. We support this amendment which protects the holders of plant rights by giving them sole rights to asexual propagate their plants themselves or license others to do so for the purpose of using the produce commercially. </PARA>
<PARA> This does not affect persons who want to asexually propagate plants for their own use, but will prevent the sale of any of the plants' produce. In relation to the first Bill, the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate is of the view that the bill should be amended to ensure that the fees and securities to be prescribed by regulations in respect of petroleum exploration activities should not exceed the relevant minimum administrative costs incurred by the Commonwealth, the States or the Northern Territory in carrying out their respective obligations under the legislation''. </PARA>
<PARA>The second Bill establishes a wool research and development council by making amendments to the Wool Marketing Act 1987 and makes minor amendments to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation Act to allow the Corporation to invest surplus money. The way the honey levy is collected is simplified by the Bill. Membership of the Soil Conservation Council is increased from seven to 12. The number of forms involved in various grain levies is reduced from 20 to four. An amendment allows the research component of funds raised by the wheat levy to be transferred to the Wheat Research Trust Fund. The Bass Strait freight adjustment levy Acts which were terminated in 1987 are repealed. </PARA>
<PARA> We also support this Bill in which the Government has recognised that the wool industry, unlike other industries, did not want a research and development corporation but a council under the umbrella of the Australian Wool Corporation. This year some $56m will be spent on wool research and development, making it the largest rural industry fund. The responsible Department is to be complimented on reducing the number of forms involved in various grain levies from 20 to four. That example should be taken on board by all departments. </PARA>
<PARA> The third Bill, the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Bill 1989 is the most complex. The main thrust of this Bill is supported by the coalition as it allows the current research councils and committees to become research and development corporations and provides for the funding and administration of research and development into primary industries. Rural industry research funds provide for government and private sector involvement in financing industry-specific agricultural research and development and for private sector participation in determining priorities for that expenditure. These funds receive income from levies imposed on commodities and from Commonwealth matching contributions. The corporations will have wide powers to apply for patents, establish committees, employ staff and set employment conditions, charge for services, enter into joint ventures on research and development, acquire property, form companies, act as trustee and accept gifts and borrow money with the written approval of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Primary industry organisations generally favour a corporation instead of a council because of these powers. They say that councils are handicapped by having to observe public service rates of pay and conditions of employment. As a corporation they will be free to employ people on contracts for the term of a particular piece of research. That is sensible and in accord with the coalition's industrial relations policy. We are glad to see that the Government now recognises the merits of that policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Similar research and development corporations have already been established for the meat and horticulture industries. The dairy industry was inspired by the better research program targeting and control in the meat and livestock industries with the creation of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation and lobbied the Government to extend the concept. The wool industry, on the other hand, opted for a council under the umbrella of the Australian Wool Corporation and this is established in the previous Bill, that is, the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3). Initially the research and development corporations to be established on 1 July 1990 include dairy, grain, coal, natural resources and energy. A rural research and development corporation will also be established to replace the Australian Special Rural Research Council which looks after smaller industries. Each corporation must establish a five-year plan and have it approved by the Minister. The corporations will be responsible to the Minister to see that the plan is carried out. A major objective, which has our support, is the removal of duplication and the intent that corporations should develop a close liaison with each other to ensure this. For example, many areas of soil research will have benefits for several of the corporations and could be jointly funded. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition parties are proposing a number of amendments. The Australian Dairy Industry Conference (ADIC) seeks an amendment to allow contributions from dairy factories to be considered as dairy industry money for the purpose of attracting the dollar for dollar Commonwealth finance. The ADIC claims this would be fairer than the levy on all milk because much of the research favours manufactured products and the milk supplied by many farmers is used only for liquid milk and is not used for dairy products. It would also ensure commercial involvement with the research and development corporation and close involvement between the dairy companies and the corporation. At the moment dairy farmers are contributing about 0.2 per cent of the value of their product and the Government is prepared to match dollar for dollar up to 0.5 per cent. It will take a few years for the dairy program to reach this target. Because the vast majority of the dairy companies are cooperatives it could be argued that money from them for research would actually be grower money that these factories would contribute. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a precedent in the horticultural legislation which allows contributions from companies. However, the Government argues this was a very special deal to try to attract the many small industries to join the horticultural research effort. The Government also claims that many companies would be eligible for the Government 150 per cent tax write-off for research and development and should not get any further assistance. Our amendment specifically addresses this problem and precludes double dipping. We also want to ensure that the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research Development Corporation debacle over annual meetings is not repeated, that is, to ensure research corporations are not forced to hold annual meetings when there is no business to conduct or the business of the meeting could be done in writing at a considerable saving in costs. Research and development corporations will be accountable to those who provide the funds and they will be required to table an annual report in Parliament. Either an annual report or meeting will be provided to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Distinct from the corporatisation program envisaged for the rural industries, the intent is also to corporatise the operations of the national energy research development and demonstration program which is currently overseen by the National Energy Research Development and Demonstration Council. Currently the National Energy Research and Development Demonstration Council carries out research into energy related matters as well as coal research. Coal related research is funded primarily by way of a compulsory levy, known as the coal production excise, at a levy rate of 5c per tonne of black coal. Funds spent by the Council on coal research beyond the amount of the industry levy are drawn from the coal industry trust fund, which is itself the product of accumulated coal industry excise contributions. The Council's other energy related research is funded by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The corporation program seeks to split the Council into two distinct corporate research and development corporations: the National Energy Research and Development Corporation, which I will call the energy corporation, and the Coal Industry Research and Development Corporation, which I will call the coal corporation. We support the coal industry's view that the proposed coal corporation is unnecessary. The coal corporation will be funded only by way of the coal excise, a levy on the industry. There will be no taxpayers' funds involved. The coal industry trust account will be transferred to the energy corporation. Funding arrangements are to be reviewed after the close of the 1992-93 financial year. Specific funding arrangements are not dealt with in the legislation, which is of a generic, umbrella type. The Department, however, has confirmed repeatedly that no appropriations will be used to underwrite or contribute to the Coal Industry Research and Development Corporation. The coal industry spends millions of dollars on independent research each year and such research is essential if it is to remain competitive and retain and expand its overseas markets. This industry knows what it is doing. If no taxpayers' funds are to be put into its research efforts, there is no need for its research to be overseen by some government bureaucracy. Quite simply, the Government should keep out of it. The industry, which is perceived as already suffering an excessive degree of Commonwealth intervention, cannot conceive how the Coal Industry Research and Development Corporation could add to the industry's efficiencies or the urgent need for deregulation in the industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the sitting of the Senate was suspended for dinner I was addressing the third Bill in this package of Bills-the Bill which deals with research and development corporations. In particular, I was addressing the proposed Research and Development Corporation for the coal mining industry. I was pointing out that no taxpayers' funds are involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The coal mining industry knows what it is doing. It spends an enormous amount of money on research each year. The coalition parties simply say: Why is this Government imposing upon the coal industry a research body which it simply does not want and which this Government is requiring the coal industry to fund? Is the Government saying that the coal industry is not spending enough money on research? Is the Government saying that its research efforts are not adequate? Is the Government saying that it needs to be directed in some way by the Government? I put it to the Senate that that would be a nonsense. The industry knows what it needs to do. It is a successful industry. It is out there in a cutthroat world market and the capital expenditure involved is enormous. Quite simply, the Government should keep out of it. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have mentioned, this industry is already perceived as suffering from an excessive degree of Commonwealth intervention. One could not conceive of how the new Coal Industry Research and Development Corporation could add to industry efficiencies or fulfil the urgent need for deregulation of the industry. The coal industry wishes to model its research efforts on the model used by the minerals sector, which carries out an ambitious research program through the Australian Minerals Industry Research Association, which body acts as a broker for the minerals sector and which has facilitated an active research and development program, spending some $7m to $10m per annum, in addition to private sector research of about $15m. That is the sort of model that the coal industry wishes to adopt. The return on the dollar in private sector research and development is much greater than that which is circulated through a bureaucratic network, such as the proposed Coal Industry Research and Development Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition's resources and energy policy supports the present national energy research, development and demonstration program and it follows that we support the establishment of the proposed National Energy Research and Development Corporation but not, as I have said, the establishment of the Coal Industry Research and Development Corporation, which appears to us to be wasteful and bureaucratic and, at best, would duplicate much of the work already being carried out by the coal industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for the Government pressing ahead with the Coal Industry Research and Development Corporation in the face of industry opposition is difficult to understand. The effectiveness of the current national energy research, development and demonstration program is under review and a report is expected in April 1990. The Industry Commission has under way an inquiry into mining and minerals processing which will report in February 1991. Both of these reviews will look at the coal industry's research and development effort. The establishment of another public research institution before the findings of these inquiries is simply not sustainable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this cognate debate on three pieces of primary industry and energy legislation, I will concentrate my remarks on what is really the major Bill in this package, the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Bill 1989, but just preface those remarks by saying that the Australian Democrats will not be supporting the Opposition's second reading amendment to the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), the first Bill in this package.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrats commend the Government for initiating the further restructuring of primary industries and energy research. Australia compares poorly in general terms with other countries in its level of investment in research and development, with the exception of expenditure on agricultural research and development, which compares more than favourably with our overseas counterparts. Under these new arrangements, this tradition will be enhanced by building and expanding the efforts undertaken by the research and development councils formed under the Rural Industries Research Act 1985 to administer the rural industry research funds. This Bill proposes to establish research and development corporations, and a rural industries research and development corporation, to provide for funding and administration of research and development into agricultural industries and energy. </PARA>
<PARA> The present research councils and committees will be replaced by the R &amp; D Corporations with their much wider commercial powers. Their objective will be to improve the funding of primary industries in order to bring about a more efficient and effective research and development effort to enable this sector, long established as a major force in Australia's economic picture, to continue to improve and expand and remain on a par with our competitors in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats believe that an important aspect of these new arrangements will be the facilitation of collaboration between corporations. This will create opportunities for wider dissemination of information and activity leading to improvements in the industry as a whole. Soil research is an area that comes very quickly to mind as being likely to benefit from this new form of arrangement. We believe it is important in the area of land degradation and in a number of other areas-in general, perhaps, I would term it as in the area of sustainable agriculture-to move away from single industry research into cross-commodity research. Questions of monoculture and its impact on our fragile resource base can and, we hope, will be addressed more readily under this sort of system. </PARA>
<PARA> While we approach the major purpose of this Bill with general support and are pleased that the Government has moved to initiate a restructuring of the R &amp; D effort in the primary industries area, we are concerned at the apparent reluctance on the part of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) to take on board some concerns that are fairly insignificant in terms of the Government's overall purpose but are very important from the industries' point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> In his second reading speech the Minister placed considerable emphasis on the importance that he places on accountability of the corporations to both government and industry-a sentiment that we wholeheartedly endorse. However, it is clear that industry is of the opinion that the Bill does not go far enough in this direction. The dairy and grains industries, in particular, and the National Farmers Federation as the umbrella body, have raised a number of matters with both the Opposition and the Australian Democrats, of which the Minister is also aware. As a result amendments will be introduced by both the Opposition and the Democrats in the committee stage designed to address the industries' concerns, generally to strengthen the requirements for accountability to and consultation with industry by the research and development corporations. The Australian Democrats will be supporting most but not all of those amendments, and I will comment further about that in the committee stage. Those amendments which have the emphasis of strengthening accountability and consultation processes have our support. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a few points that I would like to make about research and development in general, along with some other concerns that the Democrats have in relation to this particular Bill. At the National Agricultural Outlook Conference held at the beginning of this year the major contribution made by research in improving on-farm efficiency and hence overall agricultural productivity growth over the last 20 years was properly highlighted. However, Tony Gregson from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) pointed out that:</PARA>
<PARA>These productivity gains have to be weighed against the negative impacts of land degradation, including increasing soil acidity and salinity, and the general decline in the social fabric of the smaller country communities. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are issues which the Democrats address on a regular basis in this place. As I have said already, we believe that the new structure for research and development provides the opportunity for action across commodity groups which will be very important in looking at both the ecological and social effects of some aspects of our agricultural development in the past and will take us into a future which will be productive and economically, ecologically and socially sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a feature of our agricultural and rural scene that the problems of rural communities continue to increase as the problems found on the farms increase. That is a flow-on from an increased efficiency, and increased sensitivity in the production in this country and an increased diversity. As we look to markets overseas, which we must and which the primary industry sector does, we must also always have as an emphasis an increase in diversity so that we are looking at ranges of new products so that we can fill market niches when they occur. It will not surprise anyone in the Senate to hear me say on behalf of the Australian Democrats that we hope a clear focus along with a cross-commodity approach in these new research and development corporations and under these new arrangements should be one on the development of sustainable agriculture, in particular on a reduced reliance on chemical production, a sensitivity about the problems of monoculture and, in general, some reasonably significant changes that could be of enormous benefit to us in this country particularly in carving out some market niches in the area of clean food for the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> For several years the Democrats have been pressing successive governments to take urgent, comprehensive and effective action on the issue of land degradation. We have a strong and ongoing commitment to the environment. We recognise that this is by far the most serious of Australia's many environmental problems; yet, we still have a shortage of soil scientists. I must say that in my work toward sustainable agriculture I have found that as a group soil scientists are very sensitive to the needs in that area. I am often disturbed that in the public debate soil erosion seems to be the key focus. When people think about land degradation, they tend to see soil erosion-gullies rippling across paddocks and dust storms coming over cities in dry summers. I think we need to remind ourselves that land degradation goes further than that. </PARA>
<PARA> The next problem that people think of is salinity. This is another area of land degradation which is clearly visible. People can go to areas which, regrettably, are increasing in this country and see salinity and its results. Leaving those two aspects aside, there are two other serious issues. Loss of nutrients in the soil, which reduces the fertility and therefore the productivity of the soil, is an issue in land degradation which is not immediately obvious. It is not a gripping issue for the general public and, I suggest, to many politicians and others in the community. Many people do not even consider it as an aspect of land degradation; yet it is a growing problem, one which has been brought about by a range of practices. Research and development in this area is enormously important. We must recognise the problem and then attempt to do something about it. It may well mean that there will have to be some quite dramatic changes in the systems of farming that we use in this country. Changes will have to take place and, with a good body of research and development behind us, we will be much better placed to make them. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area is the pollution of our soil which is caused mainly by chemicals. Again, that is an area of land degradation which is not obvious to the eye. It is obvious to the farmer whose farm may be quarantined, and it is obvious to the farmer who cannot produce certain products that he might have been able to produce otherwise. I raise those matters in this debate because one often hears people say, `We have beaten the land degradation problem on our farm or district because we do contour ploughing and have put in some drainage'. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Brownhill" NAMEID="RD4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O14">Senator POWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am aware that certain honourable senators from New South Wales involve themselves in strip cropping, a very basic farming technique which is good for the land. But often people say, `We are doing this so we are stopping gullies being formed and water and wind erosion.' They may even acknowledge some of the salinity problems which, as I say, are very obvious, and look at some of the new techniques of layout and changes in irrigation. They may even say, `We are planting lots of trees on the watersheds, therefore, we are beating salinity and that is all we really need to do.' But we must address these hidden problems of loss of nutrients and pollution of the soil. I commend these problems to the new research and development corporations, and call on them to use the facility they will have under this legislation to work together across commodity groups.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, we have a shortage of soil scientists, and that needs to be looked at. We commend the Federal Government, of course, for its $320m funding package for the decade of land care. But we are disturbed because we believe that the Government has abrogated its leadership responsibility by not moving for uniform model soil conservation legislation for adoption by the States. We believe that the Government is walking away from looking seriously at a national assessment of land capability to meet the first requirement of the national soil conservation program. We also want the Federal Government to provide assistance to farmers in the task of preventing and alleviating land degradation in all of its forms. With a shortage of soil scientists, that is a matter of concern to us. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter of concern, about which I have been reminded in my discussions with representatives of the dairy industry, is the constraints being placed on rural research and development because of the lack of an adequate basic research infrastructure in this country. There has been a broad debate in recent times about our failure in this country to really meet our broad research needs. I alluded to that at the beginning of my remarks. While rural research has led out front, this sector suffers as a result of the lack of basic research support in the general sense that basic scientific research-which very often does not appear to come up with anything that is concrete and significant in the short term-is very important. It is from a strong support for that kind of research that we could expect the number of soil scientists to grow. </PARA>
<PARA> Problems in the CSIRO, for instance, which I will not canvass at this point, are the sorts of things I am talking about here. As well, universities and other research institutions are scraping the bottom of the barrel in order to be able to continue in basic research. It has been said, and I agree, that the major resource in research is the minds of research scientists. If we do not keep our scientists, we certainly do not keep their minds. Again, Tony Gregson, at the National Agricultural Outlook Conference, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Our rural resource base is fragile and easily degraded; unless we develop land use systems and farming practices which restore and sustain the ability to produce, we will lose our capacity to be an efficient long-term earner of export income. Yet there is now a lack of soil chemists and scientists with an understanding of the physical characteristics of soils. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a major concern, as I have said, which we draw attention to in this debate. We need to assure that research scientists are being trained in all appropriate areas. There are many areas of severe shortage. We need to encourage students by offering adequate incentives to take up careers in agricultural science, in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> Another concern which has been raised by the National Farmers Federation, and which was alluded to by the shadow Minister for primary industry, Mr Lloyd, during the debate in the other chamber, is the question of extension services. That matter is, of course, raised in this legislation, and I know the Government has some concerns about that as well. State governments, and through them their State departments of agriculture, are in many cases reducing their extension services. States, of course, have had severe funding cuts in recent years as part of the economic constraints which have been placed upon all of us in order that the Government should satisfy the international money markets with a $9 billion-plus surplus. In some ways one might sympathise with the States, as one of their economies has been to cut back extension services. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Farmers Federation fears that under the existing provisions in this legislation corporations will be turned into both research and development and extension corporations. The National Farmers Federation would have liked an amendment to restrict that extension facility only to research which was funded by a particular research and development corporation. This is not coming forward from the Opposition because it believes it might be too restrictive and, indeed, there is an argument that extension is a proper end product and involvement in research and development. It is important, I think, to say that the funding which is available by virtue of the process of this newly established corporation system should not be, shall I say, unnecessarily and inappropriately syphoned off into extension work. There has not been unanimous support for amending the legislation in this area across commodity groups, again because there is an appropriate role for extension. We are simply saying that that ought to be limited. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been concerned in my own State of Victoria to discover that many of the extension services which would normally have been provided by our State Department of Agriculture are now being provided by the commercial sector, by commercial firms supplying that input. I am concerned about that because of the major agribusiness players such as Elders IXL Ltd, to name just one-but a major one. It does seem to us that all too often the pattern that we have seen in the rural sector is followed, where the major base of information comes from the commercial operation whose major concern is its own profitability, to sell its own product. Clearly, it is not going to advise farmers against using its product whether or not it believes it is the appropriate thing. Some of the issues of soil pollution, of inappropriate use of land and inappropriate inputs in agriculture, stem from that kind of failure to provide a whole range of options and alternatives to farmers through State funded and, indeed, federally funded extension services. </PARA>
<PARA> I have often said in this place that one of the major areas of neglect is in providing producers with information on alternative low or non-chemical production or organic farming. This is still not happening. However, there are developments in that direction which do please us. We do not believe that under this legislation extension services should be provided at the expense of the research and development role of these corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make just a few comments, finally, on the dairy industry. It has requested the support of the Australian Democrats to amend the Bill to permit direct contributions to the Dairy Research and Development Corporation via cooperative companies of the dairy industry to be matched by the Commonwealth on a dollar for dollar basis. There is a perception within the dairy industry that research and development has focused to date on on-farm production research while programs for the manufacturing sector of the industry have lacked commercial relevance, particularly with regard to the development of new products. The Australian Dairy Industry Conference believes that this type of research is best undertaken in collaboration with the cooperative companies-the commercial arm of the dairy industry-and is more appropriately funded through direct contributions to research and development corporations than through a levy on milk. As Senator Lewis has already said many milk producers are producing whole milk products and others are producing for the manufacturing sector. I agree that a levy on milk is not an appropriate mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> We understand the industry's interest in moving in this direction. We are supported by the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation precedent and, indeed, by our knowledge and my understanding, personally having lived in a dairy area for many years, of the nature of that industry. We do not believe that the Government's fears of this being a backdoor way of getting more funding and of keeping the grower contribution low are well founded. The growers are the cooperatives; the cooperatives are the growers-the producers in this case. We believe that it is and will be producer money. The dairy industry faces strong overseas competition and needs to get a competitive edge internationally, particularly because of our closer economic relations with New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA> The short to medium term outlook for the dairy industry is good. Increased prices in Australia emanating from improved international prices are expected to lead to higher milk production until about 1991-92. However, the long term outlook for the dairy industry in Australia is uncertain. Clearly, from 1 July 1990 there will be increased competition from New Zealand. The domestic price support under the Kerin plan will end on 1 July 1992. Beyond 1992, because of the cessation of price support and the possibility of reduced world prices due to increasing self-sufficiency in importing countries and supply response in major producing companies, the Australian dairy industry could experience a downturn in prices. Returns to farmers are likely to be reduced and major structural adjustments are expected to occur in the industry as a result. We believe that this major change to the legislation on behalf of the dairy industry is quite warranted in this particular case. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, there will be a number of amendments in the committee stage. I do not want to hold the Senate up in the second reading debate for too much longer. I simply say that my colleague Senator Coulter will be moving an amendment to the definition section of the legislation. We and the Opposition will have a number of additional amendments in the committee stage. </PARA>

I think that he is in enough trouble as it is with the Acting Deputy President, who had the Minister for breakfast during Question Time and the debates that took place today. I would like to address some remarks to the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1989. This is an omnibus Bill which amends a number of existing Acts. It will also establish a Wool Research and Development Council. The significant points in this legislation relate to arrangements that affect wool marketing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The wool industry knows only too well the effect of market forces. Last year wool growers were the envy of the rural sector. Record wool prices resulted in record ewe prices. At a sale in Hay last year I saw ewes bringing $130 a head, which I believe is a record for ewe prices. The value of wool produced in this country went up by some 30 per cent last year. Countries such as Japan, China and Russia could not get enough of our product, and they were prepared to pay for it. But this year the story has reversed. The international markets have changed. China has withdrawn from the market, and Japan, once an on-seller to China, has reduced its purchases along with other countries. The removal of China from the market is significant, as China had become Australia's second largest buyer. As a consequence, the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) has had to come in and buy. Confidence has gone out of the market and the effects are felt all along the line, right down to the saleyards. Sheep that were worth big money last year have been discounted by 50 per cent or more this year. The AWC has been forced to acquire one million bales, while there were around 9,200 bales in stock from July 1988. This stockpile could easily reach two million bales before the season is finished. However, woolgrowers will be safeguarded because of the floor price scheme. It is, nevertheless, a worrying time for all the wool producers in Australia. This sort of market fluctuation has affected agriculture for years and it will continue to do so. It is for this reason that primary industry will always need to be treated differently from other industries in legislation. Senator Panizza will talk about the wheat industry later in this debate. I hope that people realise that the wheat industry and all primary industries are different from other industries in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Our national woolclip last financial year was a record 882 million kilograms. It was up 41 million kilos on last year. Despite the increase in production, grower returns have not increased comparatively. Last year our wool exports were worth nearly $6 billion. I mention these figures because the industry is of vital significance to Australia. Its historical importance should also be remembered. In wool, Australia has no peers. We grow wool better than anyone else in the world, something that we should be proud of. The expression that `Australia rides on the sheep's back' was once said with pride. Despite this Government's best intentions to prop up every other sector of the economy, Australia is still riding on the sheep's back. In years to come we will be grateful that we have that industry to support us. </PARA>
<PARA> Research and development in the wool industry are key parts of the Australian Wool Corporation's activities. While other industries have corporations, the wool industry decided that it wanted to keep research under the umbrella of the AWC. It is for this reason that, while the Council has been up and running, legislation putting it in place is only now coming through the Senate. The legislation we have before us is a compromise between industry and government. The industry has a great record in research. I note from this year's AWC annual report that the industry's research and development program falls into five main objectives. They are: to increase demand for wool through new products and processes; to increase the efficiency of raw wool marketing; to increase the efficiency of sustainable raw wool production; to determine the impact of the internal and external environment on the industry; and the efficient management of the wool research development program. </PARA>
<PARA> The work being undertaken for the wool industry by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation was discussed in the report of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare on sheep husbandry, of which I was a part. During inspections with that Committee, I had the pleasure of viewing progress being done in biological shearing and robotic shearing, and I had the opportunity to review the research into parasites, genetic engineering and other nutritional and environmental research. In fact, Mr Acting Deputy President, I had a look at robotic shearing in your fair State of Western Australia, as I had a look at robotic shearing in South Australia. It is quite an experience to see something being done that is well ahead of its time. </PARA>
<PARA> The money contributed by taxpayers and wool growers is being well spent. It is significant, I remind honourable senators, that Australia's wool industry earns us $6 billion a year in valuable export dollars. It is very good to see over on the other side of the chamber tonight Senator McKiernan who I know has had a little bit to do with the resource sector, and he is an expert in some, but not all, of those fields. Of course, he did a little bit of damage in his time in the resource sector, but we will not go into that here tonight. Returning to the subject of wool, the Government gives $25m to wool promotion, and that is the only direct assistance it provides outside its dollar for dollar assistance. The Government has said that it will review this in three years time. My guess is that if the Australian public is silly enough to let the Australian Labor Party still be on the government benches at that time, the wool industry will be saying goodbye to their wool promotion support. I guarantee that the Australian people are not that silly and will make sure that we are on the government benches at that time so that this wonderful industry to Australia, the wool industry, is sustained in a manner which will give us all the standard of living we have now. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, the Government has handed over $39m-that is, $13m a year over the next three years- to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd. Honourable senators on the other side of the chamber should go and have their photographs taken. The Government is handing over $13m a year to Kodak, a company that has annual exports of $200m to $250m a year. Is it not amazing that the Government is giving that hand-out to Kodak? I forgot to mention that Kodak is situated in the political seat of the person I watched on television tonight playing golf whose ball went into a couple of bunkers. It is in the electorate of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). He went from one bunker to the other, and that is what this Government is doing at the moment: it is going from one bunker into the other bunker. In the end, the fascinating thing was-and Senator McKiernan saw this on television-that the Prime Minister, after he had put his second shot out of the bunker into the lip of the bunker, went and picked up his ball and took his bat home. The Government deserves to be indicted for what it is doing for companies like Kodak, when it is not doing anything to help very vital industries such us the primary industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The wool industry deserves better than this double standard that the Government is giving it. The industry is not only in some difficulty with its wool. The live sheep trade is also experiencing some difficulties. My colleague Senator Panizza has brought to the attention of the Senate on numerous occasions the problems associated with the live sheep trade in the Middle East at the moment. I do not want to comment too much on this at the moment, because I appreciate the sensitivity of the discussions that are presently taking place, but the endeavour of this Government in this area has not been as good as it could have been. The Government does a fair bit for Kodak and the like! I do not know why the Government has to give assistance to a company which is situated in the Prime Minister's seat. If the Prime Minister is in the bunker, obviously he is in a bit of trouble, but I do not know why the Government has to give so much to that industry in that electorate. I would have thought that the Prime Minister would have felt quite secure in that safe Labor seat. I trust that the Government recognises the importance of the live sheep trade not just to Australia generally but also to the sheep producers. The Middle East trade provides a valuable market for mutton and we cannot afford to lose it; nor can Australia afford to be blackmailed. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other important matters covered in this package of legislation, but the only issue I wish to raise concerns the coal industry and its views on the establishment of the Coal Industry Research and Development Corporation (CIRDC). This would replace the present research council and the committees operating the Coal Research Trust Account and part of the national energy research development and demonstration program. No public funding is involved in the CIRDC and therefore the industry argues that it should administer its own research funding. It claims that the Government's program has high administration costs and a lack of application of practical research. The industry presently pays about $10m a year to the Government in the form of a coal research levy. Until now this has been administered totally by the Government. In addition, the industry itself spends about $15m on private research. The existing fund has a deficit of over $13m, for which the Government does not intend to accept liability. The industry, somewhat understandably, believes that the liabilities created under the Government's administration ought not to be transferred to the new fund. In other words, the Government should carry the load. </PARA>
<PARA> The research and development Bill also covers dairy, grain, natural resources and energy-indeed, all other primary industry and energy areas in which the industry decides that it wants a corporation. Generally speaking, the various commodity groups prefer a corporation to a council because of the wider powers attached to a corporation. The exception to which I have already referred is the Australian Wool Corporation. Amendments will be moved by Senator Lewis in the Committee of the whole later in this debate. Essentially, the Opposition has no disagreement with these Bills. However, I draw the attention of the Senate to the inconsistent attitude of the Government to rural industry generally. When one considers the vital contribution it makes to the economic welfare of every Australian, the Government treats the farmer, the person who produces this export income, in a most off-hand manner. </PARA>

They are worried about the locking up of our resources by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories.

I would like to tell the Government, and put on record again, that the input increases, as distinct from the inflation rate, for the primary industry sector are well in excess of 10 per cent in the last 12 months. How can primary industries exist with high interest rates and with an increase in their running costs in excess of 10 per cent when they are competing with the rest of the world?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Tonight the Senate is debating the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1989 and the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Bill 1989. This series of primary industry and energy Bills allows for a wide-ranging debate and gives the opportunity for honourable senators to address a number of issues that concern primary and rural industries. I acknowledge Mitch Hook from the Grain Growers Council of Australia, who is in the gallery tonight showing an interest in these primary industry Bills. I am sure that people out in the primary industry areas would welcome his being here taking an interest in what is happening to his industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to address a problem that is facing many smaller primary and farming industries-that is, the primary products that are entering Australia's domestic market under various types of government subsidies. These products are generally imported into Australia and marketed directly to manufacturing industry, or are brought in by the large grocery chains under home brand or generic labels. This is massively affecting the horticultural industry. No matter how these products are marketed in Australia they will cause, and are causing, havoc to the Australian small farmer. These products generally do not have to meet the strict health and hygiene standards rightly applied to Australian grown and processed products. The overseas products are able to be grown by farmers who use fertilisers and insecticides that would not meet environmental, health and hygiene standards in this country. I am glad the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) is in the chamber to listen to my contribution to the debate. The ironic part is that Australian farmers have to use expensive imported fertilisers, insecticides and other farming goods that have heavy tariff protection to grow, process and market Australian products. These products then have to compete against imported products that are heavily subsidised by governments on their own domestic market. Over the last 10 years we have seen huge levels of imported products on the shelves of our grocery stores. The major grocery chains have been importing and selling under generic labels goods such as jam, rice, apricots, sultanas, raisins, currants, canned pineapple, tomatoes and deciduous fruits, just to name a few. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I have. These products are grown, processed, canned and exported from low cost countries. The bottom line is that they offer a high profit margin to the grocery chain. The products are marketed under brands such as Black and White, Blue and White or Home Brand, depending on the grocery chain. Home Brand in itself is a contradiction in terms, implying that the contents are grown at home, presumably in Australia, which is not always the case. The generic label products compete against our home-grown products. They are not always superior products and generally are inferior products. The country of origin is not marked predominantly on the can or the package. There is really no comparison between the high grade Australian products and the cheaper imports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No-one on my side of politics objects to a profit motive. If the chains find it in their best interests to promote overseas products that is a commercial decision that they make in the interests of their shareholders. No-one on this side of the House has any objection to that. But an absolute essential requirement is that the country of origin is predominantly displayed on the can so that consumers do not get confused but are able to make a decision as to the purchases they make, whether of an imported product or a product from Australia. If they wish to buy a cheap imported product because of a lower price that is a decision they are able to make without being led to believe that it is a local product. At present the maximum requirement for labelling height is 1.5 millimetres, which is slightly bigger than a pinhead. I debated this issue with Senator Bolkus and received assurances that he would take this matter on board. I believe that there is an Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) report coming out in February. If Senator Bolkus's assurances have any validity--</PARA>

I go on record to thank Senator Bolkus on behalf of Australian farmers for the assurances that he has given.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While neither I nor anyone else can object to imported primary products entering Australia in a free market-I have no objection to that-I do, however, strenuously object to products that receive subsidies from governments overseas unfairly competing against Australian domestic products on our domestic market. Let me state unequivocally that the great majority of farmers support free trade. The National Farmers Federation, the peak body of Australian farmers, is loud in its insistence that Australia pursue a free trade policy. But I believe that a lot of the products that are entering Australia, competing against our home-grown products on our own domestic market, are subsidised. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian rural production in 1989-90 was worth $22 billion, with meat and wool accounting for nearly 50 per cent of the total. In 1988-89 rural exports were valued at $17 billion, 73 per cent of total farm production and 43 per cent of the total value of exported commodities. Forty-three per cent of Australian exports are carried by Australia's 145,000 to 150,000 farmers who do more than their share for Australia's economy. Internationally, Australia's rural exporters face a lot of formidable obstacles such as trade barriers, import quotas, quarantine barriers-which are a form of tariff-the European Community's common agricultural policy that has created an oversupply of commodities that are subsidised and then dumped, and the American Farm Bill with its extended credit scheme which subsidises American farm products in the international market. </PARA>
<PARA> These are just some of the problems facing Australian farmers in export markets. On the domestic front they work under a centralised wage system. They have to offset the profits gained by being the most efficient farmers in the world against the losses of exporting their products through the most inefficient waterfront in the world. They have to sell their products in a corrupt world market, yet they pay an average of $6,000 per farm for tariffs on farm imports, or $9,000m per year. That is a direct subsidy transfer from the farming and grazing sector to assist Australian manufacturing industry. The average net farm income in Australia is $22,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA> The biggest problem Australian farmers have is the Government's self-inflicted high interest rate policy that has set farmers reeling. We hear of housing interest rates of 17 per cent, which is scandalous, but farmers and small business people are paying up to 23 and 25 per cent and even more than that with added costs. It is making it nearly impossible for anyone to stay on the land. With all these man-made adversities and the natural disasters of drought and flood, as well as low commodity prices, the Australian farmer needs a Victoria Cross and bar just to stay on the land. </PARA>
<PARA> The one thing Australian farmers do not need is the increasing trend of subsidised products competing against them in their domestic markets. These subsidies come in various forms. They are hard to detect and, therefore, hard to use as evidence in an anti-dumping case. In the case of the pineapple industry, countries such as Indonesia are offering incentives in the form of subsidised land and subsidised transport. This country is encouraging multinational companies to establish canneries and plantations in sparsely populated areas by offering these incentives. This country's motivation is to obtain hard currency and transfer the population from the densely populated cities to the less populated areas. While the cannery owners are interested in profit, the Government's motivations are quite different. </PARA>
<PARA> The example I offer is not particular to Indonesia. A number of other countries, such as Thailand and the Philippines, have also encouraged multinational companies, such as Dole and Del Monte, to establish vertically integrated industries in their countries in return for government offsets. Of course, this is putting a tremendous strain on Queensland's 550 pineapple farmers and the 1,700 process workers employed in the $180m industry at the Golden Circle cannery. Although imports have risen to 21 per cent of the total Australian market, it is difficult to establish and define just what subsidies are offered. Nevertheless, they are subsidies in various forms and they are having a deleterious effect on Australia's horticultural market. </PARA>
<PARA> The dairy industry is also suffering from dumped European Economic Community (EEC) products. Already, imported cheese represents 12 per cent of the Australian domestic market. Again, the majority of the cheese is brought in and marketed under generic brands and it is sold by major grocery chains giving maximum mark-ups. The EEC production subsidy on cheddar cheese amounts to $2,264 a tonne. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate the point I made earlier that the Australian dairy industry is the fourth largest primary industry export earner. It has to export in a corrupt world market. One thing Australia cannot control is the international market but it is another matter for Australia to allow cheese subsidised to the tune of $2,264 a tonne to enter the Australian domestic market. These imports take up not only 12 per cent of the domestic market but also hold prices down and do not allow Australian farmers to get a fair return for their considerable efforts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian rice industry has lost 20 to 25 per cent of the Australian market to imported rice. Australian rice growers produce 800,000 tonnes of rice a year. Between 80,000 to 100,000 tonnes of rice are consumed domestically and imported rice amounts to 20,000 to 25,000 tonnes of this. Again, this rice is mainly sold through generic brands or in bulk to industrial users. Australia is well able to sell 700,000 tonnes of rice overseas in a heavily subsidised and corrupt world market. The Australian rice grower then has to meet the international market by selling what he can. </PARA>
<PARA> We then must ask the question: How is this rice coming in? It is ironical that Australia imported rice from Japan last year-it was only a small quantity-yet the total public cost of the rice subsidy program in Japan is $6 billion a year. It is spent to ensure that the Japanese are self-sufficient in rice production. There is a total embargo on rice imports into Japan. Again, I do not question any country's right to sell into Australia if a product is not subsidised, but it is questionable whether countries can gain cheap access to Australia's domestic rice market without some sort of subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government recently made a decision to lift the quarantine restriction on fresh, chilled and frozen pork and allow the importation of pig meat into Australia. That subject has been aired in the Senate on a number of occasions. But apart from the disease factor that is worrying every pig producer, the Canadian pig producers are subsidised under the Canadian tripartite price support program. The Federal Government and Canadian provincial governments, as well as the pork producers, pay into this scheme, which is triggered if a certain price is not reached. This year the scheme, according to the pork industry, gave subsidies to the Canadian pork producers of between $37 and $41 per animal. The United States Department of Commerce has recognised the subsidised nature of the Canadian product and has levied a countervailing duty of 8.5c per kilo on this imported pork. The United States action was supported by the International Trade Commission in September this year. Yet despite the evidence available that Canadian pork is subsidised and does constitute a disease risk-although Senator Cook has said that it is a limited disease risk-the Government took the decision to allow the import of pig meat into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the tripartite price support scheme, there are other State government transport subsidies on grain, tax rebate offset programs and herd improvement rebates that further assist Canadian pig producers. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has given a top figure of around 17,000 tonnes of pig meat entering Australia per year. Australia's domestic market is around 300,000 tonnes, representing 4.8 million pigs. Seventeen thousand tonnes of pig meat from Canada is the equivalent of 270,000 additional pigs. There is concern in the industry that Canada will only export the more expensive cuts-legs and that type of cut-and this will completely unbalance the Australian market with an excess of leg cuts and will force the price of more expensive cuts down. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook wrote a letter to the Australian when he was questioned on this issue, and I agree with him when he said that there is nothing wrong with good healthy competition which encourages cost-efficient production. But that is not the case. The facts are that pig meat is subsidised by the Canadian Federal and State governments. Senator Cook knows it. The United States Government knew it when it granted a countervailing duty of 8.5c a kilo. So why let it into Australia and force the pig producers to sustain injury and then, after they have suffered that injury, make a case for anti-dumping support-in other words, close the pigsty door after the pig has bolted. </PARA>
<PARA> The dried fruit industry has also lost a large percentage of its market to imported products. About 11.8 per cent of the market for currants has gone to the imports from Greece. The European Community subsidises that to the extent of $1,000 a tonne. Out of the 4,000 tonnes that is the Australian domestic market, 475 tonnes of imports come from Greece. Last year that figure was 169 tonnes. In percentage terms, it has risen by 181 per cent in one year. Greece, as a member of the European Community, receives production subsidies of $1,000 a tonne as well as processing and storage aid. In contrast, Australian growers' net price is $2,350 a tonne. This year 20 tonnes of imported sultanas came on to the Australian market, an insignificant amount, but no doubt the figure will increase next year if the product receives the same assistance as is provided for currants. </PARA>
<PARA> There were 786 tonnes of apricots imported from Turkey to Australia last year. Subsequently, 22.5 per cent of the Australian market of 3,500 tonnes was lost to imports. These imports were packed under generic brands for the major grocery chains and labelled `packed in Australia' for the specified grocery stores. Consumers could be forgiven if they thought these products were a product of Australia, but across the back of the package, stamped on clear cellophane, are the words `product of Turkey'. The Turkish Government assists its farmers by subsidising interest rates to 5 per cent and by devaluing the currency to assist exports. </PARA>
<PARA> Canned fruits are also coming into Australia under generic and home brand labels. Seven per cent of Australia's market is imported, mostly from the European Economic Community. These products also receive subsidies for their production and for export. Subsidised farm produce is causing a threat to Australian farmers. Production subsidies are increasing and causing injury to Australia's primary industries. They not only remove market share from farmers and processors, but also hold prices down to that of the subsidised product that is entering the domestic market. In the pineapple industry, growers have not received a price increase for five years and have held the price on the retail shelves for 18 months. Growers and canners know that every time they go for a price increase, they lose their market share to subsidised imported products and therefore they do not want to increase prices. The stage has now been reached that if Australia wants a horticultural industry, we will have to recognise the harm that is being inflicted on the Australian industries before more farmers sell their farms for real estate subdivisions or for golf courses for tourists. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make it quite clear that I am not calling for tariff protection for Australian products. I am not calling for quotas. I recognise that free world trade will assist every farmer in Australia. I am calling for the Government to recognise that the problem facing Australia's primary industries needs addressing, and addressing fast. We have anti-dumping legislation and countervailing duties. But injury has to have taken place before these are triggered. In some cases it is nearly impossible to establish that subsidies have been given by governments because they are hidden and disguised, many in the form of assistance in government services. The Australian Government has extended to 250 days the consideration time for dumping applications. An immense amount can happen in 250 days. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said it before and I will say it again: Australian farmers have to compete on a corrupt world market. Surely it is not unreasonable to expect that they can play on a level playing field in their own domestic market. This Government can play a role in levelling the field by insisting on decent labelling on imported products, ensuring that the products are marked in large enough letters to let the purchaser know that the product is imported. The Industries Assistance Commission brought down its interim recommendations on packaging; however, the request that the country of origin be marked in easily identifiable writing was not one of the recommendations. Senator Bolkus has given an assurance that this problem will be addressed in the IAC's final report. That report was originally due to be released in December. I understand that it has now been printed and will be available in February. Hopefully the IAC has responded to Senator Bolkus's assurance in the Senate by including in its report reasonable minimum standards for labelling. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government can insist on uniform quality standards. In fact, it must insist on uniform quality standards. It is not good enough to let inferior processed products onto Australia's domestic market to compete against the home grown product in price if it means that the purchaser is buying an inferior, low standard product. The consumers are then turned away from that particular item. Nine times out of ten, they do not even realise it is an imported product. The consumers just do not buy that particular product again, which slows down the sales of Australia's primary products, including the better quality Australian product. </PARA>
<PARA> While it is recognised that reviews have to take place and are necessary, the anti-dumping authority requirement to re-apply every three years for continued dumping protection is time consuming, costly and imposes an unnecessary burden that is eventually passed on to the farmer. It is recognised throughout the world that tariff protection on manufactured goods has fallen significantly. However, in contrast, the level of protection in the agricultural sector has remained high and the trend is upwards. A large number of countries have protected their primary industries by grandfather clauses and do not allow Australian entry into their markets, as indicated by a paper on world trade distortions put out by the Australian Industries Development Association research centre. On the other hand, Australia's assistance to agriculture has declined significantly-from 15 per cent in 1986-87 to 9 per cent in 1987-88. This downward trend in agricultural assistance in Australia is continuing. Agricultural protection is an entrenched distortion to world trade which increasingly threatens efficient agricultural producers in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> These are some of the problems that are facing the Australian farming industry at the moment. These are the problems that have to be recognised and taken on board. While I acknowledge-and I have said so a number of times-that we are not calling for quotas or extended tariffs, we are calling for a level playing field for Australia's primary industries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is good to see that Senator Cook, the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), has come into the chamber for at least part of this debate on the most important industry that Australia has ever had and is likely to have for a long time. His presence is preferable to that of the Minister who has vowed to close up resources and has put marginal land on the agenda for closing up also.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The formalities of the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1989 and the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Bill 1989, have already been explained by my colleague, Senator Lewis, who was ably backed up by Senator Brownhill and Senator Boswell. In the short time I have this evening, I would like to address briefly certain points concerning the amendment to the wheat marketing legislation. The Senate may remember that this legislation passed through Parliament around 1 June 1989. Yet, here we are, six months down the track, already having to amend it. We are amending the legislative power which is given to the wheat industry to allocate part of the industry tax to research. Obviously, that was overlooked. The levy has been set at 2 1/2 per cent for this season, of which 0.5 per cent will go to the trust fund. That figure may be changed every year. As I said, this amendment is needed because this provision was not included in the original legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This is probably a good time to review the new Act, as a new delivery season has almost been completed. This legislation made a big change to the old wheat marketing system, which was not accepted too well by growers around Australia. Although being one of those most definitely against the change, in the final analysis I was prepared to support it with my colleagues and see how it operated around Australia. I am prepared to see it given a go, but it is time that we reviewed it to see how it has operated during the first season. </PARA>
<PARA> The wheat marketing legislation that was passed earlier this year deregulated the domestic market. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy recommended that each State deregulate its storage, handling and transport systems. Some benefits were to come down the track. First of all there was deregulating the storage, handling and transport systems of each State. As I said, that was recommended in the McColl Royal Commission. Out of all these things, there was to be at least an average saving around Australia of $10 per tonne. </PARA>
<PARA> Before the Act was passed growers were to store mandatorily with each State bulk handling authority only where they had the sole rights. Transport, of course, belonged to each State for it to do as it thought fit. Most States around Australia still have, as they certainly had then, a regulated transport system. Queensland was waiting for the States to put these measures into action. Mr Kerin can make sure, in our getting those benefits that were promised-and giving up those other benefits that the growers had; I will mention those later-that we get more back than we are giving up. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kerin was supposed to see to it that the other States did their part and deregulated transport, handling and storage. Of course, each State had to pass complementary legislation. What happened? Queensland, my State of Western Australia, and South Australia have refused to do this up to date. As Mr Kerin told us, there were to have been changes on the waterfront. There has been nothing whatsoever done on the waterfront up to date. We have been told that the waterfront will cost us $630m over the next umpteen years, so what do we do with it? Nothing has been delivered in this first year. </PARA>
<PARA> The State handling authorities and State rail authorities want to keep their own sole authority under the umbrella of the State governments. I believe New South Wales supplied most of the storage facilities and in other States that had their own bulk handling authorities, for example Western Australia, money was raised solely by the growers by way of a revolving toll. They used the excuse that they wanted to keep sole handling authority for those reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> Western Australia not only refused to deregulate storage and handling; it also refused to deregulate the transport system. Not only did it refuse to deregulate the transport system, but its bulk handling authority went into a five-year freight contract. Not only did it go into a five-year contract with them, but also it accepted a 5 per cent rise. Everywhere in Australia rail freight charges are dropping. I believe that Victoria dropped its charges by about 17 per cent. No, Western Australia agreed, and its bulk handling authority agreed, to increase rail charges by 5 per cent when they should have been dropping. They signed a contract for five years without going out to see what the market was by throwing a few selected bins open for tender to see what the true cost was. They decided not to do that; they signed a contract that will lock us in for five years at least. I do not know what the other States are doing, but that is the case in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask: Where is the micro-economic reform that was promised to us by Mr Kerin when he bulldozed this Bill through last year, and where are the benefits we were supposed to get? Of all those returns we were promised, we have not seen any yet. The fact is that these States have refused to give up regulated transport and have the State handling authorities give up their sole rights. What are they doing? Mr Kerin is blaming the Grains Council of Australia. The Australian tells us what is happening now; it is there for everyone to see. Mr Kerin cannot find any other scapegoat so he is blaming the highest representative body of the wheat growers in Australia because it pointed out to him the problems that would arise in the new Wheat Marketing Act. Mr Kerin did not listen. He was hell-bent on micro-economic reform-micro-economic reform for everyone on the land, but not on the wharf, not in coastal shipping or anything like that that might affect his side of politics. I suggest that instead of blaming the Grains Council of Australia which has done a great job representing the wheatgrowers he should blame himself and find out where he went wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> The handling authorities around Australia can still control their own facilities. As is pointed out in an article in the Australian, they make out that someone is trying to take control of the silos. They own them, so how can anyone take control of them? All we want is other players in the bulk handling field so that we can find out what the true handling of wheat is on the open market. No-one will take the silos off the handling authorities to store wool, barley, or whatever. They have been set up for handling the Australian wheat crop and the wheat growers can put in whatever the handling authorities want at any time. </PARA>
<PARA> The bulk handling authorities have been long established. I know that Western Australia's cooperative bulk handling was established in 1926, South Australia's was established in 1961, New South Wales's was established in the 1920s, and Victoria's was established in the 1930s. How can the handling authorities say that they cannot compete with a new player coming into the field this year? That is a fallacy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The bulk handling authorities are telling lies if they reckon that they cannot compete in the open market with all their debts paid off. They have not built a new silo in Western Australia for at least eight or nine years and they are telling lies if they say that they cannot compete with any new player coming into the field.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said earlier, to get this new marketing system going-even I accepted it in the end-wheat growers have lost many priviliges. Something that did not come to light until the last week or so is the fact that a pool did not last for the whole season. Under the old system there was a pool for the whole year. Queensland was the first to deliver to the pool. It used to usually open on 1 November every year and close on 31 October of the following year. Wheat could be delivered to that pool for the entire year, though minimal wheat was delivered after the harvesting season closed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is vastly different now. We were told that the Wheat Board could be used as the last resort buyer. But, no, the pool will last only as long as the new Wheat Board thinks fit. It cannot give me an undertaking that it will even last for the harvesting season. Queensland is the first to deliver its harvest; northern New South Wales is next, followed by the northern parts of Western Australia. If there is downward pressure on world wheat prices the Wheat Board can chop the pool off before the wheatgrowers have delivered to the pool for that season. At least if the pool cannot last for the whole year legislation should be enacted so that it remains open for the harvesting season in Australia, which is roughly from 25 October to the end of January. I think that that would cover 99.8 per cent of Australia's harvest. Otherwise we are likely to have three or four pools for the whole season. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this system the wheatgrowers of Australia lost the underwriting. The growers are still being underwritten for this season at 90 per cent of gross national product but it will reduce over five years to 80 per cent and then will disappear altogether. We have lost that guarantee. I was not prepared to accept a total loss of the underwriting. I was happy to have underwriting on a one-year basis, rather than on a three-year rotating average. I was not happy to lose it altogether. Underwriting allows the Wheat Board to borrow on the world's financial markets at a preferred interest rate. We have lost that avenue. We have lost the guarantee of payment for wheat delivered to the Wheat Board. The wheat that is sold outside the Wheat Board does not carry a guarantee. I do not mind that either, but we have lost many advantages and rights that we have had since 1947 under the Wheat Marketing Act. Our forefathers fought, from about 1935 onwards, to get a regulated wheat market-it can be better described as an orderly wheat market-without being knocked off all over the world. I am proud to say that my late father was one of the founding members of the wheat growers union of Western Australia. We have lost all these advantages. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now waiting for the benefits to flow from Mr Kerin's promises. But where are they? I have not seen any. I have seen only the down side of the present marketing system. I am waiting for the benefits. I am waiting to see the waterfront cleaned up. I am waiting for coastal shipping to be thrown open. But that is not on the Government's agenda. We have been promised things but they are not forthcoming. We were promised that we would be able to sell to whomever we liked and to extract the maximum from the domestic market. I can tell the Senate what we have extracted out of the domestic market. I am in the wheat growing game and I can tell the Senate what is happening in Western Australia. The private wheat buyers-some of whom have set up silos-are offering $10 a tonne for wheat they select, even within Australian standard white wheat (ASW). ASW wheat is wheat that has a protein content of between 8 per cent and 11.5 per cent. Wheat is also graded according to weed contamination and by hectolitre weight. The grade above ASW is high protein (HP) wheat and prime hard wheat. </PARA>
<PARA> Private buyers are offering $10 a tonne above the estimated pool return. But for that they want the grower to pay the 2.5 per cent levy. They are selecting their own varieties, even within ASW wheat. Of course, they prefer to get HP wheat for the price of ASW wheat. They are very selective in their buying. They are paying $10 a tonne above the estimated pool price. Any wheat grower in Australia knows that for many years the Wheat Board has been very conservative in setting the estimated pool return. The worst season the Wheat Board ever went through was the 1986-87 season. It turned out in the final analysis that it had overestimated the final pool return by 22c a tonne. That is what the Wheat Board realised under its estimate. The Wheat Board has been very conservative in its estimate in other years. So if the estimate is within the conservative amount of $10 a tonne, which is quite likely, those private buyers are paying no premium. In the final analysis, if I am any judge, those private buyers will be paying less than the pool. </PARA>
<PARA> To wind up, I said at the beginning that I did not want this new wheat marketing system. I was glad that the Government at least did not deregulate the export market. In solidarity with my colleagues, I decided finally to support the legislation; I still have an open mind on how this marketing system is going to go. Believe you me, I want to see the system work, but I also want to see some of those advantages that we were promised out of the new marketing Act. It is time that Mr Kerin stopped blaming the Grains Council of Australia and delivered the goods. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bills we are debating cognately are the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) and the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Bill. The Bills cover a wide range of primary industries-the tobacco growing industry, the wool industry, the beef industry, the dairy produce industry, the canned fruit industry and the massive coal industry. That is a very broad range of primary industries indeed. Each makes its unique contribution to the export income of Australia and each has its particular concerns and problems; yet, due to this Government's legislative program, we are unable to give due consideration to each industry. We are unable to consider each one of those industries properly and fully outline the effects that these Bills will have on the industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's answer to the log-jam of legislation before the Senate is to lump together all the legislation that vaguely seems to be relevant to each other and shove it all through before Christmas. It is worth making the point that it is a sure sign of a very nervous and unsure Government that it keeps us sitting right up to Christmas in the hope of clearing the decks of controversial legislation or simply to get through legislation that should have been in and passed some time ago. The Government is rushing through the legislation so as to be able to clear the decks in the coming months before the election. In the long run, it is no way to run a country. It is the country that suffers in the long run, because it is nothing short of political opportunism. </PARA>
<PARA> However, not to be deterred by the lumping together of these many industries in this cognate debate, I will give time to each one in my address. I am pleased to be able to follow the three honourable senators I consider to be the finest advocates of primary industry in this chamber. Senator Boswell, a National Party of Australia senator from Queensland, spoke about the great subsidies that overseas primary industry receives while the Australian industry does not; it must compete on a corrupt world market. Senator Brownhill, a National Party senator from New South Wales, is a great advocate for the wool and sheep industry. Senator Panizza, a Liberal Party senator from Western Australia, outlined his continuing concerns about the wheat industry and the wheat marketing industry legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I get into the legislation itself, I pick up from where Senator Panizza left off and speak about the Wheat Marketing Bill. As honourable senators will be aware, the Wheat Marketing Bill passed through the Senate earlier this year with great controversy. The controversy centred around deregulating the domestic wheat market. Rather than going through a long and tortuous debate again, suffice it to say that the Government guaranteed Australian wheat farmers that if they took their medicine, that is, effectively dismantled the Australian Wheat Board, certain benefits would flow from legislation. Those benefits would primarily be in the micro-economic reform area-that is, on the waterfront and in the transport and handling of grain. The news today is that that commitment has not been met. It has been nothing short of a big lie to Australian wheat farmers. They have been dudded.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin. There has been no sign of reform on the waterfront and no sign of reform in the handling and transport of grain. Indeed, it has been reported today that three States-Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia-have backed down on the axed recommendations and are seeking to retain control of the grain handling system. Typically, the response by Mr Kerin has been to attack the Grains Council of Australia, the representative of Australian wheat farmers. Mr Kerin has criticised the Australian Grains Council for failing to confirm its position on the right of the Australian Wheat Board to override State grain handling powers, which are written into the Federal legislation. Mr Kerin seems to believe that this endorsement by the Grains Council will somehow shift the States into action. I do not believe it will.

<PARA> Mr Kerin, as Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, has paraded around for the past seven years of the Hawke Government, asserting his credibility, full of promise. But he has always failed to deliver. It is a case of `Big John's got the light on but no-one is home'. Every time there has been a battle between the environmentalists and the productive sectors of our society and economy, Senator Richardson has rolled Mr Kerin humiliatingly. It is only now and far too late, that Mr Kerin has spoken up. He really has become Barry Jones the Second, a walking zombie, a man with no power and respect in his portfolio any more. If he had any decency he would resign before he is thrown out. He is just holding down the job. I call upon Mr Kerin to defend his position, to defend the Wheat Marketing Act, and to put into place all the guarantees or resign. I quote from today's press release from the Grains Council of Australia to make quite clear that the Grains Council has defended itself in the strongest manner. It represents 45,000 wheat farmers in Australia. The press release states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr John Kerin, is seeking to use the Grains Council of Australia (GCA) as a scapegoat in his attempts to deliver continued State Rail grain transport monopolies to his union mates, according to Chairman of the Council's Wheat Committee, Mr Donald McGauchie . . . it is clear that the Minister is still reeling from the bucketing the Council gave him this time last year over the deal he struck with the Australian Railways Union. </PARA>
<PARA>* * * * * * * * *</PARA>
<PARA> ``It is yet again'', he said ``indicative of this government in full election mode. And'', he said, ``is characteristic of the Hawke Government's inconsistency on microeconomic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that about the wheat industry and shown the seriousness of that charge, I will now address myself to many of the other industries represented in this legislation. Firstly, the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 makes a number of administrative changes. The first one is a proposed amendment to the Plant Variety Rights Act. At the moment, breeders of new plants can claim exclusive rights to sell or license to sell for a period of 20 years. It is somewhat like a patenting of the new plant. However, while that plant is protected, the produce-that is, the flower or fruit-is not, and can not be, sold on. The amendment simply extends the rights of the breeder of the new plant to the plant's produce. This amendment is not challenged but is seen as a proper move to protect the business rights of the breeder or the inventor of the plant. It gives incentive to the innovative botanist. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also relates to the dairy industry. The change to the Dairy Produce Act simply clarifies the position that all late payers of the milk fat levy will be liable to 20 per cent interest. One of the greatest challenges facing the dairy industry in the 1990s is our closer economic relations with New Zealand. This agreement effectively drops all trade barriers between the two nations. In the area of dairy produce, New Zealand will gain a comparative advantage over Australia's producers as long as the New Zealand Government continues to support the monopoly trader status of the New Zealand Dairy Corporation, as well as extending interest free loans to that Corporation. It is obvious that our dairy farmers have cause for concern. This Government is sitting idly by, espousing the virtues of free trade between the two countries, while New Zealand is arming itself with an obvious advantage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is doing so all the time, as Senator Boswell interjects. Of course, it is doing so all the time. This is reminiscent of the famous Chamberlain saying `Peace in our time'. The agreement has a clause that allows the Australian Government to act when unfair practices are undertaken and are in conflict with the spirit of the agreement. A vigilant enforcing of this clause is required to protect our dairy industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation before the Senate also deals with the beef industry. The legislation amends the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Act 1964. The amendment will allow the industry to decide which of its accounts it will draw on to pay for the cost of raising and administering this levy. This is a technical alteration giving the industry broader financial power. However, it allows me a moment to mention the most pressing concerns facing the beef industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Presently there are many problems in this once relatively stable industry. Firstly, the industry has improved its access into the Japanese market by increasing its quotas but it is equally aware of the increased investment of the Japanese in all stages of beef production in Australia. The Cattle Council of Australia has rightly signalled its concern that market integration by foreign interests can lead to market domination and market manipulation which is not in the interests of the industry or the nation. To this end a policy needs to be introduced that safeguards this extremely important industry from market manipulation. The major safeguard is greater case by case scrutiny of investment proposals. This requires a greater allocation of resources by the Government so as to be able to scrutinise effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be stated that foreign investment is welcomed as it benefits the long term expansion of the industry, particularly the feedlot industry. The interests of the Japanese investors in this part of the beef industry have allowed this capital intensive specialised development to get off the ground in Australia where otherwise it may not have. The very risky and volatile meatworks establishments have been given a much needed injection of capital by Japanese investors. Whilst the number of abattoirs with Japanese equity is relatively small they account for a growing share of the total Australian cattle kill-23 per cent of beef and veal exports to Japan. The share of Japanese markets for beef and veal held by Japanese companies, taking into account licence exporters to Japan-that is, trading companies as distinct from the 23 per cent figure from abattoir holdings-is 58 per cent of exports from Australia to Japan. To this point-it is a matter of judgment-that is not a particular unhealthy state. But the Government must pick up the very clear signal. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a genuine concern in the whole industry that the Japanese not be allowed to integrate to the point where they will manipulate the saleyard prices of Australian farmers. From reports I have received from delegations that have returned from Japan this integration investment strategy is very much in the minds of those investors. However, in order of priorities foreign investment in the beef industry pales into insignificance when compared to the damaging effects now imposed upon the industry by the unions. The current rolling strikes being waged by the Australian meatworkers union in Victorian abattoirs is preventing the industry from meeting its export commitments and starving this country of valuable export income. Unquestionably, it has badly affected saleyard prices. On average, cow prices have declined 10c to 20c a kilogram and bullock prices 7c to 8c a kilogram. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth outling the cause of this public dispute. It dates back to as long ago as the very bitter Borthwick's abattoir dispute last year. After the resolution of that dispute, which effectively imposed on the union a Federal award over a State award-the Federal award being of lower pay-the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union attempted to avoid any flow-on effects to other abattoirs by running an industrial campaign in an attempt to coerce export and domestic abattoirs into signing their own Victorian meatworks and by-products award, the union's own invention. This union-made award had already been rejected by the Industrial Relations Commission in the Borthwick's case. </PARA>
<PARA> R. J. Gilbertson Pty Ltd, G. &amp; K. O'Connor Export Abattoir Pty Ltd, Castricum Brothers Pty Ltd Meat Exporters and McPhee Meats-the four largest abattoirs in the State-decided to take a stand. To the disgrace of the Industrial Relations Commission, the case has taken six months to come before it. Over those six months all four exporters and a number of other abattoirs throughout the State have been plagued by industrial action. In the last five months alone the four major export abattoirs have lost on average 40 out of every 100 working days. The Government should not underestimate the importance of this industrial dispute now going on in Victoria. The dispute has become the Alamo for the industry, an industry that has a work practice record equal to, if not worse than, the waterfront. </PARA>

Many family businesses have been sent to the wall in the past by Wally Curran's utterly reckless ways. Many family companies which are suffering as a result of this dispute have told me that they will go to the wall now rather than give in to Wally Curran and his meatworkers. This is the last stand; this is the Alamo. It is essential for the Government to take note of this dispute and intervene in the best way that it can.

<PARA> The next amendment is to the Tobacco Marketing Act 1965. It will change the name of the Tobacco Board to the Australian Tobacco Marketing Advisory Committee. In many respects this seems to be a trivial change, as the dropping of the name Tobacco Board for the Tobacco Marketing Advisory Committee is meant merely to distinguish clearly the Federal body from the State bodies. Technically, I suppose that it is correct, as the Federal body is only a negotiating forum for the setting of the average minimum price and the administrator of the tobacco industry stabilisation plan. In fact, it does not handle the receipt or sale of the product. The industry supplies only the domestic market. In total, the industry stabilisation plan assures Australian growers of up to 57 per cent of the domestic market. To this end, Queensland supplies 58 per cent of the domestic tobacco market. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Boswell may be interested to know-he should cast his eyes south-that Victoria supplies 37 per cent of the domestic market and New South Wales supplies 5 per cent. Tobacco farmers are the epitome of the Australian family farmer. They remind us the most of the benefit of the family farm as both a social and an economic unit. Anyone who travels to the districts of Bright and Myrtleford in Victoria not only will be taken by the very rich countryside but also will notice the relatively small tobacco farms which are all worked by families-in many cases, immigrant families from Italy. This industry and these people are being forgotten as we enter the pious tussle of the for and against tobacco advertising.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bills repeal a series of States grants Acts related to the canned fruit industry which I will not read out. Suffice to say that the legislation was introduced to provide assistance to the industry following the United Kingdom's entry into the European Economic Community in the early 1970s; so it goes back that far. Since the entry of the United Kingdom into the Economic Community we have lost 50 per cent of our canned fruit market. But today the industry faces an equally devastating concern-the loss of the $30 million Canadian market. That loss is because of the Canadian-United States free trade agreement which came into effect on 1 January 1989. It gives preference to Californian fruit and removes the old Canadian-Australian agreement that gives preference to Australian fruit. It is essential that pressure be maintained at the highest level on the Canadian Government. That level should not only include the Minister for Trade Negotiations, Mr Duffy, or the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, but should go as high as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). To that end, on 24 October 1989 the Prime Minister issued a statement which goes some way to addressing this very serious concern for the canned fruit industry. In that statement he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I have reached agreement with the Prime Minister of Canada, Mr Brian Mulroney, on the resolution of Canada's tariff treatment of Australian canned fruit exports. </PARA>
<PARA>Our agreement means the Canadian tariff on Australian canned fruit can be phased down, in the context of the Uruguay Round, to a level which leaves the Australian industry competitive with other exporters. The Australian industry can now have the confidence that the tariff rate it faces will permit it to remain both viable and competitive. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a very lofty statement, but its promise has not been delivered yet because the actual settlement of the reduction of tariffs will not be negotiated until the next Uruguay Round, which could be as long as 12 months away, if I am correct. They are lofty words and the Prime Minister will be kept to them, because it is a severe loss to the canned fruit industry. As Senator Boswell indicated in his address to the Senate, when Australia is preaching the level playing field philosophy, it seems that the rest of the world is laughing at us, particularly, the United States, with its export enhancement programs that subsidise its farmers to the tune of $1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to move on to the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1989. This Bill concentrates on changes to the constitution of the Wool Research and Development Council and selection procedures for its members. The wool industry is our most consistent and significant export industry, with exports up to $6 billion last year. However, like so many of our export commodities, the market is on the downturn. Never in Australia's wool industry history has the wool market taken such a steep dive. In the space of six months the number of bales bought by exporters has dropped 40 per cent on last year, while the Wool Corporation has been buying up to 60 per cent of the total offerings to support the floor price. The Corporation's stockpile, as Senator Brownhill pointed out, is at a record 1.8 million bales. The major reason for this stockpiling has been the impact of the political upheavals in China. The turning off of the Chinese tap has resounded not only in Australia but also in many of the Asian countries that supply processed wool and yarn to China from the Australian clip. In all it is estimated that the export income could be down by as much as $2 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Simultaneously, the sheep industry has been dealt a second blow. The Saudi Arabian Government's rejection of vessels carrying Australian sheep has forced Australia to suspend its live sheep exports to this country. The live sheep export trade earns Australia $200m per year. Of that trade, 45 per cent went-we can use the past tense now as it seems almost a lost cause-to Saudi Arabia, our largest importer, with the remainder heading for other Gulf states. It is clear that the sheep industry is not in a very healthy state. </PARA>
<PARA> Unquestionably, the primary industry sector is the most efficient and productive in the world. On a world scale, Australia's wool industry is the largest exporter. Australia's beef industry is the second largest exporter. The Australian wheat industry is in the top three of the world's exporters. The total value of farm exports in 1988-89 was $16 billion. Internationally, Australia's rural exporters face formidable obstacles and they always manage to overcome them. The major factor in Australia's primary industry exports losing their competitiveness, other than the tariff barriers put up by the European Community and the quotas by the Japanese and Taiwanese, is the over-valued Australian dollar, which sits at between 78c and 79c to the United States dollar. In the short term a major influence on the exchange rates has been the Government's monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past two years the yield on 90-day Treasury notes has risen by about eight percentage points, attracting the inflow of short-term foreign capital-hot money. Thus, monetary policy aimed at slowing demand for imports has also had the conflicting effect not only of lowering the price of Australian imports but also making exports expensive. A lower exchange rate will boost the competitiveness of the export industries. If the rural sector is to compete on world markets, it must have a lower Australian dollar. The Australian dollar is being artificially propped up at unnatural levels and we will not be able to tackle our current account crisis until the Australian dollar is brought down. We need an export-led recovery and our primary industries can maintain competitiveness only with a lower Australian dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> I was unable to speak to every industry mentioned in this package of legislation. But I come back to my original point: the Government has put these Bills together cognately-shoved them all together-in many cases irrelevantly, simply to get all the legislation through before Christmas so that it can prepare for the coming election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today's order of business paper for the Senate discloses that Government Business order of the day No. 3 is Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1989, and Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Bill 1989-Resumption of second reading debate; that is item No. 3 out of eight items of Government Business which were posted today. As the clock shows five minutes past 10, we have only reached towards the end of the second reading debate of the third item of Government Business today. There is still a very long legislative list for this chamber to address itself to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I want to move to this legislation. As has been observed by many speakers in this debate, the legislation deals with omnibus Bills, Bills that pick up a series of amendments to Acts covered by the primary industries portfolio allocation. As is usual in Bills in which primary industry matters are proposed, honourable senators invariably choose this occasion to make speeches related to the general field of primary industry but not necessarily directly relevant to the items covered by the legislation. Again, that has been the case tonight. In replying on behalf of the Government I do not intend to reply to those items extraneous to the purposes of these Bills. I simply say to Opposition speakers, `We will meet you sometime in contest over those things with which you hold contrary opinions to us; but this will not be the occasion-our record stands clear'. </PARA>
<PARA> To the items that have been raised relevant to the Bills, firstly, I thank the senators who have supported in the main the key thrust of the Government's legislation; that is to say, all senators in the Opposition coalition parties and the Australian Democrats. There have been a number and a complexity, one would say, of amendments. But I make this charitable observation at the beginning of my remarks: those amendments are not to change the thrust of what we are on about here but rather to modify or, in the view of the movers, to better direct those changes that we have taken the initiative to propose. </PARA>
<PARA> While there are differences, those differences are at the margin and not at the core. That augurs well for the intention of the Government in the varied fields that these amendments affect. The main thrust of the reservations held by the Opposition was expressed in the speech by the Deputy Leader of the coalition, Senator Austin Lewis, during the second reading debate in which-I paraphrase his remarks-he indicated that what he lamented about these amendments that we were seeking, particularly in respect of research and development, was that they brought an undue intrusion of government bureaucracy into research and development, particularly in the coal area. The honourable senator nods and, therefore, I must have paraphrased accurately. What I can say, with respect to those reservations he has expressed, is that I think they arise from a perceptional fault as to what, in fact, is happening in the coal area. If we were not to pass the Government's amendments here we would revert to a system of funding for research and development out of the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council (NERDDC) round through the coal fund. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Lewis" NAMEID="NG4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Wouldn't it deregulate it altogether?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am saying that if Senator Lewis were to succeed, that is what would happen. Therefore, he would be inviting a continuation of government involvement through the advisory network of NERDCC in approving funding in this sense. I should perhaps canvass this more at the committee stage, but I will canvass the main points now during my second reading reply. The Bill proposes the establishment of a corporation which would enable the industry to have a majority voice and allocate funds on an industry levy basis so that the industry would then drive the research effort. I submit that would `de-bureaucratise'-if there is such a term-funding for research and development in the coal area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me refer to another main point that Senator Austin Lewis would dwell on and, doubtless, would put with some force in rebuttal and that is that the coal industry does not want this and that we are imposing something on it which it disdains. I say to that that the Government has had consultations with the Australian coal mining industry. In fact, I have in my notes a letter from Mr J. B. Ritchie, who was, earlier this year, the Executive Director of the Australian Coal Association in which he supports, conceptually, the details of what we are proposing. If I were to be more of a cynic than a charitable person I might say that the Coal Association is not saying that it conceptually opposes the structure we are seeking to legislate for but, rather, it is using the obstruction of the passage of this section of our Bills to negotiate with the Government an input of public moneys to add to its levy monies and so obtain a bigger pool of funds for research and development. I say, `Good luck to it'. That is a manoeuvre that is open to it, but the Commonwealth does not think it is appropriate-particularly given the size of these companies and the 150 per cent tax write-off that they enjoy-to add to that pool. However, what we are proposing-and what I now categorically state-is that these amendments be carried. If they are, we will not act on them until such time as we have had further consultations with the coal industry and obtained agreement that we should proceed with this corporation for the coal industry. I will say more of that later, but I can give that assurance to the Senate. The passage of these provisions would enable us to continue and finalise those consultations and resolve what, I think, is a negotiating stand-off over money rather than a negotiating stand-off rejecting a principle that the Government is seeking to impose. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, before I make an explanation of how I intend to deal with the arguably complex the myriad of amendments which have been put forward, perhaps I should turn to the publication released in May this year by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and me, as the Minister for Resources, entitled Research, Innovation and Competitiveness. It is from the considerations in this publication that these Bills on research and development spring. If I might assuage the concerns that have been articulated by Senator Austin Lewis by turning to page 80 point 6, `Organisation and Administration of primary and energy industries research and development' and quote the key points. The first two points will only suffice, I think to assuage the concerns that the honourable senator has put. The first point is:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's objective is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the DPIE research network. </PARA>
<PARA>I think there is consensus that that is an ideal objective. More importantly, point two states:</PARA>
<PARA>R &amp; D corporations have more flexibility than other forms of administration. Although they will remain accountable to both the Government and industry, they will be autonomous organisations able to vigorously pursue commercial objectives. In so doing they will be able to catalyse their industries to become more innovative and more adaptive. </PARA>
<PARA>Much has been said in the second reading debate by several contributors about the need to energise research and development in Australia across the whole range of areas contemplated in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the first substantive question; that is, Senator Lewis's amendment to the second reading motion. It is not the Government's intention to support this motion. We would ask the Senate to defeat it. In support of why it should be defeated, I advance a number of points. First, this motion was moved in the House of Representatives by the honourable member for Gippsland, Mr McGauran-my shadow, as I understand it-and it was proposed in what I understand to be identical terms as the one that Senator Lewis proposes for the Senate. It was defeated in the House. I ask that it be defeated in here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, he was talking about the other Bowie. He lost me when I could not work out who was Jim Bowie and who was Santa Anna in that stand-off. But that is a matter for him to work out, I guess, or for those of us who were listening to his speech to contemplate and conjure up possibilities about. However, returning to what was said in the House, Mr McGauran said that in relation to the whole range of fees under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act, concerning dealings in entitlements and acreage associated with exploration and production off-shore in Australian oil and gas fields, his intention was to ensure that the fees set by regulation:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . do not exceed the minimum administrative costs incurred by the Commonwealth, the States or the Northern Territory-</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate at this point, `nor do we intend them to exceed that'. </PARA>
<PARA>in carrying out their respective objectives under the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree to this point. The next words are important:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that the discretionary power vested in the Minister will not become an instrument for raising revenue, nor in any way discourage the petroleum exploration industry from expanding its exploration efforts. </PARA>
<PARA>I understand clearly what he means. I think, though, that his concern is wrongly based for the following reasons. First, the Commonwealth is not a beneficiary of these fees; it is merely the agent which collects them and disburses them to the States. We do not earn money out of them. We simply act as a post-box for the States, and the States are the beneficiaries. There is no motive, there is no reason, there is no possible gain to the Commonwealth for charging anything other than the minimum charge that is applicable. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, if we were to charge more than the minimum charge, properly recoverable, then we would be engaging in an act of taxation. Since we do not have any head of power to engage in such an act of taxation, we would be breaking the law and we would be prosecutable-and so we should be. The Commonwealth, as an agency determined to maintain and keep the law, is not likely to offend in any sense-firstly, because it would be breaking the law and, secondly, it would not gain anything even if it did-in the way in which the amendment contemplates and in the way in which Senator McGauran said it could when he dealt with this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point made by Senator Lewis was that he does not have power to vary the regulations and he thinks that it is best to keep the actual amount in the Act so that the Senate can deal with the Act. We want to provide a timely adjustment so that we are not in a situation of retrospectively trying to catch up with costs incurred by the Commonwealth. If we were in that position, the oil companies would benefit. They would have loan of Commonwealth money for the period when the legislature makes the adjustment when, in fact by timely regulation we can do that so that there is not a financial holiday of sorts to oil companies which wish to engage in offshore exploration. From the point of principle no major company of this character should in any way be able to rest financially for a time on the Commonwealth. I, therefore, suggest that the amendment is improper. With those words it is entirely appropriate that we defeat the amendment moved by Senator Austin Lewis, perhaps with one small postscript that, were it to be carried, as well as all the things that I have put, it would impose a huge amount of work and regulation on the Department, which can utilise its resources for more constructive purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now turn to the amendments that we are in almost earnest expectation of dealing with when we move to the committee stage. My view of these amendments falls into three categories which I will categorise for ease of consideration into group A, group B and group C. There is now a fourth category which I will deal with first-what I would call the Asia Dairy-inspired amendments. Over dinner Senator Lewis drew my attention to these amendments and, as I understand it, indicated that he will move them. On behalf of the Government I indicate that we will accept those amendments. We believe that the first set of changes to section 28 are covered by the Act anyway; nonetheless it does not damage or misconstrue the Act in any sense to include them. While we might normally make a pedantic objection, we will not on this occasion; we will accept them. We will also accept the second group of amendments. Subject to the Australian Democrats' view, because I have not had a chance to confer with them, I think that would mean that the amendments would be acceptable to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> With that explanation I now turn to my A, B and C groups. In group A I have designated amendments that are acceptable to the Government that are being proposed here. They include amendments Nos 5, 6 and 8 relating to the variation of research and development plans. Amendment No. 9 is also acceptable to the Government and relates to consultations with representative organisations. Amendments Nos 13, 15, 16 and 17 are also acceptable and relate to matching industry contributions. Amendment No. 20 is acceptable and relates to transfer of corporation assets, and amendments Nos 21 and 22 with respect to the establishment of research and development corporations are acceptable. The parliamentary draftsman has advised me that while we consider those amendments to be acceptable, in the case of amendments Nos 9, 21 and 22 he wants to improve the wording to make it acceptable in parliamentary or legislative form. The change to the wording is not intended in any way to alter the meaning or intent of the amendments. It is simply a device by the parliamentary draftsman to make those words and changes fit within the parliamentary language and, appropriately, within the terms of the Bill. So amendments Nos 5, 6, 8, 9, 13, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21 and 22 are acceptable. I do not know how we will deal with them at the committee stage, but I hope that we can take them as a block, although they are out of sequence. </PARA>
<PARA> Group B is a group of amendments which I understand the Opposition will move and which the Government will not accept. They are amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3 in respect of the Coal Research and Development Corporation, and amendments Nos 18 and 19 with respect to selection criteria. I understand that the Australian Democrats also do not support those amendments. I acknowledge the fact that Senator Janet Powell is nodding, so I assume that there is a majority in this chamber to reject those amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to amendments in what I term group C. Amendment No. 4 relates to dairy research. There is a significance about that which I will go to in a minute. Amendments 4a, 7 and 10 relate to the research and development plans of these organisations. This group also includes amendments Nos. 11 and 12. The Government would normally oppose those amendments. It thinks they are not really appropriate in this case. We have had discussions on some of the amendments and we think we can tolerate them, so we are not so greatly offended by them that we wish to oppose them, which is, I guess, a backhanded way of saying, `We will accept them under sufferance, but we will accept them nonetheless'. Once they are printed and are law, how we feel about them will only be a matter of interpretation and approach. They will stand in any case. I commend these omnibus Bills to the Senate and ask for their support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since I have been invited to give a view from the Government, I advise that we see the significance of these amendments as not in fact setting up a coal research and development corporation, but rather as putting in place standard arrangements allowing the setting up of such an organisation. We recognise that, while there is a view emanating from the coal industry in opposition to this, it is not a universal view; there are other views as well. Thus we conclude that there is a degree of confusion in the industry about what might apply in the event of such a corporation being established. It is in recognition of that and in the interests of good sober government that we are committed to having further consultations with the industry on whether it will be part of such a research and development corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the industry as a whole rejects the proposal, we would not proceed with the establishment of such a corporation. But the Australian Coal Industry Association is a body to which we would look in conducting our consultations. As I said in my second reading speech, although I do not have the letter to hand, the Australian Coal Industry Association sent a letter to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy earlier in the year in which it described, in essence, what is a research and development corporation and said that that is what it would support. However, in later consultations it backed away from that position and, as I said, if I were not so charitable a person and was more a cynic, I might argue that the reason that it has backed away is that it wants the Commonwealth to put funds into such a body so that it is not dependent entirely upon the industry levy. </PARA>
<PARA> So I think that the bargaining point is not over the principle of such a body, which is to in fact `debureaucratise'-which I think is Senator Lewis's term-the research and development effort, but is over whether or not--</PARA>

<PARA> Ted Laurie was born in 1912. He had an elite background. His father was a doctor holding an honorary appointment at the Alfred Hospital. His grandfather had been Professor of Philosophy at Melbourne University. His mother had graduated there in arts. In 1924 Ted went to Scotch College. He established a brilliant academic record. He played for the school in cricket, football and tennis. He was captain of the cricket team. In 1930 he became the school's head prefect. Ted attended Melbourne University during the first half of the 1930s. He won blues in football and cricket. He graduated with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1935. The following year he was admitted to the Victorian Bar. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1937 Ted went to work in Queensland. There Brian Fitzpatrick, the historian and civil rights worker, persuaded him to become secretary of the Council for Civil Liberties. He became active in several organisations. In these he met a number of Communists, by whom he was much impressed. In 1939 Ted Laurie joined the Communist Party of Australia. He did so for high motive. His family was altruistic. His mother was a Christian pacifist. His father presented him with a model of the compassionate man. With this background, Ted was moved by the injustice he saw in society. This was accentuated by the Depression in the thirties. Between 1941 and 1945 Ted was in the Army. He served in the Pacific theatre; the Japanese sank a ship he was on in Milne Bay. He was commissioned in the field. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1944 he married Bonnie Mackay, the daughter of a journalist whose career included editorship of the Argus, at that time a great Melbourne newspaper. It was a marriage of high success. Bonnie's death in March 1978 was a cruel occasion for Ted. I express my sympathy to their three children, Robin, Bayne and Bill, for the loss they have suffered. </PARA>
<PARA> In the post-war period Ted pursued a career which places him amongst the greatest of advocates, no matter where, this in spite of its being forever beset by mainfest prejudice. Happily, this waned in later years as his qualities were more and more appreciated. His application to join the Bar was granted by the Council only after considerable debate. In 1961 the Chief Justice of the Victorian Supreme Court, Sir Edmund Herring, refused him silk on the grounds that the Bolsheviks had killed the Tsar in 1918. Sir Edmund told Ted he could never forgive them for having murdered a relative of the royal family. By 1965 Sir Henry Winneke was Chief Justice of Victoria. He asked Ted why he had not taken silk. When told the reason he was much amused. Ted became a Queen's Counsel soon after. He was a towering silk, practising with great distinction in a number of areas until retiring from the Bar in 1982. Ted had one reader who went on to practise at the bar, Frank Vincent, now Mr Justice Vincent of the Victorian Supreme Court. </PARA>
<PARA> The late forties and early fifties were harsh times to take up unpopular causes. Russia first exploded an atom bomb in 1949 and a hydrogen bomb in 1953. In 1949 Tiananmen Square saw Mao Tse Tung announce the success of his revolution. The Korean War broke out in June 1950 and lasted until July 1953. Stalin ruled Russia until March 1953. In January 1950 Alger Hiss was convicted in the United States of perjury and, by inference, of spying. The following month, the Government of the United Kingdom announced that Klaus Fuchs, head of the physics department at the Harwell Atomic Energy Research Establishment, had confessed to passing atomic secrets to Russia. In July 1950 Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were arrested in America for espionage. They were sentenced to death on 5 April 1951 and executed on 19 July 1953. Joseph Raymond McCarthy, the Senator for Wisconsin, was at the height of his power. The Senate did not censure him until December 1954. </PARA>
<PARA> On 19 May and 14 June 1949 letters patent of royal commissions were granted to Mr Justice Lowe to inquire into and report upon the origins, aims, objects and funds of the Communist Party in Victoria. Ted appeared for the Communist Party. When he took the brief he knew it would set back his career. His integrity of purpose overrode any concern he had for personal advancement. </PARA>
<PARA> On 20 October 1950 Sir William McKell, as Governor-General of Australia, assented to the Communist Party Dissolution Act. It was challenged in the High Court of Australia by the Australian Communist Party and a number of other plaintiffs. The hearing began on 14 November 1950. Ted Laurie again appeared for the Party. The court held that the Commonwealth Government had no power to make the law it purported to. The High Court handed down its decision on 9 March 1951. On 5 July 1951 the Constitution Alteration (Power to Deal with Communists and Communism) Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives by Mr Robert Gordon Menzies, as he then was. This was passed and the referendum held on 22 September 1951. It was rejected by just 50.48 per cent of the voters. Anti-communism was running high. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision of the High Court that was handed down on 9 March 1951 and the referendum which was held six months later were crucial to Australia's development as an open, tolerant and democratic society. Freedom of expression, freedom of association and freedom of thought would now be much diminished but for the resolve of Ted and precious few like him. A true democracy guards the rights of the unpopular, especially when under ferocious attack. </PARA>
<PARA> In December 1945 the Cain Government passed an Act abolishing the doctrine of common employment. In May 1946 it made extensive amendments to the Workers Compensation Act. In December 1951 the McDonald Government abolished contributory negligence as an absolute defence and made it the basis for apportionment. These changes gave workers the potential to recover better and fairer payments for injuries they suffered in the course of their employment. A small group of lawyers enabled them to realise that potential. The lawyers prepared the cases, defined the issues, gathered the evidence and developed the strategy necessary for the victim of an industrial accident to have a successful outcome. Ted was a leader in this group. His preparation and presentation of common law claims became the model for plaintiffs' counsel. He was a towering jury advocate able to mix logic and emotion in the right proportions. He was a formidable opponent and drew top settlements from apprehensive insurers. </PARA>
<PARA> Ted played a central role in the development of industrial law in Australia. He practised in the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration until its effective demise in 1956, then in the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and then in the Australian Industrial Court and the industrial division of the Federal Court of Australia. He appeared regularly in the High Court. His name is spread liberally throughout the reports; his arguments have become precedents in industrial law. </PARA>
<PARA> Ted had great loyalty to his Party. His hunger for justice, for what was fair and for what the dignity of people demanded tempered his commitment. Internationally, the dark side of communism was manifest in the 1950s and early 1960s. Soviet troops invaded Hungary in October 1956. The split between China and Russia became public in 1960. At home Ted saw some leaders of the Communist Party use it for personal power and glory. They all served the rank and file who worked hard and deserved better. In 1965 Ted quietly left the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Ted's high purpose never flagged. It forever remained pertinent to the times. In the 1970s he successfully appeared in equal opportunity cases for women, land right actions for Aboriginals and prosecutions for peaceful protesters. At the end of his career he defended a tragic young man charged with manslaughter. He won an acquittal. Had Ted pursued a course different from the one he did, his pedigree, his qualities of mind, body and spirit would almost certainly have brought him to high office on the Bench or in government. He understood this but never repented of his choice. The living out of his ideals was his great ambition. </PARA>
<PARA> Ted was compassionate by nature, generous by instinct and tolerant by conviction. Though there were numerous occasions for it, Ted had an overwhelming lack of hate. His view of the world and the people in it was benign. He felt deeply for anyone who suffered in mind, body or soul. He invariably treated his clients with respect and understanding. His fees were moderate. He gave generously of his time to colleagues who sought his advice. His actions reflected an innate compassion for all people. Ted loved his football, his cricket and his sport in general. He loved the law. He loved his ideals. Most of all he loved his fellows. His life was well spent in their service. On 29 October 1989 a mighty spirit departed this earth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate tonight what I regard as a serious attack on the rights of honourable senators to perform their duties and to discharge their responsibilities. It is not a matter I do lightly; I would prefer not to do it. Reluctantly I have come to the conclusion that I have little choice but to bring this matter into the open and deal with it. As you will be aware, Mr President, the Australian domestic aviation industry has been involved in a serious dispute since August. It has had devastating effects on Australia's tourism which was our biggest export earner last year. These effects will cost this nation well over $1 billion and will extend for years into the future. Many hundreds, if not thousands, of companies-most of them small and family owned-will go bankrupt, taking with them the life savings of their owners. There will be no climb back to normality after this dispute has been resolved for those people who are innocent victims of the dispute between the airlines and their employees. The effects on the airlines and pilots, serious though they are, are of a lesser magnitude.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Given these circumstances, circumstances of national importance, it is quite proper for the Senate to be involved, not as a surrogate for the Industrial Relations Commission, for that is not the role of the Parliament, but in being concerned with all the aspects of this unnecessary dispute which are having such a tragic effect on our nation. I have taken my part as a senator in the affairs of this chamber in relation to this dispute. Some while ago I received a letter, which I regard as threatening, from the Chairman of Australian Airlines Ltd, Mr Harris, about some observations I made in a debate in the Senate. I ignored that letter. Some while later I was appointed to the Senate Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Airline Pilots Dispute. The Committee held numerous public hearings. Among the witnesses were representatives from Australian Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia. During the hearings I received a most threatening and intimidating letter which Mr Harris had instructed one of his minions to write to me, on behalf of the `full board of Australian Airlines Ltd'. It is one thing to write advancing a different point of view. It is quite a different matter to resort to the approach adopted in this letter. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the offending letter. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Senator MacGibbon</PARA>
<PARA> I have been directed by the full Board of Australian Airlines Limited, who met in Sydney on Wednesday 29 November 1989, to write to you with respect to comments attributed to you in the press on Tuesday 28 November 1989, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> ``Last night during the Senate inquiry Senator MacGibbon (Queensland, Liberal) said the two Opposition spokesmen on aviation had been threatened by the heads of Ansett and Australian airlines. He would not comment further on his statement.''</PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Board I request an immediate explanation of those comments as they are without any foundation whatsoever and are extremely harmful to the reputation and integrity of all members of the Board of this Airline. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, it was brought to the Board's attention that Australian Airlines' Assistant General Manager, Flight Operations, Captain David Wiltshire, was subjected to comments of a derogatory nature by you at the Senate Inquiry into Certain Aspects of the Pilots' Dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> The Board views very seriously any attempt to impugn the reputation of a senior Manager of this Airline and in particular, in the present circumstances, the reputation of Captain Wiltshire who has worked tirelessly to maintain the excellent safety record of the Airline whilst rebuilding the Flight Operations Division. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless you can advise that you were incorrectly reported in the press or you are able to substantiate any of the allegations you have made, which are requested by return facsimile, the Board seeks an immediate retraction of your comments in the next session of the public inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA> You will have received a copy of a letter dated 30 November to Senator MacGibbon written on behalf of the Board of Australian Airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> I have now had the opportunity of reading the transcript of the proceedings of the Inquiry relevant to the matters raised in that letter, and I wish to make the following points. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly it is clear that the comments attributed in the press to Senator MacGibbon alleging that threats were made to both the Shadow Minister for Aviation by the Chairman of Australian and of Ansett respectively were in essence a correct report of what transpired in the inquiry on the 27th November. (refer p. 712 and 713 of the transcript). I note that Senator MacGibbon has failed to respond to the Board's request for an explanation. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly it appears that Senator Brownhill was the author of comments casting aspersions on the reputation of Captain David Wiltshire although I understand that Senator MacGibbon was interjecting in support of Senator Brownhill, although not reported in the transcript (refer p. 609 and 610). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, you will note that this letter is now to the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Cooney. A copy was sent to me. We see that Mr Harris has now taken the trouble to read the Hansard in a belated attempt to find out what did happen. He does not say that he was wrong; he does not apologise. In the circumstances they would have been the actions of a reasonable person. He now qualifies his statement about the press. He totally shifts his claims about what happened to Wiltshire. The Hansard transcript proves Harris wrong. He now blames my colleague Senator Brownhill for `casting aspersions on the reputation of Captain David Wiltshire'. Then comes a pathetic and childish attempt to justify his attacks with the statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I understand that Senator MacGibbon was interjecting in support of Senator Brownhill although not reported in the transcript. </PARA>
<PARA>The probity and accuracy of Hansard are now impugned. </PARA>
<PARA> There are several points that must be made from the Harris letters. The first and most important point is that senators have the right to freedom of speech in the Parliament. The right of freedom of speech in Parliament draws its powers from the Parliamentary Act 1987. This, in turn, derives its powers from section 49 of the Australian Constitution, through that to the House of Commons of the British Parliament and ultimately to the Bill of Rights 1688. As well as conferring clear and specific rights and immunities on senators and members it also covers contempt of the Parliament. Contempt of the Parliament is a criminal offence punishable either by a prison sentence of up to six months or by a fine not exceeding $5,000 for a person, or $25,000 in the case of a corporation. Any attempt to threaten, intimidate or suborn a senator in the exercise of his duties is a contempt of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, Mr Harris has been proved wrong and has been shown to be careless with the truth in making these attacks. The point must be made that, even if the charges made by Mr Harris were true, senators have the right to go about their duties and to inquire into and investigate matters of national importance with immunity. It is perfectly proper for witnesses to be questioned rigorously and robustly if the occasion warrants it. It may well be that an outcome favourable to the witness can emerge as a result of rigorous questioning when a more benign approach might have caused the opposite to occur. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another point to this as well. This behaviour by Mr Harris is distasteful and insulting to me but it is also distasteful and insulting to the Senate. Mr President, in the chamber, you and you able deputies control the standard of debate in accordance with Standing Orders so that decorum prevails. Similarly, in committees, the Chairman, under the same Standing Orders, sees that the meetings or hearings of those committees are conducted with due courtesy. By his letters Mr Harris is attacking Senator Cooney's actions as Chairman as much as he is attacking Senator Brownhill. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that this is not the first time Mr Harris has behaved so deplorably. In 1987, one of our colleagues Senator Puplick questioned an official from the Australian Sports Commission at a Senate Estimates committee hearing. Mr Harris, whose position as Chairman of Australian Airlines and the Australian Sports Commission coincides with the tenure of Mr Hawke as Prime Minister, wrote the same sort of letter as he wrote to me threatening Senator Puplick for daring to question one of his officials. Just as Mr Harris wrote to Senator Cooney in an attempt to bring pressure to bear on me, so Mr Harris wrote to Mr John Valder who was then Federal President of the Liberal Party of Australia. He described Senator Puplick's action in the most denigratory of terms and for good measure finished with a threat about the difficulties of obtaining funds for political parties when people, presumably like Senator Puplick, in his opinion prostitute the systems of the Parliament. Senator Puplick dealt with the matter in his usual accomplished way. For those who are interested, pages 1665 to 1668 of the Senate Hansard of 3 November 1987 record this somewhat unequal duel. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to give Mr Harris some further advice. His priorities should be directed to discharging his fiduciary duties as a director of this greatly troubled company, Australian Airlines. It is now in desperate financial straits as a consequence of his failure to take the appropriate actions to resolve this dispute. He is the Chairman. His shareholders, the people of Australia, are greatly displeased at his stewardship. If it is possible for the company to survive-and it is not at all clear that it can-it will take all his concentrated efforts to bring that about. </PARA>
<PARA> Neither I nor any senator here will be stood over or deterred from our duty by intimidatory threats such as those made by the Board of Australian Airlines at the behest of its Chairman. I will not be deflected or intimidated from performing my proper public responsibilities. If any further action along the lines I have experienced is taken, it will result in the appropriate action being taken. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He got the gold medal, did he? Let us wait and see how many of the 85 athletes that have been selected quite properly on the proper criteria are dropped from the team by Mr John Coates and see what Senator Graeme Richardson has to say about that. Let him tell these athletes personally that as a result of his backroom wheeling and dealing, they have been scrubbed from the team, notwithstanding the fact that they quite properly and legitimately have been selected to represent Australia by the selection panel for their team.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The comment that Senator Richardson made was that he would rather have Mr John Coates select the team than he would the Senate. That might be the bureaucratic, autocratic way in which this Government and the fixers do business. Perhaps that is symptomatic of the arrogance that they demonstrate towards this chamber. As we all know, the difference is that Mr John Coates represents his own point of view in this case. I shall read part of the resolution carried today:</PARA>
<PARA>(vii) that there is no practical reason why these 15 young Australian athletes should not be given an opportunity to represent their country; and-</PARA>
<PARA>this is the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (b) calls upon:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the ACGA to reverse its decision and allow these athletes an opportunity to represent Australia, and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the Government to convey to the ACGA the view that the 85 qualifying Australian track and field athletes be allowed to compete in the Auckland Commonwealth Games. </PARA>
<PARA>That resolution was carried by senators who represent millions of ordinary, decent Australians, who do have a point of view, who do care, who do have an interest, and who will be glued to their television sets cheering along these athletes at Auckland. They will not be down there basking in the reflected glory for crude political purposes, draping themselves all over the nearest successful athlete in pursuit of a few grubby votes. They will be cheering for them as decent Australians who get pleasure in seeing their fellow man succeed. </PARA>
<PARA> To suggest that there is something impertinent about the Senate passing a motion calling upon the taxpayer-funded-in part-Australian Commonwealth Games Association to ensure that the 85 athletes retain their selection shrieks of the arrogance of this Government. It is a function of this Senate to respond to, reflect upon and present a whole range of issues, not only of a political nature but also of a social nature. That is exactly what this resolution did, and in spite of the Government it was carried. The resolution sought to express a point of view-a perfectly legitimate point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that at the end of the day, Senator Richardson, instead of doing a backdoor deal and making an offer to Athletics Australia that it could not refuse, should have been standing up in the Senate and saying, `look, this Government is of the view that it would be grossly unfair to 15 young dedicated Australian athletes to scrub them out from the team once they have been selected'. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the fundamental issue. But no, in the typical way these deals are done by this Government, we are looking for some sort of arrangement that appears to satisfy everybody but in the end achieves other than that which is absolutely desirable. I would have thought that Robert de Castella knew something about sport, something about athletics and made the odd contribution himself-some might say considerably in excess of that of Senator Richardson. Robert de Castella said that to rub out 15 young athletes now is not only to break their soul and their hearts but to break their careers. That was Robert de Castella's modest contribution to this debate. Of course, as is the way these days, the views of the athletes amount to nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> Need we go back to the time of Dawn Fraser when she was rubbed out for life because she allegedly climbed a flagpole? Pompous officials strutting around in the green and gold blazers, drinking cocktails, rubbing shoulders with their fellow travellers from overseas as if they had made some contribution to the gold medals, stood in judgment upon the moral and social worth of our athletes. We have now got ourselves into the situation where, because of a sporting imbroglio-a bureaucratic mess-caused by the failure of the officials, the sporting careers of 15 young kids are in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson was impertinent enough to suggest today that nobody else knew the selection criteria. Everybody, except presumably Senator Richardson, knows the criteria. The criteria were set down and 85 athletes met them. Unlike the rest of the sporting teams from Australia going to the Commonwealth Games, I think the athletics team is the only one not taking its full quota-all the bowlers are going; all the badminton players are going; all the swimmers are going. It is only the athletics team that does not have a full quota. It is entitled to have 118 members-the number that the English and the Canadian teams from the other side of the world are taking. Our officials from Athletics Australia judged that 85 athletes would qualify. Qualify for what? In their assessment, those athletes would qualify for the finals of their chosen events at the Commonwealth Games. It seems to me that that is considered to be not good enough, that there has to be a higher achievement before those athletes are judged to be appropriate to represent Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As I contemplate that, I think about the evidence given by some of the best coaches in Australia to the Senate Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts during its Drugs in Sport inquiry. I recall those witnesses saying, `One of the problems is that the level of expectation of Australian athletes is cast so high that they are not on an even playing field; to compete internationally they are given barriers and levels far beyond that of athletes from other nations'. When we are imploring our athletes to stay clean, to run and to compete on merit without artificial aids such as anabolic steroids, we are telling those athletes that they have to be virtually guaranteed a medal before they can qualify to represent this country. If that is not giving a wrong signal to our athletes, what is? I would have thought that being able to qualify for the finals would be an adequate yardstick by absolutely any measure. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that I hope, notwithstanding what I consider to be a grubby deal, that the 85 athletes go to the Commonwealth Games. I hope the arrangement is the sham it appears to be and that the 85 athletes will go and everybody will save face. The officials from the Australian Commonwealth Games Association can say that justice has been done, the officials representing the Australian athletes can also say justice has been done and, at the end of the day, all the athletes can go. </PARA>
<PARA> The worst of all worlds would be to put up this veneer of respectability in terms of making judgments and then, just to show that it is meant to be serious, wipe out a couple of athletes on the way so that everybody can take it seriously. Let us all hope that these officials, and Mr Coates, get the message. Given that there is no financial impediment and no problems with seats on the aircraft, accommodation, competition uniforms, marching uniforms or coaching-in fact, no practical problems at all-I hope that commonsense will prevail and those 15 extra kids will be allowed to compete, in spite of the mess caused by our officials, who wonder why they have got such a rotten reputation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In recent days there has been a rash of rumours to the effect that the Managing Director of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), Mr David Hill, has been actively engaged in discussions about his future with a view to joining a consortium which might purchase the troubled Seven network from the Qintex group in Australia. If these stories are true, they raise very serious matters of public concern in view of the obvious conflict of interest involved. Therefore, it is essential that Mr Hill should immediately clear the air and make a public statement about his future intentions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The position of Managing Director of Australia's premier national broadcaster, the ABC, is one of enormous national and symbolic significance. It is imperative that any incumbent is completely committed to the position which, at any time, involves a range of contentious and complex issues. It would not be possible for the Managing Director properly to discharge his duties if he is actively contemplating a jump into the private sector, presumably in contemplation of a large increase in financial remuneration. There should be no basis for concern on Mr Hill's part that he would not be able to work effectively with an incoming coalition government, but it would certainly be very difficult for Mr Hill to retain his current position while any cloud hangs over his future intentions. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the matters that would preoccupy any managing director of the ABC-in particular, Mr Hill, at the present moment-is the difficulties being experienced within Radio Australia both in relation to a number of very significant policy and programming changes, and a forced relocation from the East Burwood site to the south bank of the Yarra-a very pricey piece of real estate, the development costs of which are increasingly providing financial headaches for the ABC. This matter deserves much more public scrutiny than it has received to date. The staff of Radio Australia have been left in a state of great uncertainty in recent months about their future. </PARA>
<PARA> The move from the former premises of Radio Australia in Lonsdale Street, Melbourne to the East Burwood site was made some five years ago. A review of Radio Australia was conducted in late 1988 under the chairmanship of Mr Stuart Revell, the assistant managing director. In the course of that review, Mr Revell visited Radio Australia to outline the key objectives of the review. There was no hint at any stage to staff that the issue of the location of Radio Australia would be under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> That review was a very extensive exercise and resulted, finally, in a report made to the board in September this year, but not released in any public form. Again, it would seem that that report made no recommendation in terms of any relocation of Radio Australia from East Burwood to the south bank. Instead, the Board of the ABC seems to have seized on remarks in the report to the effect that Radio Australia felt isolated from the the mainstream of the ABC. The reality is that the overwhelming majority of the staff of Radio Australia feel isolated in terms of a lack of funding and, in particular, the ongoing difficulty that has been experienced in obtaining additional funding for updating transmission facilities. They are also concerned about their distance from the centre of power in Sydney. It is quite another matter to suggest that somehow they have welcomed the move or, indeed, feel that they should be brought together with other ABC Radio facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why I have additional concerns about an interview which Mr Hill gave to John Hindle on 3AW Radio Melbourne today. Mr Hill said, when being asked why the move was being made:</PARA>
<PARA>We conducted in 1988 and 89 probably the most thorough review of Radio Australia's activities-that is, the ABC conducted the review of its Radio Australia-and I think it is fair to say that it was overwhelmingly a very positive review-because what we looked at were all the things that needed strengthening in Radio Australia: the transmitters, its programs, its news, its current affairs and so on. One of the issues that became abundantly obvious to us, is that at East Burwood-which was a good idea 15 years ago when it was originally planned-has become, and most of the staff agreed in their submissions with us, that is has become a professional and geographically isolated centre. </PARA>
<PARA>That series of comments does not seem to accord with any of the facts known to me. One can understand a desire to put a positive public view on what is taking place, but I think Mr Hill's remarks go closer to being a calculated attempt to put a gloss on the actual events. Certainly the remarks suggesting that the staff were the prime movers behind the ABC Board's decision would seem to be completely divorced from reality. Certainly, on the information available to me, it is very much at odds with the facts because the reality is that more than 75 per cent of Radio Australia staff, some 154 persons, signed a petition opposing the move to the south bank. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear, therefore, that far from being a logical conclusion following ongoing study and review the ABC Board's in principle decision to move Radio Australia to the south bank is nothing short of a very recent ad hoc initiative which would seem to be primarily motivated by a desire to salvage the economic viability of the south bank project. If the move to the south bank is part of some longstanding deliberative process, it is very odd that there is no mention of it in the latest ABC annual report in relation to Radio Australia-a report which has been tabled only in recent weeks. If Mr Hill is correct in asserting that the staff are behind his initiatives, again it is passing strange that the Public Service Union has been very critical of the unseemly haste of the ABC's decisions and the lack of consultation with staff and their union. There has certainly been no public explanation to date for what is clearly a very recent decision which inevitably gives rise to concern that the move may well be driven by the financial imperatives occasioned by the Government's high interest rate policies and the difficulties which the ABC is experiencing in affording the south bank project. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe, on the information made available to me, that it is simply a cheap shot to suggest, as has been suggested on a number of occasions, that any opposition to the relocation is simply the product of disgruntled and essentially selfish staff who have become used to their comfortable eastern suburbs homes and certainly appreciate their present location. It does not strike me as being the result of any unselfishness that a move-which Mr Hill says was contemplated 15 years ago, which in fact eventuated some five years ago and until only a matter of several months ago was a fait accompli-has not resulted in a significant number of people changing their places of residence, perhaps even their patterns of travel and their general lifestyle because they have become attached to the area. That in itself is in no way sufficient to explain what seems to me to be a foment of discontent about the arbitrary and authoritarian manner in which this move is being imposed upon the staff, like it or not. I think that the public at large is very much entitled to an explanation for what is currently happening in terms of the relocation. Mr Hill in that same radio interview made quite a number of very laudatory comments about the operations of Radio Australia. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>It has been well served. It broadcasts in English and eight other languages around the globe, 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year. </PARA>
<PARA>* * *</PARA>
<PARA>. . . perhaps it's the best example anywhere in Australia of harmonious multiculturalism . . .  It's a very effective, and very professional and very credible organisation. </PARA>
<PARA>* * *</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I think as a result of the good people we have in Radio Australia . . . Radio Australia is destined to have an even brighter future than it has had in the past. </PARA>
<PARA>Again I think these remarks, which on their face are very laudatory indeed, describe a number of very far-reaching and forcible job relocation decisions which have taken place in recent months. They have also resulted in a very significant restructuring of the programming and direction of focus of Radio Australia to the point that some of the places, such as Japan, which are very much the origin of the correspondence received by Radio Australia are now to be effectively ignored, but that matter is not to be brought to the attention of any of the listeners who might write in inquiring why they are no longer getting any particular mention or expressions of concern for their part of the globe. </PARA>
<PARA> I do think that the public is entitled to an explanation not only of why these very significant programming moves are being made but, more importantly, what is driving the relocation. I have been given a copy of a document which is described as a `Planning and Financial Study of Collocation of Radio Australia in Southbank Project'. It does make it clear that the ABC expects to receive something in excess of $11m from the sale of Radio Australia-that is the East Burwood site-which it would then apply in part to reducing the debt burden on the south bank site. The project costs of that south bank site have gone from about $60m less than 12 months ago to some $76m to date if one includes Radio Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The additional project cost to relocate Radio Australia will be about $6 1/2m. It certainly does seem that there has been indecent haste in the making of this decision. It is no doubt a fact that the original decision came about only after quite a considerable degree of agony and forethought. It certainly involved considerable money in building the Radio Australia premises which I am informed certainly meet the requirements of staff and generally do not need any significant upgrading. The relocation to the city will, therefore, not achieve anything further in terms of technical efficiency, but will certainly involve a very high degree of dislocation in staffing terms. The parking spaces, for example, are very confined by the natural boundaries. There seems to be a need for a much greater explanation of why it is that this decision has only very recently been made, based on a study which I am informed took only a couple of weeks to complete, and which proceeded in the face of an almost calculated decision to ignore the concerns of the staff and the union. </PARA>
<PARA> On 24 October last, the day before the ABC Board meeting which formalised the in-principle decision to relocate, a well attended meeting of Radio Australia staff unanimously condemned the breaking by Mr Hill of a promise which they assert had been made to an all staff meeting on 29 September that full and extensive discussions with the affected staff and unions would take place before a decision was made. So there is a very high level of concern within Radio Australia, concern which is not likely to go away and which, I think, deserves a much franker explanation than Mr Hill proferred on radio 3AW this afternoon. I hope that, in making clear his future intentions, Mr Hill will accord equal treatment to the likely future aspirations of the staff of Radio Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night during the adjournment debate I was rudely interrupted when Senator Julian McGauran called a quorum. As it was already late, slightly too few senators appeared in the chamber in answer to the call. I commend those who did, not because I imagine that they were interested or supportive of what I had to say but because they were supporting the right of a senator to say what she liked at a time on a sitting day of the Senate that has traditionally been available to Independents, minor party senators and back bench senators of the major parties so that they can speak on matters for which little time is allocated during the business day. The only excuse for Senator McGauran is that a more senior member of the Opposition had set a bad example by a previous quorum call. Why honourable senators would wish to gag debate when they could use the adjournment debate for a ringing refutation is a mystery to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my remarks last night I had speculated on the motives of the electors of New South Wales who voted for an alternative to the Unsworth Government and who woke up to find themselves under a Murray-Greiner Government. I had touched lightly on some of the characteristics of the large individual who has provided intellectual leadership for the Government of New South Wales. I refer to Mr Murray's view that the greenhouse effect was merely a figment of the imagination of international eminent scientists. I had just begun to look at the activities of Mr Murray's Government on the coast of New South Wales and the revelations of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), particularly on the north coast of the State. </PARA>
<PARA> Who did the Independent Commission Against Corruption publicly name as interested parties in these inquiries? It was none other than the mountainous Mr Wal Murray and his good mate and National Party colleague Mr Ian Causley. Did these honourable gentlemen offer to stand down from their sensitive administrative posts while the ICAC's deliberations concerning their activities were under way, as former Premier Neville Wran was required to do when his conduct was the subject of inquiry? Of course not. Not at all. Not only did this pair of sinister rustics stay firmly planted in their plush leather office chairs, but they even took to issuing threats of defamation proceedings against anyone who might suggest that it was a proper thing for them to remove themselves. In this way, Messrs Causley and Murray have been able to stand over and intimidate their critics in the environment movement and elsewhere. That is how government in New South Wales is carried out. Those with the odour of impropriety about them are still treated with all the respect due to Ministers, and they remain in office. </PARA>
<PARA> The name of the New South Wales natural resources Minister, Ian Causley, will be well known to honourable senators who have followed the south-east forest debate and to those who have followed the longstanding debate about the siting of a pulp mill in northern New South Wales. Interestingly, in 1974 as an inaugural member of the Clarence Valley Environment Protection Society, Mr Ian Causley no less protested against the plan to site a Japanese pulp mill at Iluka, along with his fellow conservationists at that time. More recently, however, he has changed his tune and has been championing the siting of a pulp mill at Grafton which is to be put there by Daishowa International. He has done this much to the alarm of his voters and to a wide cross-section of local residents and industry leaders. Sawloggers, fishermen, apiarists and tourist-oriented business people have been putting forward many of the same valid objections to this proposal that Mr Causley put forward in 1974. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the same man who has brought us the south-east woodchipping war and who would, if allowed, push that dangerous conflict to the point where people are injured or even killed in the worst circumstances. This bluff former cane cutter from the north coast no doubt sees himself out there in the fields swinging his machete. Whether it is sticks of cane or trees or protesters who fall under the blade probably does not matter to Ian Causley. It was this Minister who arrogantly stated in response to the announcement of a joint government biological study of the south-east forests that, no matter what the outcome of the study, the forests would be logged. </PARA>
<PARA> This reasonable and fair-thinking Minister of the Crown has let everybody know where he stands on the issue of forestry and the environment. He made his position very clear when he addressed the Timber Development Association in Sydney at the beginning of this year. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Make no mistake about it. Our industry is engaged in a life and death political struggle. For the last 10 or 15 years it has been losing the contest. In the last couple of years it has decided to act decisively to save itself, and this commendable (if belated) survival instinct together with solid political support from this Government gives us a fighting chance. The land-use issue is pure politics. It has almost nothing to do with science. It is a battle with selfish interest groups for the control of resources which belong to the whole community. The fight to save our community's resources from being locked away will be won only by effective political action. </PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>This has two aspects. One is reversing the public relations tide which has been running so strongly in favour of the preservationists. The other is to crack political heads. This means telling governments bluntly that industry and workers will not stand idly by and watch their resources base withdrawn for no good reason. It means making political threats and making them good at election time. This is the language spoken by all governments: the language of public opinion directly translated into votes. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>This process is hard, it is unpleasant and it involves intense and sustained lobbying. It requires the kind of persistence and dedication demonstrated by our opponents. They are a formidable enemy because they believe they have God on their side-or whatever passes for God these days in the fashionable Balmain terrace. </PARA>
<PARA>He concludes:</PARA>
<PARA>I look forward to seeing you on the barricades. </PARA>
<PARA>Government in the eyes of Ian Causley is not for the people; it is for him and his mates. It is about getting the spoils and taking revenge, making threats and cracking heads. Mr Causley's approach to government is not unlike that of a small town lout looking for someone to bash on a Saturday night. Nothing demonstrates this hooligan mentality better--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw the comment, Mr President. To illustrate the general drift of what I have just been saying, I refer to Mr Causley's policy of selling off crown leases and reserves throughout New South Wales. Earlier this year Mr Causley brought in a new Crown Lands Act which is full of fine phrases about assessing social and environmental values of crown lands before they can be disposed of. All of it was made instantly meaningless when the Minister junked the administrative rules for crown lands assessments and arbitrarily decided that lands under some classes of tenure, such as perpetual leases, should be sold. There are over 20,000 perpetual leases in New South Wales. Many would contain significant environmental features and should not be let out of public ownership. A recent case in point was the sale at $1 an acre of an area of rainforest under perpetual lease on the Liverpool Range near Scone.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3K4">Senator DUNN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This rainforest is adjacent to the Cedar Brush Nature Reserve which is managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service and was wanted by the Service as an addition to that reserve. The evidence is there in black and white, and all Senator McGauran has to do is go and check his facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am sure that a proper, objective assessment of the circumstances would have confirmed that there was no better use for that crown land than to reserve it under the National Parks and Wildlife Act; but propriety and objectivity appear to be strangers to the New South Wales Government. As if flogging off the public's land at a pittance to mates and supporters is not bad enough, the New South Wales Government now seems to be ready to do the same with the public's water. In New South Wales, ownership of water is vested in the State under the provisions of the Water Administration Act. There is a push, undoubtedly encouraged by the Resources Minister, to privatise rural water and create an enormous asset in the hands of farmers and irrigators. </PARA>
<PARA> If this scheme proceeds, the results could be disastrous for the physical and social environment of rural New South Wales. The ability of government to effectively manage the State's river systems could be pre-empted; the question of massive compensation payouts would dominate every management decision and paralyse administration. With the parallel development of transferable water rights, the way would be open for big companies to move in and corner the market in water licences, creating an unknown potential for social injustice and environmental degredation. </PARA>
<PARA> What prospect, under such a regime, would there be for realising the fine words and sentiments expressed in the Catchment Management Act 1989, which was passed only last month by the New South Wales Parliament? What hope would there be for improving the water and environmental qualities of the inland river systems when a large part of the water in those systems would be beyond the Government's power to manage, or prohibitively expensive to do so because of the need to compensate the water owner? These questions underscore the hypocrisy of the Greiner-Murray Government. </PARA>
<PARA> As if to compound the errors of their National Party friends, the Liberal members of the Greiner-Murray Government have launched a massive sell off of public lands and buildings in urban areas. The Sydney Showground and E. S. Marks Athletics Field, which were first reserved for use of the people as a common in 1811 by Governor Macquarie, are to be sold to developers. These historic public lands-part of the heritage, culture and social life of the people of Sydney-will be put on the block by Nick Greiner's Government as if they meant nothing to the people of New South Wales. Part of the 80-year old Sydney harbourside reserve at Strickland House will also go. Many schools, even those wanted by the community, such as the Cremorne Girls High School, are to be sold off. Indeed, Cremorne Girls High School has already been sold off to a private school. </PARA>
<PARA> Corporatisation and management are the `in' words around Sydney's Macquarie Street these days. The Greiner Administration finds its raison d'etre in applying the Harvard Business School management techniques learnt by its Premier. But what does it all mean in the end? One wonders. Look behind the flimsy veneer and we see a bunch of grimy corporate asset strippers going about their work with grim determination. They have no respect for the past and no vision for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me conclude this sorry tale with an account of the Greiner-Murray Government's success in precipitating the decline and fall of a once proud organisation, the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service. This is the body that was acknowledged by the well respected International Union for the Conservation of Nature to be manager of one of the five best national parks systems in the world. The Service has the dubious fortune to have as its Minister the Hon. Tim Moore, a former Boy Scout, I believe. Most keen observers agree that Mr Moore would not personally wish to see the demise of the National Parks and Wildlife Service but, whether or not that is the case, he appears to be impotently presiding over that very process. </PARA>
<PARA> The rot seems to have started in the first half of this year, when Mr Moore began preparing the ground to sack the Service's director, John Whitehouse. It did not come as a surprise to many people that Mr Moore should want to do this. The able and hard working Mr Whitehouse-more than a match for Mr Moore-was put in charge of the Service by the former Labor Government, appointed in fact by the present Opposition Leader, Mr Carr. There were many in the Greiner-Murray Administration who saw Mr Whitehouse as politically unacceptable and who were determined to get rid of him. Outside the Government there was a more or less constant baying for blood from a group called the Land Conservation Council. This is not a conservation group, as its name might suggest, but an alliance of all the would-be national park plunderers-hard-line miners, loggers, graziers and assorted philistines. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Moore bravely waited for Mr Whitehouse to go away on holidays before making his move. He took advantage of the disaffection expressed by a minority of head office staff of the NPWS to put a team from the Office of Public Management (OPM) into the head office. The OPM report on the NPWS was predictable in its damning indictments of the Service's management and relied on a budget overrun as its main criticism. What was not stressed in the report, of course, was the fact that both the Service and the New South Wales Treasury had failed to predict a dramatic fall off in national park gate takings in the first half of 1989 due to freakish weather conditions which caused it to rain almost every weekend for six months. </PARA>
<PARA> Also underplayed was the contribution of the Unsworth Government to the Service's financial and management difficulties, brought about when it forced the organisation to move to Hurstville after a year had gone into planning for a move to an already selected site at Hornsby. This was a shabby political decision from that now invisible man of New South Wales politics, Barrie Unsworth, who hoped to ingratiate himself with his electorate and win a few more votes by delivering to it a captive government department. In the process the organisation was demoralised and sent reeling by the exodus of many of its financial management staff and other vital personnel. The reversal of this rotten decision was in the hands of the incoming Greiner-Murray Administration but it chose to do nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> It is arrant nonsense, therefore, for Mr Moore and his colleagues to dress up the sacking of the Service director, a plain political assassination, as a necessary management move. What has been the fate of the National Parks and Wildlife Service since? It has been unrelentingly dismal. Contrary to Mr Moore's assurances that the organisation's staffing level would be maintained, the organisation has been heamorrhaging people. More than 80 staff, or nearly 10 per cent, have resigned since the departure of the Director and have not been replaced. These include some of organisation's most skilled and experienced administrators and managers. Attempts to appoint a replacement director have ended in failure. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Moore has cancelled meetings of his statutory advisory body, the National Parks and Wildlife Service Advisory Council, to spare himself the embarrassment of explaining to its members the debacle which he has, by either intent or incompetence, created. No proposals for new reserves or management plans for existing ones are coming out of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. The organisation is dead in the water. </PARA>
<PARA> Even the one measly reserve proposal promised by the Greiner-Murray coalition at the last election, the tiny Wyrrabalong Park on the central coast, seems to have been abandoned. The capacity of the Service to carry out its important nature conservation role, to examine the environmental implications of tourist and other developments, to assess land clearing proposals and proposals to alienate crown lands, to bring a governmental view to logging proposals separate and independent from the Forestry Commission, to investigate and bring forward land reservation proposals and wilderness declarations and to protect wildlife is now vastly reduced and continuing its steep decline. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that this is exactly the result desired by the Greiner-Murray Government. It may yet preside over the disappearance of the National Parks and Wildlife Service as a separate professional manager of land and resources within the State Government, to the immense satisfaction of the troglodytes of the Land Conservation Council and those like them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question;</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Governor-General received a letter dated 3 November 1989 from one Aboriginal elder about the Barunga statement painting presented to me at Barunga in June 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The letter asked that the painting be returned to the writer. Because of the sensitivity of the issue, and requests from Aboriginal people that there be no public discussion, it would not be proper for me to mention the name of the elder concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) A meeting of senior Aboriginal people was held at Gan Gan on 16 November at which the painting was discussed. As a result, I was advised that the painting should stay in Canberra. I have informed those who have written to me that I am happy to respect and be guided by the wishes of the Aboriginal people in regard to the painting. The Governor-General has been advised of this.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Yes. The painting was placed in the Minister's custody last year as a consequence of publicity being given to apparent differences of opinion among Aboriginals.</PARA>
