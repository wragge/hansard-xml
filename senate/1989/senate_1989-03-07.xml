<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth, that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Video Material has concluded that ``Adverse effects upon people, and especially upon children, of exposure to material containing various degrees of violence, pornography or obscenity have been demonstrated''.</PARA>
<PARA> The majority of the Select Committee strongly opposed the proposition for a new NVE (non-violent erotica) category, which would have entrenched X-rated video pornography.</PARA>
<PARA> All six State Governments have, through their Attorneys-General, expressed unanimous opposition to the circulation of X-rated videos.</PARA>
<PARA> We consider the continuing distribution of X-rated videos from the A.C.T. to be reprehensible and to be contrary to the wellbeing of the Australian community in general.</PARA>

<PARA> (a) the comment on page 9 of the Women's Electoral Lobby Tax Supplement that `This paper was prepared under the assumption that tax cuts are intended in 1989.

<PARA> (b) the 2 opportunities given to the Minister for Local Government (Senator Reynolds) to defend her Government's economic policy against those who believe in a higher spending/higher taxing program-oriented approach;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the Minister's failure to appreciate that such a question asks not for a comment simply on tax matters as they relate to women but for an outline of why the Government's economic policy is or is not heading in the right direction; in other words to defend the parameters set by the Government rather than to enter into the debate itself;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) in light of this, the Minister's evasive tactic of indicating she did not want to pre-empt the tax conference was spurious to say the least; and</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have read the article-few could have missed it-on the front page of today's Australian, headed `Wheat strikes at the heart of Coalition unity'. It would seem from all the reports that that is an accurate description of what is occurring in the Opposition ranks. I understand that the coalition has set up a wheat peace group and that Senator David Brownhill is a member of that committee. I have a high regard for Senator Brownhill's competence and ability, but I must say that even someone as competent and able as he may not be able to bring about a solution in a matter as fundamental to National Party politics in this country as this division in the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been asked by Senator Jones what effects the impasse in the coalition will have on Government policy in regard to the wheat industry. The Government has decided on a package of measures to apply to wheat marketing from 30 June this year. Legislation putting the Government's proposals into effect is currently being prepared for introduction and passage in the current parliamentary sittings. The Government is determined to proceed with its plans for the wheat industry. The fact that the coalition cannot make up its mind on a wheat marketing policy will have no effect on the Government's wheat marketing package.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal with that interjection, which is not a point of order-and Senator Chaney knew it not to be a point of order when he rose to address you, Mr President-when I conclude my answer. The sooner the wheat legislation is in place, the sooner the industry and the Australian Wheat Board can get on with the important job of planning and establishing operations reflecting its wider responsibilities and powers under the new charter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The press article today fails to point out that there is a substantial body of support within the wheat industry for deregulation of the domestic market, which after all accounts for only around 15 per cent of the crop. The Australian Wheat Board will continue to have control over the bulk of the crop, which goes to overseas customers. In this context it is an absolute nonsense to say, as the Grains Council of Australia does, that the Australian Wheat Board will no longer control price, and that prices will collapse. The fact is that some 80 per cent of our milling and industrial wheat is exported and, under the Government's plan, the Australian Wheat Board will be the sole exporter. As well, the Australian Wheat Board will be a strong operator in the domestic market and will have the necessary powers and government borrowing guarantees to compete for cash. The Government is concerned with the efficiency and effectiveness of the marketing process itself, and this is the key objective of the Government's package of measures for the wheat industry.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jones also asked me what were the levels of Federal Government concern about a possible loss of confidence amongst Australian growers, exporters and overseas consumers of wheat. Those engaged in marketing and purchasing Australian wheat need have no concerns. We will continue to supply wheat of a high and consistent quality.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does the honourable senator dispute that? We will continue to supply wheat of a high and consistent quality and we will do this cheaply and efficiently through the Australian Wheat Board. The Government is concerned to maintain a strong and viable wheat industry in Australia. The package of measures agreed to by the Government recognises that, by world standards, Australia's wheat industry is efficient and responsive but that there is potential for further benefits to be achieved from increased competition within Australia. A major objective is to strengthen the effectiveness of the Australian Wheat Board as a marketer and trader and to move it progressively away from government control to full industry accountability and control.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government will continue to support the industry during its transitional period by the provision of borrowing guarantees for advance payments and the establishment of an industry fund. The Government has also undertaken to guarantee borrowings of up to $100m for the purposes of the industry fund. The new arrangements will provide more flexibility and choice to growers to achieve cost savings in marketing and the moving and handling of their wheat. Freeing the domestic market will bring competitive pressures to the storage, handling and transport sector where potential exists for significant savings. I believe that fully answers the questions by Senator Jones.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very difficult to please everyone in this business. It is the case that, from time to time, there are differences of view as between agencies and departments on whether particular visas should be issued for people coming in and differences of view about the time that is necessary to scrutinise the circumstances of the particular diplomatic applicant for a visa. The standard time, as I understand it, has been of the order of 28 or 30 days. I will need to check that point of detail and also the point of detail about the period for which this particular procedure, if it could be so described, has been in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One has to make a judgment; weigh and balance on the one hand the desire, no doubt, of security agencies to have an almost open- ended time in which to pursue investigations of this kind, compared with, on the other hand, the need for efficient and effective governmental relationships and not to delay unduly diplomatic visa applicants any more than anybody else's visa application. So it is a matter of judgment, of balance, with some variation of approach in particular circumstances as I said in answer to a question the other day.

Has the Minister's attention been drawn to an environment article in today's Sydney Morning Herald by Greg Roberts?

Can the Minister inform the Senate of the accuracy of these claims?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="531" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="ARTS, SPORT, THE ENVIRONMENT, TOURISM AND TERRITORIES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My attention has been drawn to the article which appeared this morning. Dr Larkum has been investigating for some time the effects of sewage in the Barrier Reef. However, the article is completely wrong when it suggests that an area near Heron Island has been badly damaged by sewage. I think Dr Larkum has been basing some of his experiments at Heron Island on controlled conditions. When contacted this morning by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority he was able to give it an assurance, which I can give to the Senate, that no area near Heron Island has been affected in the way claimed in the article.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As for the rest of the article and its tenor, I would have to concede that there has always been concern, and always will be concern, about sewage on the Great Barrier Reef and the effect of nutrients on coral. Obviously that is an area that will require much more research. I do not think that there is anyone in the world who can say definitely what all the effects are or what the effects of particular amounts of nutrient might be. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority spends about a quarter of its research budget on researching the effects of nutrients on corals. Most of that research is conducted in areas where there is the largest amount of tourist traffic-that is, the strip between Townsville and Cairns, areas such as Magnetic Island. I think that most of the rest of the money would be spent in the Whitsundays. The concentration has been in those areas.</PARA>
<PARA> All tourist developments require a permit to discharge into the marine park. Applications are assessed very carefully. Just for once I will not be critical of the Queensland Government, because its Water Quality Council standards are high and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority ensures that they are met. Floating structures, such as the hotels which have had so much publicity in recent times and pontoons, are required to hold sewage in their tanks and to transport it away from the reefs before it is discharged into the ocean. Island resorts are required to meet a minimum of secondary processing standards and developers are required to fund the environmental monitoring of the effects of any discharge of effluent. Some island resorts are in the process of upgrading their sewage treatment plants and the Authority is looking at that carefully. Guidelines have been drafted by the Authority on the basis of the latest research, and standards for the discharge of effluent will be tightened even further if research, such as the kind being conducted by Dr Larkum, suggests that that is the appropriate way to go.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs stated at Question Time last Friday that the Government's $240 administration charge for migrant appeals against assigned status was subject to `uncertainty created by differing legal views', I ask the Minister whether the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Attorney-General both take the view that a legislative basis is needed for the $240 fee. On whose advice did the Minister decide to continue to levy the fee without legislation? How many appellants have paid the fee since September 1987, and what total sum has been received from them?

In respect of the test case brought in Victoria in March 1988 to challenge the legality of the $240 fee, I ask: Why was a decision made not to allow the case to run as a test case with both parties bearing their own costs: why was the issue of the costs of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs in that action not raised until the Commonwealth Ombudsman's investigations were all but completed; was the decision to pursue the Department's costs of $4,475 in November 1988 an attempt to discourage the complainant from seeking the Ombudsman's assistance; does the Minister intend to pursue the demand for $4,475 in costs in spite of his concession regarding the merit of the aborted test case; and on what basis was the decision made not to fight the second test cast brought in New South Wales and conceded by the Minister on 15 December 1988?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Early on the Department obtained the views of both senior and junior counsel in the case before the Federal Court challenge to the legality of the fee referred to by the honourable senator. The counsel were Mr Black, QC, and Mr Bell. It was this advice that was relied upon to continue to collect the fee administratively. Subsequently further advice was sought which introduced an element of doubt. I sought the advice of the Attorney-General on 24 October 1988 and received it on 12 December 1988. That advice had changed over the course of 12 months. The Attorney advised that the matter was now not entirely free from doubt and it was his view that it was the better course to put the matter beyond doubt by legislating for the fee. The Government is committed to this course as a result of the inquiry of the Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies, and the legislation implementing the Government's decision will be introduced in this session. As I said in the Senate on 3 March, the Ombudsman's report provided an impetus to act now to cease Independent Review Panel (IRP) arrangements, to introduce regulations as an interim measure and to provide a second application regime.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the second part of the honourable senator's question, between September 1987 and February 1989 inclusive approximately 11,400 appellants had paid around $2.7m. In answer to question No. 3, there are no plans to refund the money collected as fees for the review by the IRP. As I have previously said, I do not think the collection of the fee for administrative review has been unreasonable. In answer to question No. 4, which is a five-part question, regarding the litigation in Victoria in March 1988, referred to by Senator Jenkins, to challenge the legality of the fee, the reason that the case did not run its full course was that the applicant withdrew. It would be improper for the Commonwealth, if litigation were entered against a Commonwealth action, to agree that each party bear its own costs. Where litigants are successful in the court, it is usual for the cost to be awarded in their favour. Likewise, where someone commences litigation and withdraws, it is usual that they bear defending party costs. It is not the case that the issue of the Department's costs was not raised until the Ombudsman's investigations were all but completed. The Department, in March 1988, made its position on costs clear, namely, that the appellant would be responsible for the costs awarded against her. There has been no deviation from this position.</PARA>
<PARA> In answer to part (c) of the fourth question, the decision taken in November 1988 to maintain the earlier decision to pursue costs was made in light of the usual policy that Commonwealth revenues be protected. Nothing was done to discourage anybody seeking the Ombudsman's assistance-either a litigant or any other person. It could be said that the Department's maintaining its pursuit of costs was a catalyst leading to the Ombudsman's involvement in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA> In answer to part (d) of the fourth question, regarding the matter of continuing to pursue costs, if the unsuccessful litigant wishes to raise a question of significant hardship or any other matter relating to paying costs, I will consider that submission. In answer to part (e) of the fourth question, in December 1988 litigation was commenced in an unrelated case in New South Wales. That case challenged the interpretation and application of change of status policy and also challenged the imposition of the $240 fee. On the basis of counsel's advice, my Department considered the primary decision defective on the basis of an interpretation and application of change of status policy and, accordingly, the decision was vacated and the litigation discontinued.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I personally believe that it is necessary to have some charge for review on a user-pays principle. Without that, especially in the immigration area, there will be many frivolous appeals. Certainly in the new proposed model, a fee will be included in the legislation. The people who have generally been stirring in this area have one common feature, that is, they are lawyers. Lawyers always believe that one should never charge a fee for anything except for their own services. They also seem to believe that the immigration area is the new growth area. Most lawyers have now been excluded from workers' compensation. They are now looking for a new area to leech onto, and the most vulnerable area they have found is the area of defenceless migrants.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories inform the Senate of the extent to which the buffalo eradication program in Kakadu National Park utilises commercial operators to remove buffalo from the park, rather than carrying out wholesale shooting? Can the Minister advise the Senate as to the environmental impact of the buffalo control measures in Kakadu National Park?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="533" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="ARTS, SPORT, THE ENVIRONMENT, TOURISM AND TERRITORIES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Collins would be aware, the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service has been implementing a program of buffalo eradication in Kakadu since 1979. That program was required for two reasons: firstly, the bovine brucellosis and tuberculosis campaign and, secondly, the environmental damage that the buffalo were causing. I do not think anyone would dispute that the damage they were causing to Kakadu was extensive indeed. We have achieved considerable success on stages 1 and 2 of Kakadu. Already it is generally acknowledged that that has led to a spectacular recovery in vegetation in those areas. Soil erosion, which has been an enormous problem in respect of buffalo in Kakadu, is also now less of a problem than it was. Obviously, we have had a preference for not allowing the wholesale shooting of the animals. Consequently, they have been rounded up, herded and taken away, largely for domestication and meat supply purposes. That is a policy which we have preferred and which will continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In stage 3, which comprises the former pastoral leases of Gimbat and Goodparla, that has also been the basis for the removal of buffalo. These are areas for which Senator Evans has expressed particular affection in recent years. In 1988 some 6,000 animals were removed from Gimbat by the successful tenderer. Counts of the remaining buffalo by officers from the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service have indicated that sufficient numbers remain for a further commercial take and tenders will shortly be called for the coming season. On Goodparla the former leaseholders continued to remove stock under an agreement with the Commonwealth until 31 December 1988. More than 12,000 animals were taken to domestication programs or abattoirs. Arrangements for a further stock removal at Goodparla are currently being considered.</PARA>
<PARA> Again, in Gimbat and Goodparla there has been a remarkable recovery of the vegetation in what is a fairly dry area of the park. As with stages 1 and 2, priority has been given in stage 3 to the commercial utilisation of buffalo rather than shooting. Returns to the Commonwealth so far in the current financial year show that the buffalo contracts in Kakadu amount to $316,000 and that for the Northern Land Council buffalo control costs amount to a further $65,000. The management plan foreshadowed the establishment of a controlled population of buffalo within a specific area. Having in mind the need of the traditional owners to have some source of meat, to maintain within the park some illustration of its history and to maintain an obvious attraction to tourists, negotiations with the Kakadu Association are well under way and I hope that we will be able to stock a suitable area and fence it off very shortly.</PARA>

I refer to a previous question which I put to the Minister on 1 December last year regarding the financial instability of McLean Consolidated Pty Ltd, to which he proceeded to issue an export woodchip licence a few weeks later. First, is the Minister aware that the Western Australian Government seized the timber stock of McLean Consolidated on 14 February 1989 because the company is months behind in royalty payments, and that another company, Whittakers Ltd, has negotiated a purchase price of $1.5m for McLean's Denmark mill and the 60,000 tonne per year woodchip export licence? Secondly, does the Minister agree that the financial collapse of McLean Consolidated Pty Ltd and its subsequent takeover by Whittakers comprise a change in the terms of the proposal and are deserving of full public disclosure of economic and environmental implications? Thirdly, will the Minister stand by the commitment given at a meeting with conservation groups on 22 November 1988 and tabled by him in the Senate on 15 December in which he `indicated that if there were to be any change in the proposal it would be subject to the appropriate environmental analysis.'? Fourthly, in relation to the sale of McLean Consolidated, could the Minister clarify the position of Gersor Pty Limited, who are 50 per cent joint partners of the McLean export woodchip licence? Finally, if not, is the Minister aware that Gersor Pty Limited is a shelf company with an issue of two shares valued at one dollar each?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps I should ignore the interjections and answer the question. Neither of the interjections is particularly helpful, nor do they illuminate the matter in any way. Senator Vallentine asks me whether I am aware that the Western Australian Government has seized the timber stock of McLeans. Yes, I am. The reason it has done so, I understand, is that McLeans was significantly behind in the payment of royalties to the Western Australian Government. The Western Australian Government then seized the timber stock to secure the payment of the royalties, but reached an arrangement with the company and timber has been released from that stock and the company is trading otherwise normally, the Western Australian Government having secured protection for royalty cover if the company were in some form later to default. So I am aware of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next question was whether I agreed that the financial collapse of McLean and the takeover comprise a change in the proposal. I do not think that they change the proposal so far as I would define `proposal' in the normal sense of the usage of that word in the context of woodchip export licences. The proposal in a woodchip export licence context is a proposal to export a given amount of woodchips from a particular source for a specified price over a given period. The ownership change of a company does not alter where the source of the woodchips is, whether it is environmentally sound, what the price relationship of that export is, and over what period the new owner might export. Therefore, it seems to me that the proposal as used in this context is not being changed in a way in which it would require a further environmental assessment.</PARA>
<PARA> That goes to the next question Senator Vallentine asked, as to whether I would honour my undertaking. Of course I would honour my undertaking. I always honour my undertakings, but the undertaking as Senator Vallentine has expressed it is not consistent with the undertaking I gave at the time in the meeting with the environmentalists to which she referred. I also understand that on 27 February Whittakers made a takeover bid for McLeans but that bid is stalled at the moment as to whether or not it should be referred to the shareholders for decision. If it were to be stopped, there is then a hiatus and other bidders can come into the market. But there is the prospect or possibility of a management buy-out; there is the prospect or possibility of the Coalition for Denmark's Environment, an environmental group, buying the mill. There is a complication in that someone by the name of Mr Traher is claiming some ownership, which complicates the whole matter. At this stage I cannot be absolutely sure what the future ownership of that mill facility will be, but if the conditions that I have set for the export licence are adhered to there is no reason why the export licence should not be given. I make this point particularly strongly. The export licence is to export sawmill residue, that is, the material left over after sawmilling has been conducted. The alternative to reducing that residue to woodchips and exporting it would be simply to burn it. As there is always sawmill residue after a sawmilling operation, it would seem sensible for the mill facility to avail itself of a commercial woodchip market, if such is available, rather than burn it, thus adding to the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Finally, I was asked about the role of Gersor Pty Ltd. I am aware of the company's role in the McLean takeover.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should put it that way, yes. I was asked whether the Taxation Office has mailed out tax file numbers to people who are dead. I do not know for sure, but I think it highly likely. When somebody dies, it is not the custom for the next of kin immediately to notify the Taxation Office of the death. Indeed, it might be sometime afterwards before the Taxation Office becomes aware of the death of a taxpayer who, because he was a taxpayer, had a tax file number. It also often takes considerable time for the Tax Office to discover whether a taxpayer has changed address. I am advised that it is correct that the Tax Office has mailed to taxpayers advice of their current tax file number. The purpose is to remind them that they can complete their new tax instalment declaration on 1 April, as is required and, indeed, is in their interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am also told, as I suggested earlier, that in some cases, advices have been sent to wrong addresses in Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory because taxpayers have changed addresses without advising the Tax Office. The Tax Office computers are not and never can be completely up to date. It is not realistic to expect that they would be. The Tax Office regrets any distress that such errors might have caused, and when it became aware of the problem it ceased mailing tax file number advices. It now advises that it intends to mail advices only to those taxpayers who lodged a tax return in 1988. However, that will not entirely rule out the possibility of correspondence being sent to people who have moved. Therefore, it may still be sent to obsolete addresses. Advices may also still be sent to those who have died. Inevitably, commonsense and logic would suggest that this is not the first time the Tax Office has sent correspondence to people who are deceased, because it is in correspondence with most taxpayers at least once a year, frequently more often. The statistical probability is such that there must have been previous occasions on which the Tax Office mailed assessment or advice of some sort to people who were deceased. This, however, is the first occasion on which I can remember anybody kicking up a fuss about it. The reason for that is that the Liberal Party is following Peter Sawyer, the League of Rights and the other ratbags in a campaign designed to undermine the efficiency of this tax enforcement mechanism.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Consumer Affairs. Has the Minister seen advertisements in national newspapers for various `Lotto schemes' guaranteeing wins by those who subscribe to those systems? Would the Minister advise honourable senators whether it is worth while investing in such schemes to supplement their incomes? If not, can it be assumed that action is being taken to protect consumers from losing their savings on such lottery systems? When can we expect an end to the advertising of such schemes?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="537" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The short answer to one part of Senator Maguire's question is that, even on his income, he should stay away from such schemes. The matter raised by the honourable senator has been the subject of numerous complaints over recent days, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales. The advertisements for `get rich quick' lotto schemes are non-scientific. They are certainly not a new approach to ripping off gullible consumers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The scheme which Senator Maguire refers to purports to offer guaranteed winnings on the basis of scientifically-based and mathematically-assessed probabilities with the use of high technology computer equipment and techniques. The schemes are being promoted in full page advertisements in which people are being told that they can win and win consistently. After making contact with a return coupon, people are requested to provide further large amounts of money for a full system, in order to be in a position to make these massive winnings. Basically, the information which is provided in exchange for this money is also set out in booklets which can be bought very cheaply in many major retail outlets. The schemes in question are neither new nor scientific. They are merely a variation of existing pyramid schemes or games.</PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of the fact that there has been a prevalence of these sorts of promotions, the Trade Practices Commission, together with State consumer protection agencies, has been pursuing this matter. The schemes in question probably contravene three or four provisions of the Trade Practices Act and also some State consumer legislation. Accordingly, a number of proceedings have been instituted by State agencies to chase up the promoters of such schemes. Major difficulties are involved in the successful location and prosecution of the promoters of these schemes. This is because of the large number and great variety of schemes involved. Also, promoters change both their business names and their locations as often as possible.</PARA>
<PARA> In order to be more successful in our approach in this area, we are also conducting, through the Trade Practices Commission, a publicity campaign which is very much geared towards protecting, advising and warning consumers about this sort of approach. The campaign being run by the Trade Practices Commission is very much in line with other campaigns that we have run, such as the campaign to warn small businesses against bogus telex directory advertising.</PARA>
<PARA> So the matter that Senator Maguire raises is of concern to us. In order that we can offer adequate and effective protection to consumers, we are pursuing this matter not only on a cooperative basis with the States but also on our level with a keenly tuned publicity campaign, as well as an intention on the part of the Trade Practices Commission to prosecute wherever we can.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Justice and also concerns alleged abuse or maladministration of the tax file number system and unauthorised access to confidential information. I have referred the Minister to a report in Saturday's West Australian newspaper in which a former insurance investigator alleges that police and Australian Taxation Office officials illegally provided confidential information and that in some cases bribery is involved. The Minister would be aware that the newspaper reported that it tested the informant's credentials by asking him to obtain, and receiving from him, a journalist's tax file number, details of Department of Social Security transactions concerning another person and the silent telephone number and address of a person from a source in Telecom Australia. I ask the Minister: Have the Australian Federal Police (AFP) investigated these claims? What action is the Government taking to prevent these gross abuses of personal privacy and to punish those who would appear to have broken Federal laws?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="538" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the article in the West Australian of 4 March headed `Major corruption in PS: Informer'. Indeed, it does make the sorts of claims which were outlined by Senator Chaney. I think this whole chamber would be extremely concerned to ensure that allegations of corruption of such seriousness are pursued with vigour and expertise. Indeed, as I will indicate in a moment, that is the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In general I think it is important to say on behalf of the Government, and no doubt on behalf of the chamber which, during the passage of the tax file number legislation undertook concurrent privacy legislation, that any action of such an illegal kind, if it is proved to have occurred, must be condemned by the whole community not only because of the particular instance concerned but also because of the impact it has on the general public's perception of fairness and honesty in the dealings of public servants with very confidential information.</PARA>
<PARA> It was only this morning that I received a brief from the Deputy Commissioner, Operations, of the Australian Federal Police on this particular matter. Without detailing all parts, it is to the effect that on 3 March 1989 an informant, whom I will not name-an ex-investigator in Perth-approached the West Australian newspaper with information concerning allegations of corruption in the Perth Taxation Office and the Western Australian Police Department. On the same day he detailed his allegations to an AFP officer in the western region and made a number of allegations, which I will not outline.</PARA>
<PARA> The head of the Western Australia Police anti-corruption squad was briefed on the allegations, a joint operation was established and search warrants were executed on the premises of the former employer of the informant. A large quantity of documents and computer equipment was seized and evidence obtained, including tax microfiche. It is said that further documentary evidence is being looked at and the informant is continuing to assist police in their inquiries. In the last couple of minutes only I have been informed that a serving police officer in the Western Australian force has been charged and further developments may be expected in the very near future. So the investigation under way-as I say, a joint operation between the AFP and the Western Australia Police anti-corruption squad-is being undertaken with full devotion of necessary resources.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the particular allegations, obviously we need to wait to see whether they prove to be substantiated. But I understand the concern of Senator Chaney and indeed of all honourable senators that tax file number information in particular be protected. That is why this Parliament not only inserted very severe penalties in the tax file number legislation to deal with the unlawful disclosure of tax file number information, but also set up machinery in order to ensure that as far as is possible administrative safeguards are in place and management can be alerted to those situations which might develop where an official could be tempted and corrupted in the way that is suggested by these allegations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the attention of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories to a report in today's Hobart Mercury which has as its headline `Noranda threatens to quit'. I ask the Minister whether he can clarify for the Senate whether the original guidelines for the establishment of the Wesley Vale pulp mill have been changed, given that the Tasmanian Government is insisting that no changes have occurred while in the article I have referred to Mr Zimmerman, the Chief Executive Officer of Noranda Forest Inc., clearly states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . changes to the guidelines negotiated by the companies-Noranda and North Broken Hill . . . provided a `workable formula' to allow the mill to go ahead.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Noranda certainly believes that, from its point of view, these are changes for the better. I think Mr Zimmerman ought to be congratulated for at least coming out and, to some extent, dampening down this sham that some representatives of the company in Tasmania and the Tasmanian Government have been perpetrating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Obviously the Government, in examining its decision on the mill in the next couple of weeks, has a predisposition towards supporting downstream processing and, hence, pulp mills. Obviously it must assess what environmental price we have to pay. In doing that and in looking at the guidelines which have been changed it is not very difficult to list changes. I want to refer to an article by Andrew Fisher in the Sunday Tasmanian dated 26 February, which is not an Australian Labor Party rag. He went through just some of the changes. Remember that the Tasmanian Government said that there had been no changes. Whilst Senator Puplick has said that I had better tell everybody that Peter Rae said there had been changes for the better, he said that after he had been prodded by his leader. Nonetheless, Mr Hodgman said that there had been no changes at all, and repeated that many times in a debate we had on Saturday.</PARA>
<PARA> As soon as we pick up the original guidelines we see that they state that Bass Strait had to be protected at all times. That has now been changed to `or after 12 months'. So, for 12 months, the company has a free rein to do anything it likes. The company had originally to use what was called `the best available control technology'. That has now been changed to `commercially proven and widely accepted technology'-a second change. Under the original guidelines, the mill was not to affect the receiving waters of Bass Strait. That now reads `receiving waters outside the mixing zone'-a third change.</PARA>
<PARA> Instead of implementing chlorine dioxide substitution to at least 40 per cent, the company must now simply have the plant capacity to do that. The company is not even being made to do so as it was under the original guidelines-another change. Under the original guidelines, if there was a pollution leak the company had to take immediate action. That now reads `as soon as practicable'-another change. If the pollution controls broke down for more than 30 minutes, the plant had to close. Under the new guidelines, it can continue running for a full day. There was to be no accumulation-that is pretty definite-of effluent on the sea bed. That now reads that `there should be no build-up that would cause material detriment'. The big change is the one concerning dioxin because from there being no detectable changes in background levels it is now defined as `no material detriment to the environment'. Background levels one can only define, as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation scientist, Dr Hallegraft, said last week, as the quality of the water before the mill starts. Material detriment according to the Oxford Dictionary is `significant or important harm or damage'.</PARA>
<PARA> So, yes, there have been changes, not just some but many. There has been change after change. For Mr Hodgman to try to maintain that there is no change should not be a surprise. He said he would resign if there were changes. Obviously the job is more important to Mr Hodgman than the principle. So, he will stay, change or no change. Fortunately because of the Gray Government's handling, whether the mill goes ahead, that Government cannot survive and it will not stay.</PARA>

I refer to a report in last Wednesday's Australian that the Minister's Department is proposing that universities will have to abandon the principle of appointment on merit but will need to prove that they have been unable to find a `suitable Australian candidate to fill the position before an overseas appointee will be granted residency'.

Why is it that our universities should no longer be able to appoint the best applicant on the ground of excellence?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not particularly changed my views on the question of tenure for academics. As Senator Teague will know, I had some doubts about tenure but I had more doubts about the witch-hunt that may follow if it was done away with. Nevertheless, one must recognise that academia has passed Senator Teague and me by. For the most part, wherever possible, they are going for fixed appointments. Therefore, if academics are only going for fixed appointments, some of the past immigration practices in this regard may no longer be relevant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The main objective of my Department's proposals is to extend the existing special provisions for senior academics to fixed term appointments of at least three years. This reflects the growing emphasis on non-permanent appointments to achieve staffing flexibility in the period of significant reallocation of resources. The current special provisions apply only to permanent appointees. Fixed term appointees are considered under temporary resident requirements. On the advice of the Department of Employment, Education and Training, lecturers would no longer be included in the special provisions but would be subject to the normal employer nomination provisions. That reflects the need to give Australian graduates the opportunity to compete for entry level positions-that is, tutors and lecturers-without excluding overseas appointees when no local applicant is suitable.</PARA>
<PARA> By focusing solely on the problems with definitions of senior academics, I think that our position has been slightly misrepresented. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and the Australian Committee of Directors and Principals have undertaken to provide data on the number of overseas appointments at lecturer level to enable further consideration at this point of contention. In other words, the position is not final; we have put forward the general proposition. I have not really changed my mind on tenure. It is one of the methods by which proper academic excellence is protected. Also we had to recognise back in 1982 that there were problems in terms of flexibility. These days those problems are more intense than they were seven years ago. On the advice of another department, we have to react more flexibly. I do not see this move as particularly disadvantaging people overseas. The employer nomination scheme is basically the way. People are targeted to specific jobs from any other occupation. I do not know that academics are so special as to require a special category.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The annual report of the National Museum of Australia opens on a very disappointing note from the point of view of people who are genuinely interested in museums in Australia and in the development of great cultural institutions in the Australian Capital Territory. It opens with these words:</PARA>
<PARA>For the second year in succession the National Museum of Australia was very much `on hold' in 1987-88. For some 22 months it has awaited a decision by Government on the future of the project following the review of the Commonwealth involvement in the development of museums and other collecting and exhibiting institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, this very significant national institution has once again been told that it must mark time, that it must wait. It has to mark time in a way which will allow the Government eventually to sort out its policies on museums and collecting institutions. What the Government has to sort out is the demand by the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, and the Department of Finance, to kill off the National Museum of Australia. Senator McMullan, who undoubtedly will want to participate in this debate, has been one of those who have attempted to have two bob each way on this matter, by going off to meetings of museums associations here in Canberra and telling them how hard he is going to fight to get the Government to overturn its decisions about the National Museum and how much he is going to put pressure on the Minister for Finance to ensure that this important institution is funded and is proceeded with. But there is no evidence of Senator McMullan's success in this matter or, indeed, the success of anybody in the Australian Labor Party in persuading the Department of Finance to change its philistine attitude towards the major museums and collecting institutions in the Australian Capital Territory or anywhere throughout Australia. As a result, the Museum, in its report, had to record as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>As mentioned previously in this report, there were no funds appropriated to purchase new acquisitions during the year. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Museum has to rely exclusively upon donations in order to improve its collection. One of the consequences of this is referred to in the report and you, Madam Acting Deputy President, would undoubtedly be interested in this. Page 17 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> In 1984, a substantial and very important collection of Australian women's needlework samples was destroyed by fire before it could be acquired by the National Museum and brought to Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there is clear evidence that parts of our cultural heritage are being lost. They are being lost because of the Government's deliberate policy of attempting to starve to death the National Museum of Australia. That is what Senator Walsh and the Department of Finance are attempting to do at the moment. The review of museums and collecting institutions has been going on and on, interminably. We have asked questions at Estimates committee meetings. We have been told that reports, comments, papers, minutes and suggestions are going up to Ministers. We have still seen absolutely nothing. In the meantime, this important institution has to report that it has no funds for acquisition, that parts of the cultural heritage of this country are being lost because the Museum does not have the capacity to purchase them or to make arrangements for them. As I said, Madam Acting Deputy President, you undoubtedly would be scandalised at the loss of the collection of women's domestic needlework which was destroyed by fire because the Museum was not in a position to safeguard it. We see in the Museum's report that it has to operate with a conservation department of only two persons when it should have a great deal more. I take this opportunity to reiterate the words that are in the coalition's policy on the arts under the heading `Museum of Australia':</PARA>
<PARA> The Coalition Parties are committed to the Museum of Australia and wish to see it built and grow to be a pre-eminent national collecting institution and significant tourist attraction for the ACT. We will give a clear financial commitment to the Museum for the next five year period, redefine its future building programme and require it to stress its particular role in relation to the preservation of our Aboriginal cultural heritage. </PARA>
<PARA>It is an absolute scandal that the Australian Government is not prepared to join in making that sort of commitment to the National Museum of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall not be deterred from my support for the National Museum of Australia, however hard Senator Puplick tries and however pathetic his attempts might be. But I have to express some concern about the circumstances developing around the National Museum of Australia. I understand, as does everybody who is half-way literate in economics, the extraordinary constraints on public sector finances. The Opposition is saying that the most important thing we can do with regard to economic policy is to cut public sector expenditure. That may or may not be a good policy, depending upon one's philosophical predisposition, but it does not lend itself with great enthusiasm to significant enhancement of this general area of collections by national galleries and collecting institutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not appropriate to look at the National Museum in isolation. It must be looked at in the context of its significant relationship to the National Library of Australia, the Australian National Gallery, the Australian War Memorial and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies. I welcome the fact that the report makes clear the continuing liaison between the National Museum and those bodies, but I suggest that we need to look at ensuring that there is no duplication in that area. In spite of the understanding that we all must have in this place of the constraints on public sector finances, it is a concern that there have been no funds and there continues to be no funds for acquisitions by the National Museum of Australia. I welcome the fact that donations continue to be received, both of finances and of items of particular interest. I note that, even at that very low and slow rate of acquisition, there are significant catalogue backlogs which cannot be overcome. I look forward to the circumstances when the Government can take initiatives to enable acquisitions to be made to enable the backlog to be adequately catalogued. </PARA>
<PARA> I also note the comment in the report that some important collections in the Aboriginal area have been on the market but have had to be passed up. I guess that, whatever the budget, that will continue to be the case. There is no likelihood of unlimited funds to enable the purchase of everything that comes on offer that we would like to have. But it is indicative of a continuing problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the continuing commitment of the staff. In this difficult period prior to the establishment of the museum in an effective operating sense, Australia is fortunate to have a committed staff who apply themselves professionally. I note in particular on page 13 the reference to the continuing work to further develop systems, procedures and facilities for the management and control of the collection so that when the decision is made to proceed with the National Museum all these related operational programs will be in place. I congratulate the staff on the work they are doing in that and other areas, and the liaison with the other institutions, which I urge them to enhance. I note that material continues to be made available as far as possible through loans to other institutions. During the year there were very notable loans to the Stockman's Hall of Fame, the South Australian Art Gallery, the Queensland Art Gallery, the South Australian Museum and, I am delighted to note, the American-Asian Society of New York. Together, these things mean that the material that people contribute is not wasted but is made available as much as possible. The staff do an excellent job, notwithstanding the continuing constraints on public sector expenditure. I look forward to the opportunity to see the reversal of the decision of the last Budget-of which Senator Puplick is apparently unaware-and a speedier commencement of the National Museum than is currently envisaged. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This report is very brief and very welcome. It is welcome because it indicates that after much time and effort and much delay the protection of our movable cultural heritage has moved one step forward. I well remember that this legislation was rushed through this chamber-we were told we were not allowed to amend it because it was a matter of such enormous urgency that it had to be completed-then waited for the best part of two years for its proclamation. This paper now reports the further development and production of the National Cultural Heritage Control List. This is an important development in Australian cultural policy, because it marks the first attempt systematically to provide a clear indication of what parts or items of Australia's movable cultural heritage can be exported from the country and then reimported, and under what terms and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Movable Cultural Heritage Act was enacted to provide the legislative framework for establishing a system whereby we could have some control on works of art, cultural material and artefacts which might be taken out of the country. The development of that regime rested primarily with Dr Battersby, whom I take this opportunity to congratulate for the extremely fine job that she has done over many years in this field. It was then the responsibility of the Government to promulgate regulations to establish a list of items or categories of items which could or could not be removed from the country. Regulations made in 1987 and statutory rules made in July 1988 have given effect to this. </PARA>
<PARA> In the arts, the new system provides that works of art which exceed a specified market value may require export permits when they are more than 30 years old or when the original artist is no longer living. For example, with photography, which is classified in the regulations as a fine art, a marketable value of $7,000 could make the photographs subject to restrictions, while Australian paintings with values of more than $150,000 could require ministerial permits for export. Major works of art held in Australia but created elsewhere may also be restricted if they have been in this country for 35 years. That is similar to legislation which the British use to protect their own significant private collections, mainly from the predations of American collectors-although these days, I suspect, it is the predations of collectors with pockets stuffed full of yen who are more likely to be a threat to the continuation of those art collections. We know that in places like the United Kingdom and Canada similar legislation has been very important for the control and retention of their cultural heritage. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation also provides a basis on which we can move forward to a formal ratification of the 1970 United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation protocol which deals with this matter, and will allow us to be more closely integrated into international arrangements whereby works of art can be returned to their country of origin. I am not a total fanatic about that. I happen to think that if the Elgin marbles had not been housed in the British Museum they would by now be in the same crumbling state that the rest of the facade of the Parthenon is, and the statues from the Erechtheum, which are hidden away under the Parthenon because they have almost crumbled into nothingness, are some indication that occasionally display in foreign museums may be of some value. Nevertheless, we know that in the Aboriginal communities there is concern about return of cultural material. There are occasional claims that there are even items in our own National Gallery which may or may not have arrived from Peru or elsewhere and which need to be examined within the framework of this piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, I very much welcome the report. I congratulate those who have been responsible for drawing up the various categories of items to be included in the class A schedule, which cannot be exported except with a certificate, and class B objects, which require an export permit or certificate of exemption. I look forward in future years to seeing the way in which this develops. It is a new development in terms of promulgation of these regulations. I believe that this is an important piece of legislation. The Opposition is very happy to support the operations of the legislation, and we look forward to the continued development of this very important initiative. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>I was able to obtain a copy of this report only at 2.40 p.m. today and have had only limited time to examine it. But having given the report a fairly preliminary examination, I consider that it appears to be a very realistic assessment of the position in respect of research and development, with some useful comments about some of the difficulties which need to be cleared away if we are to improve our national performance overall. At the beginning of the report is a letter from the Chairman of the Industry Research and Development Board to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button). In that letter the Chairman notes that the overall level of industry research and development is increasing. He also suggests that the quality and quantity of research and development interaction between public and private sectors are improving. In the same letter the Chairman makes a point which is taken up later in the report. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>In this report the Board highlights some of the factors which stand in the way of maximising the contribution of IR&amp;D to industry efficiency and international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>At page 6 of the report one finds the following:</PARA>
<PARA>Can the results of growing investment in IR&amp;D be turned into economic growth? It seems likely that Australia may not have a sufficiently developed infrastructure to successfully commercialise many of the innovations which will emerge from the IR&amp;D process. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not the only qualification the Board makes. In addition to the concern expressed about a sufficiently developed infrastructure, at page 14 of the report we find these words:</PARA>
<PARA>There is a very real danger that the volume of management skills and venture capital required to bring successful R&amp;D projects to commercial fruition will not be available. It is very clear that an economy in which R&amp;D is increasing, and in which the supply of venture capital is not increasing at the same rate, is heading for a severe bottleneck in its attempts to create wealth from technology. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, one gets a warning on page 22 of the report, on which it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Board views with concern the propensity of some companies or company groups to make repeated use of the Government's grant-based incentives for IR&amp;D, rather than progress to the stage of profitability where they can take advantage of the tax incentive. The Board seems, in some instances, to have become part of the ongoing business of the company or group. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, I refer to page 26 of the report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>Indications are that the incentive has so far had a moderate level of success in boosting R &amp; D performance and in achieving some favourable shifts in management attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA>If Australia is to get out of its present economic difficulties, the problems that are identified by the Board need to be overcome because research and development of itself does not add to the economy. It is simply one of the means by which the economy can improve and move into the latter part of the twentieth century. The report is a sober reminder that the general environment in which commercialisation is seen as profitable and hence can be undertaken simply does not exist in many industries. Practically every member of the Senate would have had people come into his office with an idea which simply cannot be put into operation in Australia. I certainly have met people who in an inventive or research sense are equal to the best in the world or ahead of the rest of the world, but they turn away from Australia to East Asia or North America to capitalise upon the work they have done. That reflects the failure of the Government to come to grips with the labour market, tax and transport difficulties in this country and the other things which lead Australians to despair when they look to the commercialisation of promising research work done in this country. It remains a significant area of failure and one that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce has to address far more vigorously in the future than he has in the past. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate now has before it the Australian Sports Commission Bill 1988. This is a Bill for an Act to establish a new Commonwealth statutory authority, to be called the Australian Sports Commission. Essentially, the Bill will merge the functions and administrations of the Australian Institute of Sport and the Australian Sports Commission, as they are presently constituted. This merger is claimed to be an integral part of the process of streamlining Commonwealth sports administration, to which this Government has apparently dedicated itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commission is going to be permitted to operate under the name of the Australian Institute of Sport when performing certain of its functions. Although occasionally the term Australian Institute of Sport will be used, the Institute will not be a separate body, as is the current situation. It will operate entirely as part of the one statutory authority. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill sets out the objectives, functions and powers of the Commission. Those functions are to be performed, in whole or in part, by the Commission under the name of the Australian Institute of Sport. The Bill also covers a wide range of issues relating to the management and operation of the Commission in much the same way as other statutory authorities are dealt with. Finally, the Bill defines the relationship between the Commission on the one hand, and the Government on the other, within which the Commission will undertake its respective tasks. </PARA>
<PARA> I indicate at the outset that the Opposition does not oppose this piece of legislation. However, I wish to make a number of remarks about sports policy and sports funding in Australia. I will also wander, with some care and trepidation, onto the issue of drugs in sport, without in any way compromising the inquiry currently being conducted by the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts into at least one aspect of this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Institute of Sport had its genesis in the period of the Fraser Administration. Mr Ellicott, the then Minister for Home Affairs and a very keen supporter of the establishment of the Institute, stressed that an emphasis should be given to both the encouragement and promotion of particularly talented sportsmen and women, who are sometimes referred to as the elite. He also sought to establish a body which would eventually decentralise its operations, thereby providing a greater degree of access to its programs, particularly its coaching programs, throughout the whole of Australia. Indeed, the Institute's decentralisation program has been one of the most valuable attributes of the development of sports policy in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, a couple of things need to be said about sports policy, and particularly about sports funding. First, this Bill has been with us for what appears to be an inordinately long period. I think the Bill has now been in the Parliament for nearly 19 to 20 months since it was introduced into the House of Representatives. It has certainly been around for a long time. It is very disappointing that the advantages that are claimed to flow from this initiative have been delayed for so long. It is also fair to say that some claims made by the Government, in terms of its expenditure in sport, do not altogether bear the closest of examination. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer honourable senators to the fact that some time ago the then Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism, Mr Brown, gave a commitment, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, that funding for sport would be maintained in real terms in the 1987-88 Budget and in the subsequent Budget of 1988-89. In real terms, however, funding for sport has been squeezed. It has been kept at unreasonably low levels in a number of areas. For example, if one looks at page 202 of the 1988-89 Budget Statements, under the heading `Assistance to Sport' one sees that $30.3m was provided for assistance to sport in 1986-87; in 1987-88 $29.6m was provided; and in 1988-89 $27.1m was provided. Compared with last year's Budget, this constitutes a decline in total assistance of $2.4m or 8.3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson, the current Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, says that there really has not been a decline in the level of funding for sport. He argues that one has to rope into this calculation an extra $6.32m, which will be spent on programs which he describes in a press release as `programs promoting healthier lifestyles, a wider community participation in sport, water safety, and a recreation assistance scheme for people with disabilities'. Although the Opposition does not have the slightest objection to the provision of assistance for any of these programs, I think some of the programs aimed at `promoting healthier lifestyles' are not exactly returning value for the Commonwealth dollar. Nevertheless, the claim which I believe most people in the sporting community were led to believe, that there would be a maintenance of expenditure on sports activities, has not been honoured by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> An article in the Sun-Herald of 4 September 1988-just after last year's Budget was brought down-describes the President of the Confederation of Australian Sport, Mr Jim Barry, as being `bitterly disappointed' with the outcome of the Federal Budget. He had reason to be bitterly disappointed, because the claim that the Government was going to maintain its expenditure on sport in real terms, as distinct from maintaining its expenditure within the sport and recreation portfolio area, has not been lived up to by this Government in the way in which people were encouraged to believe it would be. </PARA>
<PARA> Although this nation makes enormous claims about sport and undoubtedly we are supposed to feel honoured to have one of the world's great sporting heroes as our Prime Minister-one defines a sportsman these days by the simple definition that he is the person standing next to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the photograph-the actual level of per capita expenditure in this country in terms of money spent in support of sporting activities is not high by international standards. For example, the amount of money spent per head of population in the United States of America, even excluding college, sports and corporate sponsorship, is $7.43. In West Germany, the figure is $6.77; in Italy, $4.64; in France, $6.48; in the Netherlands, $4.84; and in Canada, $3.12. In Switzerland, perhaps not known as one of the world's greatest sporting nations other than in certain winter sports, the figure is $13.84. I have deliberately not included any of the unreal comparisons with Eastern Europe. But if we put those figures against the figure in Australia of $2 per head we can see a reasonably comparative figure. I believe that money spent in support of sport is money well spent because it is not only spent in terms of activities which I think make a contribution to the health and well being of the nation--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh yes; my figures always take into account other factors of that sort. They are perfectly accurate figures and perfectly valid comparisons of money spent. For example, the United States, West Germany, Canada and Switzerland-countries which I have mentioned-are all federal states and the comparison is perfectly accurate in that regard. I am most grateful to the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) for the opportunity to make that point with even greater force. The point I was going on to make was that the money spent on sport is well spent, not only in terms of its contribution to lifestyle and indeed to healthier living, but also in terms of the enjoyment of individuals, the building of a sense of community, and the support of and assistance to voluntary organisations, which I think is in itself important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There have been a number of instances in which one could be very critical of some of the operations of sporting bodies in this country, but I do not want to carp about those on this occasion. There is only one to which I wish to draw attention-I am sure that Senator Tate will be particularly interested in this-and that is the scandalous mucking around with the establishment of cycling facilities in Australia. We have had a world class velodrome available for the promotion of cycling, training and the practice requirements for Australian cyclists located in Launceston. That world class velodrome should have been the primary focus for cycling activity in Australia. It has not been. The reason for that-Senator Crowley, who will follow me shortly in this debate, undoubtedly will be interested in a different aspect of this from Senator Tate's interest-is that prior to the last South Australian State election an electoral bait was drawn across the trail promising that a cycling facility was to be established in Adelaide. That promise was made some two years ago by the South Australian State Government. It has just been reannounced for the third, fourth and fifth time that money is going to be spent in South Australia to duplicate a facility which exists in Launceston and which has not been properly used in Launceston because of an electoral commitment given between the Commonwealth and the State Labor parties in South Australia to have a facility built in Adelaide. Frankly, this sort of political decision made within the sporting community and within sports policy I think is most unfortunate and not conducive to the proper development of sports facilities and sports planning in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In October 1988 the Liberal and National parties released their sports policy. It is important that I put on record exactly what our policy is in relation to the Australian Sports Commission and the Australian Institute of Sport so that people are aware of the incoming government's policy in this area. Under the heading `Australian Institute of Sport', the policy states:</PARA>
<PARA> A Liberal/National Party Government will support the amalgamation of the Australian Institute of Sport with the Australian Sports Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the purpose of the Bill before us today. I continue:</PARA>
<PARA> The AIS will be required to allocate more of its resources to coaching courses both in Canberra and at other venues around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision of adequate domestic and international travel to expose AIS scholarship holders to higher levels of competition will be emphasised under a Coalition Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy of decentralisation of accepted AIS sports to centres around Australia will be continued. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Institute of Sport will be required to establish performance levels to assist it in setting goals, and to act as a measure of its successes and failures. </PARA>
<PARA>We indicate that we will continue to support and encourage the Australian Sports Aid Foundation and, indeed, we will be looking for a greater degree of private sector sponsorship within sport. The policy has a number of other significant initiatives which will take us very much back to a position of national leadership, but not government direction, of Australian sport and sports policy in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the final question that I said I wished to address, the question of drugs in sport. The pressure which is placed upon young athletes to compromise themselves by using drugs is now at a most extraordinary level. It is to the overwhelming credit of most young Australians that they are not seduced into this form of behaviour. It is a tragedy that young athletes like Darren Clarke who a few years ago were only fractions of seconds off world record pace in particular events now find themselves something like five metres off the pace. One cannot help but remark that to a very large extent it would be not unfair to say that that is in part because they have resisted, whereas others have succumbed to, the lure of using performance enhancing drugs in sporting activities. People like Clarke and others have played a prominent role in indicating the degree to which they will resist pressure by those who want them to use performance enhancing drugs and that is greatly to their credit, but I do not know the extent to which that capacity to resist is being progressively undermined by the philosophy of `win at any price' and the pressures which, right from the senior levels of government down, we all tend to put on people in the sports arena to achieve for Australia-waving flags, running television commercials and all the rest of it-with the implication that somehow almost any price is a good enough price to pay for success on the sporting field. </PARA>
<PARA> I said earlier that I think it is enormously to the credit of the overwhelming majority of Australian athletes and young people in particular that they resist this pressure. I have been concerned-I put it at that level at this stage-to read some of the material which has flowed from the public hearings of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, which has been investigating this matter. I do not want in any way to reflect on what that Committee is doing or to in any sense judge or pre-empt what it will say in its final report, but I believe that the way in which the hearings of that Committee have been reported has started to engender in the minds of most people who are simply casual readers of the press or observers of the media that somehow Australian sport is awash with drugs and that every participant in sporting activity in Australia at a certain level must be under suspicion of having some contact or some involvement with drugs and with the drug culture in sport. I do not believe that that is correct. I believe that the media has caused the reports of the Senate Committee to be dealt with in such a way as to reflect very adversely upon sports men and women throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The President of the Australian Olympic Federation, Mr Kevan Gosper, in February of this year wrote to Senator Black, the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, the Committee which is undertaking the investigation to which I have referred. Mr Gosper says in his letter, in part:</PARA>
<PARA> Widescale assertions of drug-taking are being made in a manner that besmirches the reputations of the AOF and the IOC, the AIS and the controlling bodies of the Olympic sporting disciplines. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a patent misrepresentation to assert, as was the case last week, that the AOF `gave six week's notice' of impending drug tests in the hope that no Australian sports people would be detected. </PARA>
<PARA> To imply official corruption in this way belies overwhelming evidence to the contrary that the majority of young sports people are not associated with drug-taking. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts speak for themselves:</PARA>
<PARA> 15,000 athletes at the Seoul Olympic Games</PARA>
<PARA> 260 events</PARA>
<PARA> 600 drug tests</PARA>
<PARA> 20 positive</PARA>
<PARA> 10 dismissed on appeal</PARA>
<PARA> 10 upheld</PARA>
<PARA> Further research has shown that fewer than three percent of athletes within the programme of Olympic disciplines tested positive. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Gosper goes on to make the point that the Australian Olympic Federation has been one of the pioneering organisations in attempting to eliminate the use of drugs in sport. He seeks public acknowledgment of the policy of the Australian Olympic Federation and the work that it has done in seeking to eliminate drugs in sport. On behalf of the Opposition I want to record our public acknowledgment of the effort that people such as Mr Gosper and the Federation and the various organisations particularly concerned with amateur sport in this country have undertaken, as far as is practicable, to get rid of the use of drugs in sport. I think it ought to be placed on the public record that the overwhelming majority of sports administrators in this country are concerned about this problem and have been undertaking such actions as are available to them to combat the problem. I do not think their efforts should be left without being remarked upon when so much of the reporting in the media gives an entirely false impression of the overall situation as far as this country is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned equally about the importance of re-establishing in Australia a testing centre for drugs in sport inquiries which will meet Australian Olympic Committee standards. Madam Acting Deputy President, you will recall that in April 1987 the International Olympic Committee's Medical Commission revoked the accreditation of the Royal Brisbane Hospital to test for drugs in samples supplied by athletes both from Australia and from overseas. We have still not fully re-established within Australia an International Olympic Committee accredited facility for these tests. If my memory serves me correctly, they are currently being sent mainly to Cologne in order to be tested and the test results are returned to Australia. I do not think that is satisfactory. I know that the Government has taken some steps in this regard and I hope that the accreditation of a suitable facility in Australia will not be long delayed. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make one final comment on this matter. Even when one has tests and testing facilities, sometimes those tests are open to query as to their reliability. I do not intend to go into enormous detail regarding the case of Mr Alex Watson. However, I believe that the submissions that Mr Watson has made, backed up by some extremely important data from people such as Dr Maslen, a Western Australian expert on questions regarding caffeine and testing for caffeine, are of some considerable relevance because there are doubts about the validity of particular tests applied in relation to certain substances which are still not well understood in terms of their physiological and pharmacological effects upon the body. I do not seek to pronounce one way or the other, at this stage on the question of Mr Watson's position, other than to say that I hope that all the evidence will be properly assessed by the relevant authorities, both in terms of the international associations with which he is concerned and with the Pentathlon Union in Australia and at an international level. The facts speak for themselves. I hope that, at the end of the day, Mr Watson gets true justice, whatever the outcome of all those inquiries. In order to get true justice we must also have thoroughly reliable tests. I hope that the tests, both at the international level and the domestic level, will always be understood to be of the highest possible standard. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying once again that the Opposition supports this legislation. It believes that some significant issues have arisen in terms of Australian sports policy, Australian sports administration, and Australian sports funding. However, those are capable of being debated within the Budget context and within the context of individual cases, such as that which I have raised regarding the placing of cycling facilities in Australia. I believe that the amalgamation of the various parts of sports administration in the Australian Sports Commission, being established in its new form under this Bill, is a step in the right direction. To that extent the Opposition is prepared to indicate its support for this legislation and to wish it speedy passage but, as it has been in the Parliament for almost two years, I simply say that I wish it a speedy passage today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Australian Sports Commission Bill 1988, which, as Senator Puplick has said, will establish a new statutory authority-the Australian Sports Commission-which is essentially an amalgamation or a merging of the functions of the Australian Institute of Sport and the current Australian Sports Commission. As well, this legislation defines the objectives, the functions and the powers of that new body and spells out how it relates to the Government and to the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. In particular, the legislation makes clear-and the Government in this legislation wants to make clear-the new Commission's relationship with the Government. It is clear that the Commission will operate within the framework of an overall government objective and policy and, ultimately, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) will be able to require or guide the Commission to put into practice and effect the policies of the government of the day-at least as I understand it. I presume that Senator Puplick, in spelling out the Opposition's policy, does not really take issue with that point. He may be able to explain to me later, as I understood him to say at the end of his speech, why there seemed to be some requirement for the Commission to be independent of government. This legislation makes it clear that the Minister will determine the overall guidelines for the Commission, as established. I suppose that I can presume that, as Senator Puplick is agreeing with this legislation, he is not taking too much objection to that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I chide Senator Puplick for chiding us about cost constraints and the restriction of moneys or the allocation of funding to the sports arena over the last few years. I think the Australian Sports Commission, the Department and the relevant Ministers need to be congratulated on continuing to achieve all the things they are achieving under the sports vote and, at the same time, being very mindful of the need for expenditure restraint. In some ways this legislation is one very effective way in which the Government has addressed the problem of reducing administrative costs by merging the functions of the various subsets under the sports ministry, achieving savings that have enabled the continuation of all the things we want to see happening under sports, and at the same time being very mindful of the need for cost constraint. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it amusing that, as ever, the Opposition, which somehow believes in no government expenditure, comes into this chamber and criticises the restraint practised by this Government and, even worse, criticises the Government for not maintaining real funding. This Government is very aware of the importance of economic constraint. It has achieved a very effective ongoing program in the sports area and, at the same time, a very responsible management of sports expenditure. Even the changes to the administration which this legislation further enshrines add to the gains or the financial good management by reducing some of the expenditure. I ask Senator Puplick whether the Opposition's policy says that the Opposition will maintain government funding in real terms under the sports policy. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That will be a point for another debate. Senator Puplick seems to dispute Senator Richardson's claims that the Opposition has to take into account another $6.3m under the sports development program and has to take off the gains made by a reduction in expenditure. We are pleased to see that the Opposition has a policy that is very similar to the Government's policy in the sports area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was mischievous of Senator Puplick to suggest that Adelaidians do not cycle as well as Launcestonians. I do not believe that the decentralisation policy meant that there should be one national facility in the country, wherever it is put if it is to be taken out of Canberra. If one has a look one will find that there are international standard facilities in more than one place around this country. Cycling has been very extensively fought for and supported by the South Australian Government and by any number of people committed to the cycling sport in that State. I will not cite all of the heroes who have cycled with such success in South Australia but when this cycling facility is completed in South Australia I am sure we will see an extension of the benefits and the opportunities that are offered to Australians to develop their cycling skills. </PARA>
<PARA> The existence of the cricket academy in South Australia does not mean that this is the only place where one can learn cricket at that kind of level or that it is confined to that place. Nor does it mean that facilities are not to be developed in other places. What we have to support-and I strongly support it-is the intention to make these excellent international facilities available to Australians with the aim of decentralisation. While it is sometimes advantageous for people to come to the Institute of Sport and use its excellent facilities, clearly that is not possible for many Australians for much of the time. So some balance is achieved by taking some of the specialist facilities away from the capital. Sometimes we reverse that by bringing teams there, particularly prior to significant events, so they can use the facilities at the Australian Institute of Sport. No doubt there will always be continuing debate about the best balance between those two services. At the moment, the Government fairly clearly wants to make its sporting facilities available to as many people in the community as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> A couple of other achievements under this Government and the Australian Sports Commission are well worthy of recall. In particular I recall the emphasis of the Government to provide as much support as possible for broad community participation. I do not believe we should overlook Aussie Sports which, to this point, has been established for nearly three years. Well over 1,700 primary schools and over 500,000 children are now enjoying the benefits of that program. That is something that is sometimes overlooked but the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) deserves considerable congratulations for that achievement. Early participation in sport and recreation to the point where it may become the expectation of people that sport and recreation are a normal part of living, hopefully will establish that practice. Hopefully, that expectation will be carried on through secondary school and into adult life. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of concern to me and to a number of others that so far that pattern has not been established to the point where girls maintain their participation in sport and recreation during secondary school years as much as do boys. Any number of research documents continues to show that that is the case. While I know that there are thousands of young women around Australia participating in sport and recreation, the numbers are not maintained as highly as they are at the primary school level. It is a matter that the Government continues to address. We take very seriously the point that Senator Puplick made earlier about the benefits of health and fitness to the community if its members participate in sport and recreation. </PARA>
<PARA> Not too long ago, when I launched at a function in South Australia a community video about women in sport, Senator Richardson said, on behalf of the Government, that there are about 1.5 million women registered in the various sports which have a registration component. The Government aims to see that number tripled to 4 1/2 million by the year 2000. That is a very good, simple goal. There are many more women whom we want to see actively registered as participants in sport and recreation in all its varieties around this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make some comments about the drugs in sport campaign. I spoke recently at a Sports Medicine of Australia Foundation dinner at the New South Wales branch. There are some points that we should make about the drugs in sport debate. In some ways there are two very diverse attitudes in the community about drugs in sports. One is an instinctive repugnance. People say, `They're cheating. It's not fair. How dare they', and so on. It was best captured, I suppose, by a splendid article in the Age the day after Ben Johnson lost his gold medal. That article commenced with the words, `Say it isn't true, Ben'. I suspect that that was an attitude many of us had. In other words, `Please, you, who seem to have been so absolutely splendid and great, do not tell us you have done it by cheating and using drugs'. It seems that that was the case. There was a sense of disappointment and repugnance at the use of drugs by sports people, particularly at the elite level. On the other hand, there is a broad community acceptance. People say, `So what? Everyone is doing it. If I don't, how can I compete? It's not fair. It's making a mockery of it. Everyone does it, so what's the harm?'. The challenge for the inquiry, and certainly for the Sport Commission in its national drug program, is to come to terms with those two very diverse opinions in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things we should do is practise some restraint. It would be better for us to hasten slowly in this area and wait until we have some substantial data on which to begin to form our opinions. For example, what is a drug in the expression `drugs in sport'. I do not believe we have a clear definition of what is called a drug for the purposes of this debate. In the past, I have spoken to people about this. One example that comes to mind is that of a man who used to ride 50- and 100-mile bike races in England. I suspect that anybody who rides in 50-mile races, let alone 100-mile races, is probably so remote from my experience that I would have nothing in common with him. But at one stage he was relating to me how taking a drink of water during a race was regarded as dishonourable, the behaviour of a cad; only a cheat did it. Until very recently, people who ran the marathon were regarded suspiciously if they took a sip of water in the course of that 26 mile-plus run. Even water was regarded as unacceptable. It was regarded almost in the nature of an aid to a person trying to compete in those events. The 50- and 100-mile cyclists also told me that when some sports people were discovered to have flasks of tea or coffee to sip along the way they were also frowned upon. They were not struck off, but it was considered not to be the proper way to behave. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have seen is the development over time of what is regarded as appropriate behaviour by sports people. For example, these days it is regarded as inappropriate for a person running a marathon to do so without taking adequate fluids throughout the course of the run. I met some heroes of the old order as they lay twitching and unconscious at the end of a marathon in the resuscitation tents of various cities-heroes who knew that a real man did not sip water. These people had to be hydrated with intravenous water or a saline drip when they got to the end of the race. Mostly they managed to make it to the end before they collapsed, which was very timely, I suppose. But that notion is now frowned on; it is very foolish. The attitude of the community would say that it would be foolish in the extreme not to take adequate fluid and sustenance and prepare properly if one is going into that kind of endurance race. We must realise that there has been an historical change. There has been an emerging understanding of what is an appropriate level of fitness and what is an appropriate level of proper, wholesome healthy body response to such strain and stress as athletes put on their bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> In the drug debate we need a clear definition of what a drug is. We must also ask whether it is ever possible or proper to use drugs. For example, is an athlete who has a headache unable to take pain killers if it is coming up to the time of a race? I do not think that anyone would say that that is the case. On the other hand, perhaps pain killers will help a person endure the stress or strain for which he might strive in achievement. Maybe that comes under the definition of drugs. Maybe it is about what one can use by way of medication or assistance within a certain number of hours of a performance. I think I read in a newspaper recently that Ben Johnson is supposed to have used drugs within 21 days of his run. So what is the appropriate time before an event, let alone after an event, in which a person may take medication?</PARA>
<PARA> Are these drugs medications? If they are medications, ought they to be prescribed only by a doctor? I take Senator Puplick's point that we urge a caution as to the validity of reports on this. I do not know whether they are true. However, I am concerned when I read about non-medical people passing out steroids by the handful saying, `Just knock a few of these down', because steroids are serious medications. We do not even know the concentration of the chemical or the significant active ingredient in the tablets. As a medical person, I am quite horrified at that casual practice in the allocation of medications and chemicals to people. It is very worrying. I do not want to be understood to be saying here that doctors only should prescribe drugs in sport. However, if after seriously addressing this question, it were judged that some medications were appropriate sometimes, we must look at who is the appropriate person to administer those drugs. I do not see why a drug for a fit athlete is too different from a drug for a sick person. We need to be responsible about the stringent requirements that go with the administration of medications to healthy people as well as to unwell people. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the best thing to do in the drugs in sport area is to wait for the report from the Senate committee. Maybe the very best we can do is to wait until that considered response by a committee that is taking a large number of submissions provides us with, I hope, some of the data that I have alluded to as necessary and with information on many of the other questions that I have not had time to refer to today. It is time to be somewhat restrained; it is time to look for some hard facts, proper data and definitions. It is also important to look at how those two attitudes that I have mentioned-that is, on the one hand, a repugnance by people to those who use drugs in sport and, on the other, a broad acceptance-might be resolved. Through it all I think that we should have a considerable regard, if not respect, for the athletes, particularly those trying to reach international levels of excellence. They are under considerable strain and pressure to achieve and to win at all costs. From that we may conclude that we need to redefine what is at the base of our sporting philosophy. </PARA>
<PARA> Talking of winning at all costs leads me to another point that I want to raise briefly, and that is violence in sport. The report of the National Committee on Violence by Professor Chappell was released recently. I was interested to find that Professor Chappell not only covered domestic violence-violence against our children, and so on-but also mentioned violence on our sporting fields. I suppose, reading from page one, Professor Chappell probably did not tell me how to think about it, but I gathered that he was not in favour of violence in sport. If that is not what Professor Chappell said, I suggest that that is all I can conclude from page one. </PARA>
<PARA> However, being a good sportsperson, I also turned to the back pages and there I saw the hero who coaches the team in Queensland that has Warwick Capper playing for it. Capper had been clobbered, bitten or thumped three times in the one match by his own colleague. `Oh', said the man in charge of that team, `That's really nothing. It just shows the boys are really serious'. `Whoops', one could almost hear him thinking, `As long as they don't take this violence off the field it'll be all right'. I had a funny feeling that page one and the back page were contradicting each other in a very significant way and I also had a feeling that Warwick Capper might have had a slightly different view about violence on the football field too, let alone anybody else who has collected a very good elbow as he has run past. </PARA>
<PARA> I raised the question of violence in sport at the national sports medicine meeting. I was interested to find that many people at that meeting were at pains to tell me that sport would not be sport if it were not violent. I thought, `Oh, no, back to page one'. Very often sport is excellent, superb sport without violence. It is the development of the skill, the challenge, the balance and the finesse that is the excitement of sport. It is not just whether a person can drop three of the opposition and not get caught, or whatever else it is that our heroes get up to in the name of exciting body contact. </PARA>
<PARA> I was delighted to see that some of the football codes are introducing changes to their rules of practice so as to ensure that players do not suffer grievous injury. I would not mind at all-this is not a recommendation that I would insist anyone follow-if we had the rule that put people off the field for five minutes to cool down. That would be a jolly good thing. If a person got caught thumping someone, he would have to go over the back of the fence and wait for five minutes. Thus his team would play at a disadvantage. While that is not bad in practice, it does not seem to stop the ice hockey players who forever come back to the field just to enjoy another five minutes off the field. But I will not talk about ice hockey. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it very interesting to consider what it is about violence in sport that seems to get people agitated, although they have not quite become violent about it. It seems that some people push strongly for violence in sport as a good thing. Again, it may be that what we have to do is to make clearer what we mean by violence in sport. I think that the gratuitous whack, thump, kick, trip-anything of that sort-which is clearly outside the rules of the sport and is quite likely to injure the other contestant ought not be encouraged. I find the enormous following for golf quite interesting. One could hardly use violence in golf, a sport with an enormous following, although the golf ball might speak differently. Tennis, skiing and lots of sports enjoy huge participation and television audiences, or even live spectator audiences, and would not by any definition be called violent. I find it quite interesting that some people suggest the changes in our cricket from test matches to one-day matches have done little more than encourage, if not violence, at least some kind of Mexican wave and banana throwing among the crowd, and that that is a move towards violence. Perhaps I am straying a little too far from the Bill. </PARA>

Senator Tate's comment was quite a curious one and I disagree with it. However, I can say that he is in good company, or at least in large company. Going back to my comments on drugs in sport, it may be time to redefine the philosophy of sport: where is sport going? What is meant by sport in terms of a government's or a nation's commitment to it? What is our commitment to sport?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not believe that there are people who would actually encourage violence in sport. I am not urging that we do away with tough, rigorous playing, but I certainly would not want to encourage violence in sport any more than honourable senators would want to encourage the use of drugs in sport. We have to appreciate that violence and drugs have another thing in common, that is, the dollar. The investment of large amounts of dollars in sport means that sometimes the nature of the sport is determined by the persons paying, rather than by the persons playing. </PARA>
<PARA> All those involved in sport-the sports people, the sports administration and, in particular, the Australian Sports Commission-have a challenge to make clear some of these questions and the philosophical underpinning of sport in this country, which I think is changing considerably. Evidence of that is the establishment under the Australian Sports Commission of the Women's Sports Promotion Unit. When I conducted the inquiry on women and sport for the Government we had a considerable battle to persuade people that women's sport was worthy of the same kind of recognition by government and sponsors as men's sport receives. Since that report was tabled in 1985 the climate for women's sport in this country has considerably changed. If that reflects a changed community attitude that allows more diversity, and more tolerance, of a wider variety of women's sport, then I can only congratulate the people involved. Certainly, I believe that both Ministers for sport-in particular, the former Minister, Mr John Brown, who launched the Women's Sports Promotion Unit in December, 14 months or so ago-and the Sports Commission, in its support and commitment to the Women's Sports Promotion Unit, reflect the importance and acceptance of the participation of women in sport. I believe that we are getting excellent value for our sporting dollar from the Women's Sports Promotion Unit, chaired by Margaret Pewtress. </PARA>
<PARA> The debates I alluded to, in terms of the philosophical underpinning of sport, concern things that the women in sport are tackling. Certainly they were raised with us during the inquiry on women's sport. We were told that women's sport is Mickey Mouse and that nobody would want to watch it because it is all milksoppy stuff. Clearly those people have never watched a good netball match. While we had to address that question, the conclusion of our report was that, essentially, it is up to the participants in sport to determine the nature of their sport-not only the active players, but also the coaches, the trainers, the people in the administration and the infrastructure behind, or involved immediately with, the sport. With the formulation of the views on sport by the participants, the Sports Commission would have even further information to go on. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986 the Australian Sports Commission published a strategic plan for 1986-87 to 1988-89 in which many of these questions were tackled, or at least were appreciated as being important to address. In our Australian Sports Commission we have a comprehensive organisation which is already tackling many of these issues. But, like everything in this world, new issues have emerged. The issue that I think is particularly high on the agenda at the moment is the question of drugs in sport, notwithstanding that there is a national policy to deal with drugs in sport under the Australian Sports Commission. Clearly that debate now has a new dimension. In the not too distant future we may have to address the question of violence in sport. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic issues associated with sport cannot be overlooked, not only the cost to government through the allocation of its public dollar but also the cost and/or the benefits to the corporate sector and sponsors in the area I am interested in-that is, women's sport. The considerable increase in the sponsorship dollar for women's sport and the increased media coverage are partly a recognition of the fact that many people in this country spend lots of money on sport and recreation, whether attending as spectators or participating and buying the necessary equipment. The Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has produced some excellent reports, not the least of which is entitled Technical Paper No. 1-The Economic Impact of Sport and Recreation, Household Expenditure. This report takes us to another area of analysis under the sports heading that is useful and fruitful. The recognition of the economic contribution of sport and recreation, both within the community and beyond, in terms of export potential, is something we cannot overlook. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that my comments have been allowed under this legislation, I am pleased to have been able to put them on the record. This is useful legislation, in large part because it rationalises even further, and brings together, the services that the Sports Commission, the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories and the Australian Institute of Sport provide to the Australian community. I commend the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Sports Commission Bill 1988 is designed to streamline the implementation of Government policy on sport in Australia by bringing under the control of the new Australian Sports Commission activities which were previously the responsibility of its predecessor of the same name, the Australian Institute of Sport and the Department of Sport, Recreation and Tourism. The Australian Democrats support this Bill. It is most interesting to note that we appear to have tripartisan agreement on a number of issues with regard to this legislation. Perhaps sport is the great conciliator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, in commending the Bill to the Senate I want to draw attention to a number of issues which are of concern to the Australian Democrats and which we believe should receive the attention of the Australian Sports Commission. The first of these issues is the distinction between what are generally referred to as elite sports and community sport. It is widely accepted that Australians are extremely interested in sport and that Australian performers who can achieve top level performance in national and international competition receive an extremely large amount of attention. To some extent, we are inclined to define our standing in the world community by our successes and failures in the arenas of international competition. Indeed, one major catalyst for the creation of the Commission and the Australian Institute of Sport was a perceived decline in Australia's sporting reputation as measured by our Olympic gold medal counts and defeats in international sporting events.</PARA>
<PARA> It is the opinion of the Democrats that far too much attention is being paid to elite sports compared with that paid to participatory sport. In that respect, it is pleasing to see that one of the functions of the new Commission is to develop and implement programs that promote equality of access to and participation in sport by all Australians. The Australian Democrats advocate that the Australian Sports Commission be encouraged by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) to place a very heavy emphasis on the development of community sports. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst it is true that the achievements of top class performers can inspire others in the community to emulate their performance and dedication, too much attention to elite sport can have some very destructive effects. In the first place, the impression can be given that only the world class performers have any value or deserve any recognition. This impression may deter people, particularly young Australians, from participating in sport. I believe that this phenomenon is already evident in some high schools, where small numbers of students, under intensive coaching, are achieving even higher standards of performance. But increasing numbers are dropping out of participation in sport. I believe that this is because those who drop out are given the impression that inability to achieve high levels of performance is synonymous with failure. The Aussie Sports program is certainly doing a great job to rectify this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the emphasis on top performance, competition and winning has deteriorated into an attitude which sees winning at any cost to be desirable. That issue has already been debated here. This can result, in some sports, in increasing violence. I believe that broad concern about violence in our community, which has often been expressed in this place and, indeed, has been expressed today during this debate, must recognise that the promotion, tolerance and sometimes even glorification of violence in sport inevitably promotes the impression that violence is appropriate in other spheres of human activity. Some body contact sports are approaching the stage where actions which are tolerated during the course of the game would, if they were to occur on the street, result in assault charges leading to convictions and even to lengthy prison sentences. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crowley raised the matter of the National Committee on Violence. In its first report there is a whole section on violence in sport. In fact, that report states the issues that Professor Duncan Chappell believes should be discussed while the Committee is receiving its evidence. I also draw to the Senate's attention the case of a well known football team being shown Rambo movies before going out to play a game. The Australian Democrats believe that the new Commission should tackle this matter of violence in sport and also tackle the overemphasis on winning at all costs, which can breed violence. </PARA>
<PARA> Another result of an undesirable emphasis on winning at all costs is the use of drugs in sport to enhance performance. Certainly, this is another issue which has received plenty of attention in this place and during this debate. I believe it will inevitably be a major concern of the new Commission. The costs of drug usage are enormous. They include the likely damage to the health of participants, the undermining of the concepts of fair competition, the cost of monitoring and detection, and the extraordinary frustration of athletes who do not resort to drug taking and who, after enormous dedication and training, find themselves defeated by inferior or less dedicated athletes who have taken drugs. The Australian Democrats certainly believe that the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, which is inquiring into the use by Australian sports men and women of performance enhancing drugs, should be commended on the way in which it is conducting its inquiry. It is unfortunate that it has been criticised unduly and too early in the course of its inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> The last undesirable outcome of the win at all costs mentality is the totally unbalanced commitment to excessive training which can result when national prestige is made dependent on the performance of athletes and sports contestants. In recent years we have seen examples of absolutely extraordinary performances by teenage gymnasts and swimmers in international competition. While filled with admiration for their almost incredible levels of performance, many Australians must wonder whether the lives of these young performers may not have been rendered miserable through the extremes of the demands placed upon them. Certainly, it is possible that under such conditions young people can become victims rather than happy proponents of sport. The Australian Democrats believe that the Australian Sports Commission should accept responsibility for monitoring the degrees of pressure and the training regimens which are proposed for young contestants. Certainly, we do not want our young people to be pressured into obsessive levels of involvement and training which can make their lives a misery. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like now to express grave disquiet on behalf of the Australian Democrats at the prospect of the Bruce Stadium, which was constructed some years ago for the use of the Australian Institute of Sport, at this stage being turned over to the Canberra Raiders and lost to concerns such as Little Athletics and the more general Canberra community use. It seems to be a classic case of precisely the direction in which we should not be moving-that is, of handing over to commercial sport a facility which is intended for participation sport. For this and other reasons the Democrats believe that the trend to ever greater emphasis on elite sport, and media coverage of it, needs to be reversed in favour of energetic promotion of community sport, because of the health, recreational and social advantages of community sport. For example, we should not assess our prowess as a nation on the issue of whether a lone Australian is the holder of a world record for running, but rather on the percentage of Australians of all ages who run regularly and enjoy a high level of physical fitness. Distance runner Sebastian Coe summed it up when he said, `I'd rather see 50,000 people taking part in a fun run than one person running a four-minute mile'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is on community sport or sport at the level of participation that the emphasis of the Australian Sports Commission should fall. It is widely accepted that we are an unhealthy community with low levels of physical fitness. There have been a number of reports which have suggested that levels of fitness for younger Australians, particularly teenagers, have been falling rather than improving over the years. Assessments are that a high proportion of the maladies which afflict us are related to our lifestyles and that failure to engage in exercise and physical recreation is a major factor resulting in ill health. Over the past 15 years health care costs in Australia have trebled. Consequently, enormous benefits will accrue to our society from increased participation in community sport and increased levels of fitness. It should be borne in mind that the types of sport which promote health and fitness generally do not require enormously expensive facilities such as are commonly required for elite sport. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the encouraging and exciting developments over recent years has been the increase in participation in many types of sport by groups who were not formerly very active. I refer in particular to women, people with disabilities and senior citizens. It is not very long ago, as Senator Crowley said, that women were effectively debarred or energetically discouraged from participating in very many forms of sport. Discouragement and subtle forms of discrimination still exist, but a great deal of progress is being made in making participation available to women. As a result, women's levels of performance are improving very rapidly in many areas. These improvements are occurring at a much more rapid rate than that which applies to male performances, and it is apparent that women athletes will achieve parity in many fields within a very few years. The old myth that women are inferior to men in terms of strength and endurance is now becoming `an old myth'. More recent evidence suggests that women may indeed be innately superior to men in these areas and that in fields such as long distance running and the marathon women's performances are set to surpass those of male athletes. Ken Dyer, in his book Challenging the Men: Women in Sport, states:</PARA>
<PARA>In the Olympics . . . most women's sports were introduced well after they were introduced for men . . .</PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . anomalies are quite glaring. For example, there is no women's cycling in the Olympics or any other games despite its being a very popular women's sport in which world championships have been organized since 1958. Worldwide, field hockey is as popular among women as it is among men. It has been a men's Olympic sport since 1908 but was not on the women's programme until Moscow 1980. There is no example of what is primarily a women's sport, such as netball, being on any major games programme. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> In aerobic events in which they compete, women have attained virtual equality with men. This assertion is based on the following facts . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to quote just a few of them:</PARA>
<PARA> Women have completed a majority of the ten fastest swims across the English Channel and their dominance has been particularly marked in the last three years. They also hold all the records for swimming the Catalina Channel of California. These events involve eight or nine hours' swimming. </PARA>
<PARA> Women have held the fastest times for the fifty mile swim-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Greta Anderson-</PARA>
<PARA>and the fifty mile run (Natalie Cullimore) in the 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA> Marathon swimmer Diana Nyad became the first person to swim from the Bahamas to Florida on 20 August 1979. She swam the eighty-nine mile distance in 27 hours 38 minutes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought the honourable senator might find these facts interesting. The book continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Women are now consistently achieving times in the marathon . . . of under 2 hours 40 minutes. With such times they can confidently expect a placing in the top 5 per cent or so of male finishers in even the strongest events. </PARA>
<PARA> Women hold the fastest times for all roller skating events of 25,000 metres and over. </PARA>
<PARA>And finally:</PARA>
<PARA> Women are now swimming 800 metres, their longest Olympic distance, in times not achieved by men until the early 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA>These developments are beginning to affect in very positive ways women's perceptions of themselves and will promote progress towards equal participating in all aspects of society. Further, the changes are making the enjoyment of active participation in sport in many areas-as participants, officials and administrators-available to more and more women. The Australian Democrats trust that the Commission will energetically pursue the goal of promoting participation in sport by women. Earlier, the pattern in Australia was for people to engage energetically in sport during childhood and early adulthood, but thereafter for active involvement to decline rapidly and for the vast majority to become spectators rather than participants. More recently, the values of participation in physical activity in adulthood and on into old age have been increasingly recognised. The `Life. Be In It' campaign made a contribution here. It is therefore very encouraging to note that participating in appropriate sport and physical activity by senior citizens is also very much on the increase. As a result many will experience vastly improved health and quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Sports Commission has played a restricted role in the development of veterans' sport, which unfortunately has been restricted by staff ceilings and availability of program funds. Nevertheless, a great deal remains to be done. Currently only about 35 per cent of adult men and 27 per cent of adult women, according to a 1986 Health Commission report, take any exercise. According to the National Heart Foundation, only about 10 per cent take regular exercise as defined by the Foundation. People with disabilities have been unnecessarily deprived of the opportunity to participate in sport, but enormous efforts have been made by disabled people and those with their interests at heart to turn this situation around, and with great success. The Australian Sports Commission has played a leadership role in this area in the last few years. I wish to quote from the February-March edition of Aussie Sports News 1989 and draw the Senate's attention to an article headed `Aussie Sports and integration of disabled students'. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA> In 1987 Malkara Special School, ACT, for children with intellectual disability and St Peter &amp; Paul's School developed an integrated Aussie Sports program. Since that time the program has developed and expanded with great benefits to all children physically, socially and emotionally. The community were also involved, with coaching being provided by a number of sporting associations. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Aussie Sports with its emphasis on enjoyment, development of skills and participation in a variety of modified sports is ideally suited for integration. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that there will be further participation by people with disabilities, both adults and children, in the sports area. Certainly a lot still remains to be done, but it is in areas such as these, by taking the initiative and setting the pace, that community participation in sport can develop. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that under this legislation the Minister is responsible for all appointments and that control is very much from the top down, as Senator Crowley mentioned. Millions of Australians are involved in sport and they have voluntarily combined into thousands of organisations in order to promote and regulate the activities of their sports. The Democrats would prefer to see more provision for direct input by these grassroots practitioners into the management of the Australian Sports Federation. They, after all, are the people who understand the needs of sport in this country and they are interested most in amateur and community sports of the types the Democrats believe the Commission should foster. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I wish to place on record that the Australian Democrats recommend that the Australian Sports Commission give its major emphasis to community and participation sports; that it continue and develop its excellent initiatives in the fields of children's sport, women's participation, veterans' sport, and sport for the disabled; that provision be made for strong input into the Commission's management and planning functions by the grassroots Australian sporting community and by its representative organisations; and that the Bruce Stadium be retained for the use of the Australian Sports Foundation for athletics, little athletics and for general Canberra community use and not be handed over to commercial interests. The Australian Democrats wish the new Australian Sports Commission well and commend this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Australian Sports Commission Bill 1988, I shall be brief and restrict my remarks to one essential area, namely, the use of banned substances in sport for the purpose of enhancing performance. Since I am the deputy chairman of a committee that is inquiring into that matter, I do not wish to impinge on any deliberations of that committee, but wish to make some general comments which I believe are essential for the Government to consider not only in terms of elite sports, but right through the range of juvenile sport and levels of sport below those of elite standards. These are matters which, in my view, have to be addressed not only by officials and athletes, but by society as a whole, and presumably with the Government giving some lead in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are enormous pressures, as my colleague Senator Puplick said, on athletes in Australia at all levels to compete well. There is enormous social pressure, pressure through the media, family pressure, pressure from sponsors, coaches and from those who organise the meets. It is not unkind to say that we in Australian society are not very good at expressing empathy or sympathy for losers. We love winners, but at best failed athletes returning to the shores of Australia, having competed in world championships or in the Olympic Games, will get nothing but perhaps a nod of the head and polite applause. They will receive no recognition for their endeavours, attempts, contributions, or for trying, or for the sacrifices that go with their participation in sport. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps it is the inferiority complex that affects most of us that leads us to enjoy basking in the reflected glory of success. We feel uncomfortable when we stand alongside somebody who at an international level did not win gold, silver or bronze. Society in its own way puts great pressure on athletes to win. The athlete knows how much it means to everybody else for an athlete to succeed. That is demonstrated by the way in which we conduct ourselves when we watch, for instance, the Olympic Games and the way in which we conduct ourselves on the return of our athletes. We have motorcades for the gold medal winners, but those who perhaps may have broken an Australian record and performed at a greater level than they have ever before achieved but who do not win gold are allowed quietly to go off to their friends and relations for little more than sympathy. It happens after every Olympics. It happens at government level and at the level of ordinary Australians, and that is the attitude that is taken. </PARA>
<PARA> The media do not help. They write headlines about a kid who is competing, who has never been within 10 seconds of a world record, but who is thought to have a chance. In that way the media create a hype, an atmosphere, that these young people can succeed. But even if they do their very best, it will not put them in reach of a world record, yet the media write in those terms. The reputations of the coaches and officials ride on the performance of the athletes, at least to their minds and those of their peers and colleagues. We have seen coaches bathe in the reflected glory of a successful athlete whom they take credit for delivering almost from birth to the winning post. That, in itself, puts enormous pressure on athletes. Anyone who has attended a sporting competition for juveniles, for example, little athletics, would have seen the vigour and energy demonstrated by parents on the sideline. Poor old Billy dare not fail, if he is not to get six of the best when he gets home for not being the best. From day one extraordinary pressure is put on our athletes. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to consider the enormous rewards and gains to be made by athletes who succeed. The financial rewards for the organisers of meets, sponsors and the media are great. Winning athletes are of advantage to them, so enormous pressure is put upon the athletes, who are given great incentives to succeed. Knowing that the difference between gold and failure, glory and loss, a million dollars and nothing, is perhaps a second or part of a second, who would not be tempted to take under supervision in moderate, controlled doses an anabolic steriod for short periods, like everybody else with whom the athletes line up? They would hardly be human if they were not tempted. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick referred to Darren Clarke who, if my memory serves me correctly, came fourth in the 400-metre final at the Seoul Olympics. My guess is that Darren Clarke is probably the fastest drug free 400-metre runner in the world. But he did not come home with gold. He did not come home with enormous endorsements. He was not driven in the back of a motor car down the main street of his home town, being cheered and clapped and met by the Lord Mayor. He did not receive that sort of reward as an acknowledgment for his being clean, for his resisting the temptation to take drugs, despite his knowing when he gets into the blocks that there is a prospect that everybody who beats him is cheating. Is there not a temptation for him to do what is the norm? The answer is that of course that temptation is there. I am not saying that everybody against whom he has competed used a performance enhancing drug. Darren Clarke, like everybody else, would know that many people who finish ahead of him in his chosen sport are highly likely to have used a performance enhancing drug. </PARA>
<PARA> I was disturbed when I read the letter of the President of the Australian Olympic Federation, Mr Gosper. The letter was referred to in a different way by Senator Puplick. Mr Gosper said:</PARA>
<PARA>Let's not lose sight of the fact that the real solution to the problem of performance-enhancing drug-taking rests with the athletes who countenance the drug-taking. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a stupid, naive and poorly judged comment that does nothing for Mr Gosper's reputation or that of the Australian Olympic Federation. With those words, he seeks to sheet home all the blame to athletes who countenance drug taking. Surely it rests with coaches, officials, families, governments-which involve themselves in sport these days-and society generally. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick read out a paragraph of Mr Gosper's letter in respect of the six weeks notice of impending drug tests given by the Australian Olympic Federation. I do not suggest, nor have I heard anybody else suggest, as Mr Gosper says, that it implies official corruption. I do not believe it does. But whenever an athlete is told that he has six weeks before he will be tested, we can be certain that unless he is an absolute idiot the results of such testing will be negative. The athlete would certainly have got himself off the `gear', as it is called. We all have a responsibility to understand the enormous pressure to which the athletes are subjected. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to understand that if Australia were able to introduce a regime of regular and random testing for illegal substances-the daily work of chemists around the world would seem to indicate that it is not possible-there would be the prospect that a whole generation of Australian athletes would be disqualified or eliminated from world competition. The problem could be overcome only if we could satisfy ourselves that there was an effective method of detecting these substances and if the system introduced in Australia were introduced by every other nation that competes in international sporting competitions. </PARA>
<PARA> An enormous amount of money and energy is being used to ensure that the testing procedures will fail. It has been discovered that the drug probenecid has been used primarily to mask anabolic steroids. It has the effect of holding in the liver about 99 per cent of the anabolic steroid after what is outside it is flushed out through using a diuretic. It has been suggested that the drug has been in use since 1981, but only in recent times has it been detected. That makes me wonder what masking substances are presently being used to hide the use of banned substances. At the end of the day, although the integrity of the testing that takes place at competitions such as the Seoul Olympics might not be open to question, the effectiveness of such testing can be questioned. These days, all sorts of methods are used to cheat the testing procedure. It is becoming more common, for instance, to use urine substitution. A male athlete, for example, has somebody else's urine inserted through his penis. Of course, the urine is clean and the test says that the athlete's urine is clean. All sorts of other methods are used to ensure that the testing does not give a positive result. </PARA>
<PARA> Society, officials such as Mr Gosper, the Government, and other bodies that are funded with taxpayers' money ought to ask themselves about the underlying philosophic reason for banning certain substances. I think Senator Crowley touched upon that subject. We have to remember that the only drugs which are presently banned are the ones which can be detected. That is logical, because if one could not test the drug, how would one ever know whether it was being used? If one did not know it was being used, what would be the point of banning it? The only exception to that situation is blood doping and there are now suggestions that that can perhaps be detected. As Senator Puplick mentioned earlier, the only two substances which have a qualitative definition are alcohol and caffeine. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to address the whole problem of drugs in sport, we ought to ask ourselves the question: why are we opposed to the use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport? Is it because we are concerned about the health of the athletes; is it because we wish to ensure that each athlete competes on an even playing field; or is it because we have a primeval instinct that man should compete `in the raw' without additional help--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, with modest exceptions. Is it simply that we want to see the extent, or the extremity, of man's and woman's ability in the field of sport? If we are concerned about athletes' health, what would be our attitude if it were possible to manufacture a drug which enhanced performance but was of no risk to health? Would we say that that was reasonable? If, for instance-and this is a bad example-it were possible to manufacture an anabolic steroid that had no short, medium, or long term effect, but provided muscle mass and the other qualities which enhance performance, would we ban that product? If so, why would we do so? Clearly, this would have nothing to do with our concern and anxiety for the health of athletes. Is it that we believe in what has been described by others as an even playing field? Is it that we want to make sure every athlete competes under the same circumstances and is given the same opportunities, so that when all athletes line up at the starting blocks they are actually running the same distance?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some people would say that we ought to ensure there is an even playing field. Frankly, we do not presently have an even playing field. One hears of African swimmers practising in hotel spas. Would anyone seriously put to me that athletes from deprived countries, such as the Sudan or Yemen-perhaps Ethiopia would be a bad example-are on an even playing field with the athletes of East Germany, or West Germany, or the United States? Of course they are not in terms of diet, training conditions, sports medicine or equipment. They do not have the same capacity to train without needing to seek employment or to travel around the world and compete in international events. Surely, nobody is seriously suggesting there is an even playing field at present. But nobody is complaining. Nobody is suggesting that every athlete ought to have the same chance in his training. It is claimed that athletes only have the same chance when they have finished their training and are in the blocks for the final. I believe that those who put that view are hypocritical unless they are prepared to ensure that there is an even playing field. </PARA>
<PARA> My final proposition is this: Is it a fact that we are concerned to ensure that present-day human beings compete without any form of artificial assistance? If that were the case, one would have to question the difference between an anabolic steroid and a vitamin B12 injection, or any other form of nutrition, food supplement or dietary process which would not constitute the normal daily regime of an athlete. I do not believe that a line can now be drawn to separate natural raw ability and artificial assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the questions which I believe have to be properly addressed. I do not believe they have been. It is not good enough for us simply to say that a certain thing is wrong, because society itself has not made up its mind why it is wrong. I do not believe that these questions have been addressed by the Government; I do not believe that they have been addressed by senior sporting officials who should have been thinking about these issues two generations ago; nor do I believe they have been considered by the community at large. Until one considers these matters, one faces great difficulty in addressing the fundamental and underlying problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The sad fact is that, in the medium term, there is very little prospect of ensuring that athletes will compete purely on natural ability. Let me give another example of what one might describe as an artificial aid. It has been suggested that the West Germans insert gas through the rectum of their swimmers in order to give them better flotation or buoyancy. Does that process constitute an external aid? Is the athlete in that case swimming on his own ability? Is that a perfectly acceptable situation?</PARA>
<PARA> I recall that in the last Olympics at Seoul the Australians designed and developed new swimming gear, which apparently was purported by our fair-minded competitors to give us an advantage. Senator Richardson will correct me if I am wrong, but I believe the swimming gear was banned because it could not be demonstrated that it would not give us an unfair advantage. Therefore, I assume that, if every single swimmer used our swimwear in the future it would be all right. So one is left pondering what is fair and what is unfair; what is cheating and what is not cheating. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that, in my view, we are a long way from solving these problems. We will not do ourselves any favours by imagining that the problem rests simply with athletes. The drugs being used are not simply anabolic steroids. They also include diuretics, beta blocks, narcotics and stimulants. We are talking about a whole range of products which have different effects, ranging from helping pistol shooters to helping marathon runners, high jumpers or basketball players. Until we come to grips with these fundamental issues, the problems shall not be solved. I hope that those who are a part of the Australian Sports Commission will address those questions which are, in my view, of a philosophic nature and look past getting us from fourth to first. Sadly, Australians are ambitious to bathe in the reflected glory of success, which is the very reason the Australian Institute of Sport was developed in the first place. It started in 1977. If my memory serves me correctly, it was because we were not satisfied with our performance in the Olympics in 1976. I remember one of our athletes-he was a swimmer; I shall not name him-who came back having competed and come third. He smashed his previous record. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. He was a world record holder, he smashed his previous record, but only scored third on that occasion. When he got off the aeroplane he was asked why he had failed. We wonder why athletes are tempted to take a performance enhancing substance of some sort when they are treated like that by Australian officials, Australian coaches and Australian society. As I say, that is why we have the Institute. It was not good enough for Australia to perform the way it did in 1976, so it decided to use taxpayers' money, with their full support and endorsement, I believe, as is still the case, to establish an institute of that nature to enhance our performance. Let us hope that we get past that stage-it is an intrinsic part of being involved in elite sports these days-address some of these other questions, and ensure that Australia plays its part and has proper and fairer sport internationally.</PARA></TALK.START>

However, lest there be any misconceptions in Senator Puplick's or anyone else's mind, the decision taken to locate cycling in Adelaide had naught to do with promises for any election, but everything to do with topography and climate. The reality was that the national body of cycling wanted Adelaide, campaigned for Adelaide and, in the end, got Adelaide. That is why this facility is in Adelaide. There is no other reason.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of elite sport versus more general participation, if one looks at the record one will see that the Australian Sports Commission has achieved a good balance with the funds available to it. It is certainly its intention, and mine as Minister, to ensure that that balance is continued. As all honourable senators will be aware, I am in the process of preparing a submission on the future of Australian sport which will involve even more taxpayers' money but will also involve considerable sums from the private sector. Again, in that submission I am ensuring that the balance between elite sport and participation will continue. There has never been any thought in my mind to try to concentrate all effort on elite sport. The health of Australia will be dependent upon participation in sports generally and we have to attempt to raise that participation level. I would have thought that the Aussie Sports program already has provided a tremendous boost for the future by encouraging many children to participate in a whole variety of sports that previously they would not have dreamt of. I think we are succeeding and certainly trying in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of sports medicine and its relevance to community health generally, part of that submission will certainly be including an expanded sports medicine component. It is not just a matter of looking at how to cure a pulled hamstring faster than is done at the moment, but rather how to relate research into the health of athletes to preventive medicine generally. I regard that as particularly important and hope to be successful in securing more funds for a study of it. </PARA>
<PARA> That, of course, leads to the discussion at the moment on drugs and how the Australian Sports Commission ought to react to drugs in sport. I have been careful over the last few months to say very little about the issue because it is before the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. I have been at pains not to attempt to pre-empt the Committee's findings. So to some extent I will limit my remarks on the question, although honourable senators may be assured that I will have plenty to say about it once the Committee has reported. Nonetheless, it seems clear now that the Olympic movement worldwide will strengthen and tighten its rules regarding drug testing. There is no question that between now and the Olympics in Barcelona the Olympic movement will exert its influence worldwide. I detect on its part a determination to make sure that the scandals which marred an otherwise very successful Olympic Games in Seoul are not repeated. The revelations of Ben Johnson's coach in Canada-from memory, his name is Francis-during the past 10 days are quite remarkable. They show a systematic use of performance enhancing drugs over a very long period, not just by Ben Johnson but by a number of other very prominent Canadian athletes. One can only speculate as to how widespread that usage has been. Certainly there are grave suspicions that it has spread to a number of countries. </PARA>
<PARA> We are asked by Senator Crichton-Browne-in my view rightly-to consider our aim. Is it to have a level playing field or are we concerned about health? I said once before in the Senate that there is nothing wrong with being concerned about the level playing field. We are after all not at the Olympics trying to determine who is the cleverest chemist or the cleverest doctor; we are trying to determine who is the best athlete. I worry that if we simply go down the path of saying, `Drugs are okay; we will let you inject yourself with these drugs', at the end of the day we will find out who is the cleverest chemist. I think I would rather discover that in a laboratory than on the track. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, it is also true, obviously, of steroids in particular, that there are very serious medical health consequences for athletes who have been taking them. The Australian Institute of Sport has an enviable record in making sure that its athletes are kept away from such substances. But certainly any submission that I put up to the Cabinet in regard to the future of Australian sport will focus upon the need for random testing. In Australia there must be a greatly increased program of random testing. The efforts of the past have not been adequate. They have certainly been adequate by world standards, but they will not be adequate by the standards that the world will set in the next four years. I want Australia to be in front of those standards and not behind them. </PARA>
<PARA> As to level playing fields and Senator Crichton-Browne's remarks about what is essentially the developed world as against the Third World, clearly it is not going to be possible to make everyone exactly equal. To use another analogy, I certainly do not intend to put forward a program under which we snatch children from their homes at the age of five and throw them into some sports prison where we indoctrinate them and train them so that by the time they are 13 years old they win gold medals and by the time they are 18 years of age they have breakdowns. That ought not to be the aim of any program in this country; nonetheless, there are countries which do that, there are countries which have taken our attitude, and there are the Third World countries. Mind you, the Third World countries have not been all that unsuccessful. The records of the Kenyans and the Ethiopians in comparatively recent times in the Olympics have been spectacular. They have done very well indeed, particularly in track and field events. I do not see why that trend cannot continue. However, obviously they are not going to have the same advantages even as athletes in Australia with the facilities that are available to them. While we cannot make the playing field exactly level, it ought not to be the case that we pick simply the cleverest chemist. I hope we never get to that stage. I will resist the temptation to comment further on Bruce Stadium. I think we have done that to death around this place by now, and I am more than satisfied with what the Government has done. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the real purpose of the Bill for a minute, so that someone at some point says something relevant to the actual Bill. Already it is obvious from the actions of the Australian Institute of Sport and the Australian Sports Commission, which have been running as a combined entity, that that has worked well, and produced economies, despite the fact that it has been difficult to pass this Bill through the Senate due to the pressure of business. Previously we have always had the possibility of one focus going towards elite sport, leaving the more participatory nature of the role of the Sports Commission somewhat in the shade. I think that has been removed by this combination. I really believe that this amalgamation will make sure that, in the future, we will not have the concern that Senator Jenkins has mentioned. I give Senator Jenkins and the Senate an undertaking that, as Minister, I will make sure that that balance is maintained and improved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Liberal and National parties do not oppose the Foreign Takeovers Amendment Bill 1988. However, in the committee stage several amendments will be moved and we will be seeking to oppose particular clauses of the Bill that will enable the Government virtually to ban real estate purchase in urban areas of Australia. At the outset, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate condemns the Government for its failed economic policies which have resulted in:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Australia's increasing dependence on foreign investment;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a continuing balance of payments crisis and associated foreign debt problems;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) high domestic interest rates adversely affecting all Australians; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) record levels of taxation which are heavily biased against the ability of Australians to save''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment draws attention to the Government's failure in its economic policies. Of course, that lays Australia open to any kind of predatory investment that may emanate from overseas. We do not oppose the second reading of the Bill. The amendment spells out very clearly the crisis this country has reached under the economic policies of the Hawke-Keating Government. I will return to that theme a little later. </PARA>
<PARA> At present I just want to observe that, because of the constant need to borrow or to sell assets and receive the proceeds from the sales of those assets, $1,500m is required every month just to keep the country going. That is an indication of the depth of our difficulty. Of course, this is expressed most clearly by our total debt, which has now accumulated to more than $125,000m. As I have said, that figure is growing to the tune of $1,500m a month. The crisis that we face in this country is of enormous proportions. Of course, the danger and the tragedy is that there appears to be no end to it because the Government simply does not have the policies to address it. As a result, debt levels in this country are growing out of all proportion. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn, firstly, to that part of the Bill that seeks to regulate the purchase by foreigners of urban real estate in this country. We have to cast our minds back to September 1987, when the Government, through the Treasurer, Mr Keating, made a statement claiming that it was about to introduce legislation to give effect to the control of urban real estate. It was a knee-jerk reaction to a perception that foreigners were buying up real estate in this country. Of course, we should just remember that in September 1987 the Premier of New South Wales was Mr Barrie Unsworth and he was fighting for his political life in the last few months of his tragic regime. In fact, he was being helped out extensively by Mr Keating, who perceived that there was a need to somehow generate some kind of image in New South Wales that housing prices were all the fault of foreigners and not the fault of either the State Government or the Federal Government. It was a knee-jerk reaction to a politically motivated need to shore up the fortunes of the Premier of New South Wales at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Six months later Mr Unsworth was out of government, out of the premiership and disappeared without a trace onto the back benches of the New South Wales State Parliament. That was the central reason for the Treasurer moving in the way that he did in September 1987 to implement this virtual ban on the purchase by foreigners of urban real estate in this country. He did it without any kind of analysis as to the proportion of urban real estate in this country owned by foreigners; he had absolutely no idea. In fact, he produced no evidence whatsoever of the degree of involvement of foreigners in land purchases in this country. It was simply a political knee-jerk reaction. One can typify that only as unbounded hypocrisy showing the arrogance of the man and also, I believe, his lack of intellectual honesty in bringing this matter forward. I will return to that point about honesty a little later. </PARA>
<PARA> Just to be certain that we know what we are talking about, I mentioned earlier that no hard evidence was produced by the Treasurer to indicate that foreign investment had pushed up house prices. I wish to quote from a report of a press conference held on 27 September 1987, when the Treasurer announced this new measure. The report in the Australian Financial Review of 30 September 1987 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The weakness of the Government's position was the lack of hard evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> At his press conference yesterday, Mr Keating could provide no facts and figures to back his decision. Nor could officials produce them later. The Treasurer admitted the evidence the Government did have, that foreign money was distorting the urban residential markets was `inconclusive'. </PARA>
<PARA>The report in the Australian Financial Review goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> He conceded that the Government relied heavily on `anecdotal' evidence. </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously that press conference clearly made the point that the Government had no real reason for introducing this measure in the first place. I guess that shows because, nearly 18 months on since the matter was first raised, the legislation is now just being discussed in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me go on to deal with a few other points. A journalist at the press conference which I just mentioned asked the Treasurer a question on the relevance of the measure. He asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Do you have any figures Mr Keating to show just what level of buying has been done by foreigners in residential real estate and what it's done to prices for the overall view?</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer's answer was no. A further question was asked:</PARA>
<PARA>What was the Government's assessment about the possibility of future capital inflow in these sort of residential areas . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer's answer was:</PARA>
<PARA>Well we had not made such an assessment . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously what we have here is a total denial of any responsibility on the part of the Government to justify its actions. Quite clearly, this measure is based on political imperatives and, as I said, basically was designed to ensure that the then Premier of New South Wales had some chance of winning a New South Wales State election which, of course, he subsequently lost. </PARA>
<PARA> One other strand in the thinking to try to save Mr Unsworth at the time was that urban real estate and residential house prices in Sydney were going through the roof and that prices were being driven up by the pressure of money coming in through foreign investment. </PARA>
<PARA> I answer that claim by quoting a statement by Mr Robert Bevan, the President of the Real Estate Institute of New South Wales. He was absolutely astounded by the action that the Government took. Mr Bevan said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a decision taken for purely political reasons to support the fallacious argument that foreign investors in the $1m plus residential market are making it hard for first-home buyers in the $80,000 to $90,000 market. If there were any way the REI could be convinced that stopping foreigners from buying into the upper end residential market would stop the price spiral in the mid to lower end residential market we would applaud the Government's move. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is the point. People who were investing from overseas-if there were a great number-from all the evidence available and from the Treasurer's own admission, which is anecdotal, appeared to be investing in expensive real estate. The fact was that there was very little movement due to the pressure of money from that source on lower to middle level property prices. That is the key point. Most people do not live in million dollar homes. They live in the cheaper ones around the median level of under $100,000, even in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> The conclusion is clear. The Government was totally politically motivated in setting down this measure. We will be opposing in the committee stage those clauses in the Bill which seek to implement controls over residential real estate. That is consistent with the Liberal and National parties' position. We have been exposing this issue since this policy was first announced in September 1987. We will also be moving some amendments in the committee stage which seek to alleviate the most onerous conditions imposed on trustees by this legislation. We will also be seeking clarification from the Government of its intentions with regard to the establishment of regulations under the legislation which will have the effect of controlling further the activities of people in the foreign investment area. </PARA>
<PARA> We should turn now to the need for foreign investment in this country. I do not think anybody in this Parliament would deny that this country requires, needs and demands more investment by foreigners who bring their technology, ideas and capital in order to stimulate job opportunities in Australia. We should welcome that on that basis. But the truth is that foreign investment is not progressing all that well in those areas. What we are seeing is mostly, if I may so characterise it, hot money. The reason why it is of the hot money variety is that many Australian businessmen and entrepreneurs tend to invest overseas rather than within this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Why do they do that? The reason they are taking their productive investments to countries such as Thailand, the Philippines, Korea, the United States of America and to other places is that, because of the returns they deem that they can obtain from their capital investments will be better placed in those countries. If the economy of this country were being run properly, we would find there would be no incentive for those businessmen to invest overseas. They would obviously prefer to invest in their home country if they could get a return equal to or better than the returns they get from overseas. They would then tend to place their money in this country. But, because of the Hawke-Keating Government's mismanagement, we see that there are not the returns available for that kind of investment in this country. Therefore they tend to invest offshore. </PARA>
<PARA> This has a twofold effect. The first is that the amount of money that would otherwise be available for development of our industries is reduced because it finds its way into other investments. Secondly, not only to replace that money but, indeed, to find other money to meet our bills every month, we have to bring in money from the overseas marketplace. That money is in the order of a couple of billion dollars a month. It is the sort of hot money which finds its way washing around the world, taking advantage of high interest rates and the currency fluctuations in order to earn short term profit. What a way to run a country! In order to finance our consumption-that is, what we spend every day in order to keep Australians employed and for them to buy goods in the supermarket-we are relying on attracting money from overseas on a short term basis which is highly dependent on the maintenance of a fluctuating exchange rate and/or a high interest rate. Of course, everybody in this country knows that the Hawke-Keating Government has deliberately brought interest rates to the highest level in history so as to make sure that we can attract that money from overseas. If we did not have those high interest rates, the dollar would collapse. As a result, we would be in an extraordinarily difficult position. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a conscious policy of the Government and it does not deny it. No-one denies it. While we have such a heavy problem with our overseas balance of payments position, interest rates by definition will remain high. This is a real tragedy for this nation. We face a situation where the Government has led us into a deeper morass of higher interest rates and a growing debt which does not seem to be falling at all but rather to be growing. </PARA>
<PARA> We have listened to the Government's assertions about the way it is running the economy. It says, `We are all on track. All you have to do is trust us'. Just how arrogant are these spokesmen of the Hawke-Keating Government? Where is their concern for the individual Australians who have to compete in the marketplace for money for their housing, for their businesses and to buy their cars at the kinds of interest rate levels that we see in the country? What is needed on the part of this Government is leadership. What this Government fails to offer the Australian people is a leadership style that allows people to believe that the Government's direction is the right one. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear the rhetoric of free enterprise being espoused by the Government, but we know that it does not believe it; its heart is not in it; it shows no commitment. We see higher and higher taxes in this country. The Hawke Government is the highest taxing government in Australia's history. Yet still we run further and further into debt; government debt grows higher than ever. We see more and more regulations by the Government in the control of the economy. We see a total lack of action in the area known as micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Where, for instance, are the Government's efforts in tackling the waterfront mess-the huge mess that has been made over many years and that it vowed it would tackle but has failed to do so? We know that the waterfront mess is one of the chief economic difficulties for our exporters and importers and adds significantly to the costs of manufacture and to the cost to the Australian consumer of goods and services. No action is taken because the Government is faced with having to shape up to the trade union movement, its political master. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has failed to take action to privatise organisations such as Qantas Airways. We saw the Government's piddling effort to try to shore up Telecom Australia and other agencies in the telecommunications industry owned by the Government and to ensure that they were put in a monopoly position ahead of any very moderate deregulation that the Government might have contemplated. There has been a total failure to recognise that one of Australia's great opportunities in the future is to develop the telecommunications industry in this part of the world and to become a dominant leader and competitor in that industry. There has been a total failure to recognise the job opportunities for future Australians in that area. While the Government maintains its present stance of taking no action to deregulate the industry, we will see the maintenance of this kind of stultifying approach to industrial development. </PARA>
<PARA> True leadership by this Government would have positive results. It would recognise, for instance, the qualities of the Australian people; it would give encouragement at the proper levels for people to improve their skills; it would provide incentive for them to work harder and also improve themselves; and it would galvanise Australians into striving to improve their education and family circumstances generally. This Government should be saluting individual workers. </PARA>
<PARA> On the contrary, the Government, through its accord with the trade union movement, sends all the wrong messages to individual workers and persons striving to improve their circumstances in this country. There is no incentive for effort. All we are doing through the accord is rewarding people on the same level and not endeavouring to reward excellence. We are not rewarding people who are contributing to a greater extent than others. The system does not encourage people to try harder. That is the resounding failure of the accord and why we have led ourselves into a false dawn of hope about the state of the economy since this Government came to power. </PARA>
<PARA> May I turn to a speech made by Sir Arvi Parbo in Adelaide a week or two ago which highlighted, I think, the very difficult circumstances in which individual Australians find themselves. He spoke about our basic need being for better performance and went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> This includes working harder, but it means more than that. It means improving our skills, removing artificial obstacles to the efficient functioning of the economy and, above all, developing a community attitude which supports and applauds achievement. It means encouraging, not discouraging, the natural desire of individuals to improve themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that that is a most succinct expression of the problem that this country faces and how we can best draw ourselves out of the mire that the Government has brought us to. We need to have individuals seeking to improve themselves. The Government's leadership in that is critical. We need to transform Australia into a performance oriented society, and that requires a major change in our current mentality. Obviously the Government, rather than seeking to lead us out of that mentality, reinforces it through its current economic policies. I quote again from Sir Arvi Parbo's speech:</PARA>
<PARA> Superior performance is not achieved by governments, the industry, the unions or any other part of the machinery; it is achieved by individuals. The advantages we have as a country do not entitle us to anything; on the contrary, they represent an obligation to make full and wise use of these advantages. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the critical issue that the Government fails to grasp. It needs to show leadership to individuals and to take them out of the mire which has been created by the Government's policies. By contrast, key policies will address those problems if they are the kinds of policies that have been adopted by the Liberal and National parties. In the area of industrial relations, we stand for a deregulation of the labour market so as to allow individual enterprises to make arrangements with their employees so that all parties benefit and so that individual workers' earnings can be improved by productivity improvement on the part of the whole firm. </PARA>
<PARA> People should be rewarded for their efforts, for their striving for excellence. That is the policy that this country needs at this time. That policy is supported by the Confederation of Australian Industry, the National Farmers Federation, the Business Council of Australia and many other organisations. We are even seeing in some parts of the trade union movement a glimmer of hope that this will be the kind of policy adopted. Charlie Fitzgibbon, one famous example, is quoted quite often. It is that reward for effort through enterprise arrangements that is the critical key to the development of our future economic policy and turning this country around so that we can start to repay the huge Labor Party debt that will be inherited by the next Howard government-and it sounds as though that will not be too long. That change must occur--</PARA>

Our outlook for the future is positive. Obviously the Government does not have any intention of changing its mode. That has already been stated by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The kind of leadership the Australian work force requires must provide incentives by ensuring that the tax system is fair and must reward effort. We should remember the words of Sir Arvi Parbo which I have just quoted. Our superior performance has to be achieved by individuals. This Government needs to recognise that it is only by individual incentive that we will achieve superior performance. Of course, we know full well that it will not do so because it is locked into its narrow thinking, as it was when it first announced this proposition for the control of real estate in September 1987. It was motivated then by political considerations. Whatever the Government might be going to do with regard to taxation cuts in July of this year, it will again be motivated by political considerations and not by considerations which are of the most fundamental importance to the Australian people. Critical issues need correction in this country, but it looks as though we will have to wait until the election for that to occur. The pressure which Australian families are suffering under this Government will drive the people to vote for change in the months ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen new taxes under this Government: the fringe benefits tax, the capital gains tax, the entertainment tax, the foreign tax credits system, the lump sum superannuation tax, the assets test on pensions, the new and higher company tax rates, the petrol excise which has gone up from 6c a litre to 22c a litre, the wine tax, the intermediate and new oil tax, the gold tax and the graduate tax. There are plenty more. They are the kinds of things this Government is doing to suppress the incentive of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to my basic theme: foreign investment has turned into a dirty word. This Government knows that it has to have foreign investment in whatever form it comes to us from sources overseas just so that we can pay the bills every month. Now it seeks to constrict the amount of investment in particular areas because it has not been able to solve the basic problems of the economy. We will be opposing certain clauses of this Bill and moving several amendments at the committee stage. I urge all honourable senators to support the Opposition's second reading amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not at all sure what Qantas Airways Ltd and Telecom Australia have to do with the Foreign Takeovers Amendment Bill 1988, unless Senator Messner is planning on selling Qantas to Japan Air Lines and Telecom to Nippon Telephone and Telegraph. His enthusiasm for foreign ownership indicates that maybe he will. I certainly have no idea what waterfront industrial relations practices have to do with this legislation either, although Senator Messner seems to think there is some connection, however tenuous. What we are debating is the question of foreign takeovers and, specifically, the foreign takeover of Australia which is, of course, increasing rather than decreasing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill before us makes a number of amendments, in accordance with announcements made over a period of years-in 1985, again in April 1987 and September 1987-that in some areas make it more difficult for foreign investors to purchase Australian assets and resources and in some areas make it a lot simpler; so it will be harder in some areas and easier in others. In any event, the Bill goes only a small part of the way towards assuaging the concerns that many Australians have about the amount of foreign ownership of companies and of land in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> To its very great shame and to the detriment of future generations of Australians, I suggest that this Government is continuing to liberalise the foreign investment guidelines instead of tightening them, as many Australians would like to see happen. Unfortunately, as we have just heard in those parts of Senator Messner's speech which actually touched on the topic this evening, it would appear that there is a considerable amount of bipartisan agreement in this area. The starting point might be different but the end point is the same, that is, encourage as much foreign investment in Australia as possible and never mind the consequences that will inevitably result from selling off the farm and, for that matter, any other bit of Australia that anybody wants to buy. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill continues the trend that we have seen developing over decades in this country, encouraged particularly under Menzies, then Fraser and now the Hawke Labor Government. The legislation seeks to amend the principal Act to exempt from Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) scrutiny companies and businesses where the total assets involved are less than $5m for urban businesses and less than $3m for rural land. If the Opposition is to be believed, under its regime the Foreign Investment Review Board would not have any scrutiny role at all because there would be no Foreign Investment Review Board to look at any purchases under any circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill seeks to amend, as I said, the principal Act to allow the Foreign Investment Review Board to scrutinise only acquisitions by foreign investors in Australian urban real estate. It makes no inroads in respect of the current rash of foreign ownership of Australian rural land or of Australian industries. In spite of the restrictions that have been in operation since they were announced in 1987, the latest FIRB report shows that real estate, rather than manufacturing in the services area, is still the major target for overseas investors, and why not? To them it is a give-away. Australian prices are considerably lower than those in Japan and in many other countries. For those overseas investors, an investment in Australian real estate, whether urban or rural, is petty cash in comparison with what they would have to expend for something similar in their own countries. So we have seen a burgeoning amount of foreign investment in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1987-88, $9.7 billion was invested in real estate, compared with $5.2 billion in manufacturing. This was up considerably from the 1986-87 values of $5.2 billion invested in real estate and $3.9 billion in the manufacturing sector. So more and more Australian real estate continues to be sold to foreign investors, primarily because the Foreign Investment Review Board is approving, willy-nilly, investment proposals for real estate which is commercial or undeveloped and only putting restrictions on foreign residents who buy or wish to buy developed real estate. As the Treasurer (Mr Keating) himself admitted in his second reading speech, while the Bill provides for the notification and examination of foreign purchases of all forms of urban real estate, both commercial and residential, the relatively liberal approach to approvals in cases other than developed residential real estate is to be maintained. If that is not a signal to anybody overseas with any spare cash to come wandering into this country and spend it as if there was no tomorrow, I do not know what is. It is an assurance to foreign investors that the `relatively liberal approach to approvals in cases other than developed residential real estate is to be maintained'. `Come and get it!' is essentially what the Treasurer is saying to residents of other countries who want to buy up Australian property. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats' position on this matter is well known and clear. We will certainly support the Government's amendments to this legislation which aim to prevent foreign investors from buying Australian residential real estate without FIRB approval. We will support this measure because it is long overdue and very necessary. We will support it on the grounds that, although it does not go far enough, it goes some way towards stopping the tragedy that is occurring in this country as we aim to sell off as much as possible to offset our other problems. However, we will be moving amendments in respect of other areas of the legislation. We will be moving to delete the $5m threshold for purchases by foreign persons of urban businesses and the $3m threshold for rural land. We believe that the FIRB ought to scrutinise all foreign investment proposals, not just those above the two amounts in those two areas.</PARA>
<PARA> We will also be moving to establish a public register of foreign corporations which own or control major Australian properties and other assets. If we get the support of the Government or the Opposition in this place, that register will be available for public inspection. I think it is outrageous-and my concern is shared by many ordinary Australians-that the public has no idea of who owns what in this country or to what extent and most of us very much doubt whether even the Government has much idea. The people of Australia simply do not know how much of their country is in foreign hands; how much of Australia has been sold, leased, loaned, mortgaged or simply given away. I think we are entitled to know those details. A register of foreign ownership will begin to give us the answers. The government of the day, whether it is the current Government or some future government with a Liberal leader, may still be able to sell off the farm, since I presume that the major political parties will happily collude on this issue for years to come. But, at least Australians will be aware-and they should be-of how much is sold and who is buying it. </PARA>
<PARA> Concern about the level of foreign ownership is not something on which the Australian Democrats have some sort of monopoly. Concern has also been expressed by the National Party in Queensland and by the Australian Labor Party in Queensland. The Queensland Labor Party has called for a tax on foreigners who own land in Queensland but live overseas. The National Party Government in Queensland introduced the Foreign Ownership of Land Register Bill (Queensland) on 19 October 1988 although, as far as I am aware, that legislation is still not operational. In addition, the Liberal Premier of Tasmania announced in July last year that he, too, would be moving to establish a register of foreign land ownership in Tasmania. I would like the South Australian Government to take a leaf out of the books of these two States since, as those of us who are South Australian residents are aware, the State Government sold off on a lease-back arrangement the Torrens Island power station to foreign investors whose identity is still being concealed by the South Australian Government, despite pressure from within and outside the State Parliament to get some idea of who now owns the major producer and supplier of electricity in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple fact of the matter is that Australians cannot determine what sort of foreign ownership problem exists until a register of foreign investments is established. Only then will we know which Australian assets are controlled by foreign interests and which States, regions and industries have a foreign ownership problem. On this basis, further action can then be taken when necessary to restrict and reduce that foreign ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, the foreign investment history in Australia is one of increasing dependency on that foreign investment. The Menzies Government, the Fraser Government and the Hawke Government have all unquestionably welcomed foreign investment, claiming it to be of automatic benefit to the country-that is, when they are not claiming it has to be done in order to offset some other difficulty that exists here. In the past they have placed minimal restrictions on foreign investment and have made no attempt to compile the sort of public register that we will be moving for. The Hawke Government-contrary, I would have thought, to Labor Party philosophy-has progressively dismantled restrictions on foreign investment since Labor won office in 1983. The current Treasurer has reduced the staff of the Foreign Investment Review Board from 40 to 20 and, as I indicated earlier, the value of foreign investment has more than doubled in the past few years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government maintains that it has been forced to increase the level of foreign investment into Australia because Australia needs foreign currency to meet the massive interest bill on our foreign borrowings. This is something about which Senator Messner had a little to say. It certainly is, or should be, a concern of every Australian that we have a massive interest bill on foreign borrowings. But instead of trying to offset this by encouraging foreigners to buy up what is left of this country, we should be looking at a much longer term solution to that problem. As we all know, foreign investment leads to payments of rents, profits and dividends to the overseas owners. So it is only a partial solution to the problem, even if we assume that it is an acceptable solution, which the Democrats do not. To meet those payments of rent, profits and dividends we have to export more, we have to borrow more in foreign currencies or we have to sell more Australian assets overseas. None of those things is either desirable, certainly in the case of selling overseas, or likely-in the case of increasing exports-because our manufacturing sector is so neanderthal, so unimaginative, that it simply is not moving into increased export markets or import replacement areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Alternatively, we have to take other action to reduce our growing foreign debt. That means recognising what or who is causing that foreign debt and taking action to impede that rather than encouraging it as the current Government, following on from the previous Fraser Government, has done. In June 1977 Australia's total gross external debt was $7.8 billion. By June 1983 it had increased to $35.5 billion. It is now over $120 billion, most of which is owed by the private sector. Those private sector borrowings have been encouraged by previous governments' and this Government's allowance of tax concessions, primarily through the negative gearing system, which has been taken up with considerable enthusiasm by Australian companies to the point where some major companies in this country pay no tax at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Alan Bond commented quite cheerfully to the Australian Financial Review last year that, while he will be paying a little less than a cent in the dollar tax in this financial year, in the next financial year he expects to pay no tax at all-this despite profits in the range of $400m annually. He does this, as other companies do, by borrowing often from overseas and then writing off the interest against the Australian tax commitment. Pensioners are often paying out to the Government 50c in every dollar they earn over a certain amount while some of the wealthiest companies in this country are paying no tax. When that happens, of course, the Australian Taxation Office loses out on revenue. In turn, it slugs the benighted pay as you earn (PAYE) wage earner and struggling small businesses to make up the revenue shortfall. I must say that I think it was extraordinary, given the increasing number of companies that are currently paying less than 10c in the dollar when the nominal tax rate is 49c for companies, that this Government last year, with the support of the Opposition, should have seen fit to cut company tax by 20 per cent and then a few months later say that the economy was not in the sort of condition that would allow PAYE wage and salary earners to get the sort of commensurate tax relief that they so desperately need. The Government ought to be looking at the cause of the problem of the burgeoning foreign debt and not simply looking at increased foreign investment to offset that rocketing foreign indebtedness that is actively encouraged in this country. In the short term this Government's policies will convert our foreign debt problem into a foreign ownership problem. In the long term the earnings on the foreign investment will need to be serviced, as well as the interest payments on our foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA> Of particular concern to many Australians is the impact that these policies are having on their lifestyle and standard of living, particularly as related to ordinary Australian families. Senator Messner argued that there was no empirical evidence to show that house and land prices were being affected in any way at all detrimentally by foreign investment in these areas. Yet we read reports in newspapers of just such attempts being made to purchase Australian real estate at highly inflated prices that will impact on everything else in the market. A Japanese client, according to the Melbourne Herald in November last year, offered the owner of a Toorak apartment in Melbourne $10m, after an earlier offer of $1m had been turned down. It is inevitable, when foreigners are able to offer an inflated price for property, that that will ripple down. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only, as some people would like to have it, Toorak luxury apartments or harbourside homes in Sydney that attract foreign investors. They are looking in the ordinary housing market to buying up blocks of units for highly inflated prices and putting some homes outside the reach of ordinary Australian families. They are doing it, as I said earlier, because housing prices are comparatively cheap in this country to most residents of Japan, Hong Kong or Singapore. It is ironic that there has been this shift in ownership in Australia. Eight or so years ago the Australian National University ran a seminar entitled `Who Runs Australia?'. At that stage people were complaining loudly about the fact that millions of hectares of pastoral land in northern Australia were being bought up by Saudi Arabians and West Germans. It seems that it takes a concerted attempt by the Japanese before people start to get concerned about what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA> Urban land and house prices are not the only areas of concern. Rural real estate is and has been for decades a target for overseas buyers. The impact on our farming sector is evident. More and more people are being forced off the land or placed in a particularly impecunious condition because of rocketing prices and valuations in that area. A few weeks ago the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, attacked my colleague Senator Macklin when Senator Macklin raised the question of payments to children whose families live in isolated areas but who have been means tested out of benefits. Senator Walsh said, `Well, anybody who is on a property valued at $600,000 and can't make a go of it should get off that property'. The fact is that frequently there are not buyers for that property. The valuation is up only because some investor from outside this country has paid a highly inflated price for a neighbouring property but is not necessarily prepared to buy the next door property, even if those concerned are prepared to sell. </PARA>
<PARA> It is ridiculous that Australian rural real estate purchases under $3m will be exempt from Foreign Investment Review Board surveillance, that is, unless the Democrats' amendment is successful. I certainly hope that my National Party colleagues in this place will consider quite seriously the impact of this legislation and the Government's proposals on their constituents. The President of the National Farmers Federation, John Allwright, has written to the Treasurer, to the Australian Democrats and, I would hope, to National, Liberal and Labor Party senators in this place expressing concern about just this matter. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> The National Farmers' Federation considers that the foreign takeovers legislation should require foreign investment in land (and possibly selected other assets) to be notified to the FIRB. In addition, steps may need to be taken to strengthen the FIRB's powers to ensure that a requirement to notify is effective and enforceable. </PARA>
<PARA> The requirements to notify land purchases would substantially alleviate fears in many rural industries, especially the Queensland cattle industry, that the rate of foreign purchase is excessive and out of control. In some areas, the concern over foreign ownership is reaching a highly emotional level. </PARA>
<PARA>That was certainly exhibited on a 60 Minutes program the other night. Mr Allwright went on:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . urge the Government's consideration of changes to the foreign takeovers legislation to require notification of foreign land purchases to the FIRB or other competent authority. </PARA>
<PARA>Tourism is another area in which foreign investment is burgeoning, again particularly in Queensland. It is not surprising, therefore, that people are very concerned about the fact that between 1986 and 1987 the level of investment in Australia's tourism increased from $440m to $1,800m-all of which was assisted by the fact that the FIRB rules on tourist developments such as hotels and motels amount to little more than open slather on foreign investment in that area. The issue was recently pinpointed by Dr Adrian Bull, a lecturer in tourism at the Queensland Agricultural College, who noted:</PARA>
<PARA>Foreign investment in tourism should be stringently controlled so that the financial benefit does not simply flow back to the visitor's own country. </PARA>
<PARA>What is happening is that golf courses, tourist resorts and so on are being purchased for access use by Japanese tourists. They are purchased by Japanese, they are for use by Japanese, and the money turns round and goes back to the Japanese and is of little benefit to the Australian people as a whole. Dr Bull pointed out that soon Australia will be in a similar position to Spain. That country receives as little as $31 for every $100 spent by tourists on a holiday in Spain. Yet, he points out, it could have been as high as $85 out of every $100 had the facilities been Spanish-owned instead of owned by other western European countries, the source of the tourists spending their holidays in Spain. </PARA>
<PARA> Even when some restrictions exist, however, there is no guarantee that very much will be done, due primarily to the fact, as I said earlier, that the FIRB has been downgraded. Its staff, as I said a moment ago, has been virtually halved and a ceiling has been imposed on its staff members. Since its establishment in 1976, the FIRB has managed only one prosecution under the Foreign Takeovers Act, and even that was unsuccessful. I am not being critical of the FIRB and its staff. They act in an advisory capacity only and if the Government-and that means the Treasurer-does not want to act, there is not a great deal that the FIRB can do about it. </PARA>
<PARA> On 28 July 1986 the Hawke Government decided that it ought to do something about the situation, however minimal its actions were to be. It decided that foreign purchases of real estate for development, both residential and commercial, would be approved-unless judged contrary to the national interest. I ask you! I would have thought that any Australian government would have been much more concerned about seeing that approval was given to a development by a foreign national only if it could be shown that that development was in the national interest, rather than the negative of its being contrary to the national interest. Given that there has been only one prosecution under the Foreign Takeovers Act, I expect that it will be highly unlikely that any proposal will ever be judged contrary to the national interest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Foreign Takeovers Amendment Bill amends the Foreign Takeovers Act to give legislative effect to changes to foreign investment policy announced by the Government in 1985 and 1987. The Opposition, as Senator Messner has said, does not oppose the Bill, although we will move several amendments at the committee stage. To the motion for the second reading, we have already moved the following amendment:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate condemns the Government for its failed economic policies which have resulted in:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Australia's increasing dependence on foreign investment;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a continuing balance of payments crisis and associated foreign debt problems;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) high domestic interest rates adversely affecting all Australians; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) record levels of taxation which are heavily biased against the ability of Australians to save''. </PARA>
<PARA>I will come back to the amendment a little later. </PARA>
<PARA> The main purposes of the Bill are to prevent foreigners from buying Australian urban real estate without approval; to strengthen the penalty and enforcement provisions of the Foreign Takeovers Act; to exempt from the provisions of the Act the acquisition by foreign persons of mineral exploration rights; to increase to $5m and, in the case of rural businesses, $3m the value below which proposals by foreigners to buy Australian businesses are exempt from examination; to increase from $3m to $20m the threshold above which foreigner to foreigner takeovers are subject to the Act; and to amend the Act to provide a changed definition of foreign person that takes account of trusts. By far the most important of these proposals is the first, that is, to bring the acquisition of urban real estate within the scope of the Foreign Takeovers Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Several things should be said at the outset about this Bill. Firstly, the Bill is a classic example of this Government's total disregard for the Parliament and for the proprieties of legislative practice. The Bill has not been lying around for a long time; it was introduced into the House of Representatives in November last year. It gives legislative effect to changes to foreign investment policy announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on 29 October 1985, 30 April 1987 and 29 September 1987. In other words, the Bill should have been brought to the Parliament more than three years ago, as soon as the first of the policy announcements were made. </PARA>
<PARA> Even the latest of the policy announcements, the one in September 1987, came out more than one year before the Bill was first introduced. That September 1987 decision was an economically stupid and cynically opportunistic decision. As we all know, the decision was taken by the Australian Labor Party in the forlorn hope of saving poor old Barrie Unsworth in New South Wales. That would have to be the classic example of mateship, the Right helping the Right, regardless of the impact it would have on all other Australians. It did not succeed. Barrie Unsworth went the way of all such Premiers and all such discarded governments. Nevertheless, that was the reason for that key decision which is now the main element of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for the taking of the decision was a disgraceful one, particularly in view of the enormous delay in bringing the matter to Parliament for the necessary legislative validation. No clearer indication could we have of the contempt with which the Hawke Government holds the Parliament and, therefore, the Australian people. Legislation by press release, which is what the actions of the Government over the past three years in this respect virtually amount to, is undemocratic. It is a denial of basic parliamentary procedures. It is the action of an arrogant and out of touch Executive and it is something to which the Senate, through its Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, has drawn attention. All of us in the Senate, on both sides of the chamber, have drawn attention to the problem for years now, yet the situation has not improved. It gets worse day by day. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only is the Bill being brought to the Parliament three years late: it is also a very silly Bill, at least in respect of its main provision which deals with the acquisition by foreigners of urban real estate. The provision is very badly flawed. It is based on thoroughly bad economics. Over the past six years we have had many examples of just how little grasp of basic economic concepts Mr Keating really has. By and large, he has managed to cover up those deficiencies with a mixture of hype, public relations good luck and a bullying of both the media and the business sector. But those tactics can only get someone through for so long, and they no longer work for this Treasurer. No longer do the media hold the Treasurer in respect. They have seen through him. They have at last recognised that, whilst the Treasurer won a journalistic award for economic management earlier in his stewardship, he won it at a time when even blind Freddy could have done the same. When put more to the test, though, the Treasurer failed lamentably to manage the economy effectively. No wonder that only a year after he won his best Treasurer award, he was judged by the same judges as the world's second worst Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to clamp down on foreign purchases or urban real estate was said by the Treasurer to have been taken because such purchases were pushing up the prices of houses in Australia and therefore making it more difficult as well as more costly for people to buy homes. In other words, the Treasurer alleged that foreign purchasers of homes in places like Sydney, the Gold Coast and elsewhere increased their prices and also acted to reduce the stock of housing. The Treasurer produced no evidence whatsoever to support his claim with respect to the cost of housing. The assertion is hotly disputed and denied by experts in the real estate industry. Leading figures in the real estate industry have made many statements refuting the Treasurer's claims in this regard. I will mention just two of them. Mr Neil Collins, the Managing Director of Richardson and Wrench, one of the largest real estate firms in Australia, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . overseas investors have been buying only a very small percentage of the market and while there have been some spectacular purchases these investors were not major players in the market. I think it will make very little difference to the market. </PARA>
<PARA>The President of the Real Estate Institute of New South Wales, Mr Robert Bevan, said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a decision taken for purely political reasons to support the fallacious argument that foreign investors in the $1m plus residential market are making it hard for first-home buyers in the $80,000 to $90,000 market. If there were any way the REI could be convinced that stopping foreigners from buying into the upper end residential market would stop the price spiral in the mid to lower end residential market we would applaud the Government's move. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said, the fact is that the Treasurer has produced no evidence whatsoever to support the assertion that the foreign buying of urban houses has pushed up prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer's argument that foreign purchasers reduce the stock of available housing is quite the opposite of the truth. The Treasurer appears to assume that foreigners can add to the stock of housing only if they build new houses. That argument ignores the fact that funds are freed up for Australians when they sell to foreigners. Some of those funds will be used by Australians to build new houses; the remainder will either be consumed or saved and, therefore, invested by others who may also build new houses. In other words, the Treasurer's economic argument is totally wrong. Indeed, in the longer term, his ban on foreign investment in urban real estate will reduce the stock of housing, not increase it. That, in turn, will lead to higher prices and higher rents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer made these wild statements in his second reading speech on 9 November 1988. He was also associated with other statements at that time. Although the new policy has been in force since September 1987, the action taken then did not push down the price of houses. On the contrary, the price rose massively in the year after the decision was taken. If we were honest about it, we would all know that the real causes of high home prices do not lie with foreign buyers; they lie entirely with the Government and its wretched failed economic policies. The economic mismanagement of the Hawke-Keating Government and the blind arrogance and intransigence of the Treasurer have led to huge increases in the costs of construction of new homes and in the cost of home loans. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why Senator Messner, on behalf of the Opposition, has moved a second reading amendment condemning the Government for its failed economic policies. Those policies have caused hardship for every Australian. But, above all, they have crippled young married couples seeking to buy, or to retain possession of, their first home. The burden on young single income families with children is totally overwhelming. </PARA>
<PARA> When this Government came to office in 1983, monthly repayments on an average home were of the order of $385. Today, that figure has nearly doubled. How can any young couple afford such a staggering increase? That is not the end of the story, by any means. In addition to huge loan repayment increases, there have been equally staggering tax increases. Some people would argue that the actual monthly repayment on a loan does not necessarily increase with an increase in interest rates, because the banks, or the lending institutions, simply extend the time of the loan for repayment or take other measures to ease that immediate burden. That is what is happening in many instances. However, that does not, in any way, rebut the argument that the cost burden on families repaying loans on home mortgages increases as a result of interest rate increases. Of course, the demand for housing, the cost of building new houses and other factors also push up the price of housing, thereby increasing the size of the loan which is required. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the huge loan repayment increases, there have been equally staggering tax increases. The average income earner today would need a tax cut of $251 a month simply to be in the same after tax position as he was in 1983 when this Government came to office. It is no wonder the electorate is crying with financial pain; no wonder it is crying for a change of government. The average income earners in this country, and particularly the average family with young children, are facing financial stringencies which are unprecedented in the lifetimes of most of us. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many popular misconceptions about the role and nature of foreign investment in Australia. The debate about foreign investment which is taking place in this country today worries me in several important respects. That debate is increasingly ringing with xenophobic and jingoistic views which we must be very careful not to foster. We heard some of these misconceptions, par excellence, from Senator Haines, before the suspension of the sitting for dinner. No doubt we will hear more from other Australian Democrat speakers this evening. Foreign investment in Australia supplements our own domestic savings. It adds to our resources and, therefore, it enables us to grow at a faster rate than would otherwise be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has relied throughout its history, and particularly in the post-Second World War era, on the inflow of foreign capital to provide us with additional resources. There is no doubt that we will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. There is nothing wrong with that in principle. I was very concerned to hear Senator Haines express, in her remarks before dinner, the view that we had to have a register of foreign assets and land holdings in Australia. She said that until we got such a register we would not know the extent of foreign ownership by industry and by region and, therefore, we would not know the extent of what she described as the problem and what we need to do about it. Inherent in her whole approach is an argument that, somehow or other, foreign investment is bad for us. If I am misinterpreting Senator Haines, I hope that Senator Powell will say something to set me right. It appeared to me that that was the whole thrust of Senator Haines's remarks. I believe that that is a totally negative, destructive and economically wrong approach and method of looking at the whole question of foreign investment. It demonstrates to me a complete lack of understanding of the subject-a misunderstanding which is of concern to any of us, but it is of even more concern coming from the economic spokesman or representative of a party in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Powell says we do not have a register, but she does not distinguish at all between debt, on the one hand, and equity on the other. The honourable senator wants a register for the assets which are owned in Australia. Therefore, on the one hand she is talking about equity, but on the other hand she is complaining about the cost to the economy of the money borrowed from overseas. She is all over the place on the subject. I wish she would get her facts and her concepts right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The sheer size of the inflow is, of course, a function of the huge deficit in our balance of payments on current account. That totally unacceptable deficit is very much the fault of the policies of this Government. It is salutary to note in this connection that the deficit would be very much larger if there had not been the extraordinary and largely unexpected buoyancy of commodity prices on international markets over the past year or so. Indeed, this buoyancy has resulted in Australia's terms of trade now being more favourable than they have been for at least two decades. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it not strange that we do not hear much from the Government about this major improvement in the terms of trade? Why do we not hear about it? It is because this Government put all the blame for our economic difficulties in 1985 and 1986 on a fall in the terms of trade that we suffered at that time-a fall, I would point out, that was not as large as the fall experienced in the late 1970s under the Fraser Government, which caused problems but which was ridden out very successfully by the responsible economic policies of the Fraser Government. There was a significant fall in our terms of trade in 1985-86. The Government placed all the blame for our economic problems at that time on that. That was largely a fallacy. Our problems were not simply induced by the terms of trade. However, if logic were to play any part in the Treasurer's armoury, he should be saying now that the big improvement in our terms of trade has led to an easing of our economic problems. Why is he not saying that? He is not saying it because our problems are increasing despite the terms of trade improvement. </PARA>
<PARA> The concern about the size of the current inflow is related to the large debt component within the total inflow. Debt has to be repaid in the end, and in the interim interest has to be paid year by year on the capital outstanding. The interest burden on our foreign debt is now a matter of very great concern. Interest payments alone-we should forget about repayments of any of the capital-amount to something like one-fifth of all our earnings in the form of exports of goods and services. That is a huge burden at any time and it takes a great chunk out of the benefits that we derive from our export performance-a performance which, despite the increase to record levels in our terms of trade, is volumeless in terms of increase. The increase in our exports is coming from price increases, not from volume. That in itself is a major problem, but it is a somewhat separate issue. When export prices weaken-and it is a matter of when, not if-the interest bill will pose very grave problems for our economy. That is not an argument against foreign investment per se; indeed, to put up the shutters against foreign investment would be catastrophic to our standard of living. It would make the 1930s look like chicken feed. We need to pursue policies which will over time reduce the degree of our dependence on foreign investment for the maintenance of our living standards. We need a broadly based policy approach in many areas at both the macro- and the micro-economic level. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's failure to adopt appropriate fiscal and wages policies has cost Australia very dearly. The present direction of policy in both these areas must be reversed as a matter of the greatest urgency. On the wages front the Australian Council of Trade Unions deal of a $20 tax cut and a $30 wage increase per week is, I believe, a recipe for unmitigated disaster. It represents an increase in average real wages of more than 10 per cent. It is not even linked to guarantee productivity increases, yet low productivity gains have been the underlying reason for our internationally uncompetitive economic performance for decades now, and the reason why we are slipping rapidly through the international ranks in terms of our per capita standard of living. It is nothing short of economic criminality for the Government to contemplate supporting an increase of this magnitude at this time. Indeed, I believe that there are more cogent reasons for arguing against any tax cut or wage increase at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> I make two points in passing on the so-called wage tax cut trade-off. The first is that it is no trade-off. The two are additive; one is not a substitute for the other. The second point I make is that a tax cut of the size proposed would go nowhere near returning to taxpayers the taxes that have been ripped off them through bracket creep in the last six years. There would need to be a cut of something like $58 per week, not $20, to achieve that. On the micro-economic front, the Government continues to fiddle while Australia burns. The industrial relations situation continues to deteriorate and the waterfront and the shipping industries continue to suffer from gross overmanning, restrictive work practices and other impediments to improved efficiency. The Government has failed singularly to take the necessary steps either to privatise its business undertakings or to make them more competitive and efficient. The list is endless. These are the tasks that we must undertake if we are going to restore Australia's fortunes and our living standards. The Bill before the Senate does none of these. In my view it displays a negative and restrictive mentality. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, I urge all honourable senators to exercise our maximum responsibility as politicians-and I make the same comment for others in the community-to ensure that we do not get into the area of xenophobic, jingoistic mud-slinging about foreign investment in this country, because if we do we will get ourselves into some very sticky waters indeed. The concern that is being voiced in the community today about foreign investment is a great echo in my memory of the debates and the concerns that were expressed against American investment in the 1950s and 1960s. We were concerned at that time that American investment was going to gobble us up. We went through some very difficult periods in those days before we got a rational view and a rational debate on the whole question of foreign investment. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the fact that the assertions are wrong, I fear that there is an attack coming on Japanese investment in Australia. That is what it is about. If we go down the path of saying that there is something bad about the current level of investment in Australia because it is Japanese-and that is the connotation that many people will place on it-we will do ourselves a very grave disservice. Japan is our largest trading partner. Our fortunes are inextricably linked with the fortunes of Japan and it is of the greatest importance that in our approach, which needs to be responsible, autonomous and in our self-interest, we must take very careful account of the need to cooperate and work with Japan and not to give the Japanese or other people in this world any opportunity to say to us that we are being racist in our approach to foreign investment. If we do not watch that very carefully we will have a problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I am not suggesting that this Bill is necessarily of that nature, there are very heavy overtones of it. The argument in the community has been that the main purchasers of urban real estate have come from Japan. That is not entirely correct, but that is the public perception. Therefore, one can argue that, because the main provision in this Bill is directed at imposing a major clamp on foreign investment in urban real estate, it is directed against Japanese investment in this country. I caution the Senate very strongly indeed about going down that road. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My remarks will be directed in large measure to supporting amendments which will be moved in the committee stage by Senator Haines, who is leading for the Australian Democrats in this debate on the Foreign Takeovers Amendment Bill 1988. I will begin my contribution by commenting on the final remarks of Senator Short. His caution that any debate about questions of foreign investment and foreign ownership on this country should not be seen in any way to have any racist or other overtones is to be endorsed. This country has a history of waves of investment coming from those economies that are strong in the overall world picture. Initially, British investment came very much with our original British heritage, and Senator Short referred specifically to the period of strong investment from the United States of America. Following that there were the oil sheikhs. A problem was beginning to emerge with that and there was some concern, but the oil prices then went down and that problem disappeared. At the moment there is concern, and I reiterate that that concern has been about before as those waves of investment, and particularly ownership, came upon this economy. The fact that it now focuses to a very large extent, although not exclusively, on Japanese investment is a reflection of the strength of the Japanese economy on the world scene. It is a reflection of the currency difference between our two countries and of the availability of sources of investment in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrats will be moving a number of amendments, among them an amendment to set up a register-which again Senator Short has referred to-and an amendment to remove the $3m limit which currently is required before purchases of rural real estate can be made. In a sense, those two amendments are complementary. I want to address the question of whether the setting up of a register is a useful thing to do. I reiterate that this has been a policy of the Australian Democrats since the early 1980s. We had a national conference in 1982 and we included that in our policy as rural people were concerned that large tracts of land had been in the past and were continuing to be purchased by overseas interests-not at that time specifically Japanese interests. This is not a new thing for the Australian Democrats; it is a longstanding policy. We have chosen to move an amendment to this Bill to try to implement that longstanding policy. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent times it has often been suggested that, if we could set up such a register, a great deal of the heat would go out of this debate. A great deal of the suspicion, and even the concern, that this might be seen as some kind of racist exercise would also go out of the debate because people would be operating from the point of view of real information and not just from the point of view of public perception. I heard Senator Short use that phrase at least twice. Our problem is partly one of public perception. We are dependent upon adhockery to find out the nature of investment, where it is, and the level of that investment. That is really our concern. The Democrats are not saying that foreign investment and foreign ownership per se are bad. We are saying that the nature and the level of that investment or ownership may be bad and that we need a register to show exactly what is happening so that we and other concerned people and decision-makers in our community can make decisions about that. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not saying this on our own. We do not stand condemned, as Senator Short would have us, as people who really do not understand what is going on in the economic world. The National Party Government in Queensland has put up legislation, although, as Senator Haines said, we understand that that legislation is not yet operative. That Party's colleagues in the Australian Labor Party in Queensland also have such a recommendation in their policy, and so has the Tasmanian Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that we are seeing a great degree of multipartisan support, except here in the Federal Parliament. My National Party colleagues are not in the chamber tonight, nor are they entering into this debate. I looked down a speakers list of some 10 or 12 people and did not see a single National Party senator on it. I suspect that there is a reason for that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It might be convenient for him to be away tonight and not to have to persuade one of his colleagues to stand in his place. I suspect that members of the National Party are having grave problems with the fact that they have not been able to carry the day and convince the coalition of the necessity of our amendments to set up a register, which their colleagues in Queensland are going to do, to remove the limits so that we will really know what is happening with rural land and so that people will not be able to buy little parcels of land, under $3m at a time, and build up their investment without accounting to the Australian community. National Party senators have a few problems with that, similar to the problems that they are having within the coalition on the upcoming legislation on wheat marketing, where once again it appears as though the coalition will walk away from its rural constituency, which I think by now will have come to realise that it has had the wool pulled over its eyes for some years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said, there seems to be some multipartisan support around the country, although not in this Parliament, for the establishment of a register and for a closer supervision of what is going on. I can go no further for a pretty comprehensive run-down of other areas of support for the rural industry outside the political scene than an article in last Wednesday's Melbourne Age which demonstrates the attitudes of various groups that I consider would normally be looking to the National Party and to the coalition for some support in this place. These groups include: the United Graziers Association, the Cattle Council, the Victorian Farmers Federation and the Cattlemen's Union. I wish to put on the record what some of these groups are saying, which is very much what the Democrats are saying. I think the concern of these organisations relates to what is clearly developing in this area of foreign investment and ownership-that is, the development of vertical integration, particularly in the beef industry. We know it is happening in the beef industry. It has become quite obvious because of the high levels of investment and the very obvious nature of that investment. It is not an investment that is easy to disguise. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this month the Cattlemen's Union called for a total freeze on all Japanese investment in the beef industry until the impact on Australia's long term interests had been assessed. We have talked in this debate about selling off the farm. The message in this article in the Age by David Porter is this:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . cattlemen do not intend to sit around the camp fire while foreign investors rustle the family herd from under their feet. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, they are not prepared to do so. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The union's executive director, Mr Shaun Coffey says: `I think the community generally is expressing two fears. Firstly, that the industry could be overrun and we could lose control. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the honourable senators to notice the qualification `could'. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, that the Australian Government is not scrutinising closely enough what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the very point that the Australian Democrats have been making these past eight years. The article goes on to state that there is a perception that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government's review process needs to be more open, that more information needs to be made public on the level of foreign interests and where foreign investment is directed. Such openness, he says, would allay the unnecessary `suspicion and alarm'-</PARA>
<PARA>that same suspicion and alarm that Senator Short was warning against-</PARA>
<PARA>that has spread through the cattle industry. </PARA>
<PARA>That suspicion and alarm have spread through a number of other industries, in particular the tourist industry, which has been mentioned already in this debate. Again, this suspicion and alarm is based on a lack of information. All that the Democrats are saying in our relevant amendment to establish a register is, `Let us get rid of that uncertainty and that ignorance about what is happening and then let us have the debate'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Cattlemen's Union has called for a moratorium. It says that it believes it is warranted until foreign investment guidelines are tightened. That is perhaps one of the toughest stands. The United Graziers Association has pointed out, as did Senator Short, that Japan generally has been a good trading partner. It, however, favours a return or the 51 per cent Australian equity criteria for abattoirs and feedlot purchases with one-third local equity rules applying at the farm level. It believes that property purchases of $1m or more should be assessed by the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB), as should abattoirs for purchases in excess of $5m. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, that is the sort of thing that the Australian Democrats are saying clearly. Even the United Graziers Association, which is very concerned to stress the good relationship with the Japanese, is worried that $3m as the benchmark for rural purchase is too high. As I said, there is no control or review over any purchases that are smaller than that. It is clearly a simple matter to break up the purchases into smaller parcels. The Cattle Council of Australia is similarly concerned. It is concerned particularly that the fears of the meat industry should not be interpreted as populist, anti-Japanese sentiment resulting from the lingering wartime resentment. We should realise that these organisations, the industry itself and anyone else in the community who is concerned run the risk of being labelled racist. I again stress that for the Democrats, as for the rational people in this debate, including the Cattle Council, it is important that it is seen as a debate about what has been a wave process throughout our history. It is one which from time to time in the past has caused concern. It is doing so equally now. </PARA>
<PARA> Michael Prendergast, the Cattle Council's Acting Director, pointed to the emotionalism in the debate. He also said that he could understand it being there and that it does not help. He said that the Cattle Council, like the United Graziers Association, wants to see an FIRB with more teeth and believes that an industry impact statement should accompany each proposal. The Council is so concerned to keep Australian interests at a very high level that it is interested in supporting foreign investments in the form of joint ventures. The Victorian Farmers Federation pastoral group's spokesman, Mr Kevin Shiell, said this:</PARA>
<PARA> Many of the concerns about foreign ownership in the meat industry have arisen because nobody really knows how much there is. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a need for a register so that we do know. </PARA>
<PARA> The Foreign Investment Review Board is strongly supported in all of those comments. Groups are urging that it be stronger and that its requirements be stricter. At the moment that is the real part of the problem. There is no mechanism for the FIRB to deal with anyone who, as I said, accumulates small blocks of land below the $3m cut-off for rural land, $5m in business takeovers or $10m in new businesses. In addition-this has been mentioned by Senator Haines-Budget cuts have forced the FIRB to shed staff. As Senator Haines also mentioned, the constituency should realise that in this debate the Federal Opposition wants to remove it altogether. I am not sure which is worse-the sort of attrition process which it is undergoing at the hands of the Government or the absolute abolition which it would undergo at the hands of the alternative Government. Certainly none of those organisations from whom I have quoted can take much comfort out of either process. </PARA>
<PARA> It is certainly a concern in the meat industry because of vertical integration-the purchase of land, the purchase of feedlots, the purchase of abattoirs. Although the liberalisation of the Japanese domestic meat market holds great promise for new opportunities and large profits, if we can meet the demand, there is that question of what happens. Money is certainly coming in but it is not buying Australian goods. It is buying the Australian means of production of goods. This type of vertical integration can lead-Senator Haines has given examples of the tourist industry in Spain-to Australia being placed back into the colonial stage that we were in earlier in our history when profits and products were expatriated. That cannot be seen to be in our best economic interests unless it is well handled, unless we have the fullest information and unless we are looking for the best interests of this country and not being blinded by the volumes of moneys that are coming in and not worrying about where it is going or what it is doing. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear a lot from both sides of this chamber-from the conservative Government and the conservative Opposition-about levelling the playing field. We need to realise that Australian producers are still denied access to Japan's lucrative domestic meat retail sector. So we are not operating on a level playing field. This morning in the Australian the Cattlemen's Union came out with a much more detailed statement. It is worth putting that on the record. It has given the matter more thought even in the last week and has called for guidelines for the scrutiny of foreign investment in the future. A register, such as we are proposing in our amendments, would go a long way towards that. It wants the statutory meat authorities to determine first of all whether an industry benefit analysis is needed. If, then, it believes that it is needed, an economic impact study should be commissioned by the FIRB. That will be difficult if members of the Cattlemen's Union and its rural compatriots vote in a coalition government at the next election because there will not be an FIRB. The Cattlemen's Union says that such a study should consider:</PARA>
<PARA>The ability of the investor to reduce Australian income by transfer pricing . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate that the Democrats have long stood up in this chamber against the process of transfer pricing and very little has happened. The Cattlemen's Union says the study should also consider the ability of the investor to reduce Australian income:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . by collusive bidding or tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA>It should also consider the threat of monopoly power developing. This is a major concern in vertical integration. When we are dealing with a trading partner whose own market is not totally open to us, as the Japanese retail meat sector is not, it is a problem. The third point the Cattlemen's Union makes is the potential for Australian interests to be excluded. We cannot determine that unless we have a register so that we know the exact level and nature of the investment. It is very encouraging to see that the Cattlemen's Union went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The union felt the study should also include aspects such as the introduction of new technology, job creation and export market access. </PARA>
<PARA>This kind of in depth review before major investment takes place certainly has the support of the Australian Democrats. But again, Mr Coffey concluded by assuring those who were interested in this issue that the Cattlemen's Union is not, per se, opposed to foreign investment in the beef industry. All it is really saying is that it must be in the best interests of the Australian beef industry and, therefore, of the Australian nation as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that the amendments which we will move, particularly the ones that will remove the $3m limit on the FIRB's review of the purchase of rural properties and set up a register, deserve support, if only to take some of the heat and emotionalism out of the debate. When the next wave takes place this country will be in a position to know what is happening, will be in control and will not go to short term solutions, as we so often do, but will be able to look at long term solutions. The Australian Democrats believe that this Government-this Opposition seems happy with it-is really replacing the foreign debt problem with a foreign ownership problem. It will pass on to future generations the need to deal with situations where significant industries in this country are expatriating their profits overseas. The only benefit we could possibly get out of it might be some minimal employment which could probably be generated by other means and by more balanced investment. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge honourable senators, particularly those who are concerned about the rural industry and rural communities generally, to support the Democrats' amendments. I place it on the record that the Democrats will support the Opposition's second reading amendment. I am sure that each of the complaints which the Opposition has in that amendment about the Government's economic policy is a complaint for quite a different reason from our point of view than it is from the point of view of the coalition parties. Nevertheless, we have those complaints and we will support the amendment. Paragraph (c) of the Opposition's amendment talks about high domestic interest rates adversely affecting all Australians and paragraph (d) talks about the ability of Australians to save. I draw the Opposition's attention to the private member's Bills which are designed to address the problems of home owners in this country. The Bills which Senator Haines introduced last week deal with issues which the Opposition's Treasury spokesperson, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), seems to be attempting to grapple with. I urge my Opposition colleagues to support not only our amendments to this legislation but also those Bills which will address some of the economic concerns which are expressed in its second reading amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Foreign Takeovers Amendment Bill 1988 is a very important piece of legislation. I have just re-read the second reading speech of the Treasurer (Mr Keating). One comment on page 4 is of particular interest to me and to tonight's debate. At page 4 the Minister actually laid down the challenge by saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill will provide the Opposition with an opportunity to clarify its position on these issues. </PARA>
<PARA>Already two Opposition speakers have spoken to the Bill tonight but so far, unfortunately, the challenge has not been taken up. According to the speakers list, Senator Parer will speak very soon, followed by Senator Lewis and Senator Archer. I remind each of those honourable senators of that challenge. Where does the Opposition stand in terms of foreign takeovers of Australian resources, be they minerals, mines, houses, shops or whatever? Where do the Liberal and National parties stand as political parties? I remind honourable senators opposite that there is more to being in opposition or being a representative in parliament than continually knocking or continually using every piece of legislation or every debate in this chamber for union bashing, which is what we have heard from two of the previous Opposition speakers. They have used the debate on the Foreign Takeovers Amendment Bill to attack the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) claim for a wages-taxes trade-off. I dare say that other Opposition speakers will follow that through. Not only did that not add anything to this very important debate but it proved, yet again, that honourable senators opposite honestly do not know what they are talking about, whatever the subject matter, whether it be foreign takeovers, wages or taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> The challenge is in front of the Opposition. I invite it to put up a coherent, rational alternative that the people of Australia can understand, one that can stand comparison with what the Government is doing. I note that some previous speakers, particularly Senator Short, said that the $50 ACTU wages-taxes claim was something which the country could not stand. Sections in the Government also believe that. Healthy debate on that is taking place not only within the Government but within the community. It is taking place in a controlled, rational and reasonable fashion as distinct from the confrontationist tactics that we witnessed under the previous Government led by Mr Fraser and Mr Howard. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has not scored any points in recent times by union bashing. Why does it not learn from its mistakes? How many elections in a row has it lost at State and Federal levels? We heard some talk about the New South Wales election, but honourable senators opposite failed to mention the Western Australian election, the Victorian election and the last Federal election. Let us get things in proportion and not deal with only one election. Of course, the important one for each and every one of us here is the next election, whenever it will be held. That election ought to be fought on policy issues. One of those crucial policy issues ought to be taxation. Why does the Opposition not bring out its policy and tell us what it is about? Why does it not bring out one policy?</PARA>

<PARA> In closing his comments, Senator Short made a very important announcement, which I agree with, concerning Japanese investment. One of the things happening in the Australian community is that the fear of Japanese investment in Australia has been beaten up into a torrent. Lots of people are becoming extremely scared about the impact that Japanese investment will have on Australia, both in the short term and in the long term. If people have a fear it ought not to be about Japanese investment. It should perhaps be about foreign investment or whatever controls a government exercises over foreign investment. It should not be turned into a racist debate. Unfortunately, if it is I am afraid the finger will again have to be pointed at those sitting on the Opposition benches. It was Opposition members who polarised our community last year on the migration debate. If there are any costs to Australia from this anti-Japanese sentiment that is around at the moment in Australia-small though it may be-the finger will be pointed directly at those on the Opposition benches.

I did not intend to speak for this long and I will wind up shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently I was involved in a foreign takeover of a small fish processing plant in Geraldton in the mid-west of Western Australia by a Japanese company. The company which was taken over by the Japanese company was owned by British interests. I must make the point very clearly that, despite my accent, I did not become involved and do things merely because there was some British involvement in the takeover. I did so because there was great fear among the fishing community and local residents not only within Geraldton but right along the west coast of Western Australia. I am sure that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, became aware of that as well. There was a genuine fear by those people of the impact on their industry if Japanese interests were able to gain a major influence-not a controlling influence-over that very important industry to Western Australia and Australia as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, that fear was beaten up in the heat of the Western Australian State election held early last month. The fear was beaten up, unfortunately, and played on by people who had an interest in making political capital out of it. Thankfully, the matter was resolved amicably. What could have turned out to be a big hate campaign did not happen because the industry itself took a very sensible and rational approach to the problem. Industry representatives sat down and researched what possible impacts the Japanese takeover could have on their industry. They put their research on paper and brought it here directly to the Treasurer, Paul Keating. They met with him for a considerable period and put their arguments to him. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer listened to those arguments. He heard them out. He was not forced into making a decision prior to the Western Australian election merely for the sake of political expediency, which some people tried to get us to do. He did not make a decision in the heat of an election campaign. He certainly heard the people in the week prior to the election but he would not and did not make a decision until afterwards. When he did make a decision, the decision was favourable to the industry because it rejected the foreign takeover of a British-owned company operating within Geraldton in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, this is a very important Bill that we are debating tonight. I had not intended to speak for as long as I have. However, I was somewhat baited into doing so-perhaps that is a comment I could have made in my recent remarks about the fishing industry. The people of Australia need to understand a lot more about this important matter. There is an obligation, not only on the Government, but also on the Opposition parties, including the Australian Democrats, to explain to the people of Australia as clearly, calmly and succinctly as possible how the foreign money that is coming into Australia is impacting on us. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody, including honourable senators opposite, would say that we do not need foreign investment in Australia. Even honourable senators opposite would agree that there have to be some measures of control over foreign investment. In this legislation we are relaxing those controls in certain areas and tightening them in other areas. That is an indication of the flexibility this Government is showing in dealing with the economic problems that beset Australia as a developed nation approaching the twenty-first century. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is commendable. We will look with interest at the amendments that will be put forward by the Australian Democrats. Hopefully, the level of debate will improve. As I said, the challenge is before Senator Parer. He is now presented with an opportunity to clarify his position and his Party's position on this most important issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Foreign Takeovers Amendment Bill 1988. I commend Senator McKiernan for getting to his feet. According to the list of speakers, he is the only person from the other side of the chamber who will participate in the debate on what he considers to be a most important Bill. I can only presume, in view of the absence of his colleagues, that he is the only honourable senator opposite who believes that it is an important Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill has two purposes. The first is to relax some restrictions on foreign investment; the second is to tighten up other restrictions. The Bill seeks to tighten restrictions on the purchase of urban real estate by foreigners. Senator McKiernan went to great lengths, tongue in cheek, to say that he agreed with Senator Short that this issue should not be politicised. Naturally, I agree with Senator Short. But, as honourable senators will find as I debate this matter, this Bill is political. It was introduced not on the basis of fact but on the basis of the perception by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) that the Government ought to do something, without any reference at all to the facts. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us be direct: this Bill is about preventing or cutting off the level of Japanese investment in urban real estate. Newspaper and other reports have claimed that the Japanese somehow, by buying at the top end of the market, have affected the purchase price of the average house. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is yet another Government tactic, another Government technique, to draw attention away from the real cause of the rise in the price of housing in Australia. That rise has been brought about by this Government, not by foreign investment in urban real estate. </PARA>
<PARA> As indicated by my colleague Senator Messner, the coalition will support these changes but it will move certain amendments that I will discuss later. In his second reading speech the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we have always needed a substantial flow of foreign investment to help expand our economy . . . This is particularly important now, given the crucial requirement that we internationalise the Australian economy and expand our export sector. </PARA>
<PARA>What the Minister should have added-this is particularly important-is that the diabolical state of the economy has been brought about by this Government, an economy described by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), in quite comical terms, as a tragedy but not a mess. Can honourable senators imagine anything more ludicrous than that comment? When the Australian dollar went down, the Prime Minister got to his feet and said, `I did not say anything to bring the dollar down. Of course I did not'. To be fair to him, he said that aspects of the economy-fairly critical aspects such as the inflation rate and the balance of payments-were a tragedy, but not a mess. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia needs foreign investment because it is the only immediate solution to our key economic problem of external debt. The alternative-I hope that the economists in the Australian Democrats listen to this-because of the situation we find ourselves in, is a major economic recession or depression. That is the position we have reached. Until we can reduce or eliminate our current account deficit, which fuels this debt, that deficit must be financed by net capital inflow, either by increased overseas borrowing or, better still, by direct investment. </PARA>
<PARA> But the Government, having recognised the need for foreign investment and having moved to liberalise some of the guidelines in one part of this Bill, seeks to ban all foreign purchases of urban real estate. Under the legislation, all proposed acquisitions of urban real estate of foreign interests will now require approval by the Foreign Investment Review Board, regardless of size or value. Approval will not be granted for the foreign purchase of developed residential properties, except in a few limited cases. They are: Australian citizens living abroad, intending migrants who have received approval from the immigration authorities to take up permanent residence in Australia and foreign companies buying houses for executives resident in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer said in his second reading speech that at first sight we might find this incongruous. I would call it highly contradictory and typical of the breathtaking hypocrisy of which this Government is so capable. Needless to say, the coalition opposes these clauses, for the reasons I spoke about earlier. We are not advocating open slather. We believe that previous guidelines which all- owed foreigners to buy a property or properties not exceeding a cumulative value of $600,000 were adequate and preferable to this political, knee-jerk reaction. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the economic rationale for the new urban real estate guidelines which the Treasurer first announced in September 1987? I point out that we are now into March 1989. One might well ask. The official line is that the Government is concerned that the purchase of Australian houses by foreigners who have no intention of taking up residence here has contributed to driving up the price of Australian real estate and that this ban will dampen price pressures on the local housing market. How noble of the Government! What a pity there is not a shred of hard economic evidence to support this theory-not one single shred. When these measures were first announced in September 1987, the Treasurer could not provide any facts or figures to back up that decision. He conceded that the Government had relied heavily on anecdotal evidence. Nor could the real estate industry provide any support for it. It is worth repeating some of the quotes from real estate executives which the honourable member for Wentworth, Dr Hewson, cited in his speech during the second reading debate in the other place. Dr Hewson quoted Mr Neil Collins, Managing Director of Richardson and Wrench, one of the largest real estate firms in this country, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>Overseas investors have been buying only a very small percentage of the market and while there have been some spectacular purchases-</PARA>
<PARA>of course, these are the ones that get reported-</PARA>
<PARA>these investors were not major players in the market. </PARA>
<PARA>Bearing in mind that the major housing price increases have occurred in Sydney, it is worth noting the comment by Mr Robert Bevan, President of the Real Estate Institute of New South Wales, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is a decision taken for purely political reasons to support the fallacious argument that foreign investors in the $1m residential market are making it hard for first home buyers in the $80,000 to $90,000 market. If there were any way the Real Estate Institute could be convinced that stopping foreigners from buying into the upper end residential market would stop the price spiral in the mid to lower end residential market, we would applaud the Government's move. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Keating fancies himself as an economic rationalist, but the ban on the purchase of urban real estate from a point of view of factual evidence is with the fairies. In fact, since the ban has been in place, since September 1987, housing prices have continued to boom. The ban has not had one iota of effect, especially in Sydney. In the year to December 1988, the value of medium priced homes increased by 70 per cent in Sydney, 36 per cent in Melbourne, and 32 per cent in Brisbane. That was after this ban came into effect in 1987. It has nothing to do with foreign investment in urban real estate; it is something else, and hence the amendments moved to this Bill by my colleague Senator Messner. The real motivation for this change has nothing to do with economics but everything to do with politics. This is the very thing that Senator McKiernan spoke about. He said that we should not make this matter a political issue. But that is exactly what this Bill does. That is what it is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is part of the Government's ongoing search for scapegoats-people whom it can blame for the mess it has brought upon the Australian economy because, as honourable senators know, it is not the fault of the Government! The world's greatest Treasurer has told us it is not and we must believe him! Everyone knows, or seems to know-except the Government-that the economy is off the rails and the Government is paralysed into inaction. As each new set of bad economic data is released, the Government's excuses become more creative. The Australian Statistician, Mr Ian Castles, was blamed for the bad December consumer price index which pushed Australia's inflation rate to about 7.7 per cent. According to the Treasurer, Mr Castles was not measuring the housing costs properly. Mr Ron Knowles wrote about what he called the Government's `scapegoat crisis' in Monday's edition of the Australian Financial Review. It is worth quoting from his column. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> We have to be grateful to Mr Keating as the only minister who appears to be giving any thought to the scapegoat crisis. It was his fertile mind that identified the real cause of current problems . . . </PARA>
<PARA>And guess what it was-the people of Australia. That was the Treasurer's excuse. Mr Knowles continued:</PARA>
<PARA> According to the Keating doctrine, Australia would be an easy place to run if it weren't for the people who live there. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that they want to live in pleasant houses, with space for the children to play and a Hills hoist on which to dry the washing. Some of them might even want to have a home as grand as the four-storey mansion near Sydney Harbour that they are paying Mr Keating and his family not to live in. </PARA>
<PARA> These people pushing up the cost of housing and the rate of inflation are ideal scapegoats. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, ordinary, average Australians. Mr Knowles continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Not only do they have no sense of patriotism as they indulge their appetites for revolving clothes lines, they are not willing to save. </PARA>
<PARA>It is their fault again-they will not save! No-one reminds the Treasurer that the reason some people will not save is that they cannot because of the tax rip-offs by this Government-the highest taxing government in this country's history-and so on. The article further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> According to . . . Senator Button, the ordinary people have no saving grace. They are not putting their money in the banks to enable Australian industry to develop and invest. </PARA>
<PARA>Why would they? There is a bias against putting one's money in the bank. By the time one's tax is paid-and the average person who earns more than $19,500 pays 40 per cent tax-and the inflation rate of 7.7 per cent is taken into account, one is in fact losing money. Much to my surprise, Senator Walsh has developed some sort of a taste for scapegoat hunting too. He blamed the ostentatious consumption of the nouveau rich as one of the causes for Australia's low household savings ratio. I think Senator Walsh should have blamed Labor's nouveau poor for not saving their money, judging from the angry response to this assertion. As one person said in a letter to the newspapers, `Save-I would love to. But my first thoughts are to ponder a way for my family to exist, before giving a thought to saving'. Or, `Where does Senator Button get off saying we aren't saving enough? How can we? With rising interest rates, plus phone, power and groceries, et cetera, how does he expect the ordinary person to save?'. Then there was this advice to the Treasurer from another person: `I'm off to spend my money before I lose any more to Mr Keating. I will start saving again when and if you get your act together'. </PARA>
<PARA> And now to the housing crisis, which is the background to this Bill. It will stop foreigners buying into urban real estate. That is the cause of the problems, even though I have shown quite clearly that since 1987 when this ban was first introduced, although the Bill is now just before us, housing prices have grown enormously. Housing affordability continues to fall in Australia. The December figures reveal the fifth successive quarterly decline in housing affordability since September 1987-since that date. The great dream for many a young person has turned into a nightmare. I know, because I have children of my own at that age who are affected by this very problem right now. I feel sorry for them because the struggle to overcome the situation is very difficult. The problem is not that the value of housing as a multiplier of average weekly earnings has changed too much in the past 20 or 30 years, but that interest rates have changed. Interest rates for the average home are rising to about 16 per cent and the inflation rate is about 7 per cent, whereas 20 or 30 years ago it was basically nil. More importantly, the tax rate takes away and saps the savings of individual Australians. I shall come to that matter shortly because it is important. The fact that people cannot afford to buy a home has, in the Government's view, nothing to do with the galloping inflation rate, just as it has nothing to do with the Government's monetary policy, which has delivered to Australia the highest interest rates in the industrialised world. The Government also believes that it has nothing to do with the weakness of the Australian dollar against the major currencies. No, it is foreign buyers who are the big bad bogies, regardless of the fact that there has been no evidence to support that claim. </PARA>
<PARA> I now wish to address briefly Senator Messner's amendment. As I have mentioned a number of times, one of the major problems in Australia is the current account deficit, or the balance of payments deficit, whatever one likes to call it. I refer to the deficit between imports and exports-in other words, between what we buy and what we sell. As mentioned by Senator Short, the Government claimed the year before last that we were in an economic crisis because there was a collapse in our terms of trade; it was not as great as had occurred some years earlier. Then last year-and this was not forecast-the terms of trade turned around quite dramatically. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;More by good luck than by good management. The bad economic management lay in what the Government did about it. In August last year the Government decided that it ought to rearrange its affairs and gear itself up for an election-everybody knows the lag effect of economic changes. The Government decided to crank up the interest rate-because the world's greatest Treasurer said that inflation would be down at around 4.5 per cent by the middle of the year-and get the dollar up so as to reduce the price of imports and help to bring down inflation. That theory, like all great theories, did not work. We ended up with an enormous interest rate. Today, the ordinary businessman who goes to borrow money has to pay around 18 per cent. This is a key aspect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If an Australian is competing with international buyers who are investing in this country, one needs to make a comparison. An Australian borrows money at the bank rate at 18 per cent, whereas a borrower in Japan goes to the bank and gets money at 4.5 or 5 per cent. That person is already miles ahead. The balance of payments deficit is the major cause of our problems and it is increasing our total debt at the rate of $1.5 billion a month. At the end of December our gross foreign debt was over $125 billion. The net debt, which is the figure about which the Government tends to speak more often, now exceeds $95 billion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that the Minister interjects on that point, as that argument is often thrown about. If my memory is correct, the figure is about 54 per cent private sector, 46 per cent government. Private debt is that high because our domestic interest rate is so damned high, thus forcing people offshore to borrow, even though they have to take an exchange risk. Everyone is aware that, if we are to improve our balance of payments, we must, if we can, increase our exports. There is a common feeling around the place at the moment that we are probably exporting as much as we can. I would hope to see more, thus reducing our imports and hence increasing our import replacement factor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently the Prime Minister toured South East Asia-good luck to him-in an effort to get people overseas to purchase more from Australia and perhaps to get themselves involved in the Australian economy. One place he visited was the Republic of Korea. In his parliamentary statement the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> My visit to the Republic of Korea took place some three months after President's Roh's visit to Australia, thus consolidating a relationship that, in economic terms, is now among our most important. </PARA>
<PARA>That is very true. What the Prime Minister, Robert Hawke, did not say-and I say this categorically because of what Senator McKiernan said about this Government not believing in confrontation-was that he was in Korea to mend bridges. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1978 I attended an international coal conference when Prime Minister Hawke was then President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). The Republic of Korea then imported about 48 per cent of its raw materials from Australia. It wanted to increase its imports, but the only thing that stopped the Koreans was their concern about the unreliability of supply because of industrial disputation or strikes. Their representative asked the then President of the ACTU to give them some assurance, some glimmer of hope, so that they could go back and recommend the purchase of more raw materials from Australia. That person was subjected to the greatest insults and diatribe I have heard in my life-much to the disgust of everyone who attended that meeting. It was not just Koreans who were present, but buyers from all over the world. The then ACTU President told them that he did not care if they did not buy one tonne of anything from Australia because he did not like their way of government, or the way in which the industrial affairs operated in that country. His view was that, if the Koreans got their act in order, he would be prepared to speak to them. I hope that on his recent visit he repaired some bridges. What happened after the earlier meeting was that the figure of coal exports to Korea fell from 48 per cent to 38 per cent. When I was in Korea recently I asked some of those people whether the earlier incident had any effect on them, and they said that it had had an effect. They said, `Why do you think we now buy only 38 per cent and not 48 per cent? Why do you think we diversified to other places, including Canada?'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition will not oppose the Bill. We shall be pursuing some amendments during the committee stage. I reiterate the problem we have, or perceive that we have, for which a Bill is introduced to prevent foreign interests from buying urban real estate, is caused not by the purchase by foreigners of real estate but by the state of the economy and the level to which this country has been allowed to drop. That has not happened because of the people of Australia. The people do a wonderful job if they are given the chance. The inflation rate is 7.7 per cent, twice the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development average, with the inflation rate in Japan running at about one per cent. </PARA>

I understand some of the thinking of the Australian Democrats, and I understand the feeling of nationalism that we all have, but we must remember that we have little option. We need foreign investment, and on that subject we and the Government are bipartisan. We also need to be able to save more and invest more. As Senator Messner pointed out in his amendment, this country has record levels of taxation. This is the highest taxing government this country has ever seen. This affects the ability of individuals to save and do their own investment. That has gone. We have high domestic interest rates which affect the competitiveness of our own products if we are considering import replacement. We have increasing dependence on foreign investment because of the Government-inflicted state of the economy, and of course we have a continuing balance of payments crisis.</PARA></TALK.START>

All I know is that after the last Budget the Treasurer of this country said that the Government had introduced all the reforms that needed to be introduced. Less than six months ago he said that there were no more reforms for the Government to introduce. </PARA>
<PARA> We must look at our micro-economic policy and at structural changes. We must look at improving our productivity. Unless we improve our productivity, from a manufacturing point of view, we will develop into a Third World country, if we have not already done so. Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Thailand have made advances-not that I am decrying this-but we still have not changed our three major industries of mining, primary industry, and tourism. With our natural raw materials we must be able to achieve a value-added factor. It will not happen under the accord.

We must get back to the enterprise level if we are to become more productive, so that people who work in a particular organisation feel that they are in the same boat-not the east is east and west is west approach.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Such debates on the economy show how remarkably little difference there is between the Government and the Opposition. If one listens carefully, one finds that honourable senators on the Opposition side, particularly, flail in the air to attempt to discover differences between themselves and the Government and attempt in hollow ways to criticise the Government. Earlier tonight Senator Short found it remarkable that the Government is now belatedly legislating for changes that were introduced as long ago as 1985 under administrative arrangements. Several speakers later, Senator Parer criticised the Government for coming forward with the legislation, saying that it is politicising the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another thing that I find rather depressing is that the analysis of the economic situation we heard tonight from both sides falls a long way short of reality. It is easy to take small pieces of the economy and with those small pieces attempt to show that there is or is not a relationship between two factors. Both Senator Short and Senator Parer quoted the Real Estate Institute. I will return to the fallacy in their arguments later; at this point, I just remark that it is unlikely that the Real Estate Institute would criticise a system which pushed up house prices when the profits of its members are directly related to the value of real estate. As the value of real estate increases, real estate agencies increase their profits because they work on a percentage of turnover. Therefore, it is clearly in their interests to maintain a system which returns them the largest profit. </PARA>
<PARA> In three brief paragraphs of the second reading speech, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) outlined what the legislation is all about. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I should emphasise that this general strengthening of the Act does not-</PARA>
<PARA>I stress that-</PARA>
<PARA>herald a new tough line on foreign investment: the Bill brings the Act more closely into line with foreign investment policy. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to define the Government's foreign investment policy. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government remains committed to a generally relaxed approach to foreign investment in all except a few sensitive sectors. Foreign investment is welcome in Australia and policy is administered on a non-discriminatory basis.</PARA>
<PARA>The one thing on which I would personally agree with him is that if one has a policy with respect to foreign dealings it should certainly be on a non-discriminatory basis. In every other respect I find myself in total disagreement with what the Minister said. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise again that the Opposition would have no quarrel with those arguments. It certainly supports a generally relaxed approach, perhaps a more relaxed approach, to foreign investment and it welcomes it in Australia. But the Opposition is largely aligned with those who are able to dabble in that sort of large money market, so Opposition members and their mates are the ones who, more than average Australians, benefit from that sort of arrangement. Senator Short specifically said that he accepts that foreign investment is a good thing. He also criticised Senator Haines, who spoke before him, for suggesting, as the Australian Democrats have done, that there should be a register of foreign ownership. I cannot quote his words directly but he indicated that he hoped that Senator Haines was not suggesting that foreign investment was not a good thing. Nonetheless, he indicated quite clearly that he would prefer not to have a register of foreign ownership. Clearly Senator Short was saying that he would prefer this country to go on in total ignorance of the state of foreign investment and ownership in Australia. Whether one agrees or does not agree with foreign investment and foreign ownership, surely when foreign investment in a country and the relative shift of capital between countries are as large as they are today it would be desirable at least to have the basic statistics, to know where the country is going. Senator Short would prefer simply to go on in blissful ignorance. </PARA>
<PARA> The best figures I have seen indicate that foreign investment in Australia is now running at between $2 billion and $5 billion a quarter. I saw those figures just in the last few days. They suggest a foreign investment rate of between $8 billion and $20 billion a year. Before I came into the chamber tonight I did a few calculations which suggest that between 20 and 50 years from now Australia will be totally foreign owned if we go on at that rate. Frankly, I am very concerned at that rate of foreign investment. It is something we need to be concerned about; it is something we need to get a handle on. We at least need the basic data. However, the Government does not provide that basic data. As far as I am aware, Queensland is the only State which has legislated, in any way, to get a register of foreign ownership of real estate. That legislation, I believe, was proclaimed only today. No other State keeps a register of foreign ownership. We should be very worried about the size of foreign ownership and we need a register of that ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the arguments in the Treasurer's second reading speech. Senator Short and Senator Parer, as I indicated earlier, quoted the Real Estate Institute and argued that the purchase of real estate had little to do with the increase in the price of real estate in Australia. Senator Parer recently said that real estate prices had continued to climb even though there had been less purchasing of urban real estate in recent years after the administrative procedures were put in place. Of course, other factors operate in this area other than foreign purchases of real estate. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government has not restricted the purchase of land for development. We have recently seen very large purchases of near-urban land for development. Given the attitude which this Government and the Opposition have to a free rein of the market, it does not take a great deal of grey matter to see that if the price of near-urban land is substantially increased by foreign purchases for development purposes, the price of other land will be pushed up. That is, indeed, a factor in the increase in the price of urban land in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> If one followed the chain through, one would also realise, as we have learned earlier tonight, that some 60 per cent of Australia's foreign borrowings are private in nature. The interest payments on those foreign borrowings are written off against the earnings of individuals in Australia. That factor, therefore, increases the tax on other Australians and relatively decreases their ability to purchase real estate. So, as a result of that chain of events, the cost of acquiring housing in Australia has increased. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) seemed to argue that it is desirable to tie in our economy to that of other countries. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>Under a policy change which I announced on 28 July 1986, foreign purchases of real estate for development-both residential and commercial-are approved unless judged contrary to the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA>He also comments that the Treasurer will:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . prohibit proposed foreign acquisitions or urban land that are judged contrary to the national interest . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This refers to the previous conditions to which this Bill applies. To the extent that we lock our economy into that of other countries, we make ourselves dependent upon supply and demand which occurs elsewhere. A net inflow of large amounts of capital, which there is at the present time, will push up land prices. Equally, if people who have invested take their capital out of the economy, prices will fall. </PARA>
<PARA> We are therefore on a treadmill and ordinary Australians in a larger market are dependent upon the operations of usually very large operators in foreign markets. As we also know, a large amount of that money in international markets is speculative capital which simply sloshes around from one place to another, wherever it can make a profit, very often in foreign currency transactions. It seems to me to be quite obscene that this Government has made the purchase of homes by ordinary Australians dependent upon that system. Indeed, this is what the Opposition would do if it were in government. I do not believe that we should be deliberately attempting to make our own internal markets as volatile as that by making them ultimately dependent on those much larger markets. The Treasurer, in his second reading speech, when speaking of the purposes of this Bill, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The first is the natural desire of the Australian community that local people should have the dominant influence in our economy. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet this Bill aims to hand over to foreign forces a substantial control and influence over our economy, particularly over the value of Australian land. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also, according to the Treasurer, welcomes productive investment, and yet I find nothing in this piece of legislation which ensures that the investment coming in will be productive and not merely speculative in nature. The Treasurer also spoke of the benefits to Australia. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Distinct from most forms of foreign investment, we see these purchases as providing-</PARA>
<PARA>he is talking about real estate-</PARA>
<PARA>little or no real benefit to Australia. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Elsewhere he also talks about `benefit to Australia' as though there is a clear benefit to Australia and no need to justify or to prove that benefit. It is as if it is sufficient merely to assert that foreign investment in Australia produces a benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> I would equally well assert that there will be no investment in anything unless the person who makes the investment expects and gets, in most cases, a larger return than the investment which is made. We have seen massive investments in recent decades by developed countries in Third World countries. As we know, most Third World countries have investment at such a level that there is a net flow of capital for those Third World countries back into the countries which have made the investment. There is, therefore, a net flow of capital from the poor to the rich. Senator Parer, a few moments ago, talked about Australia becoming a Third World country. I believe we are going very rapidly down that road. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not operating in a level playing field-we never have and we never will. The richer players in the field can always get the advantage; the rich will always get richer at the expense of the poor. All the Government has done and, as I have stated many times, all the Opposition would do if it were in government, is simply extend that system. </PARA>
<PARA> One test of the economy is said to be the measure of benefits. As I have argued many times in this place, I am not too sure that this is a true test. I think a large number of costs are included as benefits. Let us take for the moment the proposition that gross national product or gross domestic product is a real indicator of the wealth of the country. If a gross national product is growing at a certain percentage rate and the profit which foreign investors are taking out is larger than that rate, it follows, as a simple matter of mathematics, that the country will become poorer. If the wealth of the country is growing at 2 per cent and the profit in real terms which the foreign investor is taking out is 3 per cent, clearly the country must be becoming worse off. That is precisely what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 2 of the Minister's second reading speech we find the Minister justifying this legislation and the Act it seeks to amend in terms of our small population. He states that, because we have a small population relative to the size of our existing economic infrastructure, we need an inflow of foreign capital. We have a small population, certainly, but we are a relatively rich country. The investment which we need to make surely relates to the needs of the people of Australia, not to foreigners or anybody else. If the people of Australia, that small population, has certain needs, then clearly in a rich country we can find sufficient investment for those needs. To seek to exploit our resources at a faster rate than needed by our own population is to exercise greed; there is no other word for it. </PARA>
<PARA> Neither this Government nor this Opposition has accepted a sane economic program. They have accepted the traditional growth model which seeks merely to turn resources into waste, and that is what growth is ultimately about. We seek to push through as much resource as we possibly can, so we tear down forests and dig up resources and send them overseas, pollute our environment, and call that development. That is a lovely euphemistic term which appears repeatedly through the Minister's second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA> We are a small population; we are a rich population. We have enough capital in this country for our own development provided we are modest in our demands. By seeking to exploit our resources at a faster rate than dictated by our real needs, it seems to me that we have led ourselves into a problem of enormous foreign debt which could shortly lead Australia to being totally foreign owned. </PARA>
<PARA> This type of development is not really the function of ordinary Australians. The majority of Australians do not participate in this process at all. As most honourable senators would know, a large amount of Australia is owned by a very small number of people, both Australians and foreigners. The figures run something like this: half a per cent of the population owns some 10 per cent of the country, 5 per cent of the population owns something like 50 per cent of the country, 10 per cent of the population owns about 60 per cent of the country, and the remaining 90 per cent of the population owns 40 per cent of the country. Those who participate in the sorts of transactions with which we are dealing in this legislation are not ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Cook indicated earlier by way of interjection, our foreign indebtedness is caused substantially by private borrowings. Well over half of the foreign debt is due to private borrowings. Private borrowings have very often been mounted so that individuals can buy assets which are already owned. We have seen breweries which have been in this country for well over a century bought with foreign borrowings by people in Australia. Interest payments must be made on those foreign borrowings and the interest payments are claimed against the tax which those people pay. So not only do Australians have to pay a higher price for their products than they have paid before to repay the debt; they have to pay a higher price again to pay the interest, and a higher price again because they have to pay more tax to cover the tax avoided though the foreign borrowings. We are selling off this country so that individuals can borrow that money to buy this country's assets. </PARA>
<PARA> Ordinary Australians are losing all along the way. We are losing our country and we are paying others to take it away. One can find numerous examples of this. An example which has been discussed in the newspapers just recently relates to woodchipping, the infrastructure costs of which far exceed the benefits which flow back. We are losing our resources; we are paying foreign countries to take those resources away from us. It becomes particularly serious when, to cover the debts of people such as the Bonds and the Elliotts, we are selling this country to foreign interests. I am very concerned about it. My estimate suggests that the rate of foreign ownership in this country is not inconsiderable and that, if we continue to go down this road, within 20 to 50 years we could finish up in a situation where Australia is totally foreign-owned. The Australian Democrats certainly would like to see the establishment of a register of foreign ownership so that at least we get the basic data. We would like to see the whole of Australian real estate totally in Australian hands by the year 2000. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I congratulate you on your appointment. This is the first time I have addressed the Senate while you have been in the chair. The Senate is considering the Foreign Takeovers Amendment Bill 1988, to which my colleague Senator Messner has moved the following amendment to the motion for the second reading:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate condemns the Government for its failed economic policies which have resulted in:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Australia's increasing dependence on foreign investment;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a continuing balance of payments crisis and associated foreign debt problems;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) high domestic interest rates adversely affecting all Australians; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) record levels of taxation which are heavily biased against the ability of Australians to save''. </PARA>
<PARA>How very true those words are. I hope that the Australian Democrats will support that amendment. After all, what has the Hawke Government done during the past six years? After all its talk, what has it done? It has mortgaged our future and it is now left with only one policy: the policy to sell off the farm, to sell off the land and assets of Australia to foreigners in order to meet the massive trade imbalance which has grown so enormously during its six years in government. When I asked a senator in this chamber yesterday what he thought about our current economic policy, he said, `Well, we are galloping down the Argentinean road'. </PARA>
<PARA> We are being led by a gambler. This Government has gambled away many of the benefits of the Fraser wage pause of 1982. I know the disappointments of the Fraser years and I regret the disappointments of those years, but let me assure the Parliament that the Fraser wage pause of 1982 was of enormous benefit to this country. This Government has gambled away those benefits. It has gambled away our recovery from Australia's worst drought ever, which was experienced at the end of the term of the Fraser Government. This Government has gambled away the benefits of improved commodity prices, which have been at record levels since 1986. This Government has gambled on being able to con the Australian people by talkfests, by conferences and by clever manipulation of the media while it has done nothing other than go on increasing expenditure and taxes, thereby destroying the enterprise and initiative of Australians who want to be successful. This Government has gambled on being able to con the Australian people that the 1.2 million jobs created since the 1982-83 recession were the result of good economic management. The truth is that, apart from the extra jobs created by the demand arising from increases in immigration, most of the job increases can be directly attributed to the Fraser wage pause, to recovery from the 1982 drought, and to improved commodity prices. </PARA>
<PARA> That propensity to gamble is very much part of both Mr Hawke's and Mr Keating's characters. Last year, in response to mounting pressures from traditional supporters, Mr Keating brought down a gambler's Budget. That gamble has not come off. Australia now faces economic disaster and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) blithely describes it as `a tragedy not a mess'. This Government has lost control and has abandoned us to the fate of the Argentineans and maybe even to the fate of the Venezuelans. As I said, and as Senator Coulter from the Australian Democrats said before me, the only policy that this Government has left is to sell off the assets of this country. If the Democrats firmly believe what Senator Coulter was saying, I hope that they will support the amendment moved by the Liberal and National parties. </PARA>
<PARA> Ministers in this Government are now so paralysed with fear of the consequences of Keating's last Budget that they cannot do anything or decide anything. As I have said, they have simply lost control and abandoned us to our fate. Yet there is much that they could be doing. They could be taking action to stabilise our foreign debt; to reverse the high interest rates for many categories of loans; to reduce the inflation rate; and to encourage savings. They could be taking action to provide incentives to encourage affordable home ownership; to reduce the current account deficit; and to reduce the record levels of public sector outlays and the record levels of taxation revenue. They could be taking action to reduce the levels of unemployment, particularly amongst the youth of this country. I might mention to the Senate that, under this Government, average monthly unemployment has risen to 627,000, compared with 403,000 when it took office, with the average youth monthly unemployment rate under Mr Hawke rising to 130,000, or 23 per cent, which is a national disgrace. Even some simple, practical steps by this Government would demonstrate to the people that it was still alive and not totally inept. For example, this Government could announce that it intends to build the third runway at Mascot. At least that would be an indication that it is prepared to try to do something to sort out the crisis that is existing at Mascot, our major international airport. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government could take some action to sort out the union movement-a movement with which it has had such close association in the past. It must be able to get through to the union movement that some things need to be changed. For example, it could at least persuade the union movement to recognise that a youth wage would increase employment opportunities and assist in developing a viable youth traineeship system. This Government could increase the number of places available at universities and other tertiary institutions. It could introduce some of the micro-economic reforms that it has been so voluble about. In particular, it could reform the waterfront, which the Economic Planning Advisory Council estimates would save this country $850m per annum. It could reform our coastal shipping and trans-Tasman shipping, with an estimated annual saving of $200m. A billion dollars could be saved every year if this Government were to take these steps. If it were to indicate that it would take these steps, at least that would be a start. It could reform the transportation of bulk coal and wheat, with an estimated saving of $700m per annum. This Government could say to the States that the States must take steps to reform these areas where there is a desperate need for micro-economic reform and where the States are not facing up to their obligations in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Messner says in his amendment, this country faces an increasing dependence on foreign investment. This country faces a continuing balance of payments crisis and associated foreign debt problems. This country faces high domestic interest rates, which are adversely affecting all Australians, and record levels of taxation which are heavily biased against the ability of Australians to save. Commodity prices, although high at the moment, have little chance of increasing any more, so the Government cannot look to that area to solve our balance of payments problem. Tourism is booming currently and bringing in substantial income but, as I mentioned, the tourist gateway at Mascot is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> There seems to be no chance of seeing the economic turnaround on which the Hawke Government has gambled for four or five years. I cannot see it happening under this Government. As I have said, this Government has mortgaged Australia to the hilt. It does not seem to have the courage to take the urgent action desperately needed to rectify these problems. Until it does, we will continue to attack this Government for its indecisiveness and will expose it for its empty rhetoric until at last the people of Australia give us the opportunity to take these steps. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats to make a brief contribution to the debate on the Foreign Takeovers Amendment Bill 1988. I would like to have referred to the second reading speech of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) in this place on 25 November last year, but I think it must have been one of the shortest second reading speeches ever delivered. Instead, I wish to refer to the second reading speech by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the other place. He said in his speech:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In its foreign investment policy the government attempts to maintain a balance between two important interests. </PARA>
<PARA> The first is the natural desire of the Australian community that local people should have the dominant influence in our economy. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats agree with the Treasurer that it is a natural desire of the Australian community that this should be so. Because of this, over the last year or so there has been a flurry of activity in the press with ordinary people expressing their concern at foreign takeovers. I put it to the Senate that one of the reasons for that concern is that we do not have a register of the foreign ownership in this country; therefore, people feel concerned because they are working in the dark. Earlier Senator McKiernan brought up the crayfishing industry in Western Australia. In 1988 the Western Australian Superannuation Board sold its holdings of one of the 12 processing licences for crayfishing to Chunagon Pty Ltd, a Japanese firm. There was an outcry and the then Minister for Fisheries, Mr Grill, was reported to have said that one Japanese licence was not going to damage the industry and might in fact enhance it. That was reported in the West Australian of 20 July 1988. However, in the same article we find this:</PARA>
<PARA> The Rock Lobster and Prawning Association has also called for a freeze on licence transfers until policy guidelines are clarified. </PARA>
<PARA> Association president Max Ball said the industry was concerned that Chunagon was a major Japanese end-user. </PARA>
<PARA>Those fears were justified, because earlier this year-on 22 January 1989-we read in the Sunday Times:</PARA>
<PARA> A giant Japanese fishing company is trying to take over the multi-million dollar WA crayfishing market, it was claimed yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> More than 250 angry crayfishermen met in Geraldton this week to call on the Federal Government to block the sale of three fishing licences to the Chunagon company. </PARA>
<PARA> Details of the sale are now before the Foreign Investment Review Board. The final say rests with the Treasurer, Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA>As Senator McKiernan said earlier, the Treasurer blocked that sale. If that sale had been approved, it would have placed 25 per cent of Western Australia's processing licences for crayfishing in Japanese hands. That is why ordinary workers are concerned that their livelihoods are going to foreign ownership. Again in Western Australia we had the case of Sanwa Vines. This is a Japanese firm which has bought up a vast acreage-I suppose I should say hectareage these days-of land in the Swan Valley at Ellenbrook. The land, the condominiums and town houses to be built are already on sale in Japan, and the prices are very high. </PARA>
<PARA> Perth hotels are coming on the market just like cards being dealt for a round of rummy. We read in the West Australian newspaper on 8 November last year:</PARA>
<PARA>Four of Perth's six top hotels are owned by Asian businesses and they are set to buy part of a fifth. </PARA>
<PARA>The hotels already owned are the Hyatt Regency, the Parmelia Hilton, the Burswood International and the Orchard Hotel. The fifth hotel involved in negotiations is the Sheraton. There is a very interesting tie-up there among those hotels because the Parmelia Hilton is owned by the same people who own the Sanwa Vines holiday development. </PARA>
<PARA> We then have the case of Japanese investors buying a farm in Western Australia. The West Australian newspaper in September last year said:</PARA>
<PARA>A report in this week's Countryman says the sale comes at a time when tempers are running hot in the Eastern States with a backlash against continuing Japanese investment. </PARA>
<PARA>The backlash is there not, I hope, because of any feeling that a certain nation should not move into this country, although as Senator Powell said we must have regard to the sensitivities, especially as far as the Japanese are concerned. But the Democrats believe that the concern is there because it is our land that is being sold and we do not know how much of it is being sold. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a very offensive advertisement which appeared in a Chinese newspaper. The advertisement appeared with the slogan `Australia up for grabs'. It had a picture of a smiling Asian man holding a handful of earth with a sprouting bush. In the advertisement people were asked to buy and make money down under. The message in the advertisement was:</PARA>
<PARA> ``If you want to own a piece of Australia, here is a golden opportunity to buy land in an area where prices and values are rising rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA> ``Either way it makes an excellent investment proposition as land for home unit development in fast developing Perth . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The advertisement appeared twice in June in the English-language Post, which is published in Hong Kong and distributed throughout South-East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA>I was very pleased to read in the Sunday Times in Perth on 21 August last year that the State Minister for Housing, Mrs Beggs, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The advertisement wording could lead West Australians to pay higher prices for land. </PARA>
<PARA> She said: ``I would think that sort of advertising overseas is not in the best interests of the domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA>There is awareness that overseas investment in housing and land is pushing up the prices of homes for Australians. We are fortunate in Western Australia that our prices have not risen to the extent that they have risen in the eastern States but they are certainly on the rise. If we were able to have a register so that we could know exactly how much is owned by overseas investors, we could assess that situation more closely and come to logical conclusions. We are working in the dark. There is also concern that the Japanese are moving into the beef market. That is a very genuine concern expressed by rural people and others who are working in that industry. It is an industry which has had enough problems without having the problem of foreign ownership added to it. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government wants to put an end to this sort of press as far as overseas investment is concerned and if it wants to put an end to what I think have been described as xenophobic tendencies, a register so that we know exactly what is owned by foreigners overseas for investment purposes would certainly achieve that result. I hope that we will not have yet another example of the Government and coalition Opposition voting for the second time in less than a week for such information to be denied to Australian citizens. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The other time was when I sought to have tabled documents relating to advice given by the Australian Electoral Commission to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) with regard to the electoral system for the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second important interest listed by the Treasurer-the first, honourable senators will recall, was a natural desire of the Australian community that local people should have the dominant influence in our economy-was the very significant benefit that Australia gains from foreign investment. Without a register, without knowing how much foreign investment we have and without being able to do the sums in detail, how on earth can we possibly assess that situation? It is very difficult to do when working in the dark. Senator Parer asked for the facts; the facts are simply not there. The Treasurer went on in his speech to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Under a policy change which I announced on 28 July 1986, foreign purchases of real estate for development-both residential and commercial-are approved unless judged contrary to the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA>Who is judging whether the national interest is being served? How can this be judged if we cannot place it in the context of the degree of foreign investment which we have in this country? The Treasurer went on:</PARA>
<PARA>Purchases of developed commercial real estate are approved subject to a flexible guideline for 50% Australian equity, with approvals for 100% foreign ownership being granted if Australian equity on reasonable terms and conditions is unavailable. </PARA>
<PARA>What a cop-out that is! Indeed, this is a doublespeak. We find doublespeak in the Foreign Investment Review Board report 1987-88 which was tabled the other day in the Senate. We read that, as far as policies are concerned in manufacturing, services, resource processing, non-bank financial institutions, insurance, sharebroking, tourism, rural properties and primary industry:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government approves proposals to acquire existing businesses or to establish new businesses over $10 million, unless the proposal is contrary to the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA>Again this is a subjective judgment. As far as real estate is concerned, the report says:</PARA>
<PARA>Acquisitions . . . are approved unless they are contrary to the national interest . . . providing no more than half of the units in any one development are sold to foreign interests. </PARA>
<PARA>But if those are sold again, how are we to know into which hands they are falling? The doublespeak continues as far as mining is concerned. Our mining interests can be sold to foreign investors. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Equity and control guideline is applied flexibly. </PARA>
<PARA>I refer now specifically to uranium, where the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Foreign interests may explore for uranium and are not required to seek Australian participation in their exploration activities. </PARA>
<PARA>That is indeed a very strange kind of policy to have when we have a three-mine policy as far as the Parliament is concerned and a no uranium mine policy as far as the Australian Labor Party policy is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> So the Foreign Investment Review Board itself is indeed a toothless tiger. We do not have a register. We have some rather rubbery figures which are available only through two official sources of information. One is the Foreign Investment Review Board itself and the other is the Australian Bureau of Statistics. As far as the Australian Bureau of Statistics is concerned, most of the figures relate to the first half of this decade and no-one can be sure as to their accuracy. The 1984-85 figures, which I believe are the latest available, record the mining industry as being 44.7 per cent foreign owned and mineral explorations 35 per cent foreign controlled. Thirty-seven per cent of petroleum exploration expenditure was also foreign controlled. According to the 1982-83 figures, which are the most recent available, the manufacturing industry was 33 per cent foreign owned; transport 5.1 per cent foreign owned and 3.4 per cent foreign controlled. And so the figures go on, although they are not up to date. The Australian Bureau of Statistics says that the figures cannot be regarded as having any great degree of accuracy. Again I refer to the Treasurer's second reading speech, in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I should emphasise that this general strengthening of the Act-</PARA>
<PARA>he was talking about the increase in penalties for giving false information-</PARA>
<PARA>does not herald a new tough line on foreign investment: . . . The Government remains committed to a generally relaxed approach to foreign investment in all except a few sensitive sectors. </PARA>
<PARA>The whole situation is very loose. The Treasurer went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Acquisitions below these thresholds-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, $5m in the case of Australian businesses and $3m in the case of rural businesses-</PARA>
<PARA>seldom raise issues that require detailed consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>I regard that as an insult to the ordinary Australian public. I would suggest it is a softly, softly foreign takeover approach. The Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is to be noted that there has been a net reduction in staff in the foreign investment area of Treasury in recent years as a result of liberalisations of the foreign investment guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a confession indeed. I do not believe that liberalisation is acceptable to ordinary Australians on matters as serious as this. It may or may not be acceptable after we have a register of foreign ownership, but at least we would be put in a position where we could make up our minds on a sensible and rational basis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking briefly I wish to reflect on some of the figures and facts that are involved in the Foreign Takeovers Amendment Bill. The legislation is quite extraordinary. It reflects the Government's position that it does not mind non-Australians buying any or all of our businesses, factories, shops or undeveloped subdivisions-be they residential or commercial-so long as they do not buy our houses. That is the theory that comes through in the legislation and I have no idea why. What we have to remember and assume is that the position is totally racial. The legislation refers specifically to Japan. Table 4.4 at page 20 of the 1987-88 report of the Foreign Investment Review Board shows that in 1983-84 the United States of America held $19.9 billion worth of property. By 1986-87, the amount was $40.5 billion, or more than double. In 1983-84 the United Kingdom held $20.4 billion worth of property. By 1986-87 the figure was 37.1 billion, or almost double. In 1983-84 the figure for Japan was 10.8 billion, which by 1986-87 was 21.3 billion-less than double.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The figures also show that Japan, which is the obvious target of the legislation, held $10.8 billion worth of property in 1983-84 and that in 1984-85 the figure had risen to $16.2 billion-a rise of 60 per cent in one year. Between 1984-85 and 1985-86 it rose 25 per cent and in the year 1986-87-the year in which this legislation was put together-it rose by the massive sum of 5 per cent! The whole thing blew up in our faces. To take it further, the figures showed that in 1983-84 Japan had 12 1/2 per cent of the total value of overseas ownership and exactly the same amount-that is, 12 1/2 per cent-in 1986-87. So the Government went through a great charade to try to prove figures which are not provable. Anybody who, fortuitously, kept copies of newspapers at the time would find that on 13 November 1987 the Australian carried the headline `Home ownership move inflames racism claims'. I thought that the Government was accusing the Opposition of racism last year, but I am talking about the year before. The racist claims against the Government were made in 1987, the year before. The newspaper article stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Japanese investors are annoyed by a perceived anti-Japan bias in Australia's new foreign home ownership rules and apparent racism. </PARA>
<PARA>Who is talking racism? Here the Government is floating this ridiculous legislation and attacking the Japanese when, 12 months earlier, people were saying, `Oh, yes, that Liberal mob was racist'. The Government produced legislation to demonstrate its racism. The Government was against the Japanese. Why was it not against the United States of America or the United Kingdom, both of which have twice as much ownership in Australia as Japan does? Japan was blamed for house prices. There were all sorts of articles in the newspaper about the way in which Japanese buyers were driving up prices. Who has any evidence of that? I have had a good look-and I know a little about housing-and there is no evidence to show that the Japanese influence drove up prices. This rule came into effect on 29 September 1987. Prices have risen miles more since that date than before it. That is the date that the clappers were put on the Japanese. From that date prices have risen very considerably. As I have said, even now the Japanese still own only half of what the United States and the United Kingdom have in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole point is that the crazy, spotty economy which is being created by the Government is causing the trouble. The fiddled dollar is the problem and the Government knows it. Overseas speculators-from whatever country they come-like Australia. There are no revolutions in Australia; the inflation rate is good, 7 or 8 per cent; and interest rates are high. Speculators can get interest rates of 15 to 18 per cent. Australia is absolutely made for speculators. It is not made for ordinary Australians though. We must remember that Japan is our major trading partner. In 1988 we increased our trade surplus with Japan by a further $900m. The Age newspaper of 4 March states:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's surplus from trade with Japan grew by a strong $900 million to $4.56 billion last year as Australia's biggest customer bought more of everything from abalone to zinc ore. </PARA>
<PARA>We are talking about the country that is our biggest trading partner and buys everything it can from Australia. It suits it to do so and it certainly suits us. Whether the commodity is abalone, zinc or anything else, our trade with Japan must be fostered. The Government must make up its mind. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) A number of overseas administrations use the ATCARDS radar display. ATCARDS is an Australian acronym for the AIRCAT series manufactured by Thomson-CSF (France). While the actual figures would have to be verified with other administrations it is understood that there are approximately 2,800 AIRCAT radar displays installed at one hundred and thirty airports in forty countries at this time compared with thirty radar displays at three airports (Adelaide, Melbourne and Perth) in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) All new radar display systems, regardless of manufacture, require an amount of fine tuning to optimise their operation for the local conditions and for the characteristics of the radar heads used. No two installations in the world are exactly the same so that the ``errors'' experienced in Australia are not the same as elsewhere even if the same basic radar display system is installed.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The settling in period for any radar display systems can vary considerably in length, depending on the complexity, the type of radar heads being used and the methods of running up and testing. There is no recognised ``normal period''.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The field sensor (antenna) equipment serving the old system now serves the new ATCARDS system. The display equipment associated with the old Centre was dismantled and removed shortly after the new equipment was commissioned to provide urgently needed critical spares for the Sydney and Brisbane systems.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) and (6) Ratings suspensions are initiated by supervisory staff when they desire to enquire into an aspect of a controller's work output. In itself a suspension is not a punitive action but merely allows an examination to proceed in a mutually constructive atmosphere. Because this is so, no records are kept of rating suspensions.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) There have been six resignations of Air Traffic Controllers from Melbourne Airport since 1 May 1988, two of which were from the ATCARDS area.</PARA>
