<TITLE>Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament; the humble petition of the undersigned showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That Kingsford-Smith Airport is becoming increasingly congested and existing facilities are inadequate to handle the number of aircraft or their passengers.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government's plans to divert aircraft from Mascot to Bankstown and/or increase landing charges for peak periods will do little to relieve congestion and will place enormous financial and other burdens on commuter airlines and their passengers.</PARA>
<PARA> We therefore call on the Federal Government to take heed of airline and travel industry warnings and;</PARA>
<PARA> (1) give immediate approval for the construction of a third runway at Mascot,</PARA>
<PARA> (2) upgrade existing radar and other traffic control facilities to enable Australia's high safety record to be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>Home Ownership</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.</PARA>
<PARA> Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled require the Hawke-Keating government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many Australians out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families.  And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray</PARA>

<TITLE>Kakadu National Park</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable President and members of the Senate in Parliament. The Petition of the undersigned shows:</PARA>
<PARA> That we oppose any mineral exploration or mining in any part of Kakadu National Park, the Kakadu Conservation Zone, or the Alligator Rivers Region.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners ask that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should: Halt all mineral exploration and mining in the Kakadu conservation zone by revoking current leases and licences and by incorporating the zone in Kakadu National Park and:</PARA>
<PARA> Prevent proposed mining in Kakadu stages one and two by incorporating the Jabiluka and Koongarra project areas in the National Park and by proclaiming the whole park under the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act, 1983.</PARA>

<TITLE>Health Insurance</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Senate assembled in Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate that the Government is about to introduce into the Senate, legislation changing health insurance. These changes will increase the cost of health insurance to members of employee based funds and will do nothing to help the elderly, as is being claimed. Big public funds will increase their surpluses by taking money from more efficient funds. People will be forced back into Medicare, which will not help to maintain private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray that the Senate reject this legislation.</PARA>

<TITLE>Housing: Interest Rates</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. That we consider the current level of interest rates on home mortgages to be intolerable;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. That we believe that Senator Haines' Income Tax Assessment (Housing Loan Interest) Amendment Bill 1989, which provides for tax relief for mortgage payers and is currently before the Senate, provides reasonable relief to the current unacceptable situation;</PARA>
<PARA> 3. That the Senate assembled should, therefore, urgently debate and pass Senator Haines' Bill;</PARA>

<TITLE>Solar Energy for Industry</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that there is widespread community concern regarding.</PARA>
<PARA> 1. the almost total dependence in Australia on fossil fuels and their deleterious effects in producing the greenhouse phenomenon in the environment;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. the proposal to spend millions of dollars on research into nuclear power, the production of which has in other countries proven expensive and dangerous; and</PARA>
<PARA> 3. the lack of adequate funding for research into, and promotion of alternative renewable sources of energy, in particular, solar power.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled, should:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. fund adequate research into production of large scale solar energy for industry; and</PARA>
<PARA> 2. encourage the use of known technology for hot water and space heating by tax incentives on solar heating equipment for houses and commercial buildings.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) notes that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Mr Michael Field, Leader of the Opposition in Tasmania, has reneged on pre-election commitments that there would be no Independent/Labor coalition and has now signed an historic agreement with the Green Independents, to gain the support of the Independents for a Labor Budget and Supply,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) this agreement is nothing more than a sordid, midnight power deal which has seen the Labor Party in Tasmania sell out to the Green Independents' demands for concessions on the environment, homosexuality, Cabinet influence and access and increased staffing allocations, in return for majority Government,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) at the same time, the Independent Group has `prostituted its principles on the altar of power' by sacrificing its independence and aligning itself with the Labor Party in an all-out attempt to oust the Liberal Party, and</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Mr Field's blatant hypocrisy and pragmatism has alienated the traditional support of the Timber Workers Union and the Federated Iron Workers Union, and has destroyed the trust of rank and file ALP voters; and</PARA>

<PARA> (iii) that prior to the election Dr Brown pledged not to overturn a duly elected Government and sought only to `place a firm hand on the shoulder' of that Government,</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) that at the election the Liberal Party received the largest number of seats of any political party or group and thus the endorsement of the Tasmanian electorate,</PARA>
<PARA> (v) that throughout the Tasmanian election campaign the Green Independent candidates denied they were a Party and yet the coalition agreement signed with the Labor Party guarantees them party status, and</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) that both Mr Field and Dr Brown have repudiated their own commitments by forming a coalition agreement of mutual collaboration; and</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate notes-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the leader of the Tasmanian Parliamentary Labor Party (Mr Field) has signed a coalition agreement with 5 independent `Green' members of the Tasmanian Parliament even though he consistently and repeatedly assured his supporters throughout the election campaign that he would not enter into any agreement with the independents as this would be against all of his Party's rules;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) that as a result of this agreement, Mr Field has compromised his and his party's policies which were to provide jobs for the people employed in the timber and mining industries of Tasmania;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) that unions associated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions have, within 24 hours of the Green-Labor coalition agreement being signed, given notice that they deplore the actions of the Tasmanian Labor Party and Mr Shane Murphy, Secretary of the Timber Workers Union has said, `the union's executive had moved to disaffiliate from Labor after hearing of the agreement and mass meetings of the rank and file across the State were planned for this week; and--</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Robert Ray-Mr President, I raise a point of order. It seems to me that in this notice of motion Senator Walters is breaching the guidance that you have given on other occasions, with far too much detail and argument being put into a notice of motion.

<PARA> (d) that, in spite of the Green-Labor coalition agreement, the Leader of the Coalition Opposition in Tasmania (Mr Field), still maintains that he has not entered in to any formal form of agreement with the Green Independents and will be `governing alone'.</PARA>
<PARA>As proof of the inaccuracies referred to in paragraph (d), I now seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the coalition agreement to which I have referred in my notice of motion.</PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>

<PARA> (a) Labor confirms that the introduction of fixed four-year parliamentary terms will be a priority in its first year of office.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Green Independent members agree-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) to support the Labor Government's Budget and Supply Bills;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) not to support or abstain from any Opposition motion of non-confidence;</PARA>

<PARA> (b) minimum monthly meetings between relevant Green Independent spokespersons, ministers and appropriate public servants</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Green Independent members to be given access to the State Service with formal interviews implemented through the Premier's Office</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Cabinet and Green Independent members to meet on a regular basis to discuss general policy matters. Frequency of meetings to be by agreement</PARA>
<PARA> (e) Green Independent members to be given the option of attending ministerial and similar conferences as observers</PARA>
<PARA> (f) Green Independent members to be enabled to make policy submissions to ministers prior to any decision by Cabinet. This may be achieved through Cabinet committees.</PARA>
<PARA> (g) Green Independent members to be guaranteed pre-Cabinet consultation on legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>2. Parliamentary Reform</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a total review of parliamentary procedures and standing orders to-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) develop a more open parliamentary system;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) enable individual members to have greater input into the legislative process;</PARA>

<PARA> (b) Green Independents to be consulted if Cabinet is not going to accept recommendations of selection panel or if Cabinet is to make a direct appointment</PARA>
<PARA> (c) agreed mechanism to resolve a dispute would be that in the event of disagreement Green Independent spokesperson would consult with the minister prior to an appointment being made.</PARA>
<PARA>4. Legislative Research Service</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The legislative research service should be divided into three categories;</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the economy;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) ecological management</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) social issues.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Each category should have the equivalent of at least one full time position. These experienced researchers will provide members with explanations, analysis and assessments of subject information and of policy and public issues as requested by members of the Opposition, crossbenches, government backbenchers and Legislative Council.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The researchers should be seconded from the bureaucracy for from one week to six months depending on the nature of requests. (The number of secondments will vary from time to time according to demand).</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Secondment would give enterprising public servants the opportunity for first hand experience with the parliament. Secondment would also reduce the budget allocation needed for this service.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) To operate efficiently and effectively the team would require a manager-research co-ordinator and a secretary. The Green Independents should be consulted on the appointment of the manager-research co-ordinator. At least two other permanent research librarians must be provided for the use of all members (see Tasmanian Parliamentary Library Consultancy Report 1988).</PARA>

<PARA> 12. The World Heritage Planning Team within the Department of Lands, Parks and Wildlife will prepare a report on the appropriate boundaries of a Western Tasmania World Heritage Area (with the existing National Estate Area as a reference point) for presentation to the World Heritage Committee by 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> 13. Any National Estate forests within the greater Western Tasmania National Estate Area that a Labor Government agrees to protect will also be nominated for World Heritage.</PARA>
<PARA> 14. National Estate Forests:</PARA>
<PARA> This agreement recognises the importance of protecting National Estate forests and the need for a Labor Government to strive to achieve this objective. It will be the stated policy of a Labor Government to give full and on-going protection of National Estate values and, together with the assistance of the Federal Government, ensure that the interests of timber-industry workers are protected. The Independents will continue to work for the complete protection of Tasmania's National Estate Areas. To achieve the above objectives:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Further logging and roading will not proceed in areas in which logging has not already been approved under the Federal-State forestry agreement in order to prevent exploitation of the forest resource pending the outcome of the review.</PARA>

<PARA> (i) East Picton;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Jackeys Marsh;</PARA>

<PARA> (c) A review process lasting at least a year will be established immediately upon a Labor Government assuming office to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) investigate alternatives to logging in National Estate areas and nominated areas (as at 31 May 1989) that are not already nominated for World Heritage or included within State reserves;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) assess the economic and employment effects of protecting those National Estate areas from logging operations and the strategies available to overcome these effects;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) ensure that the interests of timber-industry workers are protected.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) That review process will be carried out by a forestry task force whose composition, structure and precise terms of reference will be determined by the Premier, Mr Field, and Dr Bob Brown.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) The resources, staff, data and facilities of the Forestry Commission will be at the disposal of the task force. The task force will also have access to data on forest resources in company concessions.</PARA>
<PARA> (f) Representations to the review will be sought from industry, timber-industry unions, logging contractors, independent experts, conservation groups and other relevant parties.</PARA>
<PARA> (g) The review will investigate but not be limited to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) determination of the proportion of the State's total timber resource that lies within National Estate areas not already nominated for World Heritage or included within State reserves;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) installation of sawlog-recovery (flitch) mills at the State's chipmills and pulpmills;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) allocation of the $41.5 million remaining from the 1988 forestry compensation package;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) increased utilisation of the sawlog resource on private land;</PARA>
<PARA> (v) better utilisation of the sawlog resource at the State's sawmills;</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) intensive management of selected sites;</PARA>
<PARA> (vii) improving efficiency by changing the concession system;</PARA>
<PARA> (viii) establishment of sawlog plantations;</PARA>
<PARA> (ix) increasing financial incentives to logging contractors to recover good-quality sawlogs;</PARA>
<PARA> (x) better supervision of logging operations and segregation of sawlogs throughout the State, and particularly in the ANM concession;</PARA>
<PARA> (xi) technological developments in wood processing;</PARA>
<PARA> (xii) shedding of timber-industry jobs by automation and restructuring carried out by the timber industry itself;</PARA>
<PARA> (xiii) the extent to which logging of National Estate Areas can be delayed without loss of jobs in the timber industry;</PARA>
<PARA> (xiv) the role and future of Tasmania's small sawmills in the forestry industry.</PARA>
<PARA> (h) The $41.5 million remaining from last year's compensation package will be used to help implement alternatives to logging National Estate Areas and to ensure the protection of timber-industry workers' interests. The Independents will participate in the allocation of that $41.5 million.</PARA>
<PARA> 15. Any National Estate Areas which the review identifies as not essential to the logging industry will be protected as national parks.</PARA>
<PARA> 16. There will be a full review of the Forestry Commission and a move to abolish the concession system.</PARA>
<PARA> 17. Areas already agreed to be nominated for World Heritage as a result of last year's Tasmanian Forestry Agreement will be protected as national parks, in 1989.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate censures Senator Schacht for his conduct in making use in the Senate adjournment debate on Monday May 29 of an illicitly-obtained transcript of a private meeting of Senators and Members and his subsequent destruction of the material. </PARA>
<PARA>It is now a little over a year since we moved into this building. From the time we arrived, senators have been expressing concern about the perils of living in an era of high technology. On behalf of the Opposition, for example, I raised with you, Mr President, the question of whether the sophisticated equipment attached to our telephone system would enable the telephone numbers dialled by senators to be recorded, in the way that the hotels and motels that we occupy so often record those numbers. I was assured that attention had been paid to that aspect of privacy. In Estimates Committee A senators have raised a succession of concerns about the security in this sophisticated building, about the capacity of the recording system to record when, perhaps, things are not meant to be recorded-about our capacity to have any privacy at all in this electronic age. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not, of course, the subject of this censure motion. I simply remind the Senate that over the past 12 months I and numerous other senators have expressed concern at the potential invasion of privacy in this age of sophisticated electronics. Yesterday, Mr President, I welcomed your statement that you and the Speaker of the House of Representatives were taking seriously the concerns that had been expressed by both Opposition and Government senators and members about the potential for flagrant breaches of our civil liberties. I note that at the same time as Senator Schacht was making his grubby use of his grubbily obtained material, a more experienced Australian Labor Party man, perhaps a Labor man from a different tradition-the Hon. Gordon Scholes-was raising with the Speaker his concerns about the abuses that can occur in this building. In raising those matters at the beginning of this censure debate, Mr President, I say simply that we believe that you, as the person we have elected as the President of the Senate, of all senators, will devote your energies to trying to ensure that outsiders-people of ill will-will not be able to abuse the communications system in this building and make private communications impossible. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a very important issue which stands on its own. But this censure motion is not about that; it is about the fact that the best systems in the world-systems designed to avoid abuse by criminal elements, by subversive elements, by those who would destroy the Parliament, and perhaps even our society-cannot protect us against anything if fundamental ethics are not applied to the behaviour of senators and members in this building. Ultimately, the only thing that can protect us from the sort of subversion that we would all wish to avoid is a bit of honesty. Senator Schacht is a new member who comes straight out of the splendid bureaucratic mould of the modern Australian Labor Party. I doubt whether he has ever done an honest day's work in his life, but he has certainly done plenty of work for the Labor Party and moved the numbers around and so on. He came into this place and in a debate on the adjournment quoted extensively from what was clearly an illicitly obtained transcript of a private meeting. It was not even a private meeting just of Opposition senators and members but an all-party private meeting dealing with one of the most sensitive issues of public policy that we can be called upon to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA> This censure motion is not about that issue and it should be no part of that debate. I suppose its only relevance is that, in the range of issues we are called upon to deal with, the question of abortion and the right to life is one of the most vexed and most difficult. The difficulties are not confined to the Opposition or to the Labor Party. It is an issue which men and women of goodwill can feel fundamentally divided on, and the public statement of the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, over recent days is just the most recent illustration of the complexity and difficulty of that issue. I say again that its only relevance to this debate is that when senators and members get together for the purpose of trying to work out how to promote their view of the public interest-a matter which is fraught with very great personal and political difficulty for all participants on all sides-it is absurd that those people cannot meet in a committee room of this place without having their conversations illicitly taken down and transcribed. If we are to believe Senator Schacht-and as a person deemed to be an honourable senator we must believe him-the transcript was handed to Senator Schacht to use in the way that he used it in the adjournment debate in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the wholehearted view of the Opposition that Senator Schacht, in the difficult business of politics-and we all acknowledge its difficulty-has fundamentally failed to acknowledge standards which should be followed in this place. We do not believe that it is proper for a senator to lend himself to this illicit taping of a private meeting in the way that Senator Schacht has done. He has come into this place and made certain denials, which seem to be carefully worded. For example, he said that he personally was not involved in the recording or taping of the meeting in question. His words were:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I again emphasise that I was not involved in the recording or taping of the meeting in question. </PARA>
<PARA>He is twice on the record as saying that. He has not told us-perhaps he will tell us in this debate today-whether his staff or people in any sense acting in common purpose with him were involved in the taping. We might hope for some enlightenment from Senator Schacht as to whether he is taking a lawyer's tight definition of his words or whether he is saying that he was in no way involved in this. Perhaps he will enlighten the Senate. We do not believe that that goes to the basic issue about which we are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear that the Labor Party was aware of what happened. I think Mr Scholes's rather more concerned and honourable behaviour indicates that. I have reason to believe that the Minister at the table, Senator Robert Ray, who will be responding, had some earlier knowledge of the availability of this material. The Opposition believes that this censure should be carried because it should be made absolutely clear to all senators and members that having truck with this sort of behaviour is something that we should not have to put up with in this building. The perils from those who would destroy this institution are real enough without having it destroyed from within. The fact is that Senator Schacht, in his use of this material, has fallen below the required standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me also say that Senator Schacht was faced with the proposition that this morning we would have debated in this place a motion, of which I gave notice yesterday, that we should have laid on the table of the Senate before 2 o'clock today any document quoted from or used by Senator Schacht during the adjournment debate in the Senate on 29 May 1989; and a statement by Senator Schacht setting out how he obtained any document from which he quoted. He has, of course, refused to acknowledge the latter part of that. He has come up with the old plea that he must protect his sources. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact is that Senator Schacht-in an action which makes him, as one of my colleagues pointed out, the Ollie North of the Senate-put the document into the Minister's shredder. That is what we are told he did. Again, it reduces the standards of this place to the standards that we have looked at elsewhere and have been rather critical of. I heard an interjection from Senator Collins; he is another man who should have been a defence lawyer. He almost rivals Senator Barney Cooney in his capacity to take a dock brief in a hopeless case. Senator Collins's interjection was, `What about material put in by Senator Tambling?'. There has been no shortage of documents which have fallen off the back of trucks being used in this place and in the House of Representatives by both sides of Parliament-no shortage at all. I am glad that Senator Collins interjected, because it enables me to draw what I think is the appropriate distinction. In those cases we are talking about material which comes into the hands of senators and members through the acts of third parties and which is used in the course of political debate in this place-and there have been some very famous examples of that. The Age tapes are a classic case. The difference is that, quite clearly, in this case members of the Labor Party have conspired to breach the confidentiality of private meetings, to tape record them, to produce a transcript and to use it in this place. That is behaviour which I believe everybody in Australia would accept as distinct and different from a circumstance in which people who are not part of this Parliament choose to make material available, whether it is to one side of the Parliament or the other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A most recent example is when members of the Labor Party made material available to Senator Bronwyn Bishop relating to the behaviour of Senator Richardson with respect to the dismissal of a public servant in Washington. They are matters which are not unusual in this place.There is a total difference between the situation where a senator, like Senator Schacht, is involved in subversion in a direct way of the private discussions of his colleagues, including colleagues from his own side of the Senate. That is what Senator Schacht's crime is. That is why he is deserving of censure in this place, and that is why he has entered into a totally different line of conduct from those which are the subject of the interjection from Senator Collins. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no absolute protection against abuse in this building. It requires a little honesty on the part of honourable senators. We have certainly not seen that from Senator Schacht. The view of the Opposition is that he should be censured. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I heard Senator Chaney in silence; I would appreciate it if he would extend to me the same courtesy. As I said, I made remarks in the Senate about what I thought was relevant information. It was certainly not the first time in this chamber, or in the other chamber, since Federation, that information has been given in debate when people have had access to details of what has gone on in a private meeting. I would be extraordinarily surprised if an Opposition member, some time tomorrow or the day after, got very fulsome details of an internal meeting of the Australian Labor Party, of, say, a Caucus meeting, and did not give full details of it in this chamber to get some advantage if he thought it would embarrass the Labor Party. I would be surprised if he did not. As I said in my statement last night, I accept that that is what politics is about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my 22 months in this chamber I have been continually surprised at the level of sanctimoniousness to which members of the Opposition will go in order to proclaim their defence of this institution of parliamentary democracy, particularly Senator Chaney. He has taken sanctimoniousness to a new level and made it a new art form. For somebody who only three weeks ago was saying one thing to John Howard to his face while planting a number of knives in his back and planning to knock him off as leader, I find his sanctimoniousness here today about propriety, honesty and so on quite remarkable. One of the things that I have noticed is the composition of this censure motion compared with that of the notice of motion that Senator Chaney gave yesterday. I do not know why Senator Chaney has not proceeded with the notice of motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would have thought that on my admission that I had destroyed my material Senator Chaney would have jumped up today and moved his motion which included the famous phrase that a senator not be permitted to speak. I do not know in the record of the Senate whether anybody else has ever had such a motion put on the Notice Paper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say to Senator Chaney that although he is not proceeding with it now, that notice of motion he moved yesterday will haunt him and be used against him for the rest of his political life. He is against free speech; he wants to gag the right of people to say what they like in this chamber. Whether he finds it distasteful or not, the impression is that he is out to gag people. He intended to make sure that I did not say what I believed to be correct. I do not ask him to accept my argument or my views, but to bring into this Senate a motion that I cannot ever be heard again unless I meet his demands is extraordinary. I hope that in the years to come he will not object when we remind him that he is against free speech. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to remind honourable senators opposite-there are not too many left-that their party philosophically goes back to the days of Alfred Deakin, one of the small `l' liberals and one of the people who started the non-Labor side of politics in this country. I do not know where Alfred Deakin is buried, but he would turn over in his grave if he found that a leader of the Opposition in the Senate had put on the Notice Paper a motion saying that a senator cannot speak in this chamber. The people who make the choice as to whether I speak are the electors of South Australia. If they choose not to elect me to the Senate I accept that judgment. When they put me here they gave me the right to speak in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not the first time I have run into politicians who have attempted to gag me. In 1983 I visited Tahiti where I spoke publicly against French nuclear testing. I described Tahiti as `French occupied Polynesia'. The French secret police said it would be a very good idea if I left the country because they did not want to hear what I had to say. I was escorted onto a plane by armed gendarmes. Has anybody from the Opposition had the guts to go to a place such as Tahiti to speak out against French nuclear testing and take on the French secret police? The answer is no. I wish to give another example. Today in this building I am hosting a visit by a man called Issayas Aferwerki, the Secretary-General of the Eritrean Peoples' Liberation Front. For 26 years he and his people have been fighting for democracy and for the right to have free speech in their country. It is interesting that, on the day they are present, the business sheet contains a motion to be moved by Senator Chaney that a senator cannot speak. Fancy saying to him, `This is the model that you should have in your country when you get your independence, that a motion can be moved so that you cannot be heard in your chamber'. </PARA>
<PARA> The last example I can remember of this occurring in the Westminster system occurred in the eighteenth century, when John Wilkes, in the Westminster Parliament, passed a few remarks against the king of England. The king's supporters in the Parliament had him gagged. The people were forced into a special by-election and Wilkes was returned to the Parliament, and again gagged. In the end he won the right for people to stand in the Parliament and speak their piece even if the other members do not like one word that they utter. </PARA>
<PARA> What Senator Chaney is about is gagging those who have views with which he does not agree, those whom he finds distasteful. He may say that what I said was distasteful and he has every right to say it. I will not move a motion to gag him because of what he says. He should read and understand a few episodes in the history of the evolution of the Westminster system. Overnight, Senator Chaney realised that he had pulled a bit of a boner with this motion to try to gag a senator; so he backed off. The sanctimonious senator from Western Australia squibbed it, as most Liberals will squib the pressure. </PARA>

I said last night that I would not table the document and that I would not reveal my sources, and the senator has chucked this motion into the bin and moved a censure motion in the thought that there would be a better chance of its being carried by the Senate. He knew that nobody but the robots behind him among the Liberals and the Nationals would vote for gagging a senator, and so it should be. Senator Chaney went on at great length about the taping. I have sat in this Senate for 22 months. I have heard Senator Bronwyn Bishop produce material, a so-called tape, about the Castlereagh by-election.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Electoral Commission has judged Senator Bronwyn Bishop, who has been described by Peter Ward in the magazine section of the Australian as the Eva Peron of the Liberal Party in New South Wales. That is probably an apt description.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept Senator Calvert's opinion that what I said was in poor taste. He should also accept that even though he thinks it was in poor taste, I had the right to use this institution to say it. There are very few places in Australia in which people have the right to say what they think. The parliamentary institution is one of them-the Federal Parliament and the State and Territory parliaments. Senator Chaney went on with the usual humbug when he talked about how I abused this institution. He wants to try to make a political point, to embarrass me and accuse me of some sort of activity. That is his right; he can keep doing that. His censure motion may be carried by the Senate; that is fine. But I say to Senator Chaney that if he were really fair dinkum he would have moved the other motion of which he gave notice and tried to debate the issue that a senator may be gagged because another senator does not like what that senator says. He tipped his hand on that issue. He made a real boner yesterday. I do not know whether the electors of Pearce will elect him to the lower House, but I would like to see him try to use that sort of tactic in the House of Representatives-if he is successful in gaining a seat in that House-whereby, if he does not like what someone says, he tries to move to gag him. He will be treated with contempt by his peers for misusing the Standing Orders because when he cannot take the heat he squeals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been accused of making remarks in poor taste. The one person I do apologise to-I now say it to him because he is in the chamber; I said it last night-is Senator Harradine because on Monday night I did not inform him that I was going to speak on this matter. Quite rightly, he is upset about that. I apologise to him for that. I must say that there have been a few occasions in the past when I have been attacked in this chamber by honourable senators opposite. They never inform me beforehand that they intend to do so. I do not expect them to; that is fair cop in this game. I remember honourable senators opposite raising in Estimates committee hearings the cost of the establishment of my electorate office. They made a lot of play about it in the media in Adelaide. I did not complain; I did not whinge about it; I did not stand here and say, `That is terrible, why didn't you tell me about it beforehand?'. Opposition senators thought they could make a political point. I am willing to cop that. In this game one must cop a few kicks now and again. If one cannot take the heat, that is fine. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney had a couple of swipes about whether I had legal advice. I say to Senator Chaney that if he represents the average ability of members of the legal profession in Australia-I understand that he was a lawyer-it shows why I supported very strongly the reference to a Senate committee of the matter of the high cost of law in Australia. If Senator Chaney represents the level of competence of Australian lawyers, it is no wonder that many Australian citizens are getting fed up with the poor deal they are getting from our legal system. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney raised the matter of whether I have done an honest day's work in my life, and so on. It is true that for over 20 years I was employed in one form or another by the Australian Labor Party. Some people may say that that is not a very arduous position. That is a matter of judgment. All I can say to Senator Chaney is that since 1969, as an official of the Labor Party in South Australia, I participated in about 27 election campaigns. I take great delight in telling Senator Chaney that on most of those occasions we kicked his mob out of office. The coalition in South Australia has won two elections since 1969, one of which it won by cheating; it got 43 per cent of the vote and, because of the gerrymander, it stayed in office. It lost all the others, other than in 1979. It is for Senator Chaney to judge whether he calls that hard work. I enjoyed doing it to his Party. I am sure that I will continue to play my role and keep doing it to his Party in South Australia. Before I became involved full time in politics, I trained as a school teacher. Unlike some Opposition senators, I did not have a golden spoon in my mouth. I had to do it off my own bat. </PARA>

<PARA> If I am censured by the Senate, so be it. I will treat it as a political stunt on Senator Chaney's part. All I know is that Senator Chaney was not game to move his original motion. Had it been carried, we would have had to move such motions every day. For example, unless Senator Tambling indicated who his sources were, we would not let him speak. The next day, it would be someone else. Once Senator Chaney started down that road, people would say: Who is next? He made a boner in regard to that proposed motion. He could not go through with it. He had been told by his Party that it was a stupid motion, so he moved a general censure motion against me. That is a good, reliable tactic. He has had time to put his case. Although he may say that what I did on Monday night was in poor taste, I say it was in accordance with what is the cut and thrust of politics in this place. If he cannot take the heat, he is in for a terrible belting if he is successful in moving to the House of Representatives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chaney has moved:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate censures Senator Schacht for his conduct in making use in the Senate adjournment debate on Monday May 29 of an illicitly-obtained transcript of a private meeting of Senators and Members and his subsequent destruction of the material. </PARA>
<PARA>This is clearly not a matter which falls under the Standing Orders. When it was raised with the President he made a statement on the matter-I think that statement would probably be accepted by most honourable senator-that it clearly falls outside the parameters of the Standing Orders. However, it does fall within an area which must be of great concern to every senator who has to work in this building. The matter we are discussing has been fairly clearly set out, first in the speech by Senator Schacht during the adjournment debate on 29 May, and again in the speech he made during the adjournment debate last night. I accept the statement by Senator Schacht last night that he was not involved in the recording or taping of the meeting in question. The fact that a senator comes into this place after there has been some controversy with regard to these matters and makes a clear statement as to where he stands, in the absence of any other evidence, should be taken as being the truth. I take it as being the truth that Senator Schacht was not involved in the recording or taping of the meeting in question. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at Senator Schacht's speech of 29 May, one must accept that the meeting to which he referred was recorded. His references to the meeting involved a very clear setting out of the discussions that took place during the meeting. I know that people who were present at the meeting, in speaking to the press and elsewhere, have quibbled with some of the points raised by Senator Schacht as being inaccurate. By and large, each of those people has added that he thinks the meeting was recorded because Senator Schacht referred to the basic flow of the discussion and to many of the finer details.</PARA>
<PARA> I think that honourable senators would be aware-and it has probably happened to quite a number of people in this place-that from time to time the sound system in this building has been on in committee meetings and other meetings that take place in the committee rooms. I understand that a number of journalists have taken to twiddling the dial on our little radio sets to see whether any particular committee meeting happens to be being broadcast inadvertently. I do not know-no-one has suggested it and, therefore, it must be left in the realm of speculation-whether anybody deliberately set out to tape this particular meeting. A more reasonable conjecture would be that one of the twiddlers of the dials picked it up. There is no way of knowing whether it was a journalist, a member of parliament or a staffer. However, it seems that somebody with skills in being able to take it down in either shorthand or some other method picked it up. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition senators interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It might be reasonable for honourable senators to listen to what I have to say on the matter before they make judgments. It seems that some people who have skills in taking down such matters were involved. That would probably point to a shorthand typist, a journalist with shorthand skills, or somebody in, for example, the Hansard Department, whose staff have exceptional skills in such matters. However, no matter who it was-at the moment there seems to be no evidence to suggest who it was and nobody has attempted to raise the matter of who it was-the transcript was provided to Senator Schacht. Senator Schacht then made use of the transcript in this place with regard to attacking the Pro-Life Group on a matter about which, people are happy to admit, he feels reasonably strongly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As honourable senators have said, the whole exercise is whether Senator Schacht should be censured for engaging in the activity, that is-all that we know at the moment-using an illicitly obtained transcript, as Senator Chaney's motion calls it, in the chamber. The second part of Senator Chaney's motion contains the words `and his subsequent destruction of the material'. Last night Senator Schacht said:</PARA>
<PARA> After the adjournment I had a meeting with the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Robert Ray, about the status of the material from which it was claimed I had quoted. In particular, my primary concern was that if the material was circulated, it would jeopardise the confidentiality of my sources and it was on this basis that I sought Senator Ray's advice as to what I should do with the material. Senator Ray advised that as the Senate had rejected the resolution that the material be tabled, I was free to do what I liked with it; therefore, to ensure the protection of my sources, the material was destroyed late last night . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I think that Senator Ray's advice was probably what might be termed good political advice. It was certainly accurate advice-that is, that Senator Schacht was free to do precisely what he liked with the material. Senator Schacht chose to destroy the material. I do not believe that on that basis Senator Schacht would be able to be censured. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that there are grounds for censure as to the first part and I will explain it more fully. I intend to move an amendment to Senator Chaney's motion to test whether the Senate is serious about this issue, that is, to add after the word `members', leaving out `and his subsequent destruction of the material', the words:</PARA>
<PARA> and Senator Tambling for his conduct in making use in the Senate of illicitly-obtained material from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and any other senator who has used material illicitly-obtained from an individual or a group or from a department of state, and urges serious consideration of the establishment of an ethics committee. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason for the amendment-if it successfully attaches to Senator Chaney's motion honourable senators will vote for the censure of Senator Schacht, Senator Tambling and other senators who have used illicit material-is that I believe there is an area that falls outside the Standing Orders and within the area, as Senator Chaney said, quite rightly, of ethics. The material about which we are talking has been obtained illicitly. I do not happen to believe that what Senator Schacht did was in poor taste; I happen to believe that it was unethical. I do not believe that what Senator Tambling did was political; I happen to believe that it was unethical. I happen to believe that any other senator who uses that type of material is engaging in unethical conduct. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, Senator. It is interesting that Senator Tambling, by way of interjection, which may or may not have been picked up-I am sure that he will disagree if I have his interjection wrong-said that he had tabled all the documents. Quite frankly, that makes not a hap'orth of difference to the context of whether the material was obtained illicitly. The question is what is done with it subsequently. The documents were still obtained illicitly. They were still stolen documents. They were stolen from a department of state by some person within that department of state. I am not saying that Senator Tambling either sought or encouraged anybody, in any way, to provide him with that material. I have no evidence of that and I certainly would not want to make that allegation. He was, as it were, the innocent recipient of a lot of stolen material. But he chose to use it. Likewise, I do not know, and there is no evidence of it, whether Senator Schacht sought or encouraged anybody to provide him with that material. Senator Chaney did not make that accusation and Senator Schacht did not respond to any such accusations. I have no way of knowing that and I do not believe that any other senator has a way of knowing that. We must take it that both Senator Tambling and Senator Schacht were the innocent recipients of material. The fact that they both chose to use it I regard as unethical.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The difficulty with the context-it has already been said by Senator Schacht in his own defence-is that we do not have ethical standards by which to operate in this chamber. In a sense the motion before us is retrospective. It refers to something that has gone on to date. In other words, it suggests that there should be ethical standards. I concur totally with that. I happen to believe that the censure motion should be carried with my attachment. I hope that honourable senators, having considered the position-and certainly Opposition senators, knowing how distasteful they find this context-will also be able to feel how distasteful many Government members felt when Senator Tambling used stolen material in this place. All those on the receiving end of the use of stolen material get very upset. They are outraged and feel that something should be done. However, it is amazing how that outrage tends to dissipate once somebody who supports our own political position manages to find some damaging material about our political opponents. </PARA>
<PARA> A more productive stance regarding the issue with which we are confronted today would be to seek among all parties serious consideration of the motion of establishing an ethics committee with a view to drawing up a code of conduct for members of parliament. It may or may not be that the issue before us ends up before such a committee. Indeed, when one considers the ramifications of not permitting the use of stolen material in this chamber, one would be making a heavy inroad into many of the things that go on. For example, I can remember when in 1982 Senator Chaney, who moved the motion before us, was a Minister and was having a tussle with then Senator Grimes over material that Senator Grimes had received from a department. Senator Chaney made quite a number of comments about the use of stolen material. In other words, he, as the responsible Minister, was outraged, quite rightly, that somebody within his Department had stolen material that did not belong to him and leaked it to his political opponent. It happens constantly. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking about how this material is obtained, not how it is finally used. I believe that its final use by Senator Schacht was unethical, as I believe its use by other honourable senators would be. I will be supporting the censure motion and move as an amendment to the motion:</PARA>
<PARA> After `Members', insert ``and Senator Tambling for his conduct in making use in the Senate of illicitly-obtained material from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and any other senator who has used material illicitly-obtained from an individual or a group or from a department of state and urges serious consideration of the establishment of an ethics committee.''</PARA>
<PARA>If my amendment is not carried, I will still be voting for the motion because it, at least in part, raises some of the points that I, on behalf of my Party, have just made to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> Last night Senator Schacht again rose to his feet on the adjournment of this place and referred to `the issue of material I quoted from last night in an adjournment debate'. Even up to that point Senator Schacht was in the first place guilty of dissimulation on this matter. On Monday night he did not talk about the material he was quoting from. As recorded on page 2962 of the Senate Hansard Senator Schacht, when referring to a meeting of the so-called Pro-Life Group which took place in Parliament House on Tuesday evening of the previous week, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Sources have given me a very detailed run-down of the discussion that took place in that meeting at about 5 o'clock last Tuesday. </PARA>
<PARA>As shown on the following page, 2963, of the Hansard he said:</PARA>
<PARA> From my sources, I have some pretty detailed discussions. </PARA>
<PARA>At another point of the Hansard on the same page he said:</PARA>
<PARA> According to my sources . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is as though he had had an oral report of some kind from perhaps someone who was present at that meeting. The impression with which the Senate could have been left from listening to Senator Schacht that night was that there was a leak from somebody present at that meeting or somebody who talked to somebody who was present at that meeting. The Hansard report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>one of the discussions that took place at this meeting concerned tactics . . .</PARA>
<PARA>And so he went on. Midway through his remarks on page 2963 Senator Schacht began to diverge somewhat from this presentation of depending upon sources, oral communications. He began to quote, putting the words in the Senate Hansard in quotation marks. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> `If we are successful in having legislation passed to remove Medicare payments, there will be a lot more unwanted children'. One member said, `We have to have an absolutely foolproof oversupply of pregnancy support services'. Another member present-it may have been Senator Harradine-said, `I cannot follow the argument. I donate to pregnancy support all the time'. </PARA>
<PARA>And so on. Senator Schacht, after having begun by presenting to the Senate material from sources, went on at a later part of his remarks to make it clear to observant listeners that in fact he was quoting from some kind of transcript. It is now clear that Senator Schacht was in fact quoting from a document that was either a full transcript of the proceedings of that private meeting of members and senators from all parties in this place or a very full significant extract from such a transcript. It is also clear--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator STONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to Senator Crowley's interjection as to whether we know that in a moment. It is also clear that there was, indeed there may be still, a tape recording of those proceedings. What did Senator Schacht say about that in his remarks to the Senate last night? Like Senator Macklin, who said that we have not yet received yesterday's Senate Hansard, I cannot quote from the official record but I can quote from a transcript of what Senator Schacht said last night. I hope that Senator Schacht will not contradict me. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . I can state unequivocally that I-</PARA>
<PARA>underline `I'-</PARA>
<PARA>did not tape the meeting of the Pro-Life Group which took place last week. </PARA>
<PARA>Later in his remarks he said:</PARA>
<PARA> In doing so, I again emphasise that I was not involved in the recording or taping of the meeting in question. </PARA>
<PARA>On that point, let me say that I accept Senator Schacht's assurance to the Senate that he was not involved in the taping of that meeting. Indeed, the words of Senator Chaney's censure motion do not accuse him of that. They seek to have the Senate censure Senator Schacht for his conduct in making use of the results of the taping. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me digress for one moment to a couple of other related incidents arising from these events, apparently, of last week. First, on Thursday of last week, 25 May, Mr Scholes, the honourable member for Corio, who after all has held high office in the House of Representatives, got up in the House of Representatives, 36 hours after this meeting had occurred-I suggest that it is no coincidence; it would have taken about that time for the proceedings of that meeting to be transcribed and for the existence of that record to have become known within some ranks of the Australian Labor Party-and said:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Speaker, I wish to raise with you a matter which impinges on the privileges of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>This was quite out of the blue. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The broadcasting from committee rooms in this House is remotely controlled. The Chairman or members of a committee have no indication of or control over whether the proceedings of a committee are being broadcast. The broadcasting of the proceedings of private meetings of committees or of committees which are in camera is a breach of the privileges of this House. </PARA>
<PARA>There are some questions as to whether Mr Scholes is correct in stating that, although I have no reason to question his view. But that is not the issue. The point is that on Thursday morning of last week Mr Scholes got up in the House of Representatives and raised a matter of concern, this question of broadcasts out of committee rooms of this House being available to be picked up by, perhaps, those who might choose to monitor such broadcasts. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to another piece of fallout, if I can call it that, from these events of last week. Again I cannot be certain, and I therefore make no assertion, that this is in fact a consequence of these events last week. But on Monday night Senator Schacht referred to Senator Tate's position. On page 2964 of the Senate Hansard Senator Schacht said:</PARA>
<PARA> Then the discussion got round to the role of Senate Michael Tate, who is a member of the Pro-Life Group. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a matter of public record, and was before it was put on the Senate record by Senator Schacht. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> I gather that, at the meeting, there was certainly some bad spleen vented about the way Senator Tate had refused to go along with the proposal to introduce amendments to stop Medicare payments. Since then, Senator Tate has published a letter and made statements to the effect that, although he has a pro-life view, he wants women to be able to choose not to have abortions. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not going to enter into a debate as to the rights and wrongs of the so-called pro-life argument-or is it the pro-choice argument? What I am saying is that we are aware that Senator Tate did in fact make some public statements which seem to suggest I put it no higher than that-that the fact that those proceedings became publicly known, by way of transcript may have placed Senator Tate in an embarrassing personal situation. Senator Tate may want to say something about that at a later point. I simply raise that possibility. But it is clear-and this is the reason I raise it-that where we have a group of this kind meeting on a very sensitive subject, and in this case including members from all parties, what those people may want to say in the confines, and what they understand to be the privacy, of a committee room of this Parliament can, if it indeed comes into wider possession within the Parliament, cause any of those members or senators very great personal embarrassment. I leave that point there. </PARA>
<PARA> I and others have said that the motion moved by Senator Chaney focuses on two points: first of all, the need to censure Senator Schacht for his conduct in making use in the Senate adjournment debate of an illicitly obtained transcript of a private meeting of senators and members; and secondly, his subsequent destruction of the material. Let me take the second point first. Following an approach to him by the Leader of the Opposition and others and following these events on Monday night, the President yesterday informed the Senate of the preliminary action he had taken arising out of that incident, including discussions he had already had with Madam Speaker in the other place, and of his intention to undertake further action to deal with the possibility-I would say what is now clearly the certainty-that a broadcast was made out of one of the committee rooms which should not have been made and was illicitly recorded and transcribed. Senator Schacht has said as to that point:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I will be more than willing to offer any assistance-</PARA>
<PARA>that is to the President-</PARA>
<PARA>regarding this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>Those were Senator Schacht's words. Yet last night he told the Senate that he had destroyed his copy of the transcript or extracts from the transcript, which is after all the subject of the President's investigation. </PARA>

<PARA> Let me now come to the more important charge, the charge relating to Senator Schacht's conduct in making use in the Senate adjournment debate last Monday night of an illicitly obtained transcript of a private meeting. Senator Schacht has sought to justify this-and indeed Senator Macklin gave us a long discourse on the same subject-by referring to the fact that in both this place and the other place senators and members from time to time make use of what are, I think, colloquially referred to as `leaks'. They may be leaks from the bureaucracy, they may be leaks from the Cabinet room, they may be leaks from the Caucus or they may be leaks from the coalition party room, but leaks are used. I have never found that a very attractive manner of proceeding. Nevertheless--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator STONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I were the honourable senator, I would be careful of saying things like that, because he does not want any more egg on his face about his personal conduct in this place. In particular, Senator Schacht referred-and again Senator Macklin has referred to it this morning and indeed has made it the subject of an amendment to the censure motion-to a number of interventions in this place by my National Party colleague Senator Tambling in the area of Aboriginal affairs. Senator Tambling has been favoured with a great many documents-leaks-from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the Aboriginal Development Commission and many other quarters in a portfolio area which has become a shambles and a disgrace, not only to this Government but also to the conduct of the administration of this country. In those circumstances, Senator Tambling has been the recipient of many leaks from public servants who have clearly been pushed beyond their bounds-and I do not justify their behaviour-by a Minister and a group of activists around that Minister who have used those public servants shamefully. I do not want to pursue that point further, other than to say that last night Senator McMullan and Senator Collins also spoke in the adjournment debate attacking Senator Tambling on the same point. It was clearly a good, professional, concerted attempt by Australian Labor Party senators to divert attention from the disgraceful conduct of their colleague Senator Schacht.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw a very clear distinction-this seems to be a distinction that Senator Macklin is incapable of drawing, judging by his amendment-between this episode and the use of the documents or other forms of report leaked out of the bureaucracy, the Caucus or the Cabinet by certain people. Those are what I largely regard as unfortunate facts of life in the political system and the way it operates. But the fact is that leaks occur and they are used, as is rightly said, by most members and senators in this place. The question is whether such leaks are comparable to the use, by Senator Schacht, of a clandestinely recorded transcript of a private meeting of members and senators in a committee room of Parliament House. I suggest that the answer is that there is no comparison between the two things. </PARA>
<PARA> People can argue in both directions about the question of leaks. There are those who argue that beyond a certain point it is in the public interest that documents should be leaked. I myself do not accept that argument. However, there are arguments to that effect, and there are arguments to the contrary. I put it to honourable senators, including honourable senators opposite, that it cannot be argued that it is appropriate to have committee rooms in this building bugged-whether bugging as it is normally understood, or bugging by making use of the high-tech electronic equipment in those rooms- clandestinely to record proceedings. I cannot imagine anybody in this place arguing that that is desirable, though I will listen with interest to see whether I am wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> If such material is obtained, as obviously happened in this case, it is then a matter for members or senators-in this case, senators-to make up their minds whether to use it. It is like knocking on the door of a member's or senator's room and walking in, not knowing that he is not there. On the desk is, let us say, a Cabinet document. Is it suggested that the person walking into the room should pick up the document, merely because it is there, and walk out? In the case which is the subject of the motion, is it suggested that because the transcript was there Senator Schacht was right to make use of it? Unless we can have a bare modicum of honour in the conduct between ourselves in this place, there will be no bottom to the pit into which we will descend. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators opposite will recall that a little while ago one of their very distinguished colleagues in the other place-Lionel Bowen-achieved a very considerable milestone in his parliamentary life and, I suggest, in the parliamentary history of the Labor Party. I wrote a personal note to Lionel Bowen-I do not propose to divulge its contents-congratulating him on having pursued an honourable course in this Parliament for so long-something that I thought was more honourable than having been a Minister, or anything like that. Mr Bowen is an old-style Labor man. Does any honourable senator opposite think that John Curtin would have made use of a transcript of that kind in the way that Senator Schacht did on Monday night? Does anyone think that Ben Chifley, in his time, would have got up in the House of Representatives and made use of such a transcript obtained in that way? Or Arthur Calwell? I do not believe that even Mr Gough Whitlam would have made use of such a document in that way-and I do not put him in quite the same category as the other three gentlemen to whom I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that those who touch pitch will be defiled. On Monday night Senator Schacht touched pitch, and he has been defiled. He has lowered the repute and standing of the Parliament. In doing so, he has brought a reflection on all of us. That is one reason-not the most important reason, but one reason-why I personally feel so strongly about this action. Senator Schacht is deserving of the censure of this place. Indeed, whatever the outcome of the votes, Senator Schacht will stand censured not merely in the eyes of people on this side but, I believe, in the eyes of many on his own side, even though, of course, they will march into the lobby to support him, as will the Democrats, who today have once again proved themselves to be the most faithful supporters of the Labor Party in this place, with their diversionary amendment, which will allow them to vote against the motion. That is the only reason for the amendment. The fact is that Senator Schacht already stands censured in the eyes of all parliamentarians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion is about hypocrisy and double standards. The Opposition-I do not extend these remarks to the Democrats or to Senator Harradine-adopts one type of behaviour in a certain set of circumstances but does not apply it in others. That is the essence of this motion. We all make mistakes. Perhaps in this matter I have made mistakes and Senator Schacht has made mistakes. But what is the biggest mistake I have made in the last few weeks? A few days ago journalists asked me how I thought Senator Chaney had come out of the Liberal leadership kerfuffle. I said that he had been through a very traumatic time but I thought that, after the leadership struggle, he was a far better person than he had been before, the one element missing in his performance in this chamber and elsewhere being his well-known and oft-criticised sanctimoniousness. But welcome back, Fred. It was all there today-all the old form, all the old sanctimoniousness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are talking about standards of behaviour. We always get the blowtorch put to us over our behaviour. Senator Chaney got off very lightly in the last few weeks if we are talking about consistent, decent, or even ethical, behaviour. I do not want to go into that in detail, but I have to say that I do not know how he could be loyal to Andrew Peacock up to 1985 and then desert the ship and support Howard. I do not know how he could go on public record as often as five times this year saying that he was loyal to John Howard and criticising others for opening the leadership matter, and then do what he did. Having been approached when the numbers were sewn up, he had a critical choice, an ethical choice, to make: whether to continue to support his leader, or at least provide him with the twenty-eighth vote. He did not do so. </PARA>
<PARA> These are matters of ethics-as much as anything Senator Schacht has been involved in. Yet, while Senator Schacht is brought to account for his behaviour, Senator Chaney is not. But that does not worry me. I thought that Senator Chaney's trauma-and I acknowledge that it would have been a terrible time for any leader-had washed away all that sanctimoniousness, and that all his mirroring of our morals would be gone. But today we have had it all again.</PARA>
<PARA> The worst aspect of this motion is that it devalues censure motions, which are supposed to be specific tools to be used sparingly in the most important circumstances. I do not regard this as justifying those circumstances. I did not regard the matter raised last week against the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, and the Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, as justifying a censure motion. But if this is the case, then every censure motion will go through and everyone will say, `Ho hum, another censure motion in the Senate. Someone had the numbers, someone didn't have the numbers. Ho hum'. It totally devalues the censure motion. </PARA>
<PARA> The guts of the motion refers to the use of illicitly obtained material. How many examples have we had, sitting here in this chamber and the old chamber, of listening to the other side going on hour after hour using illicitly obtained material? How often did my colleague the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, have to sit through the Estimates Committee listening to thousands of questions based on illicitly obtained material? How often did we sit in this chamber and listen to taped phone conversation transcripts on the question of Justice Murphy? How many times have we had to put up with things like that? I will tell the Senate what the distinction is this time, and I will refer to it only once. It is because it affects us. The most pathetic thing about parliamentarians is their incestuous desire to protect their own rights and entitlements. One can go to the Estimates Committee and see $10m go through, but the moment the issue comes up of whether a car driver should open the door for female parliamentarians, whether they should get flowers delivered to their rooms, what their postage rates are, or anything to do with the rights of a parliamentarian, it is elevated above anything else. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what this is about. It is not about the use of illicit material, which happens here all the time. What makes it so special, why we take such an interest in it and why we had all the galahs here earlier on interjecting on the speech made by Senator Schacht is that it affects parliamentarians. That is what this motion is about. It is pathetic. It is an elitist concept that we are above everything else and that to use any illicit material that affects us and our involvement is an absolute crime but that to use truckloads of information from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs is not a crime and is not to be condemned. There is nothing wrong with using documents from the Department of Defence, as have been produced here by Senator Newman, even though they are illicitly obtained, even though they have dropped off the back of trucks, and even though, to get them, some public servant has breached his oath of office. That is okay, but the moment one deals with parliamentary rights it is suddenly elevated way up there. All that indicates is how pathetically elitist we are at times. I have watched it at the Estimates Committee and in privileges debates. I have watched politicians being able to dish it out and not cop it time and time again. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no evidence produced so far in this case that there are tapes; but should someone ever use the product of an illicit tape that clearly was not in accordance with the wishes of the meeting? We have had an example. Apparently it is excused by Senator Bishop because she tabled the tape. So what? Where did she obtain the tape?</PARA>

Not once has she apologised for the distress she caused everyone by using that tape in an opportunistic way. But I do not object to all that. What I object to is that she ran around before her preselection boasting about the use of the tape and the effect that it may have had on the New South Wales election. That is what she did. She was happy to do that then; yet she will come in here full of cant and hypocrisy and vote for a censure of Senator Schacht when her own level of behaviour is not only equal to but far, far worse than his behaviour would ever be in this chamber. That is the cant and hypocrisy of this particular motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take up something that I really did take offence at in what Senator Chaney said. He described Senator Schacht in the following terms: `He has never done an honest day's work in his life'. Not everyone came up the easy way, and I know that Senator Schacht did not. His father was a fitter and turner and then a failed farmer. He did not have a father who was a member of parliament to give him a golden ride through. He did not have that golden ride whereby he could even have a choice of career. The only career open to him was that of a schoolteacher. Senator Chaney made the assertion that he had never done an honest day's work. I have known him for many years. I know how hard he has worked and how dedicated he is. If working in the political area, going out into the back blocks and organising branches, is not an honest day's work, I do not know what is. I would hate to think what Senator Chaney has ever done in his life as a sort of golden spooned lawyer, one of the sons, one of the dynasty of politics. It is all right, there is nothing wrong with being part of the dynasty of politics, but he should not in a snobbish way start getting into other people's behaviour and work patterns. In my view, that is totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> If people are wondering why we are wasting time on a censure motion today, let me tell them that yesterday we had a much worse and sillier motion. Notice was given of a motion unprecedented in this Parliament, that said that unless Senator Schacht behaved in a particular way he could no longer speak in this chamber. I have got doubts as to whether that is constitutional. I could not find any standing order that said it could be done. On the other hand, I did not find one that said it could not be done. There is a group that can stop Senator Schacht speaking in this chamber if it wants to. Any time the South Australian electorate wants to, it can make that decision. The Opposition cannot make that decision for it. I am pleased that at least the Opposition has had the grace to drop off that rather stupid motion. Its precedent in this chamber is worrying. But the precedent for use in the other chamber, where one must have an absolute majority at all time, is absolutely horrifying. The Opposition has set this example here. What happens if in a week's time there is a blow-up in the House of Representatives and a motion is moved that Mr Wilson Tuckey no longer speak in the Parliament for ever?</PARA>

<PARA> I now have to have a major dispute with Senator Schacht and discipline him. He made reference to Deakin as the father of liberalism and as a prime example. Senator Schacht is obviously not a history major, because Deakin was the greatest leak in the history of this Parliament. When he was Prime Minister he was a secret correspondent for the London Post, I think it was. For years he wrote these great articles about what was decided in Cabinet, how brilliant Deakin was and what a decisive role he played. So the first great leak of the Parliament was the father of liberalism. He had no sense of privacy and breached his Executive Council oath time and time again. Senator Schacht is a minor offender. He might have defiled everyone, as Senator Stone said, but he is minor compared with Deakin, the founder of the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA> I make two other points. Senator Stone gave us a long speech. It is probably not true that Senator Stone got down to the National Press Club every Friday night and talked to everyone. I think he was directed not to at one stage. </PARA>

Not one Opposition member went up to Senator Schacht afterwards and said, `We're angry. We're upset. We want you to keep the document'. If they had, my advice certainly would have been to keep the document. But they did not, and there is no suggestion-and I am here as a witness-that Senator Schacht destroyed the material post Senator Chaney's motion. I do not think Senator Chaney even suggested that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw the remark, Mr Deputy President. It is a trick Senator Stone would have picked up from Senator Fred Chaney, no doubt. He said, `I like the old style Labor men'. Some were good. I think Mr Lionel Bowen is not of the old style; he is very much a modern Labor person. The old style that Senator Stone likes is the member who would sit in opposition, the person he could kick around. He is the sort of Labor person who would split continuously and always leave the conservatives in power. That is Senator Stone's idea of old style Labor men. He criticises us for the modernity of our Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Imagine what Artie Fadden and Page would think of a carpetbagger like Senator Stone, who went up north after being hired by Bjelke-Petersen to be his economic adviser, and who dumped poor old Stan Collard off the ticket and came here. So let us not get into what the good old days were and what the morality was then. It was not 30 pieces of silver; apparently it was $250,000 a year that tempted him up north out of the lovely State of Victoria. But I know that he loves it in Queensland now, and that he has been converted along those lines. But he should not talk about the old style Labor man, about Chifley turning in his grave. What does Senator Stone think Page and Fadden are doing right now, knowing that he is the Leader of the National Party in the Senate. He was born and bred out of the Melbourne Club. He is part of the Establishment-no application at all to the old rural agrarian socialist, the old classic Country Party person who could not read or write but when rat cunning was handed out was right at the front of the queue. They are our good old National Party boys, the boys who know about boundary rigging, about taking brown paper bags and about the old ethics of the Country Party. And Senator Stone represents none of it. He would never rig an electoral boundary, he would never accept the brown paper bag. He would never put the fix in for a road contract. He is the new modern National Party carpetbagger of today-yet he has the cheek to talk about the good old days of the Labor men, the ones they could always defeat in elections. </PARA>
<PARA> The thing that people in this chamber resent about the Senator Schachts of the world is that they delivered government to the Labor Party. They worked hard, albeit copping the appellation of hard working apparatchiks, the machine men, or whatever else. But it is the Senator Schachts of the world who, by working hard, have delivered State Labor governments in South Australia and Federal Labor governments here. In the time Senator Schacht was State Secretary, South Australia always returned a majority of Federal Labor members to Canberra. It is a credit to him. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, this debate has added nothing to the Parliament. It has added very little to the value of censure debates. To make censure motions valuable they should not be devalued by being moved every week. To make it stick, those opposite have to be consistent. They have to apply the same standards to everyone. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Robert Ray, who is the Manager of Government Business in this place, needs to ask himself a few questions, and so do we all. Do we agree that the taping and transcribing of a meeting of members and senators in Parliament House on a matter of public importance is something that should be condoned? That is the question. Does Senator Ray agree with that? There were at least two meetings on that day: one convened by Senator Ray, of what he termed the Pro-Choice Group, and one of the parliamentary Pro-Life Group. The parliamentary Pro-Life Group meeting happened to be on the videotex, as the President said in his statement. The meeting in question was publicly announced and listed on the television monitors throughout the building. It was there for all to see. Senator Ray's group was not listed.

Does he think that it is fair that I or anybody else should record the conversations in those Caucus committee meetings and place them before the Senate when the members of the Labor Party are going about their business considering important matters of public importance? Of course not. That is not the honourable way to proceed. That breaks down trust. That is an attack on democracy. Does Senator Ray think that it would have been acceptable for someone to have tape-recorded another meeting that took place on that day, the meeting of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade? Of course not. Senator Ray would be the first to jump, to move a motion of censure in any of those respects. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge and accept what Senator Schacht has said. I do not wish to vote for a censure of him personally. I propose an amendment, which is being circulated, which goes to the question of the action. I think we should focus on that question because we, in determining this issue, have to decide not whether Senator Schacht is a good bloke, but whether the action is censurable. We have to determine whether it goes to the very heart of our responsibility as members of Parliament to respect the rights of our colleagues, whether they are in the same party or not, to consult with each other in an atmosphere where we are confident that mutual trust will apply and that there are no outside people who are recording what we are saying, using the tactics of secret police. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept what Senator Schacht has said; he was not involved in that taping. But he did use the material. I sense from what he said last night that perhaps it was a good idea at the time. I would have hoped that he would have got that advice from Senator Ray sooner. I feel that the question does go to the heart of democracy. It can be distinguished from other areas such as those in which Senator Tambling has been involved. I confess that I have not gone into that question thoroughly and I am not privy to where Senator Tambling got his material. </PARA>
<PARA> Presumably there comes a time-as was suggested in the Watergate area-when persons in the Public Service consider that democracy is not being served within the particular department-in other words, that the will of the people is somehow being denied and circumscribed by actions of the bureaucracy. Personally, I believe that it would have to be a very serious matter for documents to drop off the back of a truck. But it may well be that if they do drop off the back of a track, and there is a matter of serious concern that democracy is being thwarted, either by the bureaucracy or the Government, then a member of Parliament must discharge his or her audit and control functions. That is the distinction. In this case the member of Parliament was not discharging his audit and control functions over the processes of Government. To a certain extent the action impinged upon the rights of those individual senators and members to sit down and consider a question and the ways in which their representative functions could be exercised on a matter of public importance. To the extent that this sort of action could threaten that freedom of members of parliament to go about their business in this proper way it is certainly a censurable action. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the beginning of my speech, and as the President said in his statement yesterday, the details of the meeting were shown on videotext. I do not know whether somebody saw it on the television screen and then activated the sound system. I did not know about this matter beforehand, as Senator Schacht has said. He has made his apology and I accept it. I left at 10.10 p.m. on Monday when Senator Walters was in full flight in the Estimates debate. I thought that that debate would go on for some time. The first time I heard of this matter was from the Australian Associated Press report the next morning, written by Sandra Bull and Virginia Cook, which said:</PARA>
<PARA>The creation of a baby pool for childless couples was suggested at a secret meeting of the parliamentary Pro-Life Group, the Senate was told last night. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. I have told the secretary not to take the minutes in future, just to apply for the transcript. We should look at what the motion says and what is in the amendment that has been put forward by Senator Macklin. I accept what Senator Macklin says-that is, that there should be a consideration of the ethics that should guide us. I think we all know in our minds and hearts what those ethics should be. We all accept that unless there is mutual trust and mutual respect for the freedom of individual members and senators to go about the business for which they are elected then this place will not work. So far as freedom is concerned, it is not freedom amongst thieves, as was sort of suggested by Senator Ray. We are not here to make political capital this way or that on major issues of public importance, particularly the issue which this meeting discussed. We are here to consider the matters in a proper and reasonable fashion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ironical part about all this is that one of the reasons why the parliamentary Pro-Life Group was established was to ensure that there be a proper free flow of discussion between members and senators on this particular issue to enable those senators and members to discuss these questions properly and exhaustively and to avoid any unilateral tokenism. I ask senators on the Labor side particularly to listen to what I am saying and to avoid unilateral tokenism. This is one of the major reasons why this group was established. It has written papers, one of which was about the abortion issue. But there are others in respect of technology, human life and other matters which are extremely important. </PARA>
<PARA> What does worry me about the whole issue is that the actual material from which Senator Schacht has quoted has been destroyed. I am sorry that I was not here on Monday night because the vote was 23 all. I am sorry about that because of the distortion and selective quoting of the transcript. It is unfair, not necessarily to the group or to me as chairman-I am not worried about that-but to the people who have been named in this document. I will not rename them but there are six people who are isolated and named here in a selective and distorted way. If the full transcript were available those names would have been placed in context, including those of colleagues on my right. </PARA>

To say, for example, that bad spleen was vented about the way Senator Tate had refused to go along is a disgraceful distortion. We are not a monolithic group. We allow free flow of discussions and the people who were there will know what was said about that. People have their say in those meetings, as in other meetings, and other people have a sort of balancing say. None of that was mentioned by Senator Schacht and that is one of the reasons I am sorry that this document has been destroyed, because damage has been done to some of the people who were mentioned. I do not think that that is fair at all. Frankly, I am in an awkward position to censure Senator Schacht for destroying what was an illicitly obtained document. The more illicitly obtained documents that are destroyed, the better.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand and congratulate Senator Chaney for moving this motion because it is a matter of serious importance to the working of this whole Parliament. It is a matter that goes to the trust and mutual respect that we ought to have for each other. It is action that is censurable. In line with what I said originally, I foreshadow the following amendment:</PARA>
<PARA> Leave all words out after the word ``censure'' and insert:</PARA>
<PARA> ``the action of Senator Schacht in making use in the Senate adjournment debate on Monday, 29 May, of an illicitly-obtained transcript of a private meeting of Senators and Members held in Parliament House on Wednesday, 24 May 1989''. </PARA>
<PARA>That foreshadowed amendment focuses on the action. Senator Robert Ray is not here to respond to what I have said but he should agree that such action is censurable. I accept what Senator Schacht said last night. I feel that the action should be censured and, I suppose by implication, the person should be censured. I have the feeling that we should censure the action and make it perfectly clear that we are talking about a meeting of members of parliament, within the precincts of parliament, in a committee room booked officially and notified on the screens throughout the building, and that we will not accept those meetings being recorded through the sound system, as was quite clearly the case on this occasion, and later used in parliament to undermine the representative rights and functions of members of parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had a long debate this morning on the motion of censure that I moved on behalf of the Opposition:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate censures Senator Schacht for his conduct in making use in the Senate adjournment debate on Monday May 29 of an illicitly-obtained transcript of a private meeting of Senators and Members and his subsequent destruction of the material. </PARA>
<PARA>It would be fair to say that most of the debate from the Australian Labor Party side has involved an attempt to debate issues other than those before us. Senator Schacht set the precedent, which was followed by Senator Robert Ray, of ranging over a whole lot of matters including a motion that was never moved, my qualities and all the rest. All of that is very interesting and no doubt edified Labor senators, but it had nothing to do with the issues raised in the motion. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple facts of this matter are-and I assume that no-one would defend what happened with respect to that meeting; not even Senator Schacht or Senator Robert Ray has seen fit to defend it-that the meeting was overheard, perhaps using the sound recording system-who knows?-and no explanation has been forthcoming. Senator Schacht is persisting in a cover-up, which makes the ultimate determination on how this occurred very difficult indeed. As I understand it, no-one is defending the proposition that a group of senators and members, meeting in private in this building, should be subjected to having their conversations illegally or illicitly taped, without their consent, transcribed and made available to others. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that there has been any serious defence of the proposition that Senator Schacht should be entitled to collude with that sort of activity and use that material in debate. I think it represents, and clearly represents, a threat to the doing of any sensible business in this Parliament. As I said in opening the debate, this building is designed for the use of most modern electronics. Senators and members on both sides of the Parliament have made it clear that they demand from the Presiding Officers the highest possible standards to avoid the interception of their conversations and the illicit interception of their communications. That is clear common ground in this Parliament. Today we are talking about a blatant abuse of this place in which Senator Schacht is implicated up to his neck. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Schacht was invited, in my opening speech, to give some explanation. He made no attempt to do that. There is no innocent explanation. Senator Schacht knows exactly how this transcript came into being. The fact that he has chosen not to disclose it simply indicates the implication of the Australian Labor Party, and it is ridiculous to assume anything other than that this is a Labor Party effort to subvert a group of senators and members, across party lines, who have been trying to come to grips with one of the most delicate policy issues that we have to face. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Schacht tried to divert the argument-and it is interesting how effective this part of his diversion was-to suggest that it was all a matter of taste. I seem to recall that Senator Macklin addressed the question of taste, although his own conclusion in the end was that it was a censurable act. It is not a matter of taste. It has nothing to do with taste. I agree that those matters are not in the eye of the beholder, as I think was said by Senator Schacht. They are certainly in the mouth of the taster. We should not waste the time of the Senate on those matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather, the point was put quite shortly and well in example form by Senator Stone who spoke in support of the motion. Senator Stone pointed out that no-one here would defend the proposition that anyone could walk into an office which might happen to be empty and help himself to the contents of a desk. That was something that occurred in this place some years ago, and it was the subject of some rather violent parliamentary response and properly should have been. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am reminded by Senator Stone that it involved a journalist. I do not think that either Senator Schacht or Senator Robert Ray would suggest that it would be defensible for Senator Schacht to walk into the office of, say, Senator Harradine, and because Senator Harradine happened not to be there and because the record, perhaps of this meeting, might be on his desk, to help himself to it. I think that that was a very good parallel and a simple, graphic example of the fact that, if this building is to operate in any satisfactory way at all, there have to be some standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have had the ludicrous situation where Senator Schacht has, for the second time, apologised to Senator Harradine for not telling him that he intended to speak on the adjournment. Not telling Senator Harradine that he intended to speak on the adjournment has warranted two apologies; the use of an illicitly obtained transcript warrants no apology at all. I suggest that that shows an extraordinary lack of balance on the part of Senator Schacht and either a refusal to face the facts or a determination to put those facts in some sort of odd light. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not a matter of taste, as claimed by Senator Schacht. It is a matter of whether there are any standards at all that have to be observed here. There is no innocent explanation of what occurred. Had there been, I am sure that Senator Schacht would have given it to us. He knows that he is protecting Labor Party people who undertook this transcription, and he is deserving of censure. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the Australian Democrats and, at risk of again irritating Senator Macklin, I say that he finds it very difficult to avoid going into agreement with any proposition put forward by the coalition in opposition. He did indicate in his speech that he thought that this was a censurable matter. He went on to suggest that the motion should be amended by censuring other activity, and he specifically named Senator Tambling, who has used material which has been leaked to him by officials of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs or the Aboriginal Development Commission, as a basis for questioning both during the Estimates committee hearings and during debate in this chamber. In my opening remarks I made it clear that I thought there was a distinction. There is a distinction. It is quite different from a tape recording being made of the private deliberations of people in this place. The truth is, as was said by way of interjection during Senator Macklin's speech, that it has been a part of the political process in this building, and in the old building, and in all parliaments, that that sort of material is used. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think Senator Macklin would deny that members of the Australian Democrats have been enthusiastic users of such material. For example, Senator Janet Powell on a number of occasions has brought forward leaked material, presumably made available from the Public Service, with respect to the scrapping of the community youth support scheme (CYSS). I refer to reports in August 1987 in which Senator Powell described her source as `being as reliable as I can get without a public statement from the Minister'. In June 1988 it became a little clearer, when Senator Powell released a leaked draft Cabinet document outlining the proposed closure of CYSS projects. I do not raise that in some way hostile to Senator Powell. I do not suggest that she is doing anything different from what has been done by numerous senators and members in this place over a long period. I am using Senator Powell as an example because, among the Australian Democrats, I suspect she has been the most vigorous user of such material. In July 1988 she leaked what was described in her press release as `confidential Cabinet documents on child-care which are being considered today by the Federal Cabinet'. Senator Powell used those documents to criticise the Government and to call for policy changes. In the same way she referred to other leaked documents about plans to reduce projects in the field of community employment. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to labour the point. The simple reality is that the Australian Democrats, in common with all other political parties in this place-Labor, National, Liberal, or any other party such as the Democratic Labor Party-have had access to material which is confidential and have used it. I believe that the entirely appropriate and proper distinction which is drawn by this Opposition is that if the normal deliberations of senators and members of this place are subject to electronic eavesdropping, however arranged, whether by the planting of a bug or the illicit use of the communications mechanisms throughout this building, we say that is of a quite different nature and kind. It destroys the basis for effective exchange between members of parliament and affects the system. </PARA>
<PARA> I reject what was an excellent diversionary speech and an excellent diversionary point by Senator Robert Ray. He said that we are concerned about this matter only because it touches us. The operation of this Parliament happens to be fundamental to the maintenance of democracy and our system of government. If we are not prepared to defend the integrity of the system here, we cannot expect anybody else to do so. We have a particular responsibility, not in the name of self-interest but in the name of being the people who are primarily responsible for the way this place functions. If it is good enough for members of the Labor Party and members of the Opposition to raise the issue of security of communications, as we all have done because it goes to the working of this place, it is good enough for us to show that we object to the sort of behaviour in which Senator Schacht has indulged in the use of this illicit material. </PARA>
<PARA> There were endless attempts to draw red herrings into the argument. Senator Bishop was used as an example because she brought into this place a tape recording of a public meeting. How in the world can that be said to relate to the issue we are looking at today, which is the taping of a private discussion between individuals-not even from one party, but across party lines? If this motion is defeated it will be an indication that the Senate is not prepared to impose any standards at all, that it is prepared to let these things run at large. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not accept the Democrats' amendment because, as I have tried to indicate in this response, we see the matters which Senator Macklin has tried to bring forward in his amendment as being different in quality and kind from the matters in this motion. We do not see the need for the sort of amendment that has been moved by Senator Harradine, although, were Senator Harradine's amendment to be carried, there would be no reason for us not to vote against the motion. On the speeches which have been made, it is the clear view of the Opposition that there has been a censurable act on the part of Senator Schacht. There is a clearly expressed view by Senator Macklin-and he did not indicate whether he was speaking on behalf of all the Democrats; I suppose we must assume that he was, since he did not--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr Deputy President, I claim to have been misrepresented by Senator Schacht and by Senator Robert Ray concerning Senator Schacht's attempt to use as a precedent my tabling of the tape of one John Patrick Begg, which I introduced into this Parliament in March 1988 and tabled for the public record, which showed that a staffer of the former Premier, Neville Wran, had boasted of enabling 400 dead men to vote. Senator Schacht attempted to use that precedent as somehow justifying his behaviour. I find that totally and utterly unacceptable. The distinction is very simple. The meeting which Mr Begg addressed was a public meeting and could be freely, and obviously was, taped by somebody who was present at that meeting. The subject of the censure motion today is a private meeting of members and senators to discuss matters that were relevant to the exercise of their parliamentary duty and it was taped in an illicit manner through the technology which exists in this building. As Senator Harradine said, it is the action which is censurable and, as Senator Chaney said, it is indeed the need to have some rules which we apply which is important.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Community Services and Health, and relates to the present guidelines issued by the Department of Community Services and Health on the approval of admission to a nursing home. Is the Minister aware that the present guidelines preclude from admission to a nursing home any person who may have been a resident of a state institution for a period which may have been as short as one year preceding the application for approval? Is he further aware that this guideline also applies to persons who may similarly have been residents of state institutions for three years in the past five? Does the Minister acknowledge that such guidelines infer that many elderly persons, who may be required to enter such institutions for treatment of a temporary illness, are precluded from ever returning to the nursing home situation despite a recommendation to the contrary by Commonwealth medical officers? Will he also acknowledge that such guidelines are causing considerable hardship for those who are unable, because of geographical isolation, to relocate their families closer to their homes once treatment has been completed? Finally, could the Minister please advise whether the Department is considering altering the existing guidelines to address some of the issues to which I have previously referred today?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories intend to congratulate his Queensland counterpart, Mr Geoff Muntz, on at last declaring a truce in the senseless, one-sided, 3 1/2-year war against crocodiles in the Daintree River? However, is it a fact that Mr Muntz's decision to put an end to this program of purging the river of large species of crocodiles owed little to a new-found compassion towards crocodiles or an acknowledgment of conservation, but in fact to despair among supporters and operators of the Queensland tourist industry, whose business was declining in the same ratio as the largely decimated crocodile population of the Daintree River?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I have to concede at the outset that this is one battle, perhaps the only battle, that Mr Muntz appears to have won, because the purging of crocodiles has apparently been extraordinarily successful. When a local resident was taken by a crocodile about three years ago-I might say that the local resident knew that these things existed in the Daintree River-the Queensland Government first allowed a program of indiscriminate shooting of crocodiles. So hordes of people were charging up the river in boats blasting away at anything that moved. When that ceased, there was then a policy of removing crocodiles which were considered a problem. Unfortunately this got to the stage of removing any crocodile that was not much more than a metre long. This extraordinary series of events, which went on for three years, of course has led to the tourist industry in the area being very badly hit. That is not greatly surprising, given that crocodiles are precisely what people want to see as they go up the Daintree River.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I am sorry to report to Senator Collins that Mr Muntz's victory in this area may be short lived. A colleague of his, Mr Martin Tenni, has announced that none of this is for him and the matter is now to be reconsidered. I have the following quote from Mr Tenni-this is what he said only yesterday, so it is hot off the presses:</PARA>
<PARA>No crocs classed as man-eaters, vicious or dangerous will be left in any part of my electorate if I have anything to say. I will be fighting this move every step of the way at the next Cabinet meeting.</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that that statement from Mr Tenni was an extraordinary performance-even for him. His electorate, which is called Barron River, covers the Daintree. So we are now faced with the prospect of more ceaseless slaughtering of crocodiles, all to placate the will of one very odd National Party politician. When we got to the stage of beating Geoff Muntz on something, we thought we had a big win. But in Queensland even that is not enough. We still have to cross the Martin Tenni bridge. From what we have seen, it would appear that more crocodiles are endangered in north Queensland, and the tourist industry will once again be worse off.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister for Resources, is similar to the one I asked Senator Walsh last week in the absence of Senator Cook. Senator Walsh declined to answer on the basis that he believed it was a hypothetical question, so I hope that the Minister will be prepared to answer. The Minister will be aware that, with the worldwide concern about the greenhouse effect, it is inevitable that nuclear powered electricity generation will increase; that Canada, with 10 per cent of uranium reserves, supplies 30 per cent of the world market whereas Australia, with 30 per cent of reserves, supplies only 10 per cent of the world market; and that, because of the failed economic policies of this Labor Government, we are now facing a current account deficit and a foreign debt crisis, which, incidentally, I understand, today is in excess of $105 billion. Why, in the light of these circumstances, does the Australian Labor Party, apparently with the support of the Minister, continue to entrench for the next two years its loony three-mine policy? What special market expertise does the Government have which it believes is superior to that of those who are prepared to risk their money in new projects? As I said, Senator Walsh refused to answer that question on the basis that it was hypothetical. I refer the Minister to the remarks made in the other place by the Prime Minister, who said, `From an Australian point of view, it would not make much sense . . .'</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Government senators interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can see by the interruptions that my colleagues agree with that observation. The first part of the question consisted of an assertion that there would be an increase in nuclear power generation because of the greenhouse effect. I do not know that that assertion can be made in the unblemished way the honourable senator put it forward. For example, in my talks with the Japanese power utilities in Tokyo in January of this year, they made the strong observation to me that, because of domestic opposition in Japan to further growth in nuclear power generation, they favoured an energy mix which emphasised more the liquefied natural gas input, which, they observed, was a cleaner burning fuel than coal. I do not think a glib, flippant observation like the one made by Senator Parer ought to go unmentioned or unchallenged, because I do not think it is entirely true, although it may have elements of truth in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member mentioned the Government's three-mine policy. The Government does have a three-mine policy. As a result of that policy, uranium mining companies in this country have been able not only to obtain but also to hold their markets. The companies that currently operate under that policy have a capacity to increase production to meet any anticipated growth in demand, should that growth prove to be attractive.</PARA>
<PARA> So far as long term contracts are concerned, I recall-this may not be an absolutely accurate figure, but it is certainly in the ballpark-that the contract price is about $32, whereas the spot market price is about $11. That indicates that there is a greater likelihood of healthy trading on the spot market, rather than a readiness of potential consumers to write long term contracts. All of that suggests that at present the market is in a state of oversupply. I make those observations because I think that they support the Government's existing policy.</PARA>

<PARA>Does the Minister agree that the statement by Senator Sheil may be construed as implying that personal confidentiality may be breached by the use of census material by the Federal Government? Can the Minister give an assurance that no specific identification of individual citizens, or personal information given on census forms, is selectively available to private enterprise organisations? As a national census will be conducted in 1991, can the Minister put aside any doubts in the minds of the public by explaining the manner in which census information is supplied to private organisations?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The aggregated information from the census is, of course, supplied to virtually anybody who wants it. That is the reason for conducting a census in the first place. Of course, the information is useful to governments in various ways, but the expense of a census could not be justified if only governments had access to the aggregated information. I have been asked whether Senator Sheil's letter to the editor of the Gold Coast Bulletin, which I have read, implies that personal confidential information-in other words, disaggregated information-will be sold to the private sector. Senator Sheil's letter certainly implies that it will, as I believe it was meant to do. I suppose that Senator Sheil's footnote in political history will be that he was the shortest-serving Minister ever-all of about six hours, I think.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He has again been chasing votes among his ratbag right wing cheer squad, including such collective organisations as the League of Rights, and such individual luminaries as Peter Sawyer. He is regurgitating the pathetic assertions that Senator Walters made over the last six months or so, in the Senate and elsewhere. I do not really mind her doing it elsewhere, but I object particularly to her wasting the time of the Senate by doing it to such an extent here. I assume that Senator Sheil is not so ignorant that he does not know that information about individuals is not made available by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) to the private sector or to governments, although it is published in aggregated form, for the reasons that I have given. On the question of confidentiality, the way in which information is published is set out in ABS publications as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The extent of detail in the tables is constrained to ensure that identifiable information is not being released. The likelihood of identifiable information being inadvertently released is dependent on the size of the geographic area the table refers to and the number and level of detail of the variables in the tabulations. Since data are more likely to be identifiable when smaller geographic areas are specified, census tables have been designed so that the level of detail of other variables matches the geographic areas. Thus, very detailed information is available for large geographic areas, such as capital cities or States, and limited detail is available for small geographic areas, such as legal local government areas.</PARA>
<PARA> To further avoid the inadvertent release of identifiable information, the tables have been subjected to slight random adjustments. The random adjustments are insignificant in relative terms, except for all numbers too small to be of statistical significance. Further details can be obtained from the entry INTRODUCED RANDOM ERROR in The 1986 Census Dictionary,</PARA>
<PARA>The catalogue number is 2174.0. This is just another example of the phenomenon to which I referred previously. The most inconsequential members of the Opposition-the TSMs as they are acronymically called-are trying to get a bit of publicity and few cheers from ratbags around the place by implying, knowingly I believe, falsehoods about the census and other matters.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Given that I am the source of the speculation-I refer to a speech that I made last weekend-I am aware of it. At that time, however, I suggested that a referendum of this kind would be some way-five to 10 years-down the track. I was moved to say that because the problems that the greenhouse phenomenon would bring to Australia are of such scope that the Australian people would not expect six States, two Territories and the Commonwealth to come up with nine separate solutions. A national approach would be necessary. I hold to that view. I do not believe that I ever suggested that a referendum ought to take place at the next election. However, I am informed by my colleague the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr West, that if that were to be done the cost would be approximately $5.75m, and that most of that amount would be accounted for by printing, a very small proportion being accounted for by counting. I hope that that covers the first three parts of the honourable senator's question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He referred to the status of the speculation. As I have said, this is something that I have suggested for consideration some years down the track. So far as the further powers that the Commonwealth would need are concerned, may I say that, taking even the lower range of predictions about the greenhouse effect, quite clearly policies on coastal management would have to be turned over to the Commonwealth, given that there would be very significant changes in our coast. Beyond that, land clearance has been an enormous problem in Australia. I would have thought that there would need to be some national approach to that. In fact, if one looks at emissions from industry, from the production of energy or from motor cars, Commonwealth power might be necessary in a whole range of areas. That would depend largely on the results of the research that will be carried out here and in other nations during the next few years. The discussion at the moment on the specifics is probably, therefore, a little premature.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fifteenth meeting of the Western Australian Iron Ore Industry Consultative Council did take place on Monday and Tuesday of this week. It was an occasion on which the Council conducted a review of the current situation. There has been significant improvement in the operation of the iron ore industry in the Pilbara over the last several years. At one time it was common badinage that the Pilbara was synonymous with industrial disputation. Apart from Robe River at the present time that cannot be said any longer. Increasingly it is recognised in tangible ways, the most tangible being the readiness by the Japanese earlier this year to come to long term iron ore contracts with Australian suppliers. There has been a growth of the Australian market share from 42.8 per cent in 1987 to a forecast 46.5 per cent this calendar year in the overall consumption of iron ore by the Japanese, with the largest increase amongst all the national suppliers to Japan going to Australian companies. In 1988 a record 98.3 million tonnes was shipped-that is, a 17 per cent increase on output over the 1987 figures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This performance has been reached by an increase in productivity per employee. In 1980 the output per head of employee, measured by tonnes of ore mined, was 7,500 tonnes. Last year it was 11,000 tonnes per employee. It has also been occasioned by a significant reduction in lost time due to injury or accident. There has been 20 per cent less lost time in 1988 as opposed to 1987 through injury or accident in the Pilbara. That has resulted from a close working together of the unions and the companies on lost time issues. The lost time has reduced so much that it is equal to two extra working days per employee across the industry. That is a significant achievement in what is an accident prone industry. The task of mining is a capital intensive but dangerous task, and to achieve that result is a significant outcome. In addition, lost time due to industrial disputes has fallen markedly over the whole period across all companies. The achievements would have been much greater if Robe River had been excluded from the statistics. Indeed, Robe River has now excluded itself from the statistics, in that it has declined to answer Department of Industrial Relations surveys on the amount of down time because of industrial disputes on the ground that it is not compulsory to do so. So we have lost the measure of what industrial disputation is occurring in that company.</PARA>
<PARA> To bring this to a conclusion, this Government, working with the Western Australian Labor Government, over the last five years has brought about significant micro-economic reform in the Pilbara in that the Japanese consumers, who are the main consumers of our iron ore, recognise that this is now a reliable supplier. They not only recognise that but they also reward it with long term contracts and bigger market share at a 15 per cent price increase last year. That has been achieved by the application of Labor Party policy in industrial relations and the handling of developments in the iron ore mining industry. The one exception to that is Robe River. One hopes that, by the model achieved in the other iron ore companies, it will see that it is wrong in pursuing a confrontationist, anti-worker approach in the company and should adjust its management procedures to the type of management procedures now in operation in Mount Newman Mining Co. Pty Ltd, Goldsworthy Mining Ltd and Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Cooney for his most timely question. The Government will be legislating in this area to cover consumer credit and the industry. There is very much a need for it, as was instanced at the seminar Senator Cooney referred to. There is a need not only because we should prevent privacy abuse in this area but also because there is in place at the moment a rather inadequate and patchy mix of State laws and self-regulatory systems which are nowhere near the national set of rules that should be governing such a nationally based industry. The Government intends to cover this area by amendments to the Privacy Act to give the Privacy Commissioner extra responsibilities to cover this field.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the main issues discussed at that seminar was a proposal to introduce what is called positive reporting, which entails the collection and dissemination of detailed information on both the nature and the size of an individual's current credit commitments. Basically, it could amount to a personal profile. This information would be collected regardless of whether a particular person might be a defaulter in terms of his or her handling of credit. The Government believes that this proposal has not been sufficiently substantiated in terms of the benefit to the community. It believes that there are privacy concerns involved with it which are legitimate and real. It also believes that there are practical problems and, as a consequence, will not allow positive reporting to go ahead. The Government will also address issues which arise under the current system of reporting information. The Government intends to regulate access to and the use of existing credit reporting files, the primary target being those files that are transferred either to or from credit reporting agencies. In terms of the information held by credit providers, they will be able to maintain their files but if they wish to convey them to other credit providers, they will have to obtain the consent of the consumer involved. We will cover the fundamental issue of who has access. In that respect, the Government is concerned that only credit providers have access. Accordingly, there will be a need to cull some of the existing membership of an organisation such as the Credit Reporting Association of Australia. We will also cover the questions of in what circumstances access will be available, of accuracy of information, and, as I said earlier, the question of what information. Individuals will also, under this proposed legislation, have the right of access to their individual file in certain circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of enforcement, as I said, the Privacy Commissioner will be supervising the area. The regulations under the legislation will lay down the parameters for the development of a code of conduct, which will be in accordance with privacy principles. That code will be a disallowable instrument for the purposes of this Parliament. Also, in terms of enforcement, there will be a mix of civil remedy sanctions. As well, the Privacy Commissioner will have the power to obtain orders from the Federal Court. The Government sees this as a very significant and historic guarantee of privacy for individuals in our society. We are pleased to be able to announce that we will be amending the Privacy Act to extend to this particular area of activity.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Resources aware of a proposal being developed by some scientists, both here and overseas, to site all concentrated carbon dioxide emitters, such as thermal power stations, close to the sea and to use chemically engineered technology to enable carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide to be absorbed by the ocean, thus reducing damage to the ozone layer?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposal that carbon dioxide-CO2-from power stations be pumped into the oceans so that it can be absorbed by seawater has been considered by several researchers in the past. The results of preliminary studies suggest that such systems would require 20 to 30 per cent of the power station's output to operate and would result in an approximate doubling of the cost of electricity. The engineering, technical and economic feasibility of disposing of such large quantities of CO2 in the oceans is yet to be determined. The question of dispersing the huge volumes of CO2 through sufficiently large volumes of seawater, however, could be an important issue. There could also be, though, major environmental implications for the oceans themselves and there could be impacts on both a local and a global scale. Nor is there any certainty about the ocean's long term ability to store such large amounts of CO2.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Department of Primary Industries and Energy will continue to monitor developments, and should the technology ever be proved feasible, Australia will be well placed to take advantage of it as virtually all of our major power stations are located close to the oceans. I acknowledge Senator Zakharov's long term interest in energy efficiency and environmental matters generally. A major focus of this Government's energy policy is on finding ways of developing clean burning technology and ways in which we can market clean coal to help to reduce the addition to the greenhouse gases of CO2 from coal-fired power stations. We are also looking at alternative forms of energy-adaption of liquefied natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas as transport fuels, and at the whole range of alternative non-renewable fuels.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was certainly interested to see that Dr Hewson said that a coalition government would cut the education budget as well as the social security budget and that Mr Peacock said that a coalition government would cut the defence budget. No sooner does somebody in the Opposition say that something will be cut than somebody else in the Opposition says that it will not be. I do not expect that Dr Hewson, while he may know a lot about yuppie restaurants, merchant banks and Ferraris, would know a great deal about the requirements of Australia's 7,500 government schools and 2,500-odd private schools, even though, I understand, he came from a relatively modest home himself-that is, modest in economic terms. He probably does not know that much about the 250,000-odd students in universities and the nearly one million who are doing trade courses, mostly in technical and further education institutions of various types. I do not suppose that the Ferrari-driving set has much contact at all with those people. I assume that because Dr Hewson saw that around $7 billion of Federal Government money is spent on education, he thought that education was a sharp and easy area to cut.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The experts, such as they are in the Liberal Party-that is, the people who have designated responsibilities for specific areas or for spending areas-set things straight about this yesterday. The Opposition spokesman on education-that is Mr Reith these days, I understand-told the Sydney Morning Herald that the coalition remained committed to its announced policy that `no school will be worse off' and that it would `maintain the existing number of tertiary places', which, of course, leaves no scope at all for the cuts that Dr Hewson was proposing only three days ago. Together with Mr Carlton's weekend comments on the impossibility of cutting defence, let alone those of some of the more pipsqueak Opposition front bench members who talk about increasing defence expenditure, we see the usual process of members of the Opposition, shadow Minister by shadow Minister, contradicting those others in the Opposition who say they would cut expenditure. They are walking away from all the hard decisions while still having the effrontery to say they will cut expenditure. The only thing substantial that is coming from the Opposition is what comes from Senator Stone.</PARA>
<PARA> I remind Dr Hewson of the article he wrote about taxes which was published in the Business Review Weekly in November 1986. It is not the article in which he described the present Leader of the Opposition as a prima donna; this is a different article. In respect of the Opposition's non-policy on taxation he said that the Opposition's credibility on tax would continue to be questioned until it specified all the detail. I say `ditto' to Opposition policy on outlays.</PARA>

Can the Minister explain how Australians building homes in Australia with Australian labour and with Australian building material contribute to this country's foreign indebtedness? Finally, if families and others seeking their own housing are prevented from investing in Australian labour and building material will they not be more likely to buy foreign manufactured goods, causing high home interest rates to contribute to foreign debt rather than to reduce it?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are four questions altogether. The first one referred to the large amount of new and unfilled office space. There is inevitably always some unfilled office space in CBDs. I am not sure whether it is substantially higher at this time than it normally is. It may well be. However, there are many misunderstandings in this question. The first one, and possibly the least serious, is that if it is true that there is a large amount of unfilled office space already but that resources continue to be diverted-as believed by Senator Coulter-into construction of more space, the underlying assumption is that those who are undertaking construction expect to lose money. I think that is an unlikely assumption.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the building of houses-this should be taken with a caveat because by definition no statistics are entirely up to date; but I will use the best available statistics-residential building in Australia is still proceeding at or very close to its physical capacity to supply. Under those circumstances the diversion of more money or credit into housing construction will not produce more houses so much as higher prices for houses and higher construction costs, with all the undesirable implications that flow from that. Under those circumstances, which probably also applied a few months ago, and with an excessive level of fiscal demand in the building industry, bidding up the inputs, including labour for residential construction, a higher level of demand and consumption is induced. Apart from pushing up the price of houses, this has adverse effects on our current account deficit in a direct way. Not all the components used for all residential construction, or for the furnishing of residences once completed, are supplied from the domestic market. Even if they were all supplied from the domestic market there would still be an effect on total demand and therefore an indirect effect on our balance of payments. The premises upon which Senator Coulter has based his questions are at best suspect and at worst wrong.</PARA>

That recession, of course, was aggravated by a cynical attempt to buy votes in the last Budget which the coalition Government produced and about which Senator Stone has written quite extensively and been quoted by me in the Senate on a number of occasions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stone asked a question yesterday in which he cited some figures for the March quarter national accounts. He argued that those figures indicated that Australia was experiencing a sharp rise in wage costs. In answering the question, I pointed out-and I said that this was subject to confirmation-that I believed the figures he cited referred to aggregate payments for wages, salaries and supplements and therefore included the effects of an increased number of people employed, as well as a greater amount of overtime and perhaps some other minor factors. The central economic question is the real unit cost of labour, not the aggregate amount paid in wages and salaries. I said yesterday that figures on real labour costs were not known to me but that they would be available. I have since discovered that the Treasury, which has for many years published figures for that variable, does now have figures for the March quarter in a series which I am sure Senator Stone would be well aware of-a series which is widely used and widely respected as an economic indicator. The figures I will give now will be published later in the normal Treasury Round-up of Economic Statistics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The index number for the March quarter is 93.9 compared to 95.9 for the preceding quarter and 99.4 for the March 1988 quarter. So real unit labour costs in the March quarter fell by over 2 per cent and are now more than 5 per cent below the level of a year ago. Of course, that indicates the opposite of a sharp rise in labour costs. I am surprised that Senator Stone was not more careful in this regard, given the positions he has held in the past and his normal application of a good deal of rigour to the interpretation of statistics. It seems that some of his Leader's approach to economics, statistics and accountancy must have rubbed off on him.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Sheil asked me a question on 29 May about issuing Telecom technicians working in the Gold Coast hinterland with portable telephones. He suggested that the time taken to correct faults could be reduced by issuing outside workers with portable telephones which he considered were more suitable than two way radio in the hinterland because of the distances and terrain involved.</PARA>
<PARA> The response I have from the Minister for Transport and Communications is based on advice from Telecom and is as follows: Telecom acknowledges that there are gains to be made by the use of mobile 'phones for Telecom staff but there is also a need to ensure that the mobile network is available for public use and so a balance must be maintained between Telecom usage and public usage. Mobile phones are allocated for official use in Queensland on the same basis as elsewhere in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom's Gold Coast District has requested a number of mobile telephone services including some for the hinterland fault staff. In addition, the District has ordered a number of two way radios with access to the telephone network which will be distributed to staff. These are more suited to the application described than cellular mobile 'phones.</PARA>
<PARA> As the Gold Coast hinterland contains areas of poor radio reception, a mobile telephone is unlikely to be of advantage over a two way radio in those areas since both will suffer from poor reception.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During Question Time today Senator Colston asked Senator Walsh a question about a letter of mine to the Gold Coast Bulletin concerning the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Senator Colston does not very often deserve to be complimented but I compliment him on the assiduous way in which he follows letters and press releases emanating from my office. The letter expressed concern that information gleaned by the Bureau of Statistics could be pinpointed to a person. In his answer Senator Walsh said that I was guilty of overemotional sensationalism by making such a claim. I am fairly certain that at the end of his answer he even accused me of lying.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bureau of Statistics advertises the fact that it can pinpoint, as was mentioned by Senator Walsh, areas as small as a street or local government area, and it also advertises with some pride-it actually sends out brochures advertising the fact-that it can pinpoint areas as small as a block of units. This information is sold to commercial businesses. The sorts of questions that are asked concern people's religion, income, children, cars, and things like that. If a person is the only Moslem living in a block of units earning over $50,000 a year, with two children and two cars, he is very easy to pinpoint. Incidents such as this attracted my attention to the weakness in the claim by the Bureau of Statistics that it was impossible to pinpoint people and that it only put out information in aggregate form.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter of public importance is one that the Opposition considers particularly important today. It is in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need for the Government to take immediate action to reduce the appalling level of poverty and homelessness of Australian youth and to apologise for the Prime Minister's campaign device in promising Government action to ensure that no child would be living in poverty by 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition brings forward this matter of public importance because it is simply not satisfied that enough is being done by the Hawke Labor Government to tackle the problems of poverty and unemployment. These twin evils that affect thousands of young Australians cannot be divorced from the macro-economic policies of the Labor Government that place families under stress through the combination of high interest rates and high personal taxation, and whose refusal to deregulate the labour market continues to price the young out of jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), with little over six months to make good his pledge that by 1990 no Australian child would be living in poverty, is now actually trying to claim that he has solved the problem. I refer honourable senators to a statement by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) on the April economic statement, when he said that the pledge for child poverty to be abolished will be met by July 1989. That is but one day short of one month away. What a cheap, cruel position to put down to the people of Australia. They know full well that that will not be the case. We saw a little bit of soft-shoe shuffling by the Prime Minister not long ago, to try to change his pledge from `There will be no child living in poverty by 1990' to `There will be no need for children to live in poverty by 1990'. He carefully inserted the word `need'. That would probably be correct if the Prime Minister had taken action before now to ensure that people, particularly children, would not be living in poverty. Today 2.6 million households-one in every eight households-live in poverty. That appalling figure just happens to include 800,000 children. I might add that Australia has the highest child poverty rate of all Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, with the exception of the United States. I believe that that is an absolute disgrace and a national embarrassment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has seen fit to saddle every Australian man, woman and child with its own debt, equalling $7,400 each. The size of our foreign debt just happens to have doubled from this time last year. The Government-and the Prime Minister in particular-has the audacity to say that the problem of child poverty will be solved by the end of this year. The Minister for Social Security has even more audacity in saying that it will be solved in a month's time. Whenever the Prime Minister states that child poverty caused by adolescents leaving home is somehow beyond the scope of his pledge, as it is not an economic cause, we can only point to the consistent weight of evidence that clearly suggests otherwise. It should be clear to the Labor Government by now that relationships, whether between spouses or between adolescents and parents, fracture because of economic considerations that in turn can result to so large a degree from government policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Just look at the Government's statistics. At the beginning of this year there were 239,000 recipients of class A widow's pensions and of the supporting parent benefit, and 79 per cent of those had no assessable income under the social security income test. When we consider that 180,000 single parents are responsible for 339,000 dependent children, all of whom are solely reliant upon government benefits for a living, the Labor Government hardly has cause for self-congratulation. It is indeed the Labor Government's record that the number of welfare beneficiaries in those two closely related categories rose from 209,000 in 1982, when Australia was in recession, to 240,500 in March this year. Yet yesterday the Prime Minister said that even the Brotherhood of St Laurence agreed that his promise to alleviate child poverty would be met. </PARA>
<PARA> Research quoted by the Brotherhood of St Laurence estimates that the introduction of the family allowance supplement has assisted only approximately 30 per cent of the 800,000 children to whom I referred earlier. A person who has close links with and sees poverty on a day to day basis is the Bishop of Tasmania, the Right Reverend Phillip Newell. He, as a Tasmanian church leader, yesterday criticised the Federal Government's interest rate policy and said that high rates were causing undue financial hardship. So there is little cause for rejoicing and for the Government, and the Prime Minister specifically, trying to quote other people in support of their false promises. In Western Australia alone, a leading voluntary welfare agency, Anglicare, quotes a report to say that 77,000 children in that State alone live below the poverty line and that two-thirds of sole parent families survive on less than $12,000 annual income. And the Prime Minister has the cheek and the gall to say that he is solving child poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> Welfare experts have estimated that, even with the meeting of the much-vaunted benchmarks, some 400,000 children will remain in poverty after housing costs are paid. If that figure of children in poverty is anything like correct, on a national basis it would translate into over half a million Australian children. Unquestionably, this is the pool that is sure to produce hundreds of homeless adolescents. We have only to look at the cost of raising children, according to the latest information from the Institute of Family Studies. In a low income family, a two-year-old child imposes costs of $23 a week, or $1,200 annually. An 11-year-old costs $38 a week, or $2,000 annually. A teenager can cost $57 a week, or $3,000 each year. In middle Australia, the realistic respective weekly costs of raising a two-year-old child, an 11-year-old and a teenager are $35, $63 and $95 respectively. So the figures get worse and worse. They do not equate with what the Government is allegedly doing to assist people. </PARA>
<PARA> The new family allowance of $9 a week, of $468 a year-I might add that the Government is enormously proud of that figure-does not make any impression whatsoever on the costs to which I have just referred when for a three-child family they reach $1,400 for the year. The real solution to child poverty requires much more than token gestures of financial assistance. It requires attention to housing, employment and education-all issues which the Government has just happened to recognise. But it is all too late. The extreme face of poverty grows from the breakdown caused by economic difficulties, problems that have increased and continue to worsen because we have a government that has adopted high interest rates as its tool of economic management, while at the same time doing nothing except make cosmetic changes to the tax burdens that affect Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA> The greatest immediate problem that drives families into poverty is the cost of housing. That is rising absolutely out of control as a direct consequence of the high interest rates used by the Government as its only tool of economic management. The latest rise to 17 per cent means that there has been a 47 per cent rise in five years. Since early 1988 they have risen from a figure of 13 1/2 per cent. I will be very surprised if anybody on the Government benches can be proud of that figure. Yet we hear people opposite saying, `That is okay. They probably own their homes'. That is the difference. Those opposite do not care. They do not live in poverty. Obviously, unlike Opposition senators, they are not seeing people living in poverty. That is a great tragedy. One needs to remember that families are $56 a week out of pocket since the Labor Government came to office. It is no wonder that average Australians are not inclined to rejoice about the July tax cuts, necessary as they may be as a belated alleviation of the economic bind affecting families. The tax cuts will be swallowed up by high interest rates, high inflation and more taxes within 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that the Hawke Government is the biggest taxing, biggest spending government in peacetime history. Yet in a month's time the Government will give a candy back to the people pretending that all is well and that the wounds are healed. They certainly are not healed for low income families. A low income family on an income of $15,000 stands to gain $68 a month in increased allowances and tax cuts but will surrender over $38 in the latest interest rate rise, just on a $50,000 mortgage. Of course, it would be much more on a higher mortgage. I stress that these are mortgage costs alone and that Australia's inflation is running at the rate of 6.9 per cent generally, putting pressure on family budgets. </PARA>
<PARA> Repayments on the average housing loan of $60,000 have increased by 23 per cent, or $40 a week, over the past 12 months. With housing interest rates having reached 15 1/2 per cent by the March quarter of 1989, mortgage repayments on a national basis were consuming 40.2 per cent of median family income. It has been generally agreed that a figure of 25 per cent places a strain on family finances. I might add that it was only 22 per cent when this Labor Government took office. It is an absolute and utter disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> These statistics cannot be divorced from the problem of poverty as it is inevitable that homes will be lost and living standards of individual families drastically reduced because of the failure of Labor Government policy. When people lose their homes because of the high interest rate policies of this Government, what do they do? In my State, Western Australia, the rental market availability is under one per cent. People cannot even rent. Those people who are financing the rental properties are also paying high interest rates. They cannot give their properties away. So people, forced out of their homes because of high interest rates will have literally nowhere to go. </PARA>
<PARA> Having failed Australian families by denying them affordable housing, the Hawke Labor Government stands equally responsible for a continual tax burden, quietly increased by bracket creep. Tax reform for families has been a sham. There have been tax changes; no reform, just changes-they have all gone up. Families supported by average weekly earnings that 35 years ago paid tax at a marginal rate of 19 per cent and 10 per cent of total income, now pay a marginal tax rate of 40 per cent-soon to be reduced by a mere one per cent to 39 per cent. How generous! Incomes of no more than $20,600, substantially below average weekly earnings, will attract a marginal tax rate of 39 per cent after 1 July. Incomes of $35,000, which will attract a marginal tax rate of 47 per cent, do not necessarily go far towards repaying mortgages and supporting families. </PARA>
<PARA> The policies of this Labor Government will, in two years, see two-thirds of Australian taxpayers-those that have supposedly not fallen into poverty-paying tax at the top two rates. Since March 1983 a family on average weekly earnings with two children has seen its real disposable income fall, taken away, robbed by this Government to the extent of $56 per week. Too often this Labor Government sends the message that if a family has two incomes all will be well. Where is the choice open for a family to have one income earner? This Government is trying to demand that Australian families have two income earners. This is to the detriment of the quality of family life and is contributing to the cycle of pressure that causes family break-up and eventual poverty. If families choose to have both mother and father working, that is fine. But why should the policies of this Government force people to do that?</PARA>
<PARA> Even fuel taxes have gone up to 22.39c per litre, with only 4.95c being spent on roads. This equates to about $15 of tax every time people fill up the average sized car. </PARA>

<PARA> Today the Opposition also seeks to highlight the fact that this Government has failed in providing adequate employment to young Australians which, I might add, is causing even more poverty. Rather than solid results of real jobs, we have had ingenious publicists dreaming up brand new acronyms with great fanfares of publicity for one person, and one person alone-the Prime Minister. How could we ever forget Priority One. What a disaster! That was going to create 75,000 trainee jobs. We are still waiting to see well over half of them. Those that were filled were filled basically in the public sector. Despite the Government having spent $29m, less than the previous allocation in 1987-88 to create 10,000 traineeships, most of which were in the public sector, the 1988-89 Budget earmarks $45m for 15,000 placements. The record is simply not encouraging. Why should we believe the Government now? Why should the people of Australia be conned any more. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's employment and training initiatives announced in the Budget would reach only 5 per cent of sole parents with children, while less than 15 per cent of the long term unemployed could expect any help. To have any effect, these programs must be programs of substance, not just programs of rhetoric. The proportion of the unemployed with children increased from 37 per cent to 46 per cent between 1980 and 1986. This Government's track record is simply appalling. The way it continues to thrust people into poverty is just disgraceful. In particular, since 1982 the greatest proportional increase in unemployment rates has been for families with three or more children. The duration of unemployment for people seeking full time work is now 47 weeks-a 23 per cent increase from March 1983 when the Government took office. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government claims to have created 1.2 million new jobs. Before the number of new jobs that this Government has created is thrown up to us in this debate today, let us neither forget nor ignore the fact that we need at least 60,000 new jobs per year just to keep up with the population growth and school leavers. But does this Government say that? No, it does not. It just talks about the jobs it has created. It does not talk about the ones that are needed just to keep pace. Unemployment, like the poverty that affects children, like adolescent homelessness, can be solved only through sound economic management. Management that is sound and humane must work towards lowering the interest rates that destroy the basic foundation of living standards-housing-and must focus on protecting family living standards in taxation policy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just in case people need reminding, I go back to the matter of public importance that is before the Senate today, which is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need for the Government to take immediate action to reduce the appalling level of poverty and homelessness of Australian youth and to apologize for the Prime Minister's campaign device in promising Government action to ensure that no child would be living in poverty by 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>I must admit that I am absolutely astounded that this matter of public importance has been raised in this chamber, in this Parliament, by a member of the coalition in view of the amazingly adequate achievements, in many respects, of this Government; in view of the abject failure of the coalition when it was in government; and in view, most of all, of the revelations that we have been hearing in the last few weeks about what this coalition would do in the unhappy event that it should be returned to government. It is quite correct for Senator Knowles to link together problems of poverty and homelessness of Australian youth. I would have been a great deal more impressed with her contribution if she had given us some really constructive ideas on how these problems would be dealt with by a coalition government. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had an amazing collection of purported facts and figures, many of them out of date, many of them totally incorrectly quoted, and a number of them amazingly spurious. For example, scorn has been poured on the fact that we have created only 1,300,000 new jobs in view of the fact that we need 60,000 a year just to cope with the school leavers coming into the work force. In six years 60,000 school leavers would take up at most 360,000 of those new jobs, so we are still almost one million jobs ahead. I think that Senator Knowles should have had a much closer look at the figures before she started using them with such gay abandon. The honourable senator could have profitably looked at a number of other issues in her analysis, if I can call it that, of the problems that she has raised today. She did not mention health, matters such as training for adults, child-care and a number of other initiatives on which we have an extremely proud record. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go back to the matter raised by Senator Knowles and the claim she has made against the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and his promise that was given at the time of the election in 1987. What I would like to put on the record here are endorsements not of Australian Labor Party people but of those who are in a very good position to know, those who are in possession of the information and who make a very serious analysis of these issues. Bishop Peter Hollingworth, when giving the George Syme Oration to the Royal Australian College of Surgeons on 7 May this year, said:</PARA>
<PARA>In strict economic security terms, it is true that the prime ministerial promise `that no children shall live in poverty by 1990' . . . will be achieved. This represents significant progress, and demonstrates that governments can meet some modest social justice objectives, even at a time of economic restraint when they are involved in public sector cutbacks and tax reductions in order to improve their economic efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate here that Senator Knowles's references to the Brotherhood of St Laurence and the statement which I also read some weeks ago, were based on 1986 figures. This is the up-to-date opinion of the Brotherhood of St Laurence:</PARA>
<PARA> This pledge, the most specific social commitment of the century has been the subject of a historic package to provide a guaranteed minimum income for poor children whose parents earn less than about $300 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> We congratulate the Federal Government on its work on child poverty, which represents a historic breakthrough in the national attack on child poverty. The Federal Government has now built a solid foundation of income security for Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA>Quite a glowing testimonial, I am sure honourable senators will agree. The third endorsement comes from the source which, in statistical terms, is probably by far the best placed to give an analysis; the Australian Institute of Family Studies' publication Families and the Tax Package. I will quote only the most salient comments because the analysis is very long. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The centrepiece of the Government's strategy to assist low income families is the family allowance supplement (FAS). </PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate that this has been ignored by Senator Knowles. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>When FAS was introduced, in 1987, the Treasurer pledged that the rates of payment would be increased to specific benchmarks related to the Prime Minister's commitment regarding child poverty. Those benchmarks were that combined weekly payments for children aged 12 and under would be set at 15 per cent of the married rate of pension and those for 13-to-15-year-olds would be set at 20 per cent of this rate. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the tax package, rates for younger children have been lifted to the benchmark via substantial increases in the rate of family allowance and those for 13-to-15-year-olds were raised, in addition to family allowance, by $3.10 per week to $34.10. By these means the Government's pledge to meet the benchmarks has been met. The new levels of FAS represent rises in real terms since 1983-84 of 41 per cent for younger children and 203 per cent for older children over the previous family income supplement payments. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are substantial increases in the amounts of real untaxed money in the hands of low income families, in the hands of the principal carers in those low income families, who in most cases are the mothers. Currently more than 530,000 families with 1.1 million children benefit and that represents a considerable hole in that series of figures that Senator Knowles has just used. In fact it gives us an idea of exactly what widespread advantage has been brought by comparison with what was previously the case with low income families in this country, as the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) said on the night of the April statement. We have now reached the point where younger children are receiving 15.3 per cent of the married pension rate and older children are receiving 20 per cent of that rate. They are two benchmarks considerably ahead of what was advocated in the report of the Henderson Commission of Inquiry into Poverty as the way in which those families should be lifted out of poverty, which was between 12 and 18 per cent, depending upon the age of the children involved. </PARA>
<PARA> What did we have from the coalition when it was in government? We had a failure to index these payments; a failure to recognise the extra needs of families with children; and a failure to establish standards-and standards are what we have established. I have not seen them being questioned by the Opposition, or by anybody else for that matter. I have not seen any alternatives to the standards we have set being proposed by the Opposition. In fact all that I have seen-I must say that it is a matter of considerable interest to many of us who have been working on these policies for years-are statements like the ones I have just read endorsing the Government's attempts to lift these families out of poverty. Honourable senators should not forget that we also introduced for the first time a rental assistance allowance for low income families renting privately and we have made a considerable improvement in the payment that is being awarded regularly to families with handicapped children, so that the incomes of those families are substantially healthier than they were a comparatively short time ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past few days and weeks we have had fairly vague suggestions from the Opposition about what it might do in relation to social security payments. We wonder whether it will tighten the eligibility rules, toughen up the income and assets tests or abolish the indexation of pensions, benefits and family allowances. Is that the way it is planning to go? The Opposition's major policy platform during the past three weeks indicates that its suggestions begin and end with slashing social welfare expenditure. Is the Opposition planning to target family allowance payments that are currently being made to nearly two million families with more than 3.8 million children-Senator Knowles should note that not all those families are in poverty-or will it target the payments to the 1.1 million children of those 530,000 low income families who have been very much the beneficiaries of this Government's welfare policy? Is that the way the coalition is planning to go?</PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators-and Senator Walsh reminded us of this today in Question Time-that we have made considerable gains in targeting social security outlays to those most in need, to the point where, since 1983, social security outlays have fallen from 6.9 per cent of gross domestic product to 6.2 per cent in 1987-88. There is not a great deal more cutting and slashing that can be done there. We expect social security outlays to be at 6 per cent in 1989-90. Social security has also declined as a proportion of real budget outlays from 24.1 per cent in 1983-84 to 23 per cent in 1987-88. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have been able to do is to target a great deal more accurately those individuals and households where the need is greatest. From what we can see, the Hewson solution would destroy the past seven years of repair work and targeting done by this Government since we inherited the social welfare problems of 1983. At that point families were suffering very badly from the fact that over those years of the Fraser Government the assistance directed to families had been dropping steadily in value. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have also heard from Senator Knowles today is criticism of the way in which we have been able to remove barriers to employment, particularly of young people. Quite clearly, Senator Knowles is unaware of the facts. Young people and teenagers have benefited very markedly from the policies of this Government. They are the people who have shared in the extra jobs that have been created under this Government. Also they have seen the situation move from the disastrous set of circumstances when we came to government, when the unemployment rate for young people was absolutely astronomical, to the present situation where the unemployment rate for young people, as well as the general unemployment rate, has markedly reduced. The rate of youth unemployment now is almost the same as that of the adult population. That is in very marked contrast to the situation six years ago. Teenage full time unemployment has fallen by 80,100, which is a 50.8 per cent reduction, to about half what it was under the previous Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We were confronted by an absolutely appalling situation when we came to government. A number of schemes have been very successful in getting young people back to work. Of course, the most successful measures have been our policies which have generated a much healthier economy, and which not only have taken young people into the work force but also have assisted a great many more of them to acquire the education and training which will make their future prospects a great deal more rosy. At the same time, we have introduced job training schemes which have been of considerable assistance one way or another. </PARA>
<PARA> I spoke about targeting. Perhaps I should explain it a little more carefully for Senator Knowles. For example, when looking at a scheme to assist sole supporting parents back into the work force, one appreciates very well that not every sole parent will need assistance; many will be out of the work force for only a short period. Their education, training and general experience will allow them to return to the work force without any great assistance from us. Others may have small children, sick children or dependants which will require their presence in the home for a longer period. However, amongst the cohort, there will be women who do need bridging education and assistance with training on a one-to-one basis. It is for those people that schemes such as the jobs, employment, and training, or JET scheme, and Jobstart have been introduced. We introduced the training schemes of that nature to avoid people being unemployed for long periods. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know it to be true. I have had the satisfaction of being involved with the planning of these schemes, as has Senator Crowley. I would like to know how else Senator Knowles is able to account for the fact that the unemployment rate for young people is currently one-half of what it was when we came to government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been some strange reference to tax scales, which also shows considerable confusion in the mind of Senator Knowles. She referred to rates as though they were flat rates and was not totally open and honest about the fact that the group to which she referred, those earning between $17,600 and $19,500 per year, have a marginal tax rate of 29c in the dollar, which means that they would probably pay in taxation between 12 per cent and 15 per cent on average of their incomes. She should take a closer look at the taxation rates before she starts making such sweeping statements. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, a considerably greater amount of well-targeted assistance to families helps them to look after their children in the home rather than their being put into institutions, which used to be the case. Our child support scheme is another extremely valuable measure of this Government and one that I am very glad to observe has bipartisan support in this Parliament. Although the scheme has been functioning for a relatively short period, already we see a substantially reduced number of sole supporting parents who qualify for full benefits, for the very good reason that they are now receiving maintenance to which they are absolutely entitled but which they had not previously received. Their standard of living in very many respects is greatly enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to increased employment, the Government has improved services in the provision of child care and refuges for young people. Youth homelessness is not a new phenomenon, as Senator Walters will confirm. We were both on a committee which looked closely at this matter years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like just to quote from what has been said by the Opposition and what we might expect from a coalition government whose secret agenda, we believe, is to cut families adrift from community support. That is what John Howard meant in his reply to the April statement when he said that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) should have announced further measures to reduce Government spending and that he should have arranged for families to look after themselves. We believe this Government already has many reforms for families in this nation, to enhance their standard of living and to greatly enhance the opportunities for their children in the years to come. We believe we have a record of which to be proud. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance that we are debating today, put forward by Senator Knowles, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need for the Government to take immediate action to reduce the appalling level of poverty and homelessness of Australian youth and to apologise for the Prime Minister's campaign device in promising Government action to ensure that no child would be living in poverty by 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, this is a matter of enormous public importance. This Government and any government should be urged to take action where there is poverty and homelessness in this country. Clearly, there is poverty amongst children and young people, and clearly, there is homelessness, in large measure as a result of this poverty. There is also homelessness which has not come as a result of poverty. We need only to look at some of the documentation. In the brief time available to me today, I will begin with the document released relatively recently as part of a campaign put forward by the Brotherhood of St Laurence entitled `Promise the Children'. I was a little disturbed by the title of this campaign. Children in this country have had enough promises; I would have much preferred to see the campaign named `Action for Children' or something of a much more positive nature. Nevertheless, that is the title that the Brotherhood has chosen. In its document Child Poverty: The Facts it documents facts which have been put already by Senator Knowles and are becoming all too readily a matter of general knowledge and, unfortunately, are not reducing very significantly. As Senator Knowles said, in terms of absolute poverty among children, among Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries Australia lags only a very short way behind the United States, with a very high level of almost 17 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The massive documentation in the report of the National Inquiry into Homeless Children by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission-the Burdekin report-brings the issue of homeless children very much to our minds. The Brotherhood reminds us that the Federal Government's introduction, in 1987, of the family allowance supplement and income supplement for children in low income families has reduced the number of children living below the poverty line by about 30 per cent. Of course, that is not adequate. The Brotherhood refers to what it sees as the causes of child poverty in Australia. It lists as the key elements unemployment, sole parent families, high housing costs, inadequate levels of government income support and low wages. On those, the Democrats have no disagreement whatsoever. They are all results of the sorts of economic policies that are being operated in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Unemployment is still with us, and it is a matter of great concern to the Democrats that the Government, the Opposition, the business community and even the unions appear to be somewhat satisfied with the unemployment plateau of about 7 per cent that we appear to have reached and at which we appear to be stuck. Yet only a decade ago this country would have been horrified at the thought of accepting that. During Question Time today Senator Coulter asked whether Senator Walsh could explain how home building in this country was contributing to our foreign indebtedness; in reply, the Minister for Finance spent several minutes explaining how detrimental the building industry's growth is to our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> In this week's newspapers the Master Builders Association and the housing and construction people are reported as having pointed out that some 40,000 jobs in the building industry are likely to disappear because of the pressures that are being put on the economy by the Government's policy of high interest rates. However, I do not take too much comfort from the alternative offered by the Opposition. Senator Giles has referred to the remarks of the new shadow Treasurer, Dr Hewson, with regard to cutting government spending. Senator Giles pointed out that this Government has also cut its social security payouts by targeting. Given that we still have unacceptably high levels of youth homelessness, child poverty and unemployment, the mind boggles at the thought of what would happen under the alternative government, whose expenditure on welfare, education and health could be cut, as Dr Hewson has been quoted as suggesting. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Hewson has been talking about better targeting. The appalling nature of some of this Government's targeting-and I will get to that matter later-is bad enough; imagining the alternative makes for nightmares. In its 1989 Budget submission, the Business Council of Australia urged the Federal Government to introduce spending cuts of $1 billion. We know that the Business Council of Australia has considerable influence on the coalition's policy-making. The prospect of the alternative to what we have now is not terribly appealing. On the basis of what we have heard so far, the Democrats do not believe that the Opposition would provide any comfort or would address the issues that Senator Knowles has raised in this debate. It is staggering that the Opposition should raise such issues, given that, apart from the sorts of things I have just mentioned-which provide no comfort at all-it is not putting forward any policies. Unemployment is a problem already, and it looks like getting worse if, for instance, we are to squeeze back on the housing industry, which at other times of high unemployment has always been seen as a way out. Now we are told that it is contributing to our foreign debt and, therefore, that it is going to be squeezed even more. That will cause higher unemployment, and the poverty and homelessness problems can only get worse. </PARA>
<PARA> Sole parent families as a group seem again to have dropped off the political agenda altogether, on both sides of politics. As the Brotherhood says, some people seem to think that the growth in the number of sole parent families is due to young women purposely having children outside marriage, knowing that they can claim a government pension. Of course that is not true. The level of payments to, and the struggles of, sole parent families are most significant and most damaging, and all too often result in poverty and homelessness. In fact, the majority of sole parent families result from separation, divorce or widowhood. </PARA>
<PARA> Family policies are touted throughout the Opposition's document Future Directions, to which we are asked to go for an indication of what the Opposition proposes for the future, should it get into government. There we are told that the precise details of the Opposition's social security and taxation policies must await its assessment of the overall resources available nearer the time of the next election. At the same time we are asked to accept the Opposition's rhetoric about the family. It says that it wants to improve the system so that individuals and families in need are properly supported and encouraged to assume more personal responsibility for improving their circumstances. I hope that, unlike the current Government, the alternative government would support family support services. </PARA>
<PARA> The Burdekin report, at recommendation 15.3, recommends that, where possible, families ought to be reunited and that negotiation, conciliation, counselling, provision of information and assistance with access to services to the family are required. Yet this Government, about three years ago, set up a pilot program of family mediation centres. There were three around Australia, one of them in Noble Park in my city of Melbourne. That centre was of enormous benefit to families of all kinds. It was able to provide services, support, information and advice, whatever the family problems, whether finance, relationships between family members-children and parents, parents and grandparents, children and grandparents, or whatever. Yet the program in Wollongong was cut off some time ago. The people at Noble Park are staggering along for another 12 months, having now to get their funds from the same sources as the marriage guidance people, whose guidelines require that there has been breakdown. So we have moved from a pilot program which dealt with prevention, support, and reuniting people to a program under which, if there is breakdown, the people concerned might get finance. A major cause of child poverty is sole parenthood, and much of it results from marriage or relationship breakdown. It seems to the Democrats that in this regard a major focus of policy must be the extension of a program of family conciliation centres, not a pilot for a few years and then a cut-off. Whether we are dealing with children in poverty or young homeless people, some such preventive program would make a major contribution. So far as we can see, however, there is not much hope on either side of politics. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area to which the Burdekin report points specifically, where there would be considerable assistance to young people, is that of income support. The point is made that young people often leave home because they are unemployed or because they are seeking employment. Often young people from isolated rural areas and from regional areas have got to go to other centres for employment. A submission to the Burdekin Committee pointed out that in the City of Ballarat in Victoria 50 per cent of the unemployed are under 25, and that the overall unemployment rate is twice the national average. Those people are forced to move in order to get jobs. Young people moving to get jobs on reduced unemployment benefits and inadequate income support systems are very quickly sinking into homelessness through no fault of their own. It is a simple matter for the Opposition to say that young people cannot get jobs because we are paying them too much. It is time that we recognised that one of the reasons that young people find it extraordinarily difficult to get jobs is that the jobs which a generation ago, and longer, existed for young, unskilled people, which were socially useful jobs, now do not exist. In many cases they are done by machines, by mechanical means, by some electronic process and so on; or they are taken by older people in the community who, as breadwinners, have been given priority as their jobs have been replaced through technological advance. I was brought up in a small country town where every biscuit was bagged, where every pound of tea was taken out of a large tin and put into a small one and where every retailer did home deliveries and took home orders. All those sorts of jobs, in which young people used to skill themselves to work up to becoming very important members of the community, have gone. We do not give those options to our children now. </PARA>
<PARA> What we must do is accept our responsibility. As Brian Burdekin says, we must meet the obligation to support them as required by the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. We do not do that. The young homeless allowance in this country is inadequate and almost impossible to qualify for. The Burdekin report makes several recommendations which reflect amendments to the young homeless allowance. I myself attempted to have them passed in this place some two years ago. It is very difficult to get the young homeless allowance and it ought to be easier to achieve. One of the major recommendations which the Australian Democrats would support is that the total benefit paid to homeless young people should be the equivalent of the adult rate of unemployment benefit; that while people are qualifying-and let us hope the qualifications are made easier-for the young homeless allowance there should be an alternative income support strategy; and that a special benefit should be paid during that interim period. The suggestion is a total equivalent to the job search allowance plus the young homeless allowance. Clearly, it is a major problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area that the Brotherhood of St Laurence draws attention to is high housing costs. For two or three years the Democrats have been pointing out that it is housing costs that have been pushing more and more people into poverty. Until both the major parties in this place agree to remove negative gearing, we will continue to have people finding it difficult to purchase their own homes, putting pressure on public housing and so on, so that the people at the bottom of the pile continue to be the worst off. As a result of the inadequate levels of government income support, we, as a community, have an obligation to support those who simply cannot get work or housing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this month, on the Appropriation Bills, I spoke on this very subject. At that time I asked how many senators had watched the television program Nobody's Children. I asked whether the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) or his minders had bothered to familiarise themselves with the plight of those children. I asked whether the Treasurer (Mr Keating) had seen the program. I asked, if they did, whether the Prime Minister still maintained that he was on track for that wonderful election promise he made: that by 1990 no child would be living in poverty. At the time, I said that the Prime Minister had abused and used those forgotten children; that he had used them for his own political purposes, giving them promises and expectations that he knew at the time would never be fulfilled by him. As we know, he subsequently wanted to change that, ever so slightly; but he has not got away with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was appalled that Senator Giles in her speech on homeless youth did not even bother to talk about the years of experience that she and I both had on the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare inquiring into homeless youth. She referred to that in only three or four words, saying that she had been a member of it. This is not new. On 5 December 1980 the Senate was so concerned about the homeless youth problem that was developing at that time that it gave the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare terms of reference which included the causes of, the problems associated with and the effect on Australian society of homeless youth, including the appropriate responsibilities of governments at all levels in the provision of services to this group; and the role and responsibilities of the family in supporting young people. That was in 1980. In August 1982 the Committee reported to the Senate. This Government came to power six months later. </PARA>
<PARA> What has this Government done in the period it has been in power? It had a report and it had recommendations. I would like to read just a couple of those recommendations. I am unable to go into them fully due to the lack of time. One of the recommendations was:</PARA>
<PARA> That when family support breaks down irretrievably or is non-existent, both government and the community have a clear responsibility to provide the necessary support for the young person until such time as he or she is able to make the final transition to full independent living. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee also said:</PARA>
<PARA>That family breakdown and youth unemployment are major factors which are associated with youth homelessness. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee said that the Commonwealth should provide additional funds to ensure that a properly coordinated data collection study be undertaken and that a nationally supervised `in service' youth refuge worker training scheme be established. The Government has done absolutely nothing. Because it has done nothing, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission decided to set up yet another inquiry. The letter written to the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen), which can be found at the front of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report entitled Our Homeless Children, states:</PARA>
<PARA>It is with deep concern that we present the report of our National Inquiry into Homeless Children and Young People. On behalf of the many thousands of children affected, we respectfully suggest that the Government give urgent consideration to the report and to the recommendations we have made. </PARA>
<PARA>What recommendations did it make? They were almost identical to the recommendations that we made nine years ago. What is the point of the Government having these recommendations put to them? The Burdekin report says:</PARA>
<PARA>In 1982 the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare stated-</PARA>
<PARA>and I was Chairman of that Committee-</PARA>
<PARA>so unreliable are the statistics available on the extent of youth homelessness that the Committee was hesitant to refer to them at all . . . Until such time as a properly conducted survey is undertaken, with adequate supervision and controls, there will continue to be conjecture as to the actual extent of the problem and whether or not the problem is increasing. </PARA>
<PARA>The Burdekin report goes on to say that in 1980 a survey showed that an estimated 9,000 young people per year were homeless. What is the figure today? At the time of our report, it was estimated that there were 9,000; today it is 40,000. The Government has sat on its hands and on our report and done absolutely nothing about the plight of these children. </PARA>
<PARA> Because there is no data, we do not have the ability to plan and work out just what we should be doing for these children. Our Committee gave a rough profile of homeless youth. They were probably 15 to 18 years of age; probably Anglo-Saxon; had experienced conflict within the family-for example, disputes with parents, unable to get along with a de facto parent or authoritarian father-may have been subject to physical, sexual and/or emotional abuse; often came from a non-traditional family such as a single parent or de facto family; the possibility of a drug or alcohol problem; and so on. We had the rough profile. We gave it to the Government. We asked it to do something about it, and it has done absolutely nothing-except the Prime Minister made the promise in an election speech that no child would be living in poverty by 1990. What a disgraceful event that was. It is disgraceful that the Government had on its plate the recommendations of the report of the Standing Committee on Social Welfare, but did nothing. Senator Giles did not even bother to refer to that report today even though she was a member of the Committee. I wonder why. Was it because she was ashamed of her Government for not having implemented any of the recommendations? Or was it because of the television program Nobody's Children, which portrayed so well how the homeless youth have been used and abused by this Government?</PARA>
<PARA> When I first went on that Committee I had a vague feeling that perhaps the majority of those children were children who had run away because they were not prepared to put up with parental authority. That is far from the truth. By far, the majority of those children have been used or abused by their parents or by their de facto parents. We went around the shelters throughout Australia. We had a cup of coffee with these children in the shelters and found them to be very outgoing. They talked to us about their problems. One young girl said, `Mum's not too bad. She gives me $10 every now and again'. It was her de facto father from whom she had to get away. The girl's mother knew that her de facto spouse was sexually abusing her young daughter. For the security of the rest of the family she allowed her daughter to leave home because she felt she could not cope without the spouse's financial support. </PARA>
<PARA> In another case, two young children, a boy and girl aged seven and eight, had gone home after school one afternoon to find that their mother and their de facto father had packed up and gone-lock, stock and barrel. The two young children went back to the school and slept in the school grounds over- night. It was a couple of days before the teacher found out that they were completely parentless. I felt very sorry for another young chap who at the time was about the age of my youngest child. He was covered in tattoos, he was wearing a singlet, he had long hair, and he wore earrings. I thought, `What would I do if my young son came home looking like that?'. When I said to him, `What's your story, lad?' he burst into tears and walked outside. The person who was looking after the shelter said that it was his first night away from home and that he would toughen up. </PARA>
<PARA> What a dreadful situation we have in Australia. I know that the Government cannot wave a magic wand as the Prime Minister pretended he could do, nor can it legislate for good parents. I am fully aware of that. I am also fully aware that there is much the Government can do. I am fully aware that the Burdekin report made a recommendation saying that it was the Government's responsibility. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Where children and young people leave or ought to leave home because of serious neglect or abuse, the Commonwealth should meet the obligation to support them, regardless of their age, in conditions where they are protected and can develop as required by the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very basic recommendation from the Burdekin report. It is also a very basic recommendation that our Committee put down eight years ago. Why has the Government not done anything at all in that period? It has buried its head. The only use it has made of those children is for the Prime Minister to grandstand prior to an election. </PARA>
<PARA> The television program Nobody's Children and the subsequent Couchman program in which Peter Couchman interviewed young homeless children brought back so many memories to me. These were the same children as those we interviewed when I was Chairman of the Committee on Social Welfare. They were making the same requests. When asked what sort of accommodation they wanted, they said exactly what they said in 1982. They said, `We want a block of flats so that we can all live together'. When that proposition was put to us, when we talked to them one to one across the coffee table, I asked, `Do you really believe that is practical?'. One of them said, `No, I guess not. We'd only get into trouble. We'd only have the police calling. We know that we need adult supervision'. They were asking for the same thing on the Couchman program, but they were not asked whether they thought the proposition was practical. They were not asked whether they should have adult supervision. The failure to ask those questions gave people watching the wrong impression. The majority of those homeless youths to whom we talked, as a committee, were fully aware of their own problems, their own failures. They knew that, left to their own devices, there was no way they would not get into trouble, that they needed adult supervision. </PARA>
<PARA> What these children ask for is pretty basic. They do not ask for much. They ask to be given somewhere to shelter but not the type of shelters around Australia in which they can stay only for a few weeks at a time before being shunted off. They cannot stay at the shelters for more than three weeks. They ask for permanent accommodation. These children are not there because they want to be there; they are there because they have been abused. It is the responsibility of this Government to act on the recommendations of the two reports that have been put in front of it. If it does not respond to those recommendations, if it continues to make false promises, this Government is far worse than most of us on this side of the chamber think it is. Surely there should be some humanitarian feeling on the Government benches. Surely there must be some responsibility somewhere amongst this crowd who profess to care for the underdogs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are asked today to consider as a matter of public importance the need for the Government to take immediate action to reduce the appalling level of poverty and homelessness of Australian youth, and to apologise for the campaign device of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in promising Government action to ensure that no child will be living in poverty by 1990. Let me say at the outset; on behalf of the Prime Minister, the Government and myself, that I do not apologise for that statement. That statement is usually lifted out of context by the Opposition. Even by itself it stands as a commitment to the intention and aim of this Government. It is a statement of which we should be proud-not ashamed. If the worst criticism that could be levelled against this Government is that it has not quite achieved that aim by 1990, we could say that it still has to keep to its promise. To suggest that it is no more than a device is insufficient and is, I think, a measure of the Opposition's capacity to address this topic. It is precisely because this Government cares, it is precisely because it recognises the damaging effects of poverty that it makes as a political statement, as a priority of policy, a commitment to reduce poverty. I will quote what the Prime Minister actually said at the time. Opposition members never want to know the full context. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By 1990 no Australian child will be living in poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> And to this end, my Government will establish a new program of family help-a program designed to lift more than 1 million Australian children into security and to help the more than half a million Australian families in greatest need, the hardest pushed, the most disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor's new Family Allowance Supplement will be paid, to mothers, on the basis of family income and family size. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the commitment and the promise. The Government will deliver as of 1 July this year. Last year in the appropriation debate we were criticised by the Opposition, in particular by Senator Chaney. The quote that I have used on a number of occasions by Senator Chaney appears on page 2630 of the Senate Hansard of 23 November 1988. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> With respect to assistance to families, I condemn the Government for the fact that the only families it has been prepared to help have been those on the lowest incomes. It has been prepared to help 10 per cent or so of families through the family allowance supplement. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government was condemned by Senator Chaney for doing precisely what Opposition senators say the Government ought to do. Senator Chaney acknowledged that it was our priority to help the lowest income families in this country. He said we had done this and he condemned us for doing it. I asked him then-he has never answered-whether he would have preferred it if we had actually helped the people at the top end of the income scale. He just does not know how to answer it. The Government is condemned for doing precisely what it said was its priority-to help families on the lowest income. It has done that. In the Budget statement last year it said that by 1 July tax cuts and changes in family allowances would occur. It made that statement and promised to do that. It has delivered. Again, the Government's commitment to assisting families out of poverty is on the record, not only as Senator Chaney complained about families at the lowest end of the income scale but now families well into the middle income scale through tax cuts, family allowance benefits and the family allowance supplement. The Opposition has great gall. It also has a lack of rigorous analysis. It has very little imagination. Ultimately, it has no policies at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walters said that she was a member of a committee which inquired into homeless youth which started in 1980 and reported in 1982. That report is something I know about because it has been cited. It was a very useful report. My colleagues Senator Zakharov and Senator Giles have drawn it to my attention. We have used it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walters should wait. Nobody interrupted her while she was speaking. She should hold about. That report contained useful information. It was brought together in a report put to people like myself and others who have worked in that field, as have you, Madam Acting Deputy President. We have had first hand experience, unlike the appalling claims of Senator Knowles that some of us never work amongst poverty or know about those cases. It is a disgraceful way of debating anything. Whether we have the experience or not matters less than that we understand and appreciate it. Some of us have had long years of experience in these areas and know what is contained in that report about homeless youth. We know about the shocking program on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation called Nobody's Children. In some ways this excellent program said not so much what was new but presented old and appalling information in a very powerful and pungent way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has been aware of a huge number of priorities it had to address when it came into government. One of these was to tackle the area of assistance to families and homeless children, particularly those who may have been homeless as a result of domestic violence or family break up. The dramatic increase in funding under this Government to the shelter movement is one way this Government has very seriously addressed the question of homeless youth. That seems to be quite overlooked and ignored by Senator Walters. I would certainly agree that there was not a sufficient number of youth shelters, but certainly the shelter movement for youngsters is in place and there is a very dramatic increase in the commitment by this Government towards public housing. The Government is on its way to addressing those problems. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two things that need to be said. Firstly, the Opposition's analysis of what causes the breakup of families and what causes youth homelessness and so on is similar to its analysis of the cause of domestic violence. It is very insufficient. All of us who are serious about examining these questions know that they are multicausal. Secondly, there are questions of poverty which contribute to this problem but many of us can cite children, let alone wives, from very wealthy families who find themselves victims of domestic violence or homeless children. The question of poverty certainly correlates highly with this problem and one would be a fool to ignore the consequences of poverty in those two very important areas. But they are not the only causes. Thousands of poor families in this country do not bash their wives or their children and do not have children leaving home. We are talking about a number somewhere between 9,000 that Senator Walters's committee wanted to say was correct-I suggest that was a very reasonable and modest number-and approaching 40,000, which was Mr Burdekin's suggestion. Senator Walters's report said that the data was not there. Mr Burdekin's report said the data is not there. One would have to qualify those figures. Senator Walters qualified her figures very thoughtfully and very reasonably. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walters would do anything for an interruption. She was very reasonable in her report, as has been brought to my attention, because she said, and still says, that it is very hard to examine the question with an insufficient database. I am advised that in her report-I have read it and know it to be the case-that she could not be sure that the children who were in one shelter one night were not counted again in a different shelter the next night. Those were her words. That is in the report. So she put a qualification on the figures. I simply urge her to put the same qualification on the figures we have now. We cannot be sure. There are some thousands of children in this country who are homeless and that is appalling. It is a tragedy. This Government is well aware of it and is addressing it. It is addressing it through the shelter movement, through public housing and through the assistance not just to the youth shelter movement but to the domestic violence shelter movement. It is also addressing the question by its recent announcements of increases in the family allowance supplement and by tax cuts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the causes of youth homelessness is poverty. We have not for some time defined what poverty is. It has been used extraordinarily loosely in the debate today, as has the word `child'. What do we mean by a child? That has not been properly defined. Most of us would understand in lay terms that a child might cover children between zero and 14. `Youth' tends to be the word we use for children once they have become established teenagers. I am not suggesting they are not children or minors but in terms of the way we are using the word in this debate we are slipping between assistance for children in families where it is much more targeted in two different ways by this Government, by children between zero and 13 and an increased amount of money for children between 13 and 16, to youth homelessness. To argue the Prime Minister's promise that child poverty will not exist in 1990 by quoting evidence of youth homelessness is somewhat fraught. I would like some more precision in the Opposition's presentation. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to know what the Opposition is so unhappy about. If it says that there is more to be done I would say to them, `Absolutely, this Government knows it and that is why it has just established its second stage of policies to deal with it'. If we were to say to the people of Australia, `Who do you think will do something about this-the Opposition that complains or the Government that has been here for six years in doing something about it? Which is the Government that has established benchmarks for the cost of children, which is the Government that has introduced these payments and increased them-the latest figures are $24 for a child between zero and 13 and $34.10 for children between 13 and 16 as of 1 July-which is the Government that has introduced these tax cuts, and not for the first time--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If we were to believe the Opposition, the best it has come up with since Dr Hewson has been running the economic show is the suggestion that it will cut spending on health, education and social security because these areas are not properly targeted. One of the things it indicates is that Dr Hewson has not examined the huge changes under social security, both with the review by Dr Bettina Cass and the specific targeting and consequent reduction in expenditure under this Government, so that while the total bill has come down the payments per individual have gone up. Together they are a commitment and are evidence that this Government knows what it is doing. It is addressing poverty, the establishment of benchmarks and, for the first time, indexing those payments so that families will not fall below this level again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have heard some quite far-ranging comments and contributions in the debate, most of which are hard to tie together. They came in particular from Senator Knowles. Somehow the price of fuel and insufficient allocation of excise for roads got into the cause of everything. The people are being asked here whether they would prefer to stay with a government with its policies in place, its commitment, its practices, its tax restructuring, its capital gains tax, its fringe benefits tax, its massive surplus, the first ever, that has allowed it to fund the recent tax cuts over and above the ones introduced in earlier years, or whether they would prefer the Opposition, which has no policies, no specific tax policies, has nothing but a series of complaints and now promises cuts in health, education and welfare under the new shadow finance Minister, Dr Hewson. I would think that the choice for the people in this country was very clear. I would think that most Australians would say, `We do not believe that Mr Hawke was an idiot to say that no child would live in poverty. We are glad to have a government that makes that sort of commitment on the public record as a priority, as a policy commitment, as a statement of what we will do and what we have willed to do since'. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is saying that poverty and child poverty in this country are not acceptable. We are the people who will address that problem. We are the people who have taken those very significant first steps. Out of the Opposition's mouth, this Government stands condemned for actually helping the bottom 10 per cent of families. I take that as high praise indeed. We are the Government that, since the last Budget, with its promises for tax cuts and increases in family allowances, said in the April statement that those promises will be delivered by 1 July this year. Of the two-the Opposition and the Government-I ask the people of Australia whether they can seriously wonder about the Opposition. The Opposition seems to want to condemn us for having a commitment to reduce and/or alleviate child poverty. Child poverty is not only a matter of income but to the extent that it is a matter of income support, this Government has made its contribution and made its steps clear. If it is a matter of social structuring, education, jobs and health policies, the Government's record is there. While more may remain to be done, the Government's commitment is clear. Its commitment to help women, as with its contribution to assisting families out of poverty, is also on the record. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that the choice for the Australian people was not to agree with this ridiculous matter of public importance. While the substance is important, the way it is couched is totally ridiculous and I reject it out of hand. I have no shame-in fact I am proud-that I am part of a government that has a commitment to reduce child poverty. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I may, I will quote from the Hansard of the House of Representatives of 24 May 1989 where Mr Macphee asked the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke):</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Did he, at the launch of the Australian Labor Party's 1987 election campaign, promise that his Government would eliminate child poverty by 1990; if so, what were his exact words. </PARA>
<PARA>In his reply the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> For our next term, we are setting achievable new goals for Australia's future in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> And at the head of these goals is the future of all our children. </PARA>
<PARA> So we set ourselves this first goal:</PARA>
<PARA> By 1990 no Australian child will be living in poverty. </PARA>
<PARA>When I heard that on my car radio at the time of the delivery of the policy speech in 1987, I did not have any doubt what he meant. I suspect that most people who heard it thought that he meant what he said and that is the reason we are debating it today. Had he in fact couched those sentiments, which he has put into Hansard, in the way that Senator Crowley referred to them, as commitment and aim, people might have reacted somewhat differently and interpreted his actions somewhat differently. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crowley went on today to debate the age of children and the age of youth. That is a good academic exercise but what we are really talking about is homelessness in our community. As has been said, the topic we are discussing states:</PARA>
<PARA> The need for the Government to take immediate action to reduce the appalling level of poverty and homelessness of Australian youth and to apologize for the Prime Minister's campaign device in promising Government action to ensure that no child would be living in poverty by 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister's original statement has been rephrased and, in Hansard, the Prime Minister, in his answer said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . by 1990 no child will need to live in poverty. </PARA>
<PARA>It would be everybody's hope that that would be the case. The Prime Minister, in April this year, brought down the family allowance payments. We do not suggest that they are not necessary or that they should not have been brought down, as seems to have been conveyed by some of the speakers this afternoon. It is interesting to look at the statement put out by the Prime Minister under the heading, `A Fair Deal for Families':</PARA>
<PARA> The 1989 economic statement contains major social reforms never before implemented by any government. </PARA>
<PARA>He then gave the details of the family allowance payments, and points out that for the first time family payments will be indexed and the child poverty pledge will be met in July 1989. That is perhaps the most outstanding statement of all. After the first statement, which most people had great difficulty believing, in April he said that, having brought in these welcome family allowance supplements and indexing them, he would then merely declare that the child poverty pledge would be met in July 1989. This document from which I am quoting does not say that the commitment and aim will be met in July 1989; it says that the child poverty pledge will be met in July 1989. We know for a fact that it will not be met in July 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister really has little choice but to back down and back away from the pledge he made. He cannot ignore the fact that so many young Australians are continuing to live in poverty and will be living in poverty next year. The important thing for the Government and the Parliament to look at is why that is so and what we are doing to solve it rather than getting excited about the issues put forward by Senator Crowley. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Giles seemed to devote a considerable amount of her time to what she called the abject failure of the coalition when in government. Unfortunately for us, it is now six years since we were in government. I find it remarkable that Labor members of parliament can continue to talk about the previous seven years. We were elected in 1975; that is a long time ago. I would have thought that six years in government would have given them something to talk about, the things that they have done themselves. But somehow it is the abject failure of the coalition that seems to dominate the thoughts of Government senators when they talk on these matters. Something about it really gets to them. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that anybody in our community who is involved in caring for young homeless children or who is trying to find solutions to the problem could not have been but astonished to have heard the promise before the 1987 election and would have been looking for a great deal more by now. All of us would have wanted to see the promise met. Most of us appreciate the gravity of the problem, and it comes as no surprise to look to 1990, close as we are to it now, and know that the promise has not been met. Senator Walters and others have referred to the recent Australian Broadcasting Corporation program which so graphically put together the facts on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever the rationale behind the Government's policy of somewhat misinforming the public, it is shameful that the Prime Minister and members of his Government regarded the tragedy of children living in poverty as fair game for winning votes in the 1987 election. I do not think anybody doubts that that was what the Prime Minister was doing at the time. Perhaps he hoped that people would forget it. Perhaps he did not really care whether they believed him. He made the dramatic promise that by 1990 no Australian child would be living in poverty. Of course, we all know how family incomes have suffered during the six years of Labor government. A family in receipt of average weekly earnings is $56 a week worse off because of the taxation policies of this Government. That does not include the well over $2,000 increase in mortgage repayments in the last 12 months, let alone the increases which occurred before then, which affect those families attempting to buy homes. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem with child poverty and youth homelessness is that the Government has pursued policies which actually exacerbate the problems. High interest rates, high taxation and high inflation have seriously damaged the ability of middle and low income families to provide for their children in the way in which they want to provide for them. Families are facing very severe financial hardships at present, as is evidenced by the sort of public meetings that are being held in Canberra tonight and in other places. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crowley seemed to think that we were suggesting that children being driven from homes by violence was associated with poverty. In some instances it is, but we do not for a minute suggest that violence in the domestic situation relates only to poverty. None of us would ever suggest that it does not happen in families that are financially well off. We all know that it does. We know that there are many reasons why families break up and why children go in different directions. Some of them have problems with the blended family relationships which are subsequently established. Most of us have friends with families which in some respects appear perfectly stable. The families may comprise four or five children, one of whom leaves home and becomes a homeless child, while the others do not. It does not have to do merely with money. It is necessary to look at financial issues, but what we are talking about today are the consequences of a breakdown of some kind which results in children leaving families, and the pressures that are placed upon them. I had intended to refer to the comments made by Bishop Owen Dowling. I quoted his comments in the Senate the other day, so I will not refer to them in detail. He commented that the Prime Minister's pledge stretched his credulity. He, too, is a man very much attuned to what is going on in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Some children, of course, who remain in a perfectly stable and quite happy home are living in poverty. To suggest that this occurs only in single parent families flies in the face of reality. Certainly, I can point to two-parent families living in poverty in Canberra because of the financial situation they face at present. The Prime Minister's recent backtracking on his promise was an attempt to imply that no family ought to be in poverty, so long as the parents are not spending the Government's largess at the TAB or on the poker machines. That sort of suggestion is very offensive. It is a gross insult to many thousands of families to suggest that they only find themselves and their children in poverty because of their own mismanagement. That is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> As I, said, the program entitled Nobody's Children put together most adequately the issues that we are talking about. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has produced a report entitled Our Homeless Children. People who have read that report must be much better informed than previously, if they had any doubts about the issue that we are discussing. The Institute of Family Studies has also reported on the problem. The impact on the individual is very great. It takes an enormous toll on the health, self-esteem and opportunities of children who are living in poverty with no hope for the future. Nobody's Children referred to them as a new underclass. </PARA>
<PARA> The toll on the rest of the community is great. It results in increased juvenile crime. It has an enormous impact on the health of children. There has been an enormous increase in under-age drinking among those who are homeless. There are reports about increase in brain damage of young Australians who are well below the legal drinking age. There is evidence from Dr Jean Lennane, the Director of Drug and Alcohol Services at the Rozelle Hospital, that there is more alcohol-related brain damage amongst younger Australians than has ever been seen. Such young Australians do not drink because they seek great excitement; they drink out of despair. Young people are drinking to get drunk because they see that they have no future. One 15-year-old boy is quoted as saying, `Drinking is a way to blot out the way I am feeling'. How can we live with ourselves when young people are in that situation? Alcohol is frequently seen by many as a crutch. </PARA>
<PARA> It is even more distressing to look at the suicide rate. The Australian Bureau of Statistics released figures last month which show that young Australian males have a suicide rate three times greater than in the 1950s. There were 417 youth suicides in 1987. Of course, that figure does not include deaths due to accidental overdoses or deaths of young people from car accidents, where frequently alcohol is a factor. On cannot simply look at the instances and know whether homelessness or other factors were involved, but the amount of drinking among young homeless people indicates that there is a serious problem. The consequences are enormous. </PARA>
<PARA> Sociological and psychiatric studies indicate that for every suicide there may be as many as 100 attempted suicides. Even if the figure were only 50, it would be a tragedy. There is an appalling social cost because young people have no hope for the future. Some of the consequences that we face include the care that they need and the range of mental illnesses from which they may suffer. It is not just a problem in the larger cities; it affects every community. In Canberra about 700 young people spend time in crisis refuges every year. Many others cannot be accommodated. Many turn to petty crime, drug dealing and prostitution to survive. It is a national tragedy; no one would disagree with that. The solution is not merely to declare that it will be wiped out. We need to find suitable education opportunities, jobs and activities which are meaningful for these young people. </PARA>
<PARA> Any senators who fail to support the raising of this matter have a very shallow view of the matter. What led us to raise this very important matter today was the callousness of the Prime Minister in making that pledge in 1987 which cannot be met by him. I hope that all senators will support the matter. It is a very genuine message that we need to send to the Prime Minister about the urgency of the problems faced by so many young people, including homeless young people. </PARA>

But sympathy is no substitute for analysis, policy formulation, long term planning or systematically trying to overcome the problems. In this respect there is a great deal of hypocrisy in the raising of this matter of youth poverty and homelessness in this way. It is not only hypocritical of the Opposition but also politically stupid. It is stupid because, arguably, the record of this Government in the area of youth poverty in particular is among the best records of any government in the history of this country. Youth poverty, of course, is essential to the question of homelessness in any case. There is no way of dealing with the question of homelessness unless one deals first or partly with the question of poverty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In contrast, the Opposition's record is abysmal. There is no point in saying, as Senator Reid does, that we should not mention the record of the Opposition when it was in government or the statements that the Opposition makes currently. There is a point because what this shows is a fundamental difference between the attitudes of those on this side of the House and those on the other side of the House. There is a fundamental difference in the care and concern that is shown at the practical end when it comes to divvying up budgets and thinking of policies over the long term. We do not just convey anecdotes, gripping and compelling as they are. We do something about the situation. The Opposition's record, and particularly its recent statements, show that it has made no attempt and does not show any interest in making an attempt to do the same. It shows how bereft of talent and ideas the Opposition is. There is pressing legislation involving the provision of funds and resources for many needy groups, including many provisions for youth, banked up in the Senate waiting to be considered. The Opposition is prepared to waste the Senate's time with fatuous censure motions, such as the one we dealt with this morning, and matters of public importance, such as the one before us, which are not relevant to the general purposes of the Parliament or the Government and add nothing to the stock of human knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> Former speakers have gone into the Government's record in some detail. I will give an overview and summarise the Government's record although a summary is not meant to trivialise this record in any way. The Government introduced the family allowance supplement to lift one million children into security. That and subsidiary proposals have been welcomed by all social security observers and workers in the field as going a long way to achieving the sorts of ends about which the Opposition talks but does very little. The Government has provided rent assistance and a child disability allowance free from means testing. It has introduced indexation of all family related payments, thus preventing the erosion of the real value of payments, in areas such as the family allowance, the family assistance scheme, pensioner and beneficiary children, the dependent spouse rebate, the sole parent rebate, the mothers and guardians allowance, the double orphans pension and the child disability allowance. All of these are firsts. All these areas were indexed to make sure that there was no erosion of the original benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also implemented tax cuts. Despite what those on the Opposition benches say, the greatest increases in benefits are at the lower end of the tax scale. We have made the tax scale more progressive to assist those in greatest need. It was interesting to hear Senator Knowles talk about punitive marginal taxation rates. In 1983 the lowest tax rate was 30c in the dollar. Nowadays the lowest tax rate is 21c in the dollar. The next rate up was 46c in the dollar; it is now 29c. The next rate was 60c; it is now 39c. The highest rate is 49c, going down to 47c. But most importantly-Senator Knowles would not agree with this-we have made the tax scales more progressive, not less progressive, and the nonsense which she and other speakers raised about an unsubstantiated figure of $56 a week loss in average income--</PARA>

I know that there is a conflict between the Liberal Party of Australia and its partner, the National Party of Australia, about many things. But how does that fit with the question which Senator Stone asked Senator Walsh yesterday? He quoted from the Australian Statistician's report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In current price, seasonally adjusted terms, wages, salaries and supplements rose by 3.4 per cent in the March quarter 1989, following a rise of 4.5 per cent in the previous quarter . . . </PARA>

<PARA> That is, an 8 per cent rise during those six months. </PARA>
<PARA>He asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Has the total rise in wages, salaries and supplements during the 12 months to March 1989 amounted to no less than 11.7 per cent?</PARA>
<PARA>He was saying that there had been a wages blow-out and we should not have allowed it to happen. On the other hand, the Opposition is saying that there are massive losses in income. It does not fit together. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Budget projection for this year is 6.5 per cent. The point is that Senator Stone is making out that those rises have occurred and the Opposition is making out that they have not. That is the fundamental difference. To return to the Government record: under this Government there has been an abolition of the six-week delay in the indexation of pensions and benefits and the bringing forward of those indexation benefits by another six weeks. Prospective supplementary payments for low paid workers have been introduced. There has been improved training and income support for sole parents and the long-term unemployed. Child support arrangements have been upgraded and there has been an improvement in general terms in employment levels. The Government's record in this area is second to none. This Government is applauded all over the world as one that is achieving employment growth at twice the rate of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries in general.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One does not have to believe me or the Government, because we are likely to have an interest in trumpeting our achievements. I draw the Senate's attention to a couple of statements, one of which was quoted before. I think that it deserves to be quoted once again. The statements were made by independent observers, not observers who are easy to get along with from the Government's point of view-in fact they are constant critics of the policies which we bring down. Referring to the whole family allowance arrangement and particularly the April statement which brought that to final fruition, the Brotherhood of St Laurence stated:</PARA>
<PARA> This pledge, the most specific social commitment of the century-</PARA>
<PARA>get that!-</PARA>
<PARA>has been the subject of a historic package to provide a guaranteed minimum income for poor children . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>We congratulate the Federal Government on its work on child poverty, which represents a historic breakthrough in the national attack on child poverty. The Federal Government has now built a solid foundation of income security for Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA>The Brotherhood of St Laurence is a very cogent critic of every government's policies, and no less of this Government's policies. Bishop Peter Hollingworth said:</PARA>
<PARA>In strict income security terms, it is true that the Prime Ministerial promise ``that no children shall live in poverty by 1990'' . . . will be achieved. This represents significant progress, and demonstrates that governments can meet some modest social justice objectives, even at a time of economic restraint when they are involved in public sector cutbacks and tax reduction in order to improve their economic efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Institute of Family Studies, which again is a very difficult critic and one whose people are not easily convinced by government policies but were convinced by the package, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The package appears to redress the erosion of family incomes since 1976 through tax bracket creep and the failure to index family benefits. The indexation of family benefits is an historically significant feature which will ensure that these payments will not be eroded in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>On the Institute's analysis of the Government's package 70% of families will gain more than $1000 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>48% of the cost of the package goes to the 30% of households which include dependent children. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has, in addressing family poverty, addressed the question of youth poverty. But enough of the Government's record of which I am proud and for which I do not apologise. Let us look at the Opposition's record and what it currently stands for. The only adjustments in payments that were made during the Opposition's time in office for low income families were as follows: in 1980 it raised payments from $7.50 to $10. In 1976 the Opposition cashed out tax rebates for children into the family allowance and, in doing so, cut total assistance for the first child from $4.50 a week to $3.50 a week. In 1982 the parties now in opposition increased family allowance for the first child to $5.25, a net nominal increase of 75c in seven years. That occurred against the backdrop of a blow-out in labour costs when they lost control of the economy because they did not have a wages policy, and against the backdrop of an explosion of unemployment. What gains were made were very quickly lost. </PARA>
<PARA> More cogently and more recently the Federal Opposition, at the 1987 election, effectively made a commitment to cut all benefits for under 18-year-olds. How will that help youth unemployment? The Opposition said that it would cut the dole for under-18s. It said it would introduce a special youth training wage which would be much lower than the current wage and it said it would introduce work for the dole for anyone over 19. I fail to see how any of those proposals will assist poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no different now. In the Peacock regime, the shadow Treasurer, Dr Hewson, has made a commitment to cut welfare, education and health payments. How, on the one hand, can we be highly fiscally responsible, as Dr Hewson is saying we must be, and cut the big budget items of health, welfare and education and, on the other hand, expect to do more for the youth of the country in greatest need? The Opposition is trying to have it both ways. No amount of bluster and no exercises in the petty semantics of what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) did or did not say will hide the fact that the Opposition's position is hypocritical. It talks about savagely cutting outlays, although as yet it has not-and I doubt that it will-specifically identified where those cuts in outlays will occur. Given its record, they will occur in the neediest areas; they will not affect its supporters-the well to do, those with silver spoons in their mouths, the North Shore brigade or, in Perth terms, the Dalkeith set. They will get their assistance and their perks. There will be no means tests and no targeting. It will cut broadly, in the way that it always has, and hurt those most in need. I cannot see how that will help youth poverty or, for that matter, youth homelessness. </PARA>
<PARA> On the one hand the Opposition talks about cutting outlays and on the other it talks about a sort of cargo cultism. I simply cannot match those two together. It believes that there is some sort of magical way of producing revenue to meet all the various demands. It wants to increase expenditure in almost every area. At Question Time we get a constant barrage of questions about why we are cutting in certain areas and how we should be increasing expenditure in other areas. Yet we have this talk of cutting outlays, particularly in the areas that will hurt the people that the Opposition is addressing in this matter of public importance. I do not apologise for the statement made by the Prime Minister. I do not apologise for the Government's record. It stands up extremely well in contrast to the Opposition's record and the Opposition's recent statements. </PARA>

What is more relevant than ensuring that people, particularly children, are not living in poverty? Senator Beahan went on-once again harping back-to say that the tax rates during the Fraser years were nowhere near what they are today. Dead right: they were nowhere near what they are today. But he failed to mention the effect of bracket creep. A cynic might say that `Bracket Creep' is currently in Paris. As I mentioned before, Labor's policies will, in two years, see two-thirds of Australian taxpayers paying tax at the top marginal rate. The alternative that we are offering, and that we and the Government should be looking at, requires attention to housing, employment and education.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The report on the Code of Conduct for Australian Companies with Interests in the Republic of South Africa, which we have just received, is an interesting report. It is the second report under the Code of Conduct for Australian Companies with Interests in the Republic of South Africa. Mr Bannerman, in his report, brings to our attention the fact that there are now only seven Australian companies in South Africa, employing about 740 black workers. He makes the point that this interest in South Africa is tiny by comparison with the United Kingdom, the United States and other countries. Of course, compared with the South African economy itself, it is minute. In fact, he reminds us that South Africa's population is already more than twice ours. So we are looking at seven Australian companies to which this report refers, in a country with greater than twice the population of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> He raises the interesting question of whether the code is serving a worthwhile purpose and whether it need continue, not only because of the very few companies involved under it but also because of growing evidence that questions the value of such codes within the South African economic environment. He says in the report that industry groupings at the peak level tend to see the codes as obsolescent and having mainly domestic value for the home countries of the companies concerned. Perhaps we should think about that. Unions at the peak level do not believe in codes but rather in what they can achieve themselves. He says that workers at the plant level are a little more unsure, with some thinking that they might bring some marginal benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The paramount point he makes is that the Australian companies operate in an economic environment in which they cannot get far away from the industry norms. In other words, what will occur will really occur because of pressures within South Africa. He mentioned the view, which he seems to endorse, that benefits on the small achievements that have been made by blacks to date-when one looks at changes to the pass law, black taxis and changes in the group areas-seem to have been largely achieved through pressure from within. He therefore asked whether in such marginal circumstances the code is serving a continuing worthwhile purpose. It is an interesting subject for us to consider, because we in the Opposition have supported a voluntary code of this nature. It is in our policy to support such a code because we, as with the rest of the world community, have seen it as a useful vehicle for influencing change for the better in South Africa, change away from apartheid and towards equal rights for all the residents of South Africa, no matter what their colour. Of course Australia was one of the last nations to adopt the code idea, being a long way behind the United States of America, the United Kingdom and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess the important thing to note in the difference between the Opposition's policies and the Government's policies towards South Africa is that we have not seen isolation as likely to achieve the benefits which this Government claimed it was seeking. In other words, we have said that a genuine and continuing dialogue has the opportunity of achieving greater benefit. We have therefore not supported the use of punitive economic sanctions. If we look at Australia's influence in terms of its corporate life in South Africa being down to only seven companies, we will see that in effect we have no influence left whatsoever. We have therefore adopted a series of policies that really do involve much more in the line of constructive engagement. Not only do we believe in bringing political pressure and other influences to bear towards change, but also we believe in keeping open the doors of commerce and industry, so that through influence in commerce and industry we can bring about changes for the better. We would want to maintain that policy, not to impose obstacles to investment and to business, commercial and travel links with South Africa. We will support the code until we are convinced otherwise. But we will certainly look at this report and encourage Australian businesses operating in South Africa to provide housing loans and grants, technical and managerial training, scholarships and other similar programs for black South Africans; in other words, a constructive way of trying to pursue our objectives. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the first report on the Australian civil offsets program to be tabled in the Senate. It is a somewhat tardy tabling because it is the annual report for the year 1987-88. In previous years a description of the offsets program was included in the annual report of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce (DITAC), but the Committee of Review on Offsets, chaired by Sir Brian Inglis, suggested a separate annual report be provided to enhance both the accountability and the visibility of the program. As honourable senators familiar with offsets will know, they play a major role in defence procurement, even as shown in this report. A major part of the program is concerned with the aerospace industry, because both the manufacture and purchase of aviation and defence hardware is so capital intensive that offsets play such a major role in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very disappointed with certain aspects of the report. For instance, the report lacks detail as to the age of the outstanding offsets obligations. Page 22 of the report states that 478 Australian firms and institutions have benefited from offsets work over the life of the program. But when we recall that the program was established almost 20 years ago, in 1970, I do not consider the involvement of less than 500 firms as an indication of the measure of success. What this does show is that very few firms and institutions have been beneficiaries in the program. It seems to me that it is in some ways a type of industry club, with some new members actually being discouraged, and this is especially noticeable when one sees that I think only 23 organisations became involved in the program for the first time in 1987-88.</PARA>
<PARA> I would particularly like to mention the criticisms of the Commonwealth Auditor-General in his report of October 1984. The Auditor-General identified six key weaknesses in the administrative process of the civil offsets program, especially in relation to unclear policy guidelines and substantial shortcomings in the recording, monitoring and reporting of both the offsets obligations and the achievements. However, the response from the Department was certainly briefer than it should have been, and I think this indicates the attitude that some of these departments and departmental heads have towards the Parliament. It is disappointing to note in chapter 5, titled `Partnerships for Development', that only 10 partnerships were signed in 1987-88. I understand a few more have been signed since then. This chapter gives a great deal of what I term vague promises, yet it provides very little evidence of commitment either of what the partners have undertaken to do or what they have done, or the details of their commitment. In other words, I believe this is far too vague. </PARA>
<PARA> I am afraid that a lot of money seems to remain in the hands of a few participating firms. The report devotes a whole chapter to a discussion of the 270th report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts (PAC) entitled Implementation of the Offsets Program. An indication of the failure of this program is that the Public Accounts Committee is actually currently looking at another report on the offsets program. But I must say it is at least pleasing to note that the work of the Public Accounts Committee has not gone entirely unnoticed by the Department, because it has published in this report its responses to the earlier concerns of the Public Accounts Committee's 270th report. I think the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) and this chamber should be concerned that it took the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) seven months to convey to the PAC the Finance minute of DITAC in reply to report No. 270. I think such a tardy response is typical of the way particular departments treat both the committees of the Parliament generally and the citizens who read the reports. The Public Accounts Committee thought that where possible defence and civil offsets should be administered within one department. I am pleased that the report before us today states that there is a close relationship with the defence offsets authority and that exchanges of data occurred at all levels. Nevertheless, I am disappointed that more steps cannot be taken towards integration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the first annual report on the Australian civil offsets program as a very small victory to the Parliament over the Executive. This report is clearly in response to the efforts of a number of senators and the members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. It is very interesting to see the letter to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), by Dr Charles, the head of the Department, who in referring to the report says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The decision to produce the report goes back to the Committee of Review . . . chaired by Sir Brian Inglis. </PARA>
<PARA>That Committee of Review on Offsets, and the Government's response to it, recommended that an annual report be made to the Minister, and the Government's decision in relation to that was to accept that decision. That was back in 1986, but this report was not sent to the Minister until 15 May 1989. In effect it has taken three years and a lot of pushing and shoving in this place, by various senators and the Public Accounts Committee, to at last actually get a report to the Parliament in relation to the civil offsets program, giving us an opportunity to study what is happening in relation to that program. In this letter to the Minister, Dr Charles mentions that, although this report details the information for the first time, reports about offsets have been set out in the Department's previous annual reports. He may claim that, but the truth is that there have been only passing references to the offsets program in previous departmental annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of minor errors in the report that I do not intend to go through in detail; no doubt in due course they will be picked up. In the limited time I have had to look at the report, it appears to be comprehensive, and I thank the Department for that. For example, at last we are able to see a draft of a memorandum of understanding on a partnership for development. A draft of that document is set out in one of the appendices, and it is interesting to look at. I will be interested to see how the report next year handles the record of events last August-September, when Senator Button was forced to make a detailed explanation to the Parliament about the partnership for development program. That was the report which he finally tabled on 27 September 1988, when the Senate was about to take him to task for not providing the Parliament with the information that we had requested of him. </PARA>
<PARA> There are clearly some inconsistencies between what is in the report and what the Minister told us last year on 27 September. For example, last year in his report the Minister mentioned that the partnership for development program evolved from the offsets program but that they were not related. This report shows that the partnership for development program is to be a key part of the offsets program. That is clear confirmation of what I have been saying for two years-that the Minister and this Department have not really worked out what they are on about in relation to partnerships for development. There is much misunderstanding or lack of clarity in their views. I hope that this report will enable the Department and the Minister to clear up finally what they are on about. </PARA>
<PARA> The report shows the extent of the administrative discretion and that the ground rules for that administrative discretion have frequently been changed. Once again that confirms my belief, which I have often repeated, that there is a need for a legislative base for the offsets program and for the partnership for development program. Without that legislative base, the people of Australia are being deprived of the information to which they are entitled about these programs. The report shows that companies incurred obligations of about $240m in 1987-88, and that was a substantial obligation imposed by the Government without the approval of the Parliament. </PARA>

The figures produced to the Committee and which appear in the Committee's report, particularly those relating to heroin use, must be described as highly disturbing. For instance, in the last twelve months 33,600 people used heroin and 84,500 used cocaine. The figure for the number of frequent or regular users was referred to in the first instance as 3,360 but, as is explained in the report, by the time one adds the number of people who are receiving methadone treatment and those who are in prison, it looks as though over 12,000 people in this country are in what is described as the revolving door of heroin addiction. That figure must be of concern to any Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the statistics further, one sees that the position does not improve. The turnover in illegal drugs we put at $2.6 billion a year. We brought home the enormous profits which, regrettably, are at the base of this trade and mentioned that one kilogram of heroin purchased in Asia for between $12,000 and $15,000 is marketed in Australia at between $200,000 and $250,000. Of course, those profits drive this business and, ultimately, lead to the suffering of individual Australians. We have estimated the cost of law enforcement in this area at $123m a year. So it is a major investment by the Australian community simply in trying to limit the extent of drugs on the market. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know the direct costs of drug abuse. The Committee reminds the Senate, however, of the indirect costs-the costs to individuals who support their drug addiction by means of prostitution or who are forced into fraud or property offences. An enormous number of property offences are associated with drug abuse. We look also to the indirect cost in the use of intravenous injections, leading to the spread of hepatitis-B and acquired immune deficiency syndrome. There is also the indirect cost of corruption, which was really the link between this Committee's work and the corruption which we find not only in law enforcement bodies but in the judiciary and in parliaments and is associated with the money that is produced from drug abuse. It emphasises how important the subject is and how important it is that we continue to struggle with identifying ways in which the problem might be best handled by society. </PARA>
<PARA> There are obvious ways in which to approach the subject: we can look at the supply end of the equation, at the demand end, or at both. Very briefly, in relation to supply, the Committee formed the opinion that law enforcement bodies were probably achieving more than they are given credit for in inhibiting supply. Of course, there is another side to that: success in reducing marijuana crops in this country has forced the price up, leading to an increase in other associated crime and, at least in the case of some users, to the taking of other drugs that may well be more dangerous to them. It is difficult to get evidence on which one can rely with great confidence. The local police forces say that the price of cannabis has gone up because of their success in reducing crops. In the Customs Service there are those who say that the price has gone up because the quality product is imported from overseas and the drug importers are voluntarily reducing supply in order to increase the price. </PARA>
<PARA> In the report we refer to penalties. Penalties would be a greater deterrent if those suffering them were not only those in the criminal world but also those outside, particularly the people who are financing and otherwise developing the business of illegal drugs and their importation. Unfortunately it is the couriers, the traffickers and the users-nearly always themselves addicted-who end up in court. As we point out in this report, in those cases penalties do not necessarily achieve the objective that they are designed to achieve. We say that increasing the statutory penalties will not necessarily, by itself, achieve the objective. It is not surprising that there has been some disappointment at the severity of the penalties that have been imposed by judges. Judges simply reflect community attitudes, and unless the community reacts in a certain way the courts will not follow. </PARA>
<PARA> The report mentions the importance of interdiction and of posting capable intelligence officers outside Australia. The Customs Service has an impossible task when the drugs reach our shores, unless it has intelligence on which to make the interception. The Opposition therefore supports this process. We support the posting of additional Australian Federal Police (AFP) officers in South America. However, we remind the Senate of the problems that have occurred in this area as a result of government inadequacies-the lack of coordination, the problems that have been obvious in the last few years with law enforcement bodies. We were disappointed to see the Coast-watch responsibility taken away from the AFP, which had not been given the resources to do the job properly. Of course, under this Government's policies the AFP has been reduced largely to a 9-to-5 force. </PARA>

<PARA> We in the Opposition reject the argument for decriminalising heroin and other hard drugs. Whilst that might reduce property offences, in our view it would not only increase the number of abusers, at least in the short term, but also send the wrong message from society as to the associated dangers. The other end of the equation, of course, is demand. We commend further education in schools and elsewhere. Education programs must be consistent with the message that is otherwise communicated to society. We support further rehabilitation programs. We say that control of supply is not the only way of helping to solve this problem. We must make all reasonable efforts to reduce demand. The report emphasises the extent of the difficulty, the dangers that are associated with these drugs, the growing trend towards amphetamines being taken in discotheques, the potential for going down the American crack path. These are major subjects that I hope will be addressed by the Senate, and I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, I wish simply to make reference to one of the recommendations. I am moved to do so by the fact that today is national smoke free day, as I understand it. I quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government ban all advertising of alcohol and tobacco products on radio, television, in cinemas and in print, so far as it is within its constitutional power to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>I note that Senators Alston and Hill and Mr MacKellar and Mr McGauran dissented from this recommendation. I do so with regret, as they are all coalition members. When this report came out I, as consumer affairs spokesperson for the Australian Democrats, announced that the Democrats would be producing private member's legislation in the next session of Parliament to implement part of that recommendation-a ban on advertising cigarettes. The Committee supported the continuation of the emphasis on demand reduction, which has been a major thrust of the National Campaign against Drug Abuse. It pointed out that demand reduction and law enforcement strategies are not interdependent, that, to be effective, demand reduction strategies do not require the assistance of legal prohibitions on the product. But the Committee went on to agree with Dr Alex Wojak that one of the ways to reduce the use of illegal drugs by young people may be to reduce their early use of legal drugs. In this context the Democrats believe that it is appropriate that the Commonwealth should act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted that there is evidence that the total ban on tobacco advertising implemented in Norway in 1975 has caused a marked decline in the sales of cigarettes in that country, and, in particular, a decline in the number of teenagers in that country taking up smoking. The Committee reports that, in the course of gathering evidence around the country, it found considerable support for a ban on all alcohol and tobacco advertising. The States of Victoria and South Australia have acted with regard to tobacco advertising, and are phasing in programs. The Democrats believe that action should be taken at the Commonwealth level as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee makes the point that young people in our society are faced with conflicting messages about the acceptability of drug-taking. It expresses concern about the advertising of what are legal drugs and about the possible links between the use of legal drugs and the use of illegal drugs. In recognition of the health damage of tobacco also the Democrats pursue this course of action, but that is additional to what is taken up in this report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has marked this smoke-free day with a campaign to reduce smoking by young women. Of course, it is young women who have been taking up smoking in increasing proportions in recent years. In fact, the rate of smoking is dropping in all groups of society except girls and young women. We have noted that the thrust of the campaign strategies of tobacco companies is very clearly directed towards young people, particularly young women. If the Government is serious about the campaign that it has launched today, it will take seriously the Committee's proposition and the Democrats' continuing push on the issue of advertising this product. I draw attention to that particular recommendation in the Committee's report, and seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade is very important. The state of our mine countermeasures capability is very disturbing. I have been drawing attention to this deficiency in our defence capability for many years. In my view the Navy has been far too interested, far too involved, in programs to defend merchant ships on the high seas against submarine attack-which to my mind is a very unlikely eventuality, bearing in mind that 95 per cent of the ships carrying our trade are foreign-flag vessels-and has ignored the very real danger of our ports being made inoperative by mines. Mines can be laid by submarines or aircraft or, clandestinely, from surface merchant ships. These are common ways for relatively low technological warfare to be waged. One only has to look at recent experiences in the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf and Nicaragua to see how effective this type of campaign can be. It must be tackled. We must have the capability to deal with this in our ports. In my mind, it is the most likely low level threat that we will have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to say a few words about the nature of the mine warfare problem. There are two types of mines-moored mines or buoyant mines, and ground mines, which are not normally buoyant but lie on the seabed. Moored mines or buoyant mines are the oldest type of mine normally operated by running into them or colliding with them. The method of dealing with them is to use mechanical sweeps to cut their mooring wire. They then come to the surface where they can be destroyed. Ground mines, which are normally only effective down to about 90 metres, lie on the seabed and may be activated magnetically by the magnetic signature of the ship, acoustically by its noise or by its pressure pattern, or by a combination of these. Once activated, a large explosive very seriously damages the bottom of the ship. To make them more complicated, these ground mines can be fitted with delay mechanisms, a time delay, so that they do not become active and, therefore, cannot be swept for any amount of time. They may also be given a period delay mechanism so that they have to be activated a certain number of times-say, 10 times-before they go up. So the area can be swept nine times and be thought to be clear, and the tenth time a ship goes through up the mine goes. It is a very difficult problem to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA> Another type of mine is the rising or homing mine, which I do not think that we should concern ourselves with at the moment. That is really a ground mine which is capable of operating at much greater depths. When activated it either rises on its own buoyancy, having been tethered to the bottom, or homes on the ship above. These are high technology mines which are only in the hands of the big powers at the moment and, for technical reasons, are not very likely to be used in our waters. </PARA>
<PARA> How do we deal with these types of mines? There are two basic solutions. One is mine sweeping. We can either tow a mechanical sweep which cuts the mooring wire of the buoyant moored mines or undertake influence sweeps which give out a magnetic signature like a ship and, therefore, causes the mine to go up or make a noise like a ship which makes the mine go up. Of course, pressure is much more difficult to simulate, therefore mine sweeping is never going to be a complete answer. We also have to go in for mine hunting which normally uses sonar to locate the mines on the bottom of the sea and identify them from among the debris on the bottom of the sea. Having located the mines lying on the seabed, one uses either a remote control vessel or clearance diving swimmers to deactivate them. It is a very difficult problem. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we have in this country to deal with this? At the moment, we have one old clapped-out coastal mine sweeper, two experimental mine hunting vessels and three clearance diving teams. That is pitifully inadequate for what we need. It is not that there is not a very great deal of highly devoted work going on in this field; what is being achieved is very impressive. But that is what we have at the moment. What do we need? First of all, we do need mine sweepers to clear large areas quickly. There has been a very imaginative program called the craft of opportunity program to take up vessels such as fishing trawlers, fit them with equipment and make them suitable as mine sweepers. The imaginative part of this program-and it is a very great breakthrough in the technology made in this country-is to avoid the necessity in most mine sweepers of having very high power outputs to create the necessary magnetic field or acoustic field in order to detonate the mine. Our designers have managed to produce towed arrays which can take a magnetic signature or an acoustic signature without external power supplies. This is a very great advance. The idea is that we will have a number of these craft of opportunity outfits or equipment. We will get them in when needed and they will be manned by naval reserves, which gives the reserves a very sensible and useful role. This is very imaginative and is going to be a very successful program. But they cannot do mine hunting. As I said at the outset, mine sweeping will never do all that is needed. </PARA>
<PARA> We are in real trouble in mine hunting. We have two experimental fibreglass catamarans. They are of very interesting design, but they have great problems. One is that their sonar does not work. With current plans, it does not seem that it will be working before the mid-1990s. Also, the ones that we have got were designed for inshore work and have very poor seakeeping characteristics. They cannot go to sea in rough weather; they are only suitable inshore. An example quoted in the report is that the type of limiting weather is that experienced in Gage Roads during the America's Cup races. If it were any worse than that, the mine hunting inshore (MHIs) could not operate. That is really a problem. We do need very urgently larger mine hunting vessels that can go to sea in reasonable weather. The Committee recommends-and I think it is very conservative-that we should aim to have three smaller MHIs and four larger mine hunting vessels. Of course, that is dependent on getting the MHIs to work-particularly getting the sonar to work, and possibly fitting a different one. </PARA>
<PARA> We also need what are called precursors. One cannot put these mine clearance vessels through a mine field and allow them to be blown up, because they tow their arrays. The mine hunters can do it, but the mine sweepers cannot. There were experiments done with precursor sweeps by helicopters, which I think is the most attractive way of doing it. That appears to have been abandoned in favour of having drone boats doing it, which are radio controlled boats. That seems to have got logistically out of control because none of the mine hunting vessels can carry the drone boats. Some rethinking has to be done there. I agree with the Committee that we must come back to helicopters, as the obvious way of doing the precursor sweeps, to clear the way for the mine sweepers and the mine hunters. </PARA>
<PARA> One final point I make concerns a curious omission from the report. All mine clearing and mine hunting vessels must themselves be as safe as possible from mines. They are normally what is called degaussed to counter their magnetic signature and normally have specially mounted quiet machinery to reduce their noise. That is automatic with any mine countermeasure vessels. There used to be a system in this country where all Australian registered ships were fitted with degaussing gear to eliminate their magnetic signature and make them much safer from mines in shallow waters. That program should reactivated. It is the most serious problem facing us. Nothing can be done about foreign flag ships, but our own ships should be made as safe as possible from it. It is the most important untackled task facing the Australian Defence Force. There is a great deal of dedication, knowledge and skill which this Government has not yet motivated or organised in the right direction. The problems are immense. If we cannot clear our minefields in the face of a low level threat, foreign flag ships just will not come here. This country would be economically crippled by a handful of mines laid by people with a low technological capability. It is crucial that this problem be tackled and tackled fast. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report on the Priorities for Australia's Mine Countermeasure Needs was formally tabled last week by me as Deputy Chairman of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in this chamber. It is the third major report of the Defence subcommittee in the Thirty-fifth Parliament. As a former academic, I would be quite confident in claiming that the academic standards of those three reports more than satisfy the requirements of a PhD thesis in one of the humanities. They are certainly up to textbook standard. To produce three reports of this nature within the two years of the Parliament is a great credit to my colleagues on that Committee. I will take a moment to formally thank my colleagues on that Committee. I thank the Chairman, the members of the Committee-some of whom are in this chamber at present-the Secretary, Alan Stephens, who performed with his usual brilliance and dedication. He was assisted by Dr Derek Woolner from the Parliamentary Library. I would also like to thank the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) and the Department of Defence. I thank the Navy, particularly the Defence Science and Technology Organisation for the help it gave the Committee through this inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The terms of reference broadly dealt with the capabilities that Australia has in the mine countermeasures field and the likelihood of attacks, and the way we should oppose them. One of the tragic things about mine warfare and, therefore, mine countermeasures, is that there is no public interest in it. It is not a glamorous subject; it is quite unfashionable. It has a poor public image, but it is incredibly important for Australia, and Australia is a very vulnerable country for mine warfare. It is important that we have the countermeasures to cope with that. There is a belief about also that it is a very basic level of technology. That is true. A very basic level of technology can be involved in warfare and we saw that in the Iran-Iraq war where mines were used that had been built for the Tsar's Russia before the revolution in 1917. They sat in warehouses for all those years and were successfully deployed in the Persian Gulf. Those mines were quite devastating something like 70 years after they had been made. Mine warfare also involves the leading edge of technology. We can get to the stage where some mines literally are quite unsweepable. It is very secret technology. I have spent most of my time in this Parliament with a major interest in defence. One can find out quite a lot about the electronic systems, the radar systems, the fire control systems, and the weapons systems that exist in the Services if one makes an effort to read the technical journals. There is very little information in the literature on mine warfare and the latest generation of mines. The countries that produce mines simply are not ready to exchange that information unless they can trade it for comparable information. </PARA>
<PARA> Mines come in a variety of forms. They can be moored on the bottom-the ground mines-or they can lie on the bottom. One can swim them into harbours or into approach paths. They can be on the bottom and one can swim them to the site of operation. They can be detonated in a whole variety of ways: by contact with ships bumping into them, by magnetic radiation from a ship-the magnetic signature-by the noise radiating from a ship or from the pressure of a ship passing over. All sorts of permutations and combinations are possible on that triggering device. A ship can pass over a mine 30 or 40 times and on the forty-first time it can be programmed to detonate. It can be programmed to detonate on a particular noise or magnetic signature, for one particular ship out of a whole class of ships. It can be an extraordinarily sophisticated business. I come back to the point I made a little while ago, that mine countermeasures work is slow, painstaking and unglamorous. It never gets on the front pages of the newspapers. The only thing I can compare it to is the work of an Army infantry scout patrolling in close country. It is the same sort of slow, unspectacular, painstaking work with violent death always near. </PARA>
<PARA> Mines have been used since 1776 when George Washington used them in the War of Independence against the British. Large numbers were used in World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. The characteristics of mining procedures are that they can be involved at relatively low cost. The capability can be acquired easily by technologically backward nations, and all sorts of platforms can be used to sow mines. The fact that mines are sown, produces a quite disproportionate response in the country's waters in which they are sown. It is also very difficult to prove who sowed those mines. We can prove where the mines were manufactured in some cases, but unless we catch the person redhanded, it is difficult, if not impossible, to prove who laid them. The final point about mine warfare is that if someone declares that a minefield has been sown, it effectively closes that harbour because the host nation has to go out and physically prove that there are no mines present. </PARA>
<PARA> The relevance of this to Australia is that we are one of the great trading nations of the world, and well over 90 per cent of our trade moves by sea. We are extraordinarily vulnerable at present because we have no practical countermeasures against mining. It will take us some years to acquire that. This is in the face of stated priorities by the Navy and the Department of Defence over many years that mine countermeasures were of the highest priority to the Australian defence industry. After at least 10 years on the mine hunter program, we have no capability whatsoever. How do mine countermeasures come about? Very broadly, there are two procedures: there is the sweeping procedure and the hunting procedure. It depends on the nature of the mine that is being sought. With the sweeping procedure, we can either mechanically sweep the moored mines or we can use influence sweeps to emit a magnetic pressure, or noise signature. In the hunting operation, where the mines are on the bottom and have different triggering devices perhaps, we have to go out to find the mines because they lie on the bottom. We have to look at the bottom. We can put human beings down there-clearance divers-to look at them, but it is a very slow and limited operation. We can put television cameras in little submersible, remotely piloted vehicles, or we can use sonar, the projection of sound waves which is the mass screening process. But that process is enormously slow. It is tedious and it is very high technology. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has no mine sweeping capability at present with the retirement of HMAS Curlew. The Navy and the Department have been quite innovative in developing the craft of opportunity (COOP) vessels. Suitable large fishing trawlers are modified for the towing role. The Defence Science and Technology Organisation has developed the mini-dyad program. It has developed a towed magnetic and acoustic emitter which uses very little power but which generates the necessary signals. It is a world first for Australia. It has been very successful. We have the capability in hand of developing good mine sweeping capabilities in the short term. But in the mine hunting field, the history is one of failure. The very first recommendation of the Committee is that we abandon the mine hunter inshore program with its COOP sonar DSQS-11H sonar which simply will not work and buy or lease one of the Thomson-CSF sonars, or one of the proven sonars that actually work. </PARA>
<PARA> The major criticism of this report rests with Navy for having persisted with the mine hunter inshore program in the face of demonstrable failure. Navy is to be commended for the craft of opportunity program and for the emitters that have gone with that. It is to be commended for being innovative in developing the inshore hunter with its catamaran hull and its COOP sonar. But after the expenditure of over $100m and nearly 10 years on this mine hunter program, we have a sonar which simply will not work and will never work. No-one in the Navy has had the courage to stand up and say that this will not work. While I am attributing blame, the Minister must take blame for this too. Mr Beazley in many ways is similar to Mr Keating who is supposed to be the world's best Treasurer. Mr Beazley has known that the program has been a failure for the six years that the Labor Government has been in power and no-one has done anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, this is the highest priority we have in the defence field. This country can be held to ransom until we can demonstrate that we have the capability to clear our own harbours of mines. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is another report from the subcommittee of the Joint Committee of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade which has been so ably led, in my view, by Mr Manfred Cross and by his deputy, Senator MacGibbon. Each report that they have brought down to the Parliament has been very important and worthy of serious consideration. This is yet another one. Unfortunately, the Government in the past has shown little inclination to make meaningful responses. The Navy effectively has no capability to deal with mines laid in Australian waters. Mr Manfred Cross, in a speech in the other place, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is the Joint Committee's judgment that, in the prevailing strategic climate, the use of sea mines represents one of the most likely threats to Australia's security and trade. It is a threat which is equally applicable across the range of conflicts, from low level contingencies, through to escalated low level conflict, and up to more substantial conflict. </PARA>
<PARA>We have to take this report in the context of imports and exports and to remember it in that light. In 1986-87, 78 per cent of our imports and 86 per cent of our exports travelled by sea. Any attempt to harass our trade will have wide ranging and serious implications for Australia's economy, which has already been damaged so badly by this Government. The neglect in the area of dealing with mines is yet another example of this Government's failure to look after this country. </PARA>
<PARA> An effective mine hunting capability is central to our mine countermeasure force and priority should be given to acquiring craft of opportunity platforms for mine sweeping operations. This is one of the recommendations of the Committee with which I personally agree. The program has been a mess. It is approximately 15 years since the catamaran project-the mine hunters-was first proposed, yet there is not yet an operational vessel. In 1983 the expenditure which was approved for the two prototype mine hunter inshore was $53m. By 1987-88 the expenditure had already topped $82.6m. It is expected that for each additional vessel the cost will be $86m. In addition, we have the debacle of the sonar system, which is still not satisfactory. A great deal more effort and cost will be needed before it satisfies the requirements of the Navy. The serious implications of this relate not just to money and wasted time but also to the lack of decision-making within the Department and the Navy in that an alternative sonar system is available. No decision has yet been made to purchase it, although it has been facing the Navy and the Department for a considerable time. </PARA>
<PARA> The mine countermeasures program has within it a typical example of the lack of concern which this Government has shown to its servicemen-a subject which I have drawn to the attention of honourable senators on many occasions. I would like to quote from page xxi of the report under the heading `Personnel'. Mr Cross's Committee says:</PARA>
<PARA> Equipment without people represents only half of the defence capability equation. It is essential to remember that the lead time for recruiting and training people to operational standard can be at least as long as that needed to acquire equipment. The retention of a skilled personnel base is fundamental if Australia is to regain an effective MCM capability. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is concerned by the high loss rate from the ADF of MCM specialists. We believe that the recommendations made regarding job satisfaction in our 1988 report on personnel wastage are particularly relevant, as is the recommendation in this report on reviving, the mine hunting element of the force. </PARA>
<PARA>There speaks a very sad Committee which has just seen the Government virtually turn its major report on losses of Australia's defence force personnel into a little side issue in the defence debate. The failure of the Government to come to terms with the desperate need for meaningful measures to stem the losses from the Defence Force is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> When I visited HMAS Waterhen recently there were several matters I found relating to personnel which the Parliament should be aware of. For instance, the craft of opportunity minesweepers-commonly known as COOPs-are a brilliant idea for a defence force with scarce dollars to spend and a capability to acquire. Yet there are not enough bunks for a crew crewing those vessels. In other words, they are hot bunking. One man gets out and another man gets in. Surely that is pretty unsatisfactory in today's Navy if we want to retain those people as professionals in a professional force. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we have the question of allowances. The men on these minesweepers are still waiting for a meaningful seagoing allowance. When I visited them I spoke to them about such matters. I was told how a number of them have come from other vessels to the COOPs and immediately had their seagoing allowance rate dropped. I asked a question about this in the Estimates Committee hearings. I was told that the long range plan is to use permanent and reserve force personnel. Currently, they are permanent personnel. Senator Hamer mentioned earlier that the plan is to use reserve force personnel but the answer I got was that it would use a mixture. The Navy told me that it is investigating the matter to determine whether there are sufficient grounds to justify payment of the full rate of seagoing allowance to the crews of these COOPs. The investigation, which has already taken a devil of a time, has so far revealed sufficient evidence to justify placing the crews of these vessels on the same footing as those of torpedo recovery vessels and other general purpose vessels-that is, at a lower rate of seagoing allowance. Anybody of a fair mind who visited these COOPs-they are converted fishing boats with a lot of extra equipment put into them so that there are minimal facilities for the crew and minimum space to sit, stand and sleep-would expect that they should be entitled to the highest level of seagoing allowance. They are making a major contribution, increasing the defence capability of this nation, and yet they are paying for it. </PARA>
<PARA> The other difficulty that the COOP program is facing is that it is having difficulty finding COOPs of sufficient seagoing quality to enable them to be included in the project. That is because the fishing vessels around the coast which have licences make it far too expensive for the Navy to acquire them for its fleet. Proprietors of vessels are unwilling to lease them to the Navy while they hold these valuable fishing licences. I would have thought that would have been something that could have been worked out before the project got under way. It seems to have been a bit of a bungle from go to whoa. </PARA>
<PARA> This whole story of mine countermeasures and our lack of capability is a sorry tale of woe, as anybody who has read the report of the Committee will verify. I believe it is yet another example of bungling in the Department of Defence, bungling presided over by a Minister who is not interested in the management of his Department. He is interested in the honour and glory. He is interested in the shiny toys and being photographed sitting in FA18s. I do not think he is very interested is seeing that his Department runs properly. We have heard criticism in this place recently about the Department's inability to be accountable to this Parliament. We have had further examples of the bungling of the Department in its failure to come to a decision on the armoured fighting vehicles. Just like the mine countermeasures arrangements, interminable discussions have gone on year after year. </PARA>
<PARA> There are 13 recommendations in this report. Surely Mr Beazley should be able to cope with only 13 recommendations. It should not be beyond his ability to do something about this report. I believe that Mr Cross's Committee has done the nation a favour yet again by telling us the awful details concerning the management of Australia's defence. Perhaps this time the Government will take action. </PARA>

<PARA> This Bill reinstates the Australian Wheat Board as the fully responsible marketing arm of the Australian wheat industry-an industry crucial to Australia's economic well-being. The industry is a major Australian export which has contributed around $2 billion in crucial export income and support for over 45,000 farm families and many more who live in wheat belt rural communities and it deserves all appropriate support from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, most recent figures show the damage which is being done by the United States Government's farm subsidy regime-damage which will be increased if inroads are made into the powers of the Wheat Board via the Government's Wheat Marketing Bill 1989 which deregulates the domestic market. </PARA>

<PARA> The Australian Wheat Board has operated on behalf of and in the interests of Australia's wheat growers for 50 years. In that time-and especially since the late 1940s when rural industries, particularly the wheat industry, increased their strength, organisation and political voice, and were then able to better influence decisions-the Board has developed marketing structures, which, with modification, flexibility, development and increased commercialisation, have served growers well. One only has to ask growers to be told that that is the case, and it continues to be so. Of course, one would not deny that further change, further development and further modification are, and always will be, needed in an organisation such as the Australian Wheat Board. The Democrats are confident that the Board will continue in the future, as in the past, to be innovative wherever appropriate. The introduction of this Bill is necessary because the Government has failed, in 1989, to move to extend the Wheat Marketing Act of 1984 as would have been expected in the normal course of events. Instead the Government has proposed legislation which would deregulate the domestic wheat market, and, as a result of a deal with the Opposition, deregulate grain transport, handling and storage. </PARA>
<PARA> This move is not supported by the wheat industry, whose representative voice, the Grains Council of Australia, has said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is the industry's strongly held view that the domestic wheat market should not be further deregulated than currently exists . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Graingrowers President, Mr Don McKechnie, has also spoken out on the Government's legislation, saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we believe that it is a misguided step which will benefit neither wheat growers nor consumers and will set the scene for the destruction of the Australian Wheat Board's position as the sole exporter of wheat . . . </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill has become even more essential following the statement by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy that if he does not get his way in the protracted negotiations with the Opposition which he has been forced into by the strong unwavering stance of the Democrats, he will not extend the Wheat Board's operations. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides the opportunity for the Opposition to stop milling around in a sea of confusion and dissension and take action to ensure that the Australian Wheat Board continues to be able to operate. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

I circulated the terms of reference as widely as I could. I understand that Senator Alston will be moving two amendments, which we have discussed, and I find those amendments acceptable. This is, of course, a select committee dealing with a very narrow range of subjects. It may well be that, in a year or two, this select committee once it has completed that task, will become a standing committee on immigration generally, that is, a joint standing committee of the Parliament to look at all immigration issues. We will see how the committee develops as a select committee for the purpose for which it is set up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-If Senator Jenkins is referring to the amendment that would omit paragraph 9 and substitute four additional sub-paragraphs, I have had an opportunity to consider the matter. It may be helpful if I indicate the approach of the Opposition. Essentially, the Australian Democrats proposal is to substitute the present scheme, as proposed in the Government's motion, for one that would involve a reporting to the Parliament before the reporting to the Minister. That was something that initially attracted us. I have discussed it with my colleagues and with the Democrats. The view that we take-I think it is shared by the Government-is that it is desirable that there be an opportunity for flexibility and negotiation and that in the first instance the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations should be in a position to approach the Minister without having a fixed position and be able to canvass the desirable form of the regulations. If that is done the Government will be obliged to respond in a formal manner by tabling the regulations and at that stage the Committee would also have an opportunity to acquaint the Senate and the public at large as to its formal position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We believe that is a much more flexible and sensible approach to take, otherwise the Committee will find itself locked into tendering formal advice to the Parliament which might then limit its opportunity to have discussions with the Minister, even in a public relations sense, because if it is already on the record as having said one thing, it might then have second thoughts and want to proceed in another way. We do not think that makes for sensible decision making. We take the view that it is desirable that the process be in four parts: that the Minister proposes draft regulations to the Committee; the Committee then comments on those proposals to the Minister; the Minister then formally tables the regulations; and the Committee then formally reports to the Parliament. If that procedure is adopted we think it will strike the necessary balance between flexibility and formality and that it will provide a much better opportunity to arrive at the right decision. Whilst I can understand the concern of the Democrats that the Minister should not be given preferential treatment, given the fact that there is an obvious requirement for the Minister to table the regulations, which can then be disallowed by the Senate, if necessary, on the basis of the advice tendered by the Committee, we think that all the safety valves are in place and that that is a much more desirable approach to adopt. </PARA>

<PARA> Paragraph (9), leave out the paragraph, insert the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> (9) That-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) when proposed regulations are received from the Minister before 31 October 1989, the committee make an interim report to each House of the Parliament, before the first sitting day in December 1989 of that House, on the proposed regulations; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) when proposed regulations are received from the Minister after 31 October 1989, the committee make an interim report to each House of the Parliament before the first sitting day of that House that is 56 days after the proposed regulations are received by the committee; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) when regulations under the Migration Act 1958, which relate to decision criteria for the grant of visas and entry permits are tabled in each House of the Parliament, the committee report to each House of the Parliament not later than 5 sitting days of that House after those regulations are tabled; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) when the Minister urgently refers proposed regulations to the committee, make an interim report to each House of the Parliament, if each House is sitting on that day, not later than the day that is 28 days after receiving the proposed regulations, or otherwise as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats believe that paragraph 9 of the motion as it stands creates an ominous precedent. The trouble is that Senator Ray's proposal is entirely in keeping with the provisions contained in the migration legislation which vest undue power and discretion in the Executive. The Government proposes that the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations report to the Minister. That has the effect of requiring the Committee to give the Minister its observations before communicating with the Parliament. Committees can give Ministers observations at any time. I hope that this Committee will certainly do so. I believe this Committee will have to work closely with the Minister on many occasions. But if the Minister wants to know how the Committee feels about his proposed regulations, the Democrats believe that it would be better for him to know formally at the same time as the Parliament is formally informed, because there will have been negotiations with the Minister beforehand. In fact, the danger is that Senator Ray's proposal may create a unique situation to the effect that a committee of the Parliament communicates its view formally to the Government before communicating it to the Parliament. As I said, this may create an ominous precedent. It will mean that at least those 10 parliamentarians on the Committee are liable to be inculcated with the notion that such a thing is normal parliamentary practice. I do not believe that it is normal. </PARA>
<PARA> In time, the terms of reference of other committees may well be altered to reflect this new, more efficient or expedient standard of reporting. The word `efficiency' was used frequently during last night's debate on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill. If this happens, parliamentary committees can thereby become instruments of the Executive or mere working parties of the Executive, and their membership conscripted to serve the Minister's interests and not the Parliament's. All parliamentary committees, first and foremost, owe their loyalty and commitment to the Parliament. It is possibly not surprising that if the Executive wants total control of the migration process, it should also seek as much control as possible over the parliamentary committee. Paragraph 9 of the Minister's motion certainly helps to do that. It is appreciated that the committee is being set up as a parliamentary committee. Obviously it will be a very useful committee because there will be so many regulations in conjunction with the migration legislation. The Democrats believe that it is therefore all the more important that the Committee shall be seen to be responsible directly to the Parliament, not to the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had not realised how devious I had been. It never occurred to me that this was a device to strengthen the Executive. If I had wanted to strengthen Executive control over immigration decisions, I would never have moved to put decisions in regulations that were open to scrutiny by Parliament. I would have used the existing powers of the Act and continued to issue ministerial directives willy-nilly without any senator being able to say boo to a goose about them. It is not a conspiracy theory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Jenkins totally underrates the personnel who will make up this Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations if she thinks they will be my lackeys. Any problems on minor matters can be taken to the Minister to be sorted out, rather than bringing them here, sending them back and disallowing the regulations. All we are asking for is a bit of cooperation and commonsense. In no way can this be seen as a precedent for another committee, or a device to extend Executive power over this Parliament in a conspiratorial way. The legislation that we considered last night is designed to move immigration under the control of this Parliament, where it has never been before, by issuing regulations which have the effect of law, that are binding and are reviewable by this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I concur entirely with the views of my colleague Senator Alston with regard to flexibility of discussion with the Minister before any members of the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations are locked into a position. I also concur with the Minister that this is a concession by the Executive with regard to the precise wording of the regulations. It is not just that there is a check, that the regulations express current immigration policy; but also, as has been expressed in debate, there should be sufficient flexibility of procedure for ministerial discretion to be exercised in special circumstances. The essential concept is that knowledge is power. The ability of the 10 members of the Committee to have prior discussions in this way is exactly the concession which the Opposition sought and which the Government has given. I believe there is good faith in the arrangements that are before us in respect of the negotiations that others have referred to during recent weeks and during debate on the legislation yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I attended a luncheon today for the launch of His Excellency Professor Gordon Reid's book on the history of this Parliament. I sat opposite a distinguished former senator, a former President of the Senate, Sir Magnus Cormack. He recalled how he had advocated, but without success, in the latter part of the 1960s, a procedure for managers to deal with differences of view between the Senate and the House of Representatives-that is, between the House in which the Government has a majority and the House in which it does not have a majority. This procedure is followed by the United States Congress and by the Parliament in my State of South Australia. I commend our informal arrangements regarding managers. My colleague Senator Alston referred to the dialogue which will take place between the Committee and the Minister. That is part of that general field of operation. I am not unmindful of Senator Jenkins's reference to parliamentary committees in the main reporting to the Parliament first. In some cases it would be unthinkable-for example, for the Privileges Committee, and indeed most standing committees-that it would be anything other than the Committee which received a reference from this chamber reporting back to this chamber. The Committee's terms of reference have been set out and I concur that the Opposition and the Government ought to support them fully. </PARA>
<PARA> In so far as we may go on to see the establishment of an immigration standing committee in this Parliament after the expiry of a year and a half or so, let that be considered on the merits at the time. Whilst there is sensible dialogue between the Minister of the day and that standing committee, it may well be the procedure for the standing committee to report to the Parliament in the first instance. I stand to say that these arrangements are in good faith and I support them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What has happened is that this chamber, during its last debate on the Wheat Marketing Bill, carried a large number of amendments which the coalition parties believe-and we were supported by the Australian Democrats-would have substantially improved the Wheat Marketing Bill. The Bill as amended by this chamber was taken to the House of Representatives and the Government rejected in effect all of those amendments in substance. It has agreed to some of the minor amendments, but the amendments of substance have been rejected by the Government. The Government has now brought the Wheat Marketing Bill back to this chamber asking that we do not insist upon the large number of amendments which we carried on the last occasion the Bill came before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's agenda on the Wheat Marketing Bill has not been to the benefit of the wheat growers of Australia; it has been that of playing politics in an attempt, in some way or other, to divide the coalition parties. I make it very clear at the outset that the coalition parties have accepted the deregulation of the domestic wheat market. Let me explain what I mean by deregulation. By deregulation, what we are talking about is fewer controls on an activity, business enterprise, to allow the people in that business to do their own thing in the hope that this will encourage diversity and competition. That is what we mean in ordinary plain language when we use the expression `deregulation'. It is what we mean when we talk about micro-economic reform and the Government's agenda for micro-economic reform. What we are talking about there is the same thing-the reduction of controls in a business enterprise or enterprises which would enable people to do their own thing so that there would be diversity of actions by people engaged in that enterprise with a view to encouraging competition, opportunities and, hopefully, development of that industry to the benefit of all people in Australia, to the benefit of those engaged in the industry, by using their own initiative and enterprise, and to the benefit of consumers because the competition would keep down prices and offer people choice. </PARA>
<PARA> This country is in desperate need of micro-economic reform. At the top of the agenda should be micro-economic reform in the transport industry, on the waterfront, with coastal shipping and in the labour market in particular. Those should be the priorities. This Government has not had the courage to move into the reform of those areas. However, what it did do was to say to the coalition parties, `You are doing a lot of talking about micro-economic reform. We'll give you an area of micro-economic reform. We'll introduce it into the wheat industry'. The coalition parties have said, `Well, this country's need is so desperate that we will accept that deregulation of the domestic wheat market because we believe so very much in the need for deregulation and', as I have said, `micro-economic reform'. Wheat should not be the top priority because, after all, wheat is an industry which is very much dependent upon the other areas about which I have spoken-that is, the deregulation of the transport industry, the deregulation of the labour market and the deregulation of the waterfront and coastal shipping. Those things should have come before wheat. However, this country's economic situation is such that we are prepared to accept domestic wheat market deregulation. We go along with it. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are talking about here is amendments to improve the administration of wheat marketing. Our amendments do not deal with deregulation. Our position on deregulation has been clear from the outset. I will quote, firstly, from a press release by the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr John Howard, on 26 April this year in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA> As foreshadowed by both Bruce Lloyd and myself-</PARA>
<PARA>Bruce Lloyd being the shadow Minister for Primary Industries and having the primary responsibility in the Opposition parties for the carriage of this Bill-</PARA>
<PARA>the Opposition will be moving a series of amendments to the government's Wheat Marketing Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition's criteria for the wheat legislation forced the government to make substantial improvements at the last minute. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments that we are now proposing will further improve the legislation. They do not imply any change to the coalition's decision to support the thrust of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We will be moving amendments relating to the underwriting guarantee, membership of the Wheat Board and the ambit of the legislative provisions to override restrictive State wheat transport, handling and storage regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>This is just as I indicated before. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> In particular, we will be proposing a 95% underwriting guarantee to provide a satisfactory first advance or cash trading option for the Wheat Board. This guarantee will allow the Wheat Board to borrow more and pay a better advance. Should this amendment not be carried, we will review the level of the underwriting guarantee on returning to government. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the membership of the Wheat Board should be adequately representative of the industry and, in particular, the Chairman should be a wheatgrower at the time of appointment. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Howard then made reference to some other amendments. It has subsequently been suggested that under the new leader, Mr Andrew Peacock, there has been some change. Let me assure the Parliament that that is not so. Indeed, on Thursday last, 25 May, Mr Peacock made a personal explanation in the House of Representatives, in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the course of action outlined by Mr Howard on the attitude of the coalition to the wheat legislation has not and will not be changed. </PARA>
<PARA>In another part of his personal explanation he said:</PARA>
<PARA>And so I repeat, Mr Acting Speaker, there is no change in attitude of the coalition to the wheat legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that that matter has been put aside, and that it is understood that there is no change in our approach. We are not opposing the deregulation of the domestic wheat market. Our amendments that the Committee of the Whole is now considering do not go to the question of deregulation of the wheat market but go to the proper administration of the Act and the sale of wheat both externally and on the domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA> There is much merit in these amendments. In particular, I draw attention to the amendments that deregulate the labour market. I put it to Senator Walsh, who happens to be in the chamber, that the amendment to insert after clause 88 a new clause which deregulates labour practices in the storage, handling, transport or sale of grain for export, would be a marvellous amendment and should have been taken up by this Government if it had any real agenda for micro-economic reform. I mention also the amendment relating to the 95 per cent underwriting. After all, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), in his second reading speech, said:</PARA>
<PARA> In all years the principal benefit of the GMP scheme has been the backing it provides to enable the AWB to borrow at favourable interest rates and pay a relatively high first advance to growers delivering wheat to the AWB pools. </PARA>
<PARA>The significance of what he said is that this is not a question of drawing on the taxpayers of Australia. The whole purpose of this scheme is really to enable the Wheat Board to borrow at favourable interest rates and pay a relatively high first advance to growers. That is the key to all this. The Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Essentially this means that the AWB's borrowings will continue to be underwritten by government . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Bruce Lloyd, during the second reading debate in the other place, said:</PARA>
<PARA>However, by having an underwriting of 95 per cent it materially assists the Board to borrow-and to borrow favourably-so that wheat growers can receive a better initial payment and it generally assists the industry at no cost to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not elaborate because I am sure that my colleague Senator Panizza will take that up and expand on it. But these are matters that should be adopted by the Government. At this stage I say to the Government that, although it has listed all of the amendments that it is rejecting, it should not reject amendment No. 7, which would require the chairperson to be a grower; it should not reject amendment No. 8, which would require there to be five grower members; it should not reject amendment No. 11, which relates to the non-application of the Trade Practices Act to pools-that would assist marketing of wheat by the Wheat Board; it should not reject amendment No. 17, which would put in a 95 per cent underwriting provision; it should not reject amendment No. 18, which would delete the sunset clause in relation to the 95 per cent underwriting; and it should not reject amendment No. 20, which deals with the levy money raised. </PARA>
<PARA> During the almost final stages of the debate on the Wheat Marketing Bill, I ask the Government whether it is prepared to accept any or all of these amendments that I have listed. I understand it has rejected a large number of them-all of the ones previously put by us. At this stage of the committee debate on this Bill, I make a final plea to the Government to accept amendments which I have listed. I will repeat them for the benefit of the Minister and the advisers. They are amendments Nos 7, 8, 11, 17, 18 and 20. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening we are debating the Wheat Marketing Bill, which was last in the Senate on 10 May. As honourable senators will recall, at that time, I, in my then capacity, moved an amendment to the motion for the second reading of that Bill. Without dwelling upon it, it is worth recalling the terms of that amendment:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of the motion add ``, but the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) deplores the Government's betrayal of the wheat farmers of Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) condemns the Government for weakening the position of the Australian Wheat Board as a strong trader in the domestic market; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) regrets the Government's failure to negotiate adequately with State governments over their respective responsibilities, including in regard to State statutory marketing authorities''. </PARA>
<PARA>At the conclusion of the second reading debate on the Bill, all members of the National Party of Australia, with one exception, voted for that amendment. Subsequently we crossed the floor to vote against the second reading of the Bill. The one exception was, of course, quite understandably, my colleague Senator Boswell, whose position at that time, and indeed now, as a member of the shadow Cabinet precluded him from such action. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Lewis has spelt out, the Bill was then amended in the Senate in a great many particulars, some obviously more important than others. In due time the Bill went to the House of Representatives, where the Government, on 23 May, accepted some of what I would say were the more minor amendments for the most part-in fact, I think entirely so. There was a useful tidying up of some elements of what has always been since its introduction into the other place, an extraordinarily defective Bill-a Bill to which the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) himself had to introduce some 39 amendments on the day it was taken for consideration in the House of Representatives. It has again been subsequently amended as a result of action in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> Having considered the Bill afresh in the House of Representatives on 23 May, the Minister then issued a most minatory letter to all honourable senators, and I would like to quote somewhat extensively from that letter. It is an extraordinary letter to be issued by a Minister of the Crown to all honourable senators. He began by saying that the House that day had passed an amended `Wheat Marketing Bill' by rejecting a number of Senate amendments. He said that the amendments, that is, the ones rejected, `can be portrayed', and he chose his language carefully, `as allowing the Board to ignore the Australian Constitution'. He did not say that they actually do. He said they can be portrayed as producing that outcome, as allowing the Board to ignore the Australian Constitution, `to abuse its market power'. Again, he did not say that the amendments would actually allow the Board to abuse its market power; he said they can be portrayed as allowing it to do so. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . to risk having people on it who are not the best available, and to expose the taxpayer to the risk of 95 per cent underwriting. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the Minister is perfectly well aware-nobody knows better than he-that there is no risk whatsoever in 95 per cent underwriting at the present time. The Minister went on to say, in the third paragraph, which I shall quote in toto:</PARA>
<PARA>These are all unacceptable to the Government. If the Senate insists on these amendments, there will be no Bill passed, and the sunset clause in the existing Act will be triggered on 1 July. This means there will be no underwriting of the 1989 crop and the Board would suffer a severe crisis of confidence-</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate that that includes confidence on the part of the financial markets, upon which the Board is dependent for its borrowing activities in terms of financing the first advance and so on-</PARA>
<PARA>as its very existence after 1991 would be at risk. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister went on:</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate must pass the Bill as it now stands. </PARA>
<PARA>If a letter of that kind had been written by someone outside the Parliament threatening honourable senators in that manner it would be regarded as an extraordinary abuse of privilege, but the Minister has his own privileges, of course, and I cannot raise that question. I simply want to put on the record that it is an extraordinary letter, and extraordinary action for the Minister to have taken. I want to take up the next paragraph because I want to put to rest what I can only assume to be diversionary charge that the Minister raised in a subsequent paragraph. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . so any attempt to use these amendments as a back-door attempt to sabotage domestic wheat market deregulation will not work. </PARA>
<PARA>There never was any attempt from the time the Bill left this place on the evening of 10 May-it may have been the early morning of 11 May by the time it actually left here-to sabotage domestic wheat market deregulation because, as my colleague Senator Lewis has very clearly spelt out, that matter is no longer in contention. Indeed, the only sentence in the Minister's letter with which I thoroughly agree is the penultimate sentence, in which he says:</PARA>
<PARA>The issue is no longer about deregulation-that was settled . . . two weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the Minister was correct in making that statement. He concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>I trust that you will be able to assist the wheat industry by ensuring that the Bill is passed in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely what honourable senators on this side of the chamber have been trying to do-assist the wheat industry. The Minister is quite correct in saying that the issue in this Bill as it now stands before us is no longer about deregulation, as Senator Lewis properly said; it is about making improvements in the Bill as it now comes to this chamber with a view-to pick up the Minister's own words-to assisting the wheat industry, not for the sake of picking out some favoured son of the Opposition and saying that that industry should have particular favours but simply to apply some commonsense to the piece of legislation before us so far as it affects the activities not only of the 46,000 wheat farmers in Australia but of all those dependent upon them including, if I may say so, those in their immediate families as well as those in the settlements and country towns of which their activities are the focus. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that even at this late stage it is possible, while not asking the Minister or the Government to accept anything unreasonable, to assist the wheat industry in the four matters which Senator Lewis has referred to. I will not weary the chamber by repeating them because we are pressed for time. It should be possible for the Government, even at this late stage, to say, `We are not so filled with venom or spleen or animus towards the wheat farmers of Australia that we continue to insist that we will not alter a jot or comma of this Bill before us tonight'. If that continues to be the Government's position, that will undoubtedly be the interpretation placed upon its position. I repeat that it has nothing to do with deregulation. It has to do with what is or is not to be considered a fair-minded approach by the Government towards the wheat industry of this country, the matter of deregulation as such having been settled. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Minister now at the table, the Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, that he and his colleagues I hope will consider-it is certainly a matter they should consider-what is to be the spirit or the tone in which this debate is concluded. What is to be the final attitude of the wheat growers in this country, leaving the Opposition aside, towards the actions of the Government? Are they to be convinced, as I think so many already are, that the Government has been motivated in its whole approach to this matter by animus, by spleen, by a feeling of antipathy towards this industry, for reasons which I have neither the time nor the desire to go into? That is the matter that the Minister should carry back to his colleagues when there is time for further thought by the Government, which I imagine will be necessary, either this evening or first thing tomorrow morning. It was with the objective in mind of assisting the industry that Senator Chaney, Senator Lewis, my colleague Senator David Brownhill and I-this is a matter of public report; I am not divulging any confidence and I have no intention of doing so-called on the Minister Mr Kerin, at 6 p.m. last Monday for the purpose of what I think it is proper to call an exploratory discussion with him. I had hoped, and I still hope, that there may yet be a sensible, reasonable and non-diplomatic outcome from those discussions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is worth noting that we are debating a motion from the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) that the Committee not persist with 15 amendments, including the most important amendments which were sent to the House of Representatives from this chamber when we last debated this legislation, and that the Senate accept some half a dozen altered amendments, the alterations being of a minor nature but close to amendments which the Senate passed. I say that because what we have heard from the Opposition so far has simply been a series of questions and pleadings to the Government. I still do not know what the Opposition's view on the motion is. The motion is about whether the Senate will now lie down and die on the issue of the Wheat Marketing Bill 1989; that is really the question before us now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I make any more remarks, I will say that the Australian Democrats will not lie down and die on this one. We will vote against the motion and call a division. I say that because it might be helpful to those people in the Opposition who sit behind the two spokespeople who have already spoken and who perhaps do not have the faintest idea of what is going on, with the exception perhaps of Senator McGauran and his National Party colleagues who are in the chamber at present. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not believe that the Senate should lie down and die on this matter. It is for that reason that, in the absence of the Government's having done so, we took steps at the beginning of this week to get this legislation debated in this last week that the House of Representatives is sitting in order that the Senate could continue its push on behalf of the wheat industry of Australia and get the legislation back again to the Government in the House of Representatives and persist with the amendments in line with statements that have been made by Opposition leadership of one kind or another in recent weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the three most critical amendments are the amendments which ensure appropriate grower control and representation on the Wheat Board; amendment No. 7, relating to the chairperson being a grower at the time of appointment; and No. 8, which provides that five of the members of the Board should be wheat growers. Those amendments fall into the first category which the Democrats consider to be crucial. It appears that the Government has not been prepared to concede even one of those. It seems extraordinary to the Democrats that in a piece of legislation in which the Government is saying that every wheat grower in this country is a capable marketing entrepreneur and therefore it will free up the market and deregulate-the Opposition is saying exactly the same thing, or has been until now in pursuing this amendment, but at least it is consistent in terms of grower expertise-the Government also says that the growers do not have the expertise to be on the Board. That is an absolute contradiction in terms. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the top 500 companies in Australia, we can get some idea of how the Board has been run in the past under these circumstances, with grower chairpersons and grower control. We might also get some idea of why this deregulation or privatisation push is taking place in this industry. The Wheat Board is No. 48 in the list of the 500 most profitable companies in this country, with a revenue of $2 billion and a pre-tax profit of $1.7 billion. That is a significant corporation in this country. I point out that its pre-tax profit matches pretty closely that of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd and Westpac Banking Corporation, which are in the top five, the National Australia Bank, which is in the next five, and Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd, which is lower down. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, the Wheat Board is a significant corporation which has been run by a grower chair. Of course, it is a corporation in an industry in which another great Australian company has considerable interest. We have seen on television advertisements for a certain Mr Elliott's company which conclude by bragging that it is Australia's only international grain trader. Now he wants to become the biggest national grain trader, does he not? He wants a slice of the action. He is likely to get it here, if not tonight, perhaps tomorrow, which will be very sad for the wheat industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot see how this record of the Wheat Board precludes the Government from accepting amendments which insist that these growers, who with deregulation will have to go out and battle on their own, should be involved on the Wheat Board to the degree that we in the Democrats believe they should be. I urge the Opposition to persist with that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendments that are particularly important and which relate to this whole area are amendments 12, 13, 14 and 15, which provide for exemptions from the provisions of the Trade Practices Act. The Rural Guidelines discussion paper has been referred to in debate previously. It points out that there is a great deal of concentration in the buyers' camp and an enormous diversity in the sellers' camp. What we are doing here is turning the clock right back and making our wheat industry growers price takers rather than price makers. Part B on `Rural marketing agreements and authorisation' begins with this paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> It is critically important to primary producers to come together when they act as sellers to exert countervailing market power in markets where they may be selling to a small number of large buyers. </PARA>
<PARA>Only 11 companies are listed in the field of biscuits, cereal products and bread. If we take out about four of them which are quite small, we are left with a very small field in that area alone. Tens of thousands-Senator McGauran had the number off pat in his speech-of wheat growers will have to compete with those large agribusiness corporations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly, as my colleague from New South Wales says, the numbers will soon be reduced if this legislation goes through.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other important category relates to the issue of underwriting, on which the Government seems to be reluctant. We can understand the economic rationalists not wanting to put money into anything that is useful in this community. However, several of us have shown in debate that it is not a costly exercise for Government. As Senator Walsh left the chamber, and against Standing Orders, he interjected, `If it is not going to cost, why do you want it?'. We want it for the very reason that grain growers want the Wheat Board-because it is a security. It will mean that in times of strife, whether caused by climate, or international marketing aberrations or inequities, of which we see plenty, the industry does not have to go to the wall and is there to provide some $2 billion in export income for this country along the way. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendments are important but those are critical. On the basis of those amendments alone, we should not allow this motion to pass. The Senate should persist with the amendments and show the Government that we have a combined voice of a number of parties-some fairly odd coalitions-on this issue, from people concerned about the wheat industry in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I, too, was astonished by the letter I got from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). It did not contain the typographical or computer error that Senator Stone's letter from the Minister did. I will read the whole of that second last paragraph because it is important that the wheat industry hears this full paragraph. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The issue is no longer about deregulation-that was settled by the votes on the Bill a fortnight ago. The issue is now about continued support for the industry and the Board. </PARA>
<PARA>It must be clear that, whatever the outcome, the Opposition's position has been that the industry should be deregulated. It was not satisfied with deregulating wheat marketing; it also weasled out of the Government the deregulation of the transport, handling and storage of wheat-a matter that is causing great angst within the Government, and deservedly so, and amongst the unions, which were not consulted, and their State Labor government colleagues who also were not consulted and who now face enormous difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA> The threat by Mr Kerin not to extend the existing legislation if the Senate exerts its absolute right to persist with these amendments looked as though it would be carried out when this Bill was not listed at the beginning of this week, the last week of sitting of the House of Representatives. It is for that reason that the Democrats precipitated action to get the Bill brought on, which subsequently resulted in the Government itself listing it, as I imagine it did not want to be embarrassed by a combined Opposition and Democrats change of Government procedure. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Committee that we can persist with these amendments and that extending legislation is available to us. It is on today's Notice Paper by way of a private member's Bill, which is being introduced by me. We have general business time tomorrow, which, by agreement between the Opposition and the Democrats, could be used to pass the extending legislation. Extending legislation could be dealt with by this chamber and sent back to Mr Kerin in the House of Representatives. That is the course of action that the Australian Democrats would like to take. We would like to extend the existing legislation to operate on the sunset clauses in the Wheat Marketing Act 1984. We do not want to deregulate. As it turns out, the Democrats are the only political party in this place which, as a whole, does not. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it may be that the Government will not have to accept defeat alone. If the Opposition is prepared to stick to its amendments, as its various leaders have said it will, then it will have to choose. In fact, right now it is having to choose. Its deregulation push, its ideological privatisation push, is shared with the Government. In this Bill it has actually achieved a great deal with the deregulation of transport, handling and storage, yet it is still bellyaching about the entire labour market not being deregulated. My colleague Senator Stone, who, apparently, was born on a wheat farm-weren't we all?-spoke some fine words. In spite of those fine words, we are choosing between having a healthy wheat industry and having some wimpish thing that will be eaten up by John Elliott, the US Congress, and all the rest. We can opt for a healthy industry or we can go down the deregulationist path. The choice is there. We can persist with these amendments in the Senate and send them back to Mr Kerin, and tomorrow we pass the extending legislation and send that back. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, or the Opposition, or both, have to face this question of what is going to be lost in all of this. One thing is quite clear: if the Opposition goes ahead with its deal with the Government, it will lose the wheat growers of this country-and well will it deserve to do so. Quite clearly, a small handful of National Party members of the House of Representatives and senators-Senator Bjelke-Petersen and Senator McGauran, who voted against the Bill at third reading, together with Mr Peter Fisher and one or two others in the House of Representatives-have chosen, as individuals, to continue to side with the wheat industry. Unfortunately their parties have not backed them. The parties are more concerned about the survival of the coalition than about the survival of the wheat industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Committee that Mr Kerin's threat not to extend the legislation is significant. Without extension of that legislation we will not have just a deregulated domestic market but we will have killed the possibility of having any kind of organised marketing arm for our wheat exports. That is extraordinarily dangerous. It is about the most irresponsible thing I have ever heard from any Minister. This industry is a $2 billion export earner, currently facing enormous stress on the international market, our friend Dan Quayle notwithstanding. The Opposition will be acting irresponsibly unless it persists with these amendments and joins with the Democrats in opposing this motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The broad line on this motion has been well presented by my colleague Senator Lewis. I will deal with the matter on a detailed basis, but before doing so I should say that it is obviously accepted that the domestic market will be deregulated. That is what the Government set out to do, and that is what its agenda was in the first place. But that was the public agenda, which was backed by a number of my colleagues.

<PARA> The reason given by the House of Representatives for disagreeing to amendment No. 2 on intrastate trading is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The amendment is an attempt to provide the AWB with powers to trade intrastate in the absence of complementary State legislation. However, the amendment goes beyond the Commonwealth Government's constitutional power and simply cannot be accepted. </PARA>
<PARA>I will come back to that point later. If all the States pass complementary legislation, even I will accept the Minister's words.

<PARA> If there is not intrastate trading by the Wheat Board, all domestic wheat that is traded beyond the farm gate has to be in a deregulated system away from the Wheat Board altogether. The Wheat Board simply could not deal with it. Farmers will then have to build more storage facilities so that they can handle what they have to sell on the domestic market, or even attempt to provide what is needed on the domestic market in case of drought, or whatever. New South Wales seems to like on-farm storage, but I, as a practical farmer, will not ride it. I consider myself to be an expert in the growing of wheat, and a reasonable expert in selling it. I do not consider myself to be an expert on farm storage-storing wheat in such a way that it can be kept weevil-free, and so on. The farmer has plenty of other things to do, without bothering about that. All intrastate trade will have to be through the private buyer system. More storage is going to be needed, and the more that is traded privately, the greater the down pressure on prices. In addition, there is no flexibility. If there is a drought in Western Australia, the Wheat Board will not be able to sell the wheat back to the farmers in Western Australia. The Wheat Board will have to bring it from South Australia. With the amount of skeleton weed in South Australia, I would certainly not want to see that sort of weed brought back to Western Australia. The Government has said that the amendment goes beyond the Commonwealth Constitutional power and simply cannot be accepted. That is where the hypocrisy comes into this place. Amendment No. 18 on page 7 states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government is already providing substantial assistance to the Wheat Board through its two borrowing guarantees . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> In addition it has broken new ground through provisions in the Bill to exempt the Board from restrictive State regulation of transport, handling and storage. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Government says that intrastate trading is beyond its constitutional powers. Yet, in amendment No. 18, it says that it is going to use its own powers and do what it likes to deregulate the State transport and handling systems. How can any self-respecting government put those two together and expect the people to believe that it is genuine?</PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 6 is a bone of contention. The Government says that it is not acceptable. This amendment provides for the Minister to issue directions. We have been hearing time and time again in this debate that the Government wants the Wheat Board to have more flexibility. It wants us to go out and trade ourselves and do all those sorts of things, but it also wants the Minister to have the power to give certain directions. I do not know what he has in mind, but it will not accept responsibility for any losses that may be incurred by the Minister giving directions. I believe that people should be responsible for their actions. If any wheat growers lose money as a result of the directions of the Minister, or the directions of anyone else, then I believe that the Government should pay their damages. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 7 is not acceptable because it places an unnecessarily restrictive condition on the appointment of a chairman of the Board which could be deleterious to the Board's success in a deregulated domestic market and environment. In other words, it does not regard it as a necessity to have a grower chairman. The Government has already indicated that initially the chairman will be a grower, although it regards this as a transitional arrangement. It has said that in the longer term the chairman should be a person who has the appropriate skills, et cetera. In other words, the Government is telling us that out of 45,000 wheat growers around Australia a suitable chairman cannot be found. I think that is an insult to all wheat growers. If the Government considers the wheat growers of my age group and the age group of Senator Stone and Senator Brownhill-Senator McGauran is too young-to be ignorant in wheat growing and that one of us could not fill such a position, we have sons and daughters who are as educated as anyone else in this place or in any industry or corporation around Australia. It is an insult to our intelligence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Surely we can produce a son or daughter among the 45,000 wheat growers around Australia who can take up this position. I move to amendment No. 8, which again deals with grower representation. I believe that it is a cornerstone to have five growers on the Board plus a chairman grower; so each State has at least one representative. I believe that Western Australia, because of the amount of wheat it grows, will always have a representative. I am mindful of the lesser wheat growing States which need their own representative-for example, Queensland-to make sure that their interests are looked after.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Amendment No. 17 is the underwriting amendment and the most important. Underwriting has two very important parts to play. One is a guaranteed minimum price (GMP) and the other is so that the Government, as has already been pointed out, can borrow overseas or within Australia at a favourable rate. The Government has decided that it will try to bring the GMP down to 90 per cent and then phase it down further. Borrowing and the GMP have important parts to play. In a deregulated domestic market, the base price will be the GMP. Anyone who is in marketing would not tell me anything different. Let us go to the reason why this Government will not have a 95 per cent GMP. A scaremonger has put it out that the Australian taxpayer will have to foot the bill. In 1986, the worst scenario, they would have had to put up $300m. It is a pity that the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, is not present in the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He knows, but he will not admit that he is wrong. I have been asking questions of Senator Walsh in Question Time for the last two days. He made a statement that in 1986, under a 95 per cent GMP, the Australian taxpayers would have had to put up $300m. The truth is that they would have had to have put up nought-zilch. He cited figures. He did not actually seek these figures out himself. I believe that they were sent over from Mr Kerin's Department to try to confuse the minds of the Australian taxpayers. He said that the Australian taxpayers would have had to pay out $300m. Senator Walsh or Mr Kerin should have known that in 1986 the estimated price at the time the GMP was set was $125.72. There was a final realisation of the pool for that year of $125.50, which was only 22c short of the projected figure and was 98.9 per cent of what had been estimated. So there would not have been one cent paid out with a 95 per cent underwriting. Yet this Government insists, through the Minister, that it did not mislead the Senate. I will continue to press the Government until it finally gets around to admitting it and withdrawing, no matter how long it takes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I intend to go to the wire on this. We will not compromise on this. If we compromise we will have to live with the situation for the next five years. I would prefer to go to the wire. If we are going to have a 90 per cent phasing down, then I will accept that for one year. But by the time the next season comes around we will be in government and we will make it 95 per cent then. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The following countries sent delegates to the 13th Pacific Armies Management Seminar: Australia, Bangladesh, Brunei, Comoros, France, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Kiribati, Korea, Madagascar, Malaysia, Maldives, Mauritius, New Zealand, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tonga, United States of America, Vanuatu, Western Samoa.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The names of the Australian delegates to PAMS XIII are: Colonel R. A. McCluskey, Colonel P. A. Sibree, Colonel D. J. Rowe, Colonel W. J. Crews, Lieutenant Colonel R. J. Breen, Lieutenant Colonel D. Smith.</PARA>
<PARA> A large number of Army officers attended all or part of the Seminar as observers and co-hosts. Brigadier F. J. Cross, Commander of the 2nd Military District, was the official Co-Host with Lieutenant-General C. W. Bagnall, Commander United States Western Command. His Excellency the Honourable Bill Hayden, AC Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia and the following senior officers addressed PAMS XIII:</PARA>
<PARA> Lieutenant-General L. G. O'Donnell, AO, Chief of the General Staff;</PARA>
<PARA> Lieutenant-General E. H. Burba Jnr, Commander, Combined Field Army ROK/US;</PARA>
<PARA> Major-General G. D. Johnston, MBE, MC, Commander, British Forces, Hong Kong;</PARA>
<PARA> Brigadier R. M. Earle, Brigadier (Operations and Plans), Land Command, Australian Army;</PARA>
<PARA> Major-General R. S. Buchan, General Officer Commanding Training Command, Australian Army;</PARA>
<PARA> Brigadier-General Kim Song-Jik, Director of Doctrine and Development, Training and Doctrine Command, Republic of Korea Army;</PARA>
<PARA> Brigadier M. J. Dudman, LVO, OBE, Commander, Land Force Command, New Zealand Army;</PARA>
<PARA> Major-General R. G. Fay, AO, RFD, ED, Assistant Chief of the General Staff-Army Reserve;</PARA>
<PARA> Lieutenant-General M. P. C. Carns, United States Air Force, Deputy Commander in Chief, United States Pacific Command;</PARA>
<PARA> Lieutenant-General H. Wanasingha, VSV, Chief of the General Staff, Sri Lanka Army; and</PARA>
<PARA> General J. J. Lindsay, Commander in Chief, United States Special Operations Command.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Final costings are not yet available, however indications are that the cost of additional administrative expenses was in the order of $304,000 of which approximately $226,000 was the Australian share. Costs for travel to and from the seminar, meals and any other allowances were the responsibility of participating nations.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Lieutenant-General O'Donnell did not tell the Pacific Armies Management Seminar that Australia would support Papua New Guinea in any armed conflict. The allegation in The Australian of 29 March that Lieutenant-General O'Donnell had issued a warning that Australia would support Papua New Guinea in any conflict with Indonesia was misleading and sensationalist. Lieutenant-General O'Donnell has categorically denied the claim in The Australian report that he had issued a warning to Indonesia and his response has been published by that newspaper.</PARA>
<PARA> In his speech to the Seminar, Lieutenant-General O'Donnell noted that friction between Papua New Guinea and Indonesia along their common land border ``is likely to continue, and it would be difficult for Australia to stand aloof, even if we wanted to, should that tension escalate into conflict.''</PARA>
<PARA> There has been no change in Government policy concerning Australia's relations with Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, or in its perspective concerning any border issues between those two countries. Any such issues are a matter for Indonesia and Papua New Guinea to resolve peacefully and through mutual discussion. Australia is interested in these matters because we are a neighbouring country with important relationships with both Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.</PARA>
