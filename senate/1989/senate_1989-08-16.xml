<TITLE>Community Services and Health Legislation</TITLE>
<PARA>To the President and the members of the Senate. We the undersigned oppose changes to general medical practice contained in the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act. We believe there should not be two levels of Medicare rebates for general practice. We also believe there should be upgraded undergraduate training and postgraduate training for general practitioners to obtain appropriate skills. Current and proposed Medicare rebates for general practitioner services are inadequate, and there should be appropriate Medicare rebates for doctors who provide out of hours consultations.</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore we humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled will support general practitioners to achieve the above.</PARA>

<PARA> There should not be two tiers of medical insurance rebates for General Practice.</PARA>

<PARA> This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the Senate to the continued Government interference in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme which has severely affected the viability of our community pharmacies and their ability to provide the quality and quantity of services to which we Australians have as a right.</PARA>

<TITLE>Home Ownership</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.</PARA>
<PARA> Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled require the Hawke-Keating government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many home ownership is returned to average Australian families.</PARA>

<PARA> The members of the Australian Armed Forces who served in Vietnam from 1962 to 1973 did so with distinction, valour and professionalism, upholding the traditions of the Armed Forces.</PARA>
<PARA> After World War 2 and the Korean War the Australian Government approved an End of War List of Gallantry Medals for individual acts of bravery that were not rewarded during wartime.</PARA>
<PARA> The Whitlam Government refused to approve such an End of War List at the end of the Vietnam War.</PARA>

<PARA> 1. They are completely satisfied with the design of the existing Australian National Flag.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. They are aware it properly reflects the immutable characteristics of Australia, namely:</PARA>

<PARA> That every abortion kills an unborn human baby.</PARA>
<PARA> That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Government's first duty is to protect this right to life.</PARA>

<PARA> Medicare cannot pretend to be a Universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy.

<PARA> 1. To provide strict controls over the importation, production, sale, hire or mailing of video-cassettes particularly in the ACT, with the open sale and/or hire of only G, PG, and M-rated video cassettes; and the total prohibition of the sale or hire of R-rated video cassettes, so that R-rated films can only be viewed in an adult theatre by persons over 18 years. We totally reject the concept of X-rated or NVE-rated video cassettes, which would allow the legal sale and hire of hard-core pornographic videos for viewing in the homes of our nation, which would endanger our children; and</PARA>
<PARA> 2. To give whole-hearted support to Senator Walters' Private Member's Bill to implement the recommendations of the Select Committee on Videos; and</PARA>
<PARA> 3. To dramatically improve the Federal Attorney-General's Guidelines for Classification of Video Tapes/Discs, which restrict the importation, production, sale or hire, screening in private homes and especially mailing by Australia Post, so as to include the total prohibition of any pornographic, obscene or blasphemous video cassette, or film which exploits or degrades women as sex objects, or which contain child pornography, bestiality, sodomy, group sex or violent sex acts with women, such as rape and pack rape, sadism and torture, etc., or which promotes homosexuality or lesbianism.</PARA>

<TITLE>People's Republic of China</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled. We, being members of the Junior Council of the City of Wollongong representing the Junior Council on a matter of great importance, respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Junior Council of the City of Wollongong did pass a resolution condemning the massacre of pro-democracy activists in China over the period of 4 and 5 June 1989, and have expressed concern at the subsequent events in that County. The resolution was passed at a General Meeting on 6 June 1989, by a unanimous decision of the Junior Council.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the actions of the Junior Council be recognised in the Senate, and that through the Senators our sentiments be expressed to the relevant authorities in Australia and in China, in much the same terms as resolved by the Senate on Thursday, 8 June 1989, namely that the Junior Council:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) condemns the massive and indiscriminate slaughter of thousands of unarmed Chinese pro-democracy activists and bystanders by units of the People's Liberation Army of the People's Republic of China in Beijing since Saturday, 3 June 1989;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) calls on the Chinese Government to cease this brutality and cease the attempted purge of those people believed to have been involved in the pro-democracy demonstrations who survived the massacre of 4 and 5 June 1989, whilst commencing a process of open and democratic consultation with the people of China to avoid further bloodshed and violations of fundamental human rights and freedoms;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) realises that the recent processes of economic liberalisation in the People's Republic of China, and the attendant benefit to the peoples of China and the region of those processes, cannot succeed in the face of the systematic repression of legitimate democratic aspirations;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) encourages Australia to continue in its efforts to assist those who are or could be targeted by the Government of the People's Republic of China as dissidents, whether in China or in Australia, and that every effort is made to protect them from the purge that is underway;</PARA>
<PARA> (v) expresses its deepest sorrow for the families and friends of those killed in China during this period of repression; and</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) expresses its concern at and contempt for the Government and the People's Liberation Army of China's attempt to deny that the events over the past few weeks ever happened in the manner that was described by eye witnesses and foreign journalists present at or close to the events in Tianamen Square. This tawdry attempt to rewrite history from the favourable perspective of the Government and the Army is seen as an attempt to deny the memory of a tragic event in Chinese history, and as such should be condemned.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is being introduced at a time when a small but extremely powerful union-the Federation of Air Pilots-is conducting a campaign of industrial action which is in open defiance of the Industrial Relations Commission and which has the potential to blow the Government's wages policy apart. </PARA>
<PARA> No amount of jawboning by the Minister for Industrial Relations can hide the fact that the Government has deliberately and knowingly left itself virtually powerless in the face of such a campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the current lack of effective compliance provisions there is little else the Government can do than seek to tough out the dispute, which as a result is likely to cause major disruption to the lives of thousands of Australians and serious damage to the Australian tourist industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Today's Bill offers the Government an alternative. It contains effective compliance provisions that would ensure that directions of the Industrial Relations Commission to stop industrial action, such as the one made last week by Justice Coldham, are properly enforceable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill would insert a new Division into the Industrial Relations Act 1988. Under this Division, the Commission would be empowered to issue directions to stop or prevent industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a direction could be given to any party to the industrial dispute, a member, officer or employee of an organisation that is a party to the industrial dispute, or any other person engaged in industrial action in relation to the industrial dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> Where, on the application of the Minister or a party to the industrial dispute, the Federal Court is satisfied that a person has breached or is intending to breach a direction of the Industrial Relations Commission, the Court may issue an injunction enforcing the direction. </PARA>
<PARA> Failure to comply with such an injunction would constitute contempt of court and would be punishable with the same power as is possessed by the High Court in respect of contempt of that Court. This would enable the Federal Court to issue heavy fines to any union or other body or person in breach of an injunction, and could lead to the eventual sequestration of assets, if the fines were not paid. </PARA>
<PARA> Experience has shown repeatedly that when organisations which are acting illegally are faced with the reality of such heavy fines for defying court orders they quickly come to their senses. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, any person who suffers loss or damage as a result of conduct in breach of a direction, may sue the person or organisation concerned in the Federal Court. This could have obvious relevance to disputes such as the current airlines dispute, where many innocent third parties are caught up in a struggle between a union and an employer. </PARA>
<PARA> Action taken in breach of a direction by an officer, employee, member or agent of an organisation is deemed to have been taken by the organisation, unless the organisation establishes that it took all reasonable steps to prevent the person from taking the action. </PARA>
<PARA> These provisions would replace the existing bans clause provisions which were described by the former Minister for Industrial Relations, Ralph Willis, as having ``fallen into disrepute'' and as being ``substantially moribund''. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has no real argument against the need for effective compliance provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, Mr Willis pointed out, when introducing the 1987 Industrial Relations Bill that:</PARA>
<PARA> ``An essential element of any industrial relations system which provides benefits and protections to registered organisations and their members is that there should be an effective means of ensuring adherence to the principles on which the system is founded and compliance with the decisions of its institutions.''</PARA>
<PARA> A system of conciliation and arbitration whereby the decisions of the arbitrator effectively only bind one side of the employer-employee equation is clearly defective. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognised this, and its 1987 legislation contained provisions that would have provided a directions/injunctions procedure along the lines contained in this Bill. Those provisions were flawed, containing as they did the potential for lengthy delay. And of course they were eventually withdrawn, under pressure from the ACTU, who would not accept any improvement in the compliance powers of the Industrial Relations Commission, that were not accompanied by the emasculation of common law and Trade Practices Act remedies. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result the existing Act contains the ``moribund'' provisions referred to by Mr Willis. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless it is very hard for the Government to argue now against the need for more effective provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill would provide Government, employers and the Commission real teeth to ensure that Commission decisions are adhered to and would provide real protection against those who try and pursue their ends through industrial blackmail. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill I am introducing today is similar to the one I introduced into the Senate in November 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> That Bill received widespread support from employer organisations. The Metal Trades Industry Association's Chief Executive, Bert Evans, had this to say about the Bill:</PARA>
<PARA> ``The Opposition's Bill has obviously been carefully drafted with the practicalities of day-to-day industrial relations in mind. It contains no provisions which any fairminded person prepared to abide by the rules of compulsory conciliation and arbitration could object to. On the other hand, it clearly would remove the imbalances which presently exist and which favour recalcitrant unions at the expense of employers who are trying to work within the system.''</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also received support from the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Business Council of Australia, and the Australian Chamber of Commerce. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of effective compliance provisions has a major role to play in ensuring the effective implementation of an economically appropriate wages policy. At present the Commission knows that its decisions will be adhered to by employers. However compliance on the part of the unions is effectively voluntary. </PARA>
<PARA> This inevitably introduces an element of `bias' into its decisions in favour of the unions' claims. As a result, the Commission has regularly awarded pay rises above the growth in productivity, thereby undermining international competitiveness, and leading to inflation and a higher level of unemployment than would otherwise exist. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of compliance should also be seen in a broader context. The aim of compliance provisions is not to punish or penalise-or to brow beat. However it is important in any industrial relations system that there are rules which one can safely predict will be followed. This is essential if we are to move towards a system based on mutual trust. </PARA>
<PARA> The OECD in a major comparative study of the industrial relations systems of its member countries (OECD Report on Structural Adjustment and Economic Performance 1987) found that those countries with the worst industrial relations records over a two decade period were precisely those countries with the weakest framework of sanctions for illegitimate behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> Those countries which the union movement likes to laud, eg. Sweden, West Germany and Austria, all have effective sanctions for illegal industrial action. Those sanctions are rarely invoked because all participants understand the need to comply with the rules of the industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia remains a strike plagued country. The Accord has totally failed to change this fact. We suffer from a far higher level of industrial disputation than all our major international trading partners (with the possible exception of New Zealand). Moreover we have a pattern of industrial action characterised by relatively frequent and unpredictable disputes which causes the maximum of inconvenience and economic damage. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's industrial relations system is crying out for reform. The Government can help Australia make a start, by supporting this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> Secondly, I would like to place on record my thanks to and appreciation of the secretariat who have so ably assisted the Committee in its work: Derek Abbott, the Secretary, assisted by Barry Jenkins, Laurie Swift and Christine McDonald. Whilst those of us on the Committee worked flat out, I think we would all acknowledge that the secretariat ran twice as fast behind the scenes. The success of this report is in large part, or at least in no small measure, due to their considerable work. So we are able to bring into the Senate but one day late the report as required and requested by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is also very important to appreciate how constructively and cooperatively the senators on this Committee worked. I would like to place on record my appreciation for that behaviour by the senators involved in this inquiry. It has been a very interesting and constructive exercise. I think it is a measure of the good working of this Committee that I can now table in the Senate a unanimous report signed by all members of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee received 225 submissions and conducted four days of public hearings in Canberra and Sydney, where we heard evidence from 27 witnesses. In selecting those witnesses to appear before the Committee, we sought as much as possible-and, I think, achieved-a very wide representation of the views that were brought to the Committee's attention in the submissions. I think those witnesses also reflected the range of views that had been raised in the debate in this place. For the record I note that Dr Shepherd from the New South Wales Australian Medical Association (AMA) has written-I do not know to who else, but certainly I have received a letter-complaining that the Committee did not hear evidence from an American doctor, Frank Rogers, who was in the country. I note for the record that the Committee, as honourable senators would appreciate, was under considerable time constraints. It selected 27 witnesses out of 225 who presented submissions. Many people-for example, deans of medical schools, professors of medicine and general practitioners from across this country who sought the opportunity to put evidence to the Committee-had to be denied the opportunity to appear before the Committee at its public hearings. Further, I make no apology about saying that it was Australian views we were canvassing about Australian medical practice, to consider Australian legislation. We received our terms of reference from the Senate and responded to them and not to an American-led agenda proposed by Dr Shepherd. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee had the benefit of a number of witnesses who gave to the Committee documentary evidence, citing reports about the situation overseas, particularly in comparison to Western countries, and not limited to the United States. We received a range of evidence, not just views reflecting our own perspective, or the Australian perspective. Given the time constraints we judged that the more than sufficient number of witnesses from Australia would best assist us in our task, rather than the views of one doctor from America. </PARA>
<PARA> We noted too that one doctor may present one side of an argument and that, if we were minded to take evidence from overseas witnesses, we would also have liked the opportunity to have a range of views presented. That is the accounting of why the Committee made that decision. We also note, for the record, that Dr Bruce Shepherd was invited to appear as a witness but declined. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee, as I think most would appreciate, had the contribution of senators in the debate in this place on the legislation to assist it, and indeed many of the issues raised in the hearings covered the points from the Senate debate. We conclude that the inquiry has been very useful and constructive, and as I said before, it was conducted in a very cooperative and useful atmosphere. It has addressed the substantive points of concern raised in the debate in the Senate and raised in the public domain and within the profession, as well as in the submissions and hearings. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Committee was very much assisted by the comprehensive submissions from the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and from the Department. Those submissions addressed the concerns of substance in the legislation and also took into account many of the points that had been raised in debate, both in the public arena and in the Senate, prior to the hearings and I think assisted the Committee considerable in its deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have to say that the submission from the AMA was a little less helpful. It contained within its own pages a number of contradictions and conclusions in opposition to what seemed to be its earlier positions of support for the ideas and intentions of vocation training and content-based descriptors, for example. The Committee appreciated very early on-and certainly from the submissions in evidence-that there was widespread misunderstanding of the proposal. That was not assisted by evidence of mischievous misrepresentation of the facts. Add to that insufficient consultation and we get a potent brew for confusion and anxiety. The legislation that we had to contend with properly understood this, I think, and anyone reading this report should take considerable comfort from how the concerns are largely laid to rest. For the record, the legislation establishes a vocational register for doctors who seek to be registered. It is not mandatory, and doctors who chose not to register will be able to continue to practise their medicine as they do now. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we can say that the Royal Australian College criteria for eligibility for vocational registration are clearly defined and need to be understood as addressing two things: one, the interim arrangements up to 1995, and then the arrangements from then on. I think that, when they are properly understood and properly read and appreciated, much of the confusion about criteria for eligibility will be laid to rest too. I also think it is important to note for the record that interim arrangements are interim: and I think some people had not appreciated that fact either. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the proposals under clause 10-if I did not say this in my Senate contribution, I will say it now-contain prospects for innovation in health care delivery and for opportunities for better, more interesting and exciting medical practice for the practitioners themselves. Indeed, I think the college and the Government need to be congratulated for their efforts to actually achieve that. The opening paragraph of chapter 5 reads:</PARA>
<PARA>For many years, general practice and its practitioners have had to struggle for fair recognition within the medical world. Despite the fact that general practice is the first port of call for the majority of people seeking medical care and assistance, it has long been the view that general practice is the Cinderella of medicine-not quite up to the level of its specialist sisters. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposal ensures that that view will no longer prevail. It gives recognition to general practice as a significant and separate area of medicine and acknowledges the efforts of general practitioners to improve their practice through vocational training at the postgraduate level. I think that, if the proposal is properly understood by those practitioners in the field, there will be a lot of allaying of the anxiety and concern that have been evidenced over the last few months in addressing this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee, as I said earlier, in recommending that clause 10 be proclaimed, has asked for a rider, and that rider goes to regulations being presented in Parliament to establish what we have called the Vocational Registration Eligibility Committee and the Vocational Registration Appeals Committee-known in our discussions as VREC and VRAC. It got a little strained at times understanding who was saying what about whom, but I think both of those committees, established by regulation under paragraph 3f6 (6), will allay very many of the substantive concerns that people had about this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Vocational Registration Eligibility Committee will be established to provide registration as an alternative to a fairly automatic registration of general practitioners who have fellowship of the Royal Australian College. If general practitioners have fellowship of the college, their listing on the vocational register will be near enough to automatic, but the Vocational Registration Eligibility Committee is to be established to deal with those doctors who have concerns about whether they fit the eligibility criteria, who do not have fellowship of the college or who have sundry other concerns. We have made it clear that the Eligibility Committee will be able not only to do all of those things but also to deal with complaints from doctors, for example, if they have been rejected by the college for automatic acceptance onto the register and/or if they are advised by the college to seek registration through the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it will be important to canvass the details of these committees in the substantive debate on this matter so I shall not devote too much time to them now, but I believe that they deal with one of the areas of concern for general practitioners who may not fall exactly within the definition of general practice or meet the eligibility criteria as defined by the college at the moment. I could cite as an example the case brought most often into discussion, submissions or evidence-sports medicine. I believe that the establishment of the Eligibility Committee will deal with the concerns raised with us by many people perhaps just outside the clear definitions of eligibility criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area of concern raised in this place and extensively in discussion and debate on the issue was the need for an appeals mechanism. If doctors can be put on the register and taken off the register, it seemed to the Committee, and to many of the people bringing evidence before the Committee, that an appeals mechanism was necessary. It seemed reasonable that people say, `But we want to know what it is like; we want to know how it will be constituted; we want to know exactly what its terms are and how it will be established'. The report makes that clear and I think will deal with all of the concerns raised by people about the establishment of an appeals mechanism. Both committees, as I said, are to be established by regulation under paragraph 3f (6) (b), and once those regulations are presented in parliament any remaining concerns in this area should be laid to rest. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was also very concerned-I do not think that is an overstatement-at the difficulty facing the college, the Government and the medical profession if the AMA remained outside of negotiations. We have strongly urged the AMA to return on behalf of the profession to negotiation with the Government, particularly in the area of schedule fees and rebates. I am sure the Department of Community Services and Health would welcome it, and it made that clear. The college would welcome it, and we have made that clear. The Committee would welcome it, and we have made that clear. We have in the AMA a considerable body of expertise and talent, and that is wasted for the profession and government if the AMA is not back at the negotiating table. So I hope that that recommendation of the Committee is also taken very seriously.</PARA>
<PARA> The report also addresses a lot of issues raised about vocational training, about continuing medical education and quality assurance and about the family medicine program. It also says that the Independent Peer Review Organisation should not proceed because many objections are raised in that area, largely, the Committee concludes, based on misunderstanding of what IPRO was about, how it was to be constituted and what it was to do. Nevertheless, in the light of the very effective campaign, either intentional or unintentional, the doubts and anxieties about IPRO are such that the Committee has recommended that it not proceed, but the Committee is very clear that a proper process for evaluation and monitoring of the new content-based descriptors, that is, the new item numbers that will be available to vocationally registered general practitioners, has to be put in place. One cannot introduce something of that importance, associating with it the prospects for improved medical practice and delivery of health care, and then not seriously discuss the question of how to evaluate and monitor that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee makes clear what we understood IPRO was to do, but we now make it beyond doubt that that evaluation and monitoring has to be done by the profession on the profession. It is not to be done by the Health Insurance Commission. Hopefully, the Department, the college and the AMA, as we recommend, will form a tripartite committee to get that process established. The principle is there. The principle is largely agreed to, but we need a discussion paper, a draft outline, and extensive consultation and discussion with the profession so that no doubt remains about, firstly, the importance of monitoring, secondly, the need and right for that to happen-which we recommend-and, thirdly, the process of how it can be properly done so the profession's concerns are satisfied. We have decided that that should be called the Descriptor Utilisation Review Committee, to put beyond doubt what it will do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We did have better names, Senator Puplick. Maybe we will see the honourable senator in the corridor to explain those. We can get very amusing with letters in these committees. One of the other difficulties we had in this whole peer review area was to cope with the fact that, while various sections in the community, for example, the departmental people or the professional people, use terms such as peer review quite properly, in the course of our discussions and the debate we discovered that there were slightly different meanings perhaps in the different uses of the word. We appreciate that a lot of the difficulty actually arose from an honest and genuine misunderstanding of what terms meant and how they were being used. We hope that our recommendations will lay to rest the difficulties in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another point that was of considerable importance, and clearly the case, was that consultation in this whole issue had been, if not insufficient, at least disparate. I think it is fair to say that it was probably not sufficient. While the college had contacted all doctors and the Minister had written to all doctors, we were given advice that not all doctors read the letters they get-amongst other reasons for why the consultation was not sufficient. This Committee had the benefit of four doctors on it. We all had a considerable sympathy-and we discovered that Senator Faulkner, from being in the Senate, had the same sort of sympathy, and, for the record, I am sure that Senator McMullan had the same sympathy-for people who are very busy professional people and who have to make a kind of selection of the sort of material they read. Letters of this sort did not seem to preoccupy them when they first got them, so perhaps that contributed to the failure to understand and follow the consultation and advice given from the earlier stages. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department, in its second or supplementary submission, outlined a program for consultation, and the Committee recommends that, once the section is proclaimed, that consultation process be put in place. It is quite clear that a more optimal and satisfactory outcome will occur if more people, or all the people involved, are fully informed of what it is all about. That will also prevent the opportunities for misunderstanding and the consequent anxiety that can happen. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested in a particular way to notice many submissions from women doctors. I would have to say, for the record, `Thank God for the New South Wales medical women'. While my women colleagues from other sections of Australia seemed to present the argument against the clause 10 and provided a litany of reasons for that, the submission from the Medical Women's Society of New South Wales was, I suppose, more thoughtful and more reasoned and seemed to find very little objection in the proposal, except for its concerns about the aforementioned IPRO. Unlike some of the other women, its members were very strong in suggesting that women graduating as doctors should not get a lesser degree, or be treated in a lesser way so that being kind to women could actually allow for a second grade of medical practitioners or for women being assisted in postgraduate training in a way that men are not. The Committee was very encouraged by the New South Wales Medical Women's Society's submission. </PARA>
<PARA> In the report the Committee also addresses the objections raised by women doctors. Once they have read the report, their objections and fears should be properly allayed. We did not feel there was much serious substance to their claim, for example, that women doctors are now sought after in the community-we appreciate that that is true-but that these changes will mean that women doctors will be less employable and that, just when women have got into the medical profession in significant numbers, and just when the community is indicating they are clearly very much sought after, we have actually created a scheme under which women doctors will not be employable. I think some of that reflected a misunderstanding on the part of the people putting those views of what exactly will be the consequences of the vocational registration and the use of the new descriptors. We found no substantial evidence to support the claims that there will be two tiers of doctors creating what I think the report refers to as an unemployable under-class. I believe anxieties of the women will be allayed when they read the report. </PARA>
<PARA> We had considerable objections from the resident medical officers and from medical students all the way through the inquiry. I suggest that Senator Sheil would be the best person to talk about medical students, as I am sure my colleagues will agree. I see Senator Sheil appreciates the point. Again, I am sure that once the resident medical officers and medical students see the report and more fully understand what it is about they will not have the same opposition to or level of anxiety about it, although I believe we can expect that it will take some time for the amount of anxiety and misinformation to be laid to rest. Hopefully, those people who have had a concern or indicated any anxiety in this area will get a copy of the report, read it and seek any further information from the college, the Department or wherever, so as to be properly informed about the concerns they raised with the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also raised the question of proper evaluation. There is no doubt, as I have said before, that the monitoring under the Descriptor Utilisation Review Committee and in general and the evaluation of this change by measurements of the health status of the Australian community as well as any changes in the way medicine is practised by the profession are the sorts of things that need to be seriously addressed. The Committee has made recommendations about them. </PARA>
<PARA> We have asked the Government to respond as soon as possible because of the concerns raised by a number of people. We want regulations brought into this Parliament as soon as possible to deal with the establishment of an eligibility committee and an appeals committee so that that can be finalised and people can see that the difficulties they have raised in the past are now properly addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other point I would like to make before closing is that there are some recommendations for funding, in particular funding for sufficient places under the family medicine program, for all doctors wanting to take up family medicine program vocational training prior to their registration. The Department in its submission indicated that it fully understood that that would be necessary and it indicated its commitment to the proposal and a commitment to provide adequate funding for that to happen. As I have said, we also appreciate the Department's promise to provide an extensive information education campaign. I believe that we have had from the college its commitment of preparedness to contribute by informing and educating doctors as to the details of the proposal and assisting in any other way. I note that the AMA also indicated in its hearings a willingness to contribute. I really look forward to that. </PARA>
<PARA> Issues of concern are raised under the heading of rural doctors and there are concerns about the Health Insurance Commission. I have not canvassed those today. I note that I have run over the time that I was supposed to have allotted myself and apologise to my colleagues for that. When one considers the issues before the Committee and its terms of reference, I think that, notwithstanding the time constraints, we have before us a good report. It is a unanimous report. I think that that demonstrates not only the cooperation and collaboration of the senators involved, but also the comprehensive and satisfactory way in which the issues have been canvassed and resolved. I commend the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to support the motion moved by Senator Crowley. Senate committees, it must be said, are of variable quality in terms of their functioning, the capacity and dedication of the senators themselves, the skills of the secretariat and so on. The subjects which the committees undertake to study also vary in importance. Some of us in this place have reached the stage where we can see those variations. We can remember good committees and bad committees, good reports and bad reports. We can see some of the unevenness. Some of us simply will not waste our time and effort if the committee is not worth it. In short, some of us try to concentrate our effort on what is important. We try to avoid committees which offer nothing more than occupational therapy for underutilised parliamentarians. We try to concentrate on what committees can address with advantage and we try to concentrate on committees which are well served in their membership and administrative support. I would say that the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance has passed all the tests which a critical senator might wish to make of the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Select Committee is addressing a subject of importance. One measure of that is the number of submissions it received, as Senator Crowley mentioned. Honourable senators will recall that the Committee was formed in a hurry following the completion of a debate in June and was given 15 August, yesterday, as the date on which it had to present its report. It was able to offer only a brief period to the public in which the public could make submissions. Nevertheless, it received more than 200 submissions, while each member of the Committee received many inputs either personally, through the mail or by telephone, the subject for the first part of the reference-that is, vocational registration of general practitioners and the Government's proposal contained in clause 10 of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill-was, in fact, a reference which attracted lively interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly the six senators who served on the Committee brought to the task some useful backgrounds and skills. I remind honourable senators that the six consisted of four medically qualified persons-the gang of four, according to the medical press-and the two others who were highly qualified in political administration. That was not unhelpful to the Committee in its work. Thirdly, the secretariat support was excellent. I congratulate Derek Abbott, Barry Jenkins, Laurie Swift and Christine McDonald on their contributions. I thank them for the way they made this committee exercise, conducted in such a short time frame, proceed so well. The exercise reflects great credit upon them personally and the Senate Committee secretariat in which they work. </PARA>
<PARA> But what of the reference itself? What of the problem we addressed, the process we undertook and the solutions we have proposed? The reference was to examine the particular proposal of the Government for vocational registration of general practitioners. It was to do that job within eight weeks and to recommend to the Senate how it might care to proceed from there. Honourable senators will recall that the Committee has a second reference, a wider examination of health insurance, to which it will turn next and on which it will report some time early in 1990. The Committee members determined that for this first part of the reference the goal was to try to solve the problems and try to resolve the conflicts. The goal was to try to find a solution, which could be fair to all, to overcome deficiencies in the substance and in the appearance of the Government proposal. It determined to recommend action to the Senate which could then allow the Senate to endorse the proposal after it received certain Government assurances and saw some further details of Government proposed regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee faced several problems. First, there was great angst that one medical body had apparently usurped the role of another. The story there is long and unsavoury and little value will accrue if the whole saga is laid out for the Senate. But it has been possible to recommend-and Senator Crowley has referred to this already-that the Australian Medical Association (AMA) should return as soon as possible to its traditional role as negotiator for the medical profession with government on the matter of rebate levels and on other industrial matters. That is its traditional role and it should get back to that role quickly. It is my hope as a longstanding AMA member that it will so return. We were told in evidence that the processes necessary for this to happen were already under way. </PARA>
<PARA> There was concern that the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) in pursuing the commendable goal of improving the quality, of raising standards, of recognising and certifying training, had moved to areas which were not properly its to administer or to undertake. I think I speak for the Committee when I say that the College should remain a certifying body like the other royal medical college; that is, it should award its diploma to those who meet certain academic and practical criteria. If the government of the day wishes to accredit people with that diploma to receive higher rebates, that is a prerogative of government. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Committee determined and what I hope the Senate will confirm is that the College should not exercise certain other roles which were given to it in the original proposal. That is the key, the central part, of our recommendations. The College should not negotiate with governments rebates for fees. We believe that that is a job which the AMA could do and should do. The College will not need to undertake this role if the AMA returns to its traditional role as we have asked. The College should not undertake the registration of vocationally qualified practitioners. That is why we have proposed a separate vocational registration eligibility committee (VREC) to do the job of registration. We believe that this committee should accept the College fellowship as adequate for registration but we also expect that the committee will consider and accept other qualifications and other evidence of vocational expertise as well. With the vocational registration eligibility committee operating and separate from the College-visibly separate from the College with its membership separate-the anomalies which exist, including the position of sports medicine, the position of certain family planning practitioners, the special position of medical women and so on, can be assessed and addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, on the question of continuing medical education, the VREC and the appeal committee that goes with it can assist practitioners whose continuing medical education activities might not satisfy the College. I think Senator Crowley has already said that if someone were to be removed from the register for failure to maintain enough continuing medical education that person should have a right of appeal to the committee, which we have proposed. Again, this would be a committee separate from the College which can provide an independent view and which is seen to be independent. We see these committees-the vocational registration eligibility committee and the vocational registration appeal committee-as being constituted in much the same way as are the equivalent committees for consultants and specialists which now exist. We think these committees are constituted in a way which is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> Next, in considering the role of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, we think that when it comes to appeals against decisions relating to failure to grant or maintain vocational registration that should not be a function of the RACGP. That is why we recommended the appeals committee-the VRAC-whose constitution we have also laid out, one which would make it independent of the college itself and one which would operate independently of the college. Of course, in line with the situation that exists with the other specialist recognition committees, the ones that exist already, the College of General Practitioners would have a representative on the two committees which we have proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> The other major cause of angst was a proposal for an IPRO, an Independent Peer Review Organisation-that is what the Government called it-to carry out what was called by the Government peer review. It has become clear that this problem was one largely of the choice of language by the Government. Peer review has a specific meaning to doctors and it had a specific meaning to me as a doctor. It means review of the professional activities of doctors by their peers. It has a specific meaning and the doctors who are trying to assess the Government's proposals understood that traditional meaning. They thought this was what the Government intended to do. Of course it is not so. The Department has assured us that this is not so. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Government has in mind is a quite different matter. It is the review of the utilisation of the new descriptor items on which rebates will be based. In other words, it wants to be sure that people are not cheating; that in fact doctors are not claiming improperly under the new descriptors for rebates for their patients. </PARA>
<PARA> So the intention of the Government in fact is to monitor the way in which practitioners generate Bills on which rebates can be paid. If that is what they mean, the term peer review is not appropriate if we are talking to a population of doctors. This put a completely different light on the whole exercise and the Senate Select Committee has been able to make recommendations for the form of utilisation review which is desired by the Government. We have been able to make recommendations which now, without any difficulty, accept the proper role of the Health Insurance Commission in such a process. After all it does have a role if we are looking at the utilisation of items on which rebates can be paid. It is impossible for this Committee to ask that the IPRO, as proposed by the Government, not proceed. It is our hope that the Government will accept that and that it will establish the alternative mechanism which we have proposed which is a Descriptor Utilisation Review Committee. If that is what the Government intends to establish let it say so. </PARA>
<PARA> Another vexed question was the capacity that existed under proposed clause 3 (h) for the Minister to replace the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners by any other body he chose. We are assured that that provision was there in case the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners changed its name or some other event occurred. That is not unreasonable. But it gave rise to the possible interpretation by those reading the Bill that it might allow the Minister one day to come in and say, `I have finished with the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. I am now going to give the job to the Clerk of the Senate', or someone else; anyone he may wish to name to take the place. This caused some heartburning-not that Mr Evans would not be a perfectly proper person to do the job. But in order that there should be no misunderstanding on this matter the Committee has recommended that any such determination which the Minister may care to make under clause 3 (h) should itself be subject to parliamentary scrutiny as if it were subordinate legislation. It should have the same status as a regulation. For that to happen it will be necessary for the Government to amend, or certainly in the short term to promise to amend, that section of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I remind honourable senators of what should be apparent to us all. The Government package will be finalised only when we see and when we can assess and evaluate the draft regulations to be made under the various proposed sections. These regulations will have to provide, for instance, for the Vocational Registration Eligibility Committee, the Vocational Registration Appeal Committee and probably for the Descriptor Utilisation Review Committee. The Select Committee recommends unanimously to the Senate that we defer any final Senate action, that is, the positive Senate motion required by the Senate resolution of 15 June, until after the Government has tabled draft regulations and until after the Government has given, publicly, certain assurance about its intention to enact a necessary amendment to clause 3H at an early date. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators that the recommendation as it appears might not give honourable senators that impression, because it recommends that the section be proclaimed after the Government has given certain assurances. What the Committee really means is that only after the Government has done certain things-produced regulations and promised to amend clause 3H-should the Senate proceed to pass the positive resolution which is required in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, this has been an example of a Senate committee working towards the solution of a problem. Senator Chaney used to tell me that there were two kinds of people: warriors and healers. I think there were some warriors on the Committee, but on this occasion they actually tried to function as healers. They tried to work towards a solution, and find some common ground on this matter that was raised in relation to the Government's legislation, to develop a formula and to satisfy the needs of most of the protagonists. Our formula will work; it will meet the essential needs of all parties; it will allow for the recognition of those with special skills; it will protect the rights of any medical practitioner who wishes to become recognised and who wishes to remain recognised and who fears that the College may not give him or her a fair go. It recognises the proper role of the Health Insurance Commission in monitoring utilisation. The Committee's report seeks protections in substantive and subordinate legislation against certain inequitable consequences that frightened some of our witnesses and some of the associations which they represent. It is our hope that the Government will adopt the proposal and that the Senate will then see fit in due course to complete its part of the process so that the scheme can begin to operate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Reflecting on the words of the previous two speakers, I also would like to point out that this reference to the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance regarding the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill arose out of an extremely divisive action by the Government which was poorly explained both to general practitioners and to medical students intending to enter medical practice. I cannot recall in my brief time in the Senate, just over two years now, any matter which has occasioned such an intensity of correspondence. If I add the number of signatures on petitions which I received, some 4,000 or more people communicated with me in regard to this Bill in the space of several weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point with which I think one needs to preface remarks dealing specifically with the Committee's report is that the matter is important, as it deals with the quality of the delivery of health services to the Australian community by general practitioners. That is very important. I think that every member of the Committee, and indeed most of those who appeared before the Committee, accepted that the Government's intention in this respect was completely honourable in that it was seeking to guarantee a higher standard in the delivery of general practice services to the community and that those services be maintained through continuing medical education and quality assurance. </PARA>
<PARA> One had an interesting situation in that the intention was honourable and could be seen to be objectively desirable, but the manner in which the Government had chosen to present it to the community was inadequate and certainly inadequately explained. That occasioned an enormous division right through the middle of the medical profession. As the two previous speakers have pointed out, the Committee has nonetheless, in a very intense period of discussion and debate, come to a consensus on our report. We believe that we have been able to deliver a set of proposals which satisfies both sides in this debate and will-picking up Senator Peter Baume's words a few moments ago-heal this rift within the medical profession. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee sat for a very brief time and its work was very intense. I also would like to thank those who served the Committee in the secretariat. They performed extremely well. A large number of submissions-well over 200-came in in a very short time. There were a number of intense sitting days. The report, which has been distilled, is excellent. It is clear, brief, to the point and I believe that it will satisfy most of those who have considered the question on both sides. </PARA>
<PARA> Some eight matters were contentious and required clarification. I will run through them briefly. I have already alluded to the first; that is, the lack of clarity in the proposal as presented originally. Clause 10 of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill was extremely brief. Much of what was being proposed was really in the form of draft documents which had passed between the Department and the college. Firstly, they were not widely available and, secondly, they were a moving feast as it were. </PARA>
<PARA> We had evidence from the college on basic and fundamental matters such as the definition of general practice. Its position seemed to move as we probed and questioned the college in relation to what it understood to be general practice. I am not in these remarks reflecting in any way on the integrity of the college or suggesting that the college was being deceitful. On the contrary, the college was attempting to be helpful in terms of those who saw difficulties in the way of being registered under what appeared originally to be a fairly restrictive definition of general practice. Nonetheless, looked at objectively, the proposals were not really helpful until they were set down in a form of words to which both the Department and the college had agreed and made available to those affected, namely, those in general practice, who will be seeking registration, and those medical students intending to go on and enter general practice. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, dealing with that specific and very serious problem which was perceived by a large number of doctors and medical students, the Committee has recommended that the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill be proclaimed only after the draft regulations proposed under sections 3f and 3g to establish the proposed VREC and VRAC that is, the Vocational Registration Eligibility Committee and the Vocational Registration Appeals Committee-have been presented to Parliament. In other words, we are saying that the whole of the proposal must be on the table before the matter is then passed by the Senate. That, I believe, will substantially allay the fears which have been raised in relation to seeing only a small portion of the package. </PARA>
<PARA> The next matter was raised by a number of witnesses and in a number of letters. There were clearly a number of areas which ran the risk of falling outside the definition of general practice. In other words, people would not be judged as general practitioners, would therefore not be able to get registration, would not be able to charge higher fees and would not be able to have their patients get rebates at the higher rate. A number of the women doctor witnesses who came before us expressed the concern that many women doctors particularly deal with the areas of family medicine, family planning and sexually transmitted diseases. </PARA>
<PARA> The other major area of concern was sports medicine. These people may have been in general practice and delivering a quality service as general practitioners. In every other respect they would be eligible for registration, but because they moved to an area where their practice was not substantially any longer general practice they would not remain eligible. Nonetheless, they were still satisfying the criterion which seems to be uppermost in the mind of the Government, that is, the quality of the delivery of service. These people had engaged in vocational training in their subspeciality, had very often participated in continuing medical education and, of course, the other qualities required could be assured. </PARA>
<PARA> In addressing that problem, the Committee has suggested two separate proposals. They have already been outlined by Senators Crowley and Baume. The establishment of VREC will enable the qualifications of those people who do not easily fit within the college parameters to be looked at. In looking at those people the Committee will be able to say, `Yes, they fit within general practice, and they can get registration as general practitioners under that criterion'. Although the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners will have one member on that recommended VREC, it would not be a dominant force on the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also recommended that the Department investigate the ability to recognise those doctors who clearly fall outside general practice, however that is defined, but still fall within the characteristics of being vocationally trained, delivering quality service and participating in continuing medical education. Such a mechanism would then pick up those few practitioners who may well fall outside the area of general practice completely but who still could obtain registration and the use of, perhaps, some additional item numbers under the Medicare schedule. That recommendation picks up those people. </PARA>
<PARA> Concern was expressed about the adequacy of fees in general practice and the use of the descriptors. The Committee has picked up that point and reflects on the evidence given by one witness that one of the highest indicators of the quality of general practice was the length of the consultation. The length of the consultation under the existing rebate system is largely determined by the fee structure. So we are recommending that that matter also be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> The next item related to the lack of appeal provisions within the original proposal. Again the Committee has recommended that, in addition to the establishment of the VREC, there be established a vocational registration appeals committee drawn from the same bodies but composed of different people. So it will be an independent committee which can review the recommendations of the college in relation to the acceptance of somebody seeking registration for the first time or in relation to an appeal against the VREC for somebody who does not fall easily within the college qualifications and who is seeking registration for the first time or for somebody who has been registered and who is threatened with the removal of his or her name from the register. Such persons can also use that appeal provision. Again, I believe that the Committee has adequately dealt with that matter of appeal. </PARA>
<PARA> Concern was also expressed as to the length of training required, bearing in mind that doctors are already involved in a six-year university training scheme plus one compulsory hospital year afterwards. It is seven years before they can go into general practice. If the length of training required for entry into general practice were excessive, particularly for those in part time training, then the time before they could go into unsupervised medical practice may be so long that it may discourage people from going into medicine altogether. The Committee has recommended that the length of training be investigated and that for those who wish to engage in more intensive training consideration be given to having that training period shortened, particularly in the light of the suggestion that a second hospital year may be involved as part of that training. </PARA>
<PARA> Concern was also expressed by a number of witnesses that the family medicine program as presently constituted is, in some cases, delivering unsatisfactory educational opportunities for some doctors entering the program, that some of the supervision is inadequate and that, if this proposal were adopted by the Government, there would be a need to expand the family medicine program. The Committee has accepted that there would be a need to expand the family medicine program to make it as flexible as possible to meet the special needs of those going into these subspecialities, to meet the needs of country doctors who need somewhat different training from those who go into an urban practice, where there may be little or no obstetrics and little or no anaesthetics given, quite contrary to the experience in the country. The Committee has recommended that more funding be provided for the family medicine program and that it be adequate to meet the needs of the expanded program. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of evaluation emerged very strongly in my mind because, in questioning a number of the witnesses as to the adequacy of general practice in Australia, either objectively as assessed within Australia or comparatively as assessed between Australia and other countries, extremely slim research evidence was available as to whether we had a good or a poor service and, indeed, what changes needed to be made to improve that service. Considering that the health budget is one of the largest components of the total Budget, it is to be decried in the extreme that so little evaluation of our health care system has been carried out. The Committee has accordingly recommended that, within the family medicine program and within general practice as a whole, funding be set aside so that proper evaluation protocols can be set up now, that we can get comparative data now, so that we can see five or six years down the track whether this proposal is working, which parts of it are working well and which parts need to be changed. It is only in that way that we will be able progressively to modify general practice and really deliver to the Australian public the hope which the Government has expressed, namely, a better quality of general practice. That matter is a very important one which perhaps did not receive a great deal of attention from the Committee. I lay great emphasis on that and express the strong hope that the Government will take it up and make proper funding available for evaluation. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally-this is a matter which has already been mentioned-there was the vexatious question of peer review. Senator Peter Baume mentioned that at some length and pointed out that the word `peer' and the words `peer review' were used in a different context by Government and by the profession. I believe the Committee has adequately sorted that out. The Government is clearly keen to see reviewed the appropriate and consistent use of descriptors across the widest range of general practice. Appropriately, the Committee has recommended that the Independent Peer Review Organisation, as originally proposed, not be proceeded with but that, alternatively, a descriptor utilisation review committee be established. It would take on that much narrower a role. The review would be carried out by professional people-it would not involve non-professionals looking over the shoulder of doctors-and would be oriented towards uniformity in the use of those descriptors. </PARA>
<PARA> So those eight areas which evinced enormous concern from the medical profession-as I indicated earlier, their letters represented the largest number of letters in the shortest possible time I have ever received, covering substantially eight areas of concern-have all been addressed by this Committee. There is a uniformity of support for the Committee's report. If the Government proceeds on the basis of that report, and particularly if the draft regulations come forward on these clauses of the Bill so that everybody can see what is proposed and be satisfied that it deals with their concerns, not only will the concerns of the medical profession be allayed but the substance of their concerns will be adequately addressed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to give my appreciation of the operation of the Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance. It was handed a monumental task to evaluate just what clause 10 of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill meant. The task entailed an awful lot of work, given the myriad of submissions that came in, many of them aggressive and hostile-and rightly so, given the time that they occurred. I also give my congratulations to the secretariat of the Committee. It did a tremendous job of sorting everything out and bringing all the threads together to present to the Committee so that we could make a proper appraisal. Derek Abbott and Barry Jenkins, Laurie Swift and Christine McDonald must have been doing callisthenics for tired eyeballs after reading all the submissions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to speak for a little on the origins of clause 10 in the legislation. Honourable senators will probably remember that at that time general practitioners' incomes were low and their morale had been sapped, probably because of the delays in negotiations with the Government on increasing the rebates. The Government had taken some unilateral actions, for example, cutting out an item number for out-of-hours services, which had a detrimental effect on the income of general practitioners. Because of actions by the Government the AMA withdrew from negotiations. The Association has been treated as if it broke off the negotiations unilaterally and without cause, but there was cause for it to lose confidence in negotiating with the Government not only because of the delays but also because of the actions of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will remember that at the same time as this happened the Government was taking action with regard to pharmaceutical benefits. These had been slashed in one area and have since been reinstated. The pharmacists' remuneration had been reduced and they had to take the Government to court. They won their court battle. The pathology services were under attack. In fact, pathology service rebates had been virtually cut in half. This also resulted in court action and there has been a reinstatement of those pathology rebates. In other words, it was an era of turmoil for the health industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, as it turned out, was loath to raise the general practitioner (GP) rebates unless it got a return through better and more cost effective medical services. Because it did not have anyone to negotiate with and the executive of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) was willing to go on negotiating, negotiations took place there for some months unbeknown to the rest of the medical profession, and then it became an overt operation. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners was anxious to be the body that was responsible for the accreditation of doctors in order that they could be placed on the vocational register. Because the Government used this instrument-the executive of the RACGP-this resulted in a split in the medical profession. That split exists to this day because a lot of the doctors feel that a minority of the RACGP has carried out these negotiations, initially in secret and subsequently more openly. When they became more open there was a confused interpretation of just what was meant by the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, in wanting its more cost effective application of general practitioners, was interested in about four main areas. It wanted to be sure that GPs did not prescribe more medications than they needed to; it wanted to be sure that doctors were aware of the cost of the medications they prescribed and that if they could reduce their prescriptions of high cost medicines that would help the Budget; it wanted to be sure that GPs did sufficient of their medical consultations that they did not have to refer patients to specialists as often as they had been perhaps in the past. That is understandable from the quality of the medical education lately and I will deal with that a little later. The Government wanted to prevent doctors referring cases to specialists in more cases than were absolutely necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to improve the quality in those main areas the Government felt that it could use the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners through the vocational register, through continuing medical education, through peer review, practice audits and the other mechanisms mentioned in clause 10. The RACGP, I might add, is perhaps one of the less democratic organisations in Australia. It was instituted as an academic body. In fact, it specifically wrote into its constitution that it would never take political action. There is probably a movement within the RACGP at the moment to challenge its executive about coming to an agreement with the Government over the vocational register of general practitioners. That is an issue that I suppose will have to be supported out amongst the members of the college itself. I do not know what effect it will have on the legislation but it could mean that a lot of doctors will just refuse to go on the register, which, of course, is their right. </PARA>
<PARA> There are in Australia approximately 16,000 general practitioners and fewer than half of that number are members of the RACGP. It is fair to say that the vocational registration proposal was half-baked when it was presented in legislation to the Senate. I am sure that it was the half-baked nature of the proposal that led to this outcry from the medical profession. Because that proposal was ill explained and misunderstood, I think the misunderstandings and the reaction were quite understandable. A lot of those misunderstandings still exist. One of the recommendations of the Committee is that the Government have a massive publicity campaign to explain just what is meant by clause 10 before and after its implementation. </PARA>
<PARA> From its inception, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners has been interested in the status and prestige of its members. To that end, it instituted the family medicine program which, since its inception, has been largely funded by the Federal Government. The program consumes approximately $9m a year and that money is now built into the economic structure of the College. The RACGP is happy to use that program in its move towards becoming the accrediting body for vocational registration of general practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA> During the course of the Committee's deliberations it became obvious that the RACGP was willing to bend over backwards in order to help general practitioners achieve vocational registration. For example, I do not think sufficient thought had been given initially by the college to all those areas of general practice that do not come under the banner of ordinary general practice-for example, industrial medicine, womens medicine, sport medicine, sex counselling clinics and medico-legal practices. General practitioners were practising in a whole series of areas in specialised fields that could not be classified as general practice. So the Committee and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners had to turn their minds to finding some sort of common ground to enable all those different areas to be accommodated and I think we have done that. </PARA>
<PARA> I was quite horrified to hear the disclosures that were made to the Committee in respect of medical education. Apparently some 20 years ago the deans of the medical colleges got together and, instead of producing mainly general practitioners, which had been their aim since time immemorial, they decided to produce a thing called the non-differentiated doctor. They got to work on that. The undifferentiated doctor was able to gain only provisional registration if he worked in a public hospital for a couple of years. Having done that he could undergo further education for four, five or six years and enter whatever field of medicine he liked. It turned out that all the procedures were being removed from medical education up to and including a student's intern years in a hospital. We found that there were young students and doctors who had not stitched a wound, set a minor fracture, delivered a baby or done all of the ordinary everyday procedures that one would expect that they should be able to do. </PARA>
<PARA> However, 10 years ago a number of the deans of the faculties decided to change back to producing general practitioners, so now in Australia we have a hodgepodge picture of just what types of graduates we are producing. The Committee has made recommendations to the medical education bodies in the hope of resolving that issue. I hope that we can go back to producing some proper general practioners and also reinstate general practitioners' privileges in hospitals which have been denied them lately. In fact, general practitioners have hardly 10 patients in hospital. Medicine has an enormous specialist orientation now, which increases the cost and it is not warranted. </PARA>
<PARA> In effect, the Committee has separated all the functions of all the bodies that will administer clause 10. The RACGP has been given its job to do. We have requested that the AMA come back to the fold and start negotiating again, despite its experiences. Everybody has to be careful negotiating with government. The Health Insurance Commission has been given its job, which is to keep the register, and the Department has been given its job. The two proposed new committees, VREC and VRAC-the Vocational Registration and Eligibility Committee and the Vocational Registration Appeals Committee-are bodies which we have seen to be capable of oversighting the accreditation of doctors in order to get on to the vocational register. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government is prepared to accept the Committee's recommendations, I think that many of the problems will be resolved. One that was mentioned in this morning's debate was the difficulty with the interpretation of the Independent Peer Review Organisation as compared with the doctors' interpretation of what peer review meant. That has been sorted out. Obviously the Government intended to monitor the costs of the use of its new descriptor items and the doctors referred to the quality of the care. Those two issues have been resolved and the roles of the Government and the profession have been separated. If the Government is prepared to accept that type of recommendation, I am sure the Senate would be happy with it. It now remains for the Government to act fairly quickly and say whether it does, or does not, accept the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee and get to work and put forward its regulations so that if the legislation is to come into operation, it can have the blessing of the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has already been stated-I am not being critical of the fact-the body of the Senate does not have a copy of the report because of time delays in the printing of the report. The Committee has had a very short time in which to get the report together. All we have are the conclusions and recommendations. As I have not had an opportunity to read the report, my comments will be on just the recommendations and conclusions that I have before me. I do not have any in depth information from the Committee on which I can base my comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All members of the Committee have stated that there was great concern in the community. Senator Sheil said that there was not only great concern but also anger among the medical profession. I can understand that because over the period the Government has been in power we have had a whole heap of doctor bashing. We only have to remember back to when the Minister for Community Services and Health, Dr Blewett, came out saying that the medical profession was ripping off the public in cases of fraud and overservicing to the tune of $120m. At that time the Minister was preparing the community for the Government's cutting down of the medical profession. </PARA>
<PARA> That situation occurs in many instances. Indeed, Hitler used to use the same method. Whenever he was going to get stuck into a certain group of people he would prepare the constituency he had at that time in exactly the same way. He would do a lot of bashing of a particular group. Those of us who remember his tactics with the Jewish community know that he spent a considerable amount of time telling people what dreadful people the Jews were before he actually took action against them. This Minister, Neal Blewett, does exactly the same thing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the case that it would be unparliamentary to impute directly to a member of the other place such gross motives, as has been well acknowledged, as those of Hitler. I do not think Senator Walters directly made that imputation, and with that assurance from her I ask her to continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was saying that the same action has been taken. Indeed, we had the situation in which Neal Blewett was preparing the community for the amount of doctor bashing he was about to do and he really got stuck into the doctors and said that-I remember the figure very clearly-$120m was the estimate of the amount of fraud committed by the doctors. That claim, of course, was subsequently discredited by the Public Accounts Committee and it was recognised by the Department of Health that it was a discredited figure. I quote from a letter that the General Manager of the Health Insurance Commission sent to the Australian Medical Association (AMA). It said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As you have said, the estimate prepared by the Department was $120m and this figure was later discredited. </PARA>
<PARA>So that claim was certainly laid to rest. We had a situation a little later when the pathologists were to be cut down. It was the same old thing. I will read from one of the press reports, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> There was no real evidence that the increasing cost of medical benefits for pathology services was due to fraud and overservicing . . .</PARA>
<PARA>And of course that again was discredited. The Government did exactly the same thing this month, on 11 August. The chemists were attacked. The chemists are now being prepared for attack in exactly the same way, and the Government is coming out and saying very publicly how the chemists are ripping us off on prescriptions. We have exactly the same wording:</PARA>
<PARA> While we have no hard evidence on the extent of the problem, we estimate that there are between 20 and 25 million general prescriptions per year priced under $11, so potentially we are talking about $25 to $50m [overcharging] if all of them are charging an extra dollar or two. </PARA>
<PARA>That of course was said by a principal adviser in the pharmaceutical benefits section of the Department. We have all become used to this Government, when ready to attack a certain section of the professions, first preparing the ground very well and coming out with all these extravagant suggestions and estimates that eventually are discredited. In the meantime, it does a tremendous amount of professional bashing. Is it any wonder that there was a lot of concern and a lot of anger in the community?</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's report, as I see it, has at least vindicated the concerns that the Opposition had during the debate. I spoke about five main points where the legislation was defective, and they have been dealt with in the Committee's report. First of all, with the lack of provision for appeal, the Committee has recommended that a system of appeal, both for general practitioners going onto the vocational register and for those who are removed from the vocational register, be set up. I am pleased to see that this is so. The Committee has recommended that an independent committee be set up and that that committee have among its membership a member of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, a member of the Australian Medical Association, a member of the Australian Medical Council, and a member of the National Specialist Qualification Advisory Committee, and that the Minister nominate a member who is suitably medically qualified and experienced. A five-member committee of appeal, I believe, is very good. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also recommended that there be an eligibility committee set up under the regulations. We have to remember that there were two methods of doctors being put on the vocational register: either through their appeal to the college and the college giving them the okay or through regulations. We will also remember that, at the time of the debate, there were no regulations that we were able to view and, therefore, there was no method of us knowing what eligibility was available under the regulations. The Committee has suggested that there be an eligibility committee set up with the same people on it-not the same individuals, but the same representation. Indeed, the Committee stipulated that they not be the same people, but that there be a member of the college, a member of the AMA, a member of the Australian Medical Council and a member of the National Specialist Qualification Advisory Committee, and, again, I gather, a fifth member who is suitably medically qualified to be nominated by the Minister. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Peter Baume" NAMEID="ME4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But that's the specialist recognition model we have used.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. It seems to me that the Committee has certainly dealt with two of the concerns that I had-that there was no provision for appeal for those going on and no appeal for those going off. It has also recommended that the draft regulations, which we had not seen during the previous debate, be brought forward by the Government before the Bill is proclaimed. That, I believe, is essential. If we are going to have eligibility criteria through the college, the Senate must know the eligibility criteria under the regulations. So the need for the regulations to be presented to the Senate before the proclamation of this clause of the Bill is most important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My concern relates to clause 3h. Clause 3h in the Bill enabled the Minister at some future time to say that he would not use the college for eligibility, that he would use another body-any body he chose-and it would, indeed, become the arbitrator of whether or not the general practitioner would go on the vocational register; that he would not have to refer back to the Parliament; and that all he would do would be, by notice published in the Gazette, to determine who should be on such a committee. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be understood that that is very clearly the first step in a preferred provider scheme. The Government would be able to bring in the preferred provider scheme with no reference to the Parliament at all, just by placing a notice in the Gazette. Of course we could not possibly have passed legislation in that way. I am sure that the Government knew that when it put forward the legislation. I am sure that the Government realised that the shoddy legislation it put before us was not able to be passed by the Senate. I am at a complete loss to understand why it put forward such shoddy legislation unless it just wanted to defer payment of the extra increase in the schedules.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has handled the matter in this way. It has said that clause 3H is not correct, that it must be set out very clearly. If the Minister decides to alter the college as a reference, then he has to come back to the Parliament and it should be done by regulation rather than just by placing a notice in the Gazette. I agree entirely. I am not happy that the Committee has said that that should be done as soon as possible. The Committee has said that it would be happy to have the legislation proclaimed once the Government has done two things: firstly, after the draft regulations providing for the committee for appeals and the committee for eligibility are put forward, and, secondly, after the Government has indicated publicly that at the earliest possible opportunity clause 3H will be amended to require the Minister to exercise his powers under that section by regulation, not by determination. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right; that will give the Parliament the right either to reject it or to accept it. But that is not the normal way to go about things. If the Government is prepared, at the earliest possible opportunity, to make that amendment, I do not see why we do not move in this place an amendment to the whole clause. We can bring in the appeals mechanism by amendment; we can amend clause 3H, which will require the Minister to exercise his powers by regulation rather than by determination in the Gazette. It is not a great problem to redraft amendments. It can be done in one day. The Committee has said that this would delay the legislation, that it would take time. It depends on the determination of the Government whether it takes one day or six months. I am not particularly happy with the fact that the Committee is prepared to accept all these alterations by way of regulation rather than by amendment of the legislation-by doing it in the proper fashion. But I guess we can talk about that later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was also not very happy with the fact that no guidelines had been suggested in the legislation. The Committee has now dealt with that matter in a recommendation. It has said that the college, after negotiating with other professional organisations, should produce clear guidelines regarding credit towards vocational registration that will be offered for study and experience gained outside the family medical program. That has covered my main areas of concern. The Committee also recommended that the proposed Independent Peer Review Organisation not be proceeded with but that the new descriptors be properly monitored and evaluated. </PARA>
<PARA> We come then to the adequate funding for all that to be carried out, but perhaps more important is the evaluation that the Committee recommended. With Senator Peter Baume on that Committee, I know that that would have been of some priority. I congratulate him for making sure that the evaluation of the whole vocational register should be undertaken and that the Commonwealth provide adequate funding to enable this evaluation to be carried out. We can set up a register such as that suggested in this legislation and it could do nothing or it could do a lot. Unless we monitor it and unless we have an evaluation, and a proper evaluation, of how it is working, a lot of time, energy and money could be wasted. As usual, Senator Baume has demanded that a proper evaluation be undertaken to make sure that the legislation is carried out in a proper fashion and that its aims are indeed reached. </PARA>
<PARA> Another suggestion by the Committee is that the college should revert to its proper role of arbitrator of professional standards and that it should withdraw from other political negotiations. The Committee underlines that, if this is done, it is necessary for the AMA to re-enter the arena as principal negotiator for the profession, and recommends that the Government invite the AMA to be involved in consultations about the implementation of the recommendations of this report. I sincerely hope that the AMA does take that up again. I know that at one stage, because the AMA was unable to negotiate further with the Government, it chose to say, `Well, that's it. We cannot go ahead. It is an impossible situation. The Government will not give an inch', and it walked out. I sincerely hope that the AMA will take that up again. It is very necessary, because I think the legislation proved that the college, with the best intentions in the world, is not up to negotiating with the Government, and I think it is essential that the AMA come forward and again react in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate the Committee on its report. I hope that the Government will respond to it very quickly, because at the moment Dr Blewett has said that there will be no increases in the schedule fee because the legislation has not gone through. That, of course, was totally unnecessary. The increases could have taken place and should have taken place. I hope that the Government does now respond to the Committee's report very rapidly because it must be recognised that during the recess the Committee and the secretariat worked extremely hard and have come forward with the report on the day that they said they would. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on the subject of the Select Committee on Legislative Procedures of which I was a member, and not on the Standing Orders report, which is a separate issue. The first thing I want to deal with is what the Committee was trying to do and what our terms of reference were. It is worth reading them. The first term of reference was to report to the Senate on the referral of Bills introduced in the Senate to committees for examination of the provisions of the Bill. The second term of reference was the allocation of one day each sitting week for meetings of committees to consider Bills. The third term of reference was the avoidance of an excessive concentration of Bills to be dealt with towards the end of the session and, finally, the Committee was to deal with any proposed changes to procedures to facilitate the referral of Bills to committees and to expedite the Senate consideration of Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a very important subject. Responsible government has changed enormously over the last century, primarily because of the power and discipline of party organisations. The result has been that the House of Representatives is no longer a legislature and cannot be a legislature. The Government can and does get any legislation it chooses through the House of Representatives without any serious debate and certainly without any alteration. The House of Representatives fulfils a useful role; it is an electoral college that decides who the government is going to be. It is a public forum for discussing the shortcomings of the government and campaigning for the next election. But a legislature it is not. It cannot be. </PARA>
<PARA> If government legislation is going to be examined by an elected body it must be done by the Senate. No-one else can do it. The crucial feature in that role is that the Senate is not and will not be in the future controlled by the government. Only a body not controlled by the government, party discipline being what it is, can act as an effective legislature, critically examining legislation. That change to the whole nature of responsible government, which has happened over the last hundred years or so, is very important. Even so, we have to consider why, if that is our role, we cannot do it ourselves in the chamber, why we have to suggest that some Bills would benefit by being referred to committees. </PARA>
<PARA> Committees have many advantages. The first is that they can summon expert witnesses, hear them, discuss with them and argue with them. Any amendments that are going to be proposed can be carefully drafted, discussed with experts and debated by the committee before they are finalised. I think some honourable senators will remember complex issues like copyright and patents Acts which were amended-I think usefully amended-on the run. That sort of amendment would be much better done in a committee and proposed to the Senate as a whole, than done on the run in the Committee of the Whole without immediate access to expert witnesses. Committees have a very valuable role there. </PARA>
<PARA> A possible area of criticism of committees may be that they will be split on party lines. In my experience, that has not been the case. When a committee, which normally comprises three government senators and three non-government senators, meets to consider a particular problem, I have always found that there is a very general desire to get the right answers to the questions and the committee reports are normally unanimous. Even when there are dissenting reports, the issues are brought out and can be seriously discussed, with great benefit, by the Senate as a whole. They will benefit from committee consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps a good example of the value of a committee is what we have been doing this morning-discussing one of the clauses of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill concerning the future of general practitioners. I cannot imagine that a useful debate could have been held in this chamber without the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Insurance Legislation having looked at the matter first. Its recommendations are valuable and if and when we do debate them in the chamber the debate will be much better as a result of those Committee considerations. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had suitable committees since 1970-the legislative and general purpose committees-but they have, historically, been far more concerned with their general purpose activities, their inquiries, than they have been with legislation. The increased use of them for legislation is, I think, the next logical step in their development. The Committee has accordingly recommended as its first recommendation that more Bills should be referred to committees. The question is how you select these `more Bills'. </PARA>
<PARA> The second recommendation of the Committee is that there should be a selection of Bills committee to examine all Bills introduced into the Senate and recommend which of them would benefit from being referred to a particular committee. Because of the procedural necessity for the Government to be able to get its legislation through, the committee must also recommend by when it should report back. That is an integral part of saying which committee they should go to. It is recommended further that that selection of Bills committee should comprise the various Whips. They do represent the balance of power in the Senate and they can say, with some certainty, what would be the will of the Senate on these particular matters. Generally speaking, they would recommend the referral of Bills. Of course, it is for the Senate to decide whether the Bills are actually referred. They would recommend the designated time each day, which Bills should be referred and to which committee and by when they would report. If that were adopted by the Senate, that would happen. Generally, I suppose they would look at controversial Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> I have one area of doubt about one of the arguments-not exactly recommendations-in the Committee report, where it is suggested that non-controversial Bills would not benefit from committee consideration. My view is that the non-controversial ones are sometimes the most dangerous ones. Ones with which everyone agrees go through with choruses of praise from all sides of the chamber but frequently the small print, the actual wording of the Bill, is scarcely looked at. I would like to see a system where non-controversial Bills are referred to a committee and publicly displayed by that committee asking for any comments. If after a week or two no comments have been received, the committee reports back saying that there are no difficulties with the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most interesting case of what can occur happened in Britain last century at a time when there was no divorce law in England. In order to be divorced, an individual had to have a special Act of Parliament. One parliamentary draftsman wished to be divorced from his wife and, when drafting a Bill-something about sewerage in the West Country or something like that-he slipped in the expression, `Mr So-and-so is hereby divorced from his wife Margaret'. Nobody noticed, and he had his divorce; he had his own Act of Parliament. I am not saying that that is at all likely to happen in this Parliament, with our Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills and the Committee of the Whole. Nevertheless, it is an example-perhaps a crude one-of what I mean by saying that with popular Bills, those with which everyone agrees, someone needs to look at the fine print. Referring them to a committee just for a check would be beneficial. That is one small area where I disagree with the thrust of the Committee's recommendation. Basically, I am very much in favour of more Bills, many more Bills, being referred to committees. We have been referring only a handful each year. Out of about 200 Bills that go through this Parliament, probably four or five go to committees. Everyone agrees, as far as I know, that all the Bills that have been referred to committees have been substantially improved as a result of committee recommendations. Now is the time, I believe, to extend that process much more.</PARA>
<PARA> The next recommendation of the Committee dealt with how this will come about. If we refer Bills to committees it will take more time. Admittedly, a number of committees can sit simultaneously to reduce the time. But if we add together the time taken by legislative and general purpose committees plus the time for procedures in the chamber we will find that there will be an extension of the time. We could sit longer. This Parliament does not, by international standards, sit for very long. Typically, we sit about 80 to 90 days a year. Other parliaments sit on many more days. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give an example. In 1987 this Senate sat on 84 days. The Canadian Parliament sits on average 175 days. In the British Parliament, the House of Lords sits for 156 days. We could sit longer. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4H4">Senator HAMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not saying they are full days, but they sit on 156 days. We sit very long hours when we sit; much longer than other parliaments. Nevertheless, we could sit more days if that were necessary. But my soundings among my colleagues have persuaded me that the pressures on Australian members of parliament in their electorates are such that it would be very difficult to get the Senate to agree to a substantial increase in the number of sitting days. Incidentally, it would not be the voters who would be offended; it would be our own party members who would be offended by the non-appearance of the sitting member. Nevertheless, that is a reality with which we have to live.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we cannot sit for many more days we must look at ways of extending the time available to us. The committee recommendation is that Wednesdays of each week should be set aside for committee hearings on Bills. Of course a number of committees could sit simultaneously; all eight could sit simultaneously if necessary. That would expedite proceedings and we would have to make some arrangements for our broadcast days, which are more typically Wednesday, if we wished to have committee hearings. That could be done; that would have to be put in train if we wanted to go for that change. But we recommend, as we were asked to do by our terms of reference, one particular day, and we thought Wednesday was the best day which should be available for committee hearings on Bills. If there were no hearings on Bills the committees could no doubt consider other references, but basically the time would be for committee hearings on Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> We were then concerned that if we were not prepared to sit substantially more days in this Parliament, and we were going to take more time to consider Bills in more detail-after all, that is our responsibility, because if we do not do it no-one else will-we must look at ways of saving time in other respects. Here comes one of our controversial recommendations which may or may not be accepted by the Senate. I think it is one the Senate should seriously consider. Estimates committees have not worked in the way in which they were originally envisaged. The idea of Estimates committees when they were set up was that they should be a substitute for debate in the Committee of the Whole. As things have developed we now have both. Senators hear Ministers and public servants in their Estimates committees; then the reports come into the Senate and to a substantial extent the whole thing is rehashed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommendation is that that should not happen. The debate in the chamber-in the Committee of the Whole-should be on the report of the Estimates committee and the only new areas that could be opened up would be ones which had been asked in the Estimates committees but had not been answered. The committees would be required to list any unanswered questions that could be raised and asked. Otherwise debate would be on the reports from the committees to the Committee of the Whole on their examination of the Estimates. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Peter Baume" NAMEID="ME4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, in Estimates committees some questions are judged to be questions of policy and senators are invited to raise them in the Committee of the Whole.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4H4">Senator HAMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In that case they would not be able to do so under this proposal. They may be; it would depend on what went in the committee report. The committee report, quite frankly, in the past has been not taken very seriously by some committees. It has just been produced as a matter of routine. If an honourable senator wished to raise policy issues as a result of Estimates committee hearings it would be put in the Estimates committee report and then it would be eligible for debate in the chamber when the report came up for debate. Also, the committee would list any unanswered questions which could be asked again and answers insisted on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also make this point, because I know some honourable senators feel they are being deprived of something by this elimination of the Estimates committee debates in the Committee of the Whole: if they wish to have a question asked there is no difficulty about giving that to another honourable senator to ask on their behalf. Alternatively, any senator, if he or she is available, can attend a committee hearing. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, if the answer is not obtained in that way there are many other processes by which a senator can get information. A question without notice, a question on notice, a speech on the adjournment, a letter to the Minister, a request under the Freedom of Information Act are all methods by which we can gain information. We do not have to take up considerable time of the Senate-and we do take up a lot of time on these Estimates committee debates-if we can get a better procedure. I accept that this will be a controversial matter when it comes to debate in the chamber in due course. The Committee was looking for a way in which we could allocate the time of the Senate-there are only so many hours in a sitting day and we accept that we are not going to increase the number of sitting days by any very great margin-and use our available time more productively. We think a duplication of the Estimates committee debates in the Committee of the Whole is not a wise use of our time.</PARA>
<PARA> There are two other matters which the Committee did not, in fact, discuss very much, but which were put in because they have been the subject of procedural debate in this chamber and recommendations from the Procedure Committee, and we thought for completeness they should be covered in our report. The first is the matter of a time limit on debates on the suspension of Standing Orders. I think we want to be quite clear what sorts of debates take place on a motion to suspend Standing Orders. If it is generally agreed-in other words, if it is to happen, if Standing Orders are to be suspended-there will be no debate at all; it will be accepted on the nod; people will do a deal and say, `Right, we'll suspend Standing Orders and get on with that matter'. The only occasion on which there is a debate on the suspension of Standing Orders is if the motion is going to be rejected. The sole purpose of moving the suspension of Standing Orders, knowing that it will fail, is to make a political point or points. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very easy, as I who often sit in the chair know, to make one's remarks relevant, even though one is supposed to be saying why Standing Orders should be suspended. In fact, with a little skill, one can link in with remarks such as `It is only by suspending Standing Orders that we can debate so-and-so', and make one's whole speech on a subject on a motion to suspend Standing Orders. It is a very common procedure in this chamber. The question is for how long it is prudent or fair to allow people to make such a political statement. At the moment there is no time limit. Each speaker can speak for 30 minutes. Any number of speakers may speak. Again, that does not seem a prudent use of our time and the suggestion in this report, echoing a report by the Procedure Committee, is that a time limit of 30 minutes should be set on a motion for suspension of Standing Orders, bearing in mind-as I said at the outset-that the sole purpose of such a motion, knowing it is going to fail, is to make a political point. I think that is probably a fair recommendation, but I am aware again that it is one on which there are very divided opinions in this Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The final recommendation to which I wish to refer is the question of the quorum. At present the quorum is one-third. The House of Representatives has suggested, or has moved, to a quorum of one-fifth of its members. The suggestion in the Committee report is that we should shift to a quorum of one-quarter. That, again, is a matter on which the Senate is, I know, deeply divided. Calling quorums is one of the weapons of an Opposition because it is the Government's responsibility, traditionally, to keep the quorum and Oppositions yield very reluctantly the few weapons they have at their disposal. I would say to my colleagues that this is probably all right because, in view of the fact that the proposition will reduce a weapon of the Opposition, that will be more of a problem for the Australian Labor Party than for us in the not too distant future. Nevertheless, we cannot expect to be in government forever, so one has to look at what is fair and I am open minded about this. I do not feel strongly very much one way or the other about whether a quorum should be one-third or one-quarter. But I do know there are deep feelings on this matter and when this motion comes on at the end of the year it will have to be fully debated. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to my original point, Mr Acting Deputy President. This, in my view, touches a vital issue in the working of our system of democracy. The House of Representatives, for reasons I have already given, cannot be a legislature and will never be a legislature again. The only legislature we have in the Federal Parliament is this chamber. What we have to look at is how we can best perform that role. I think the use of committees, hearing expert witnesses, discussing matters, and making a proper report back to the chamber as a whole is the best way to go. I think this is a very important report and I hope that most, if not all, of its recommendations are adopted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few comments on, first of all, the third and the fourth reports of the Procedure Committee and then refer my remarks to the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Legislation Procedures, which you, Mr Acting Deputy President, so ably chaired. The third report of the Procedure Committee dealt with three issues: firstly, the disclosure of in camera evidence; secondly, written questions in Estimates committees; and, thirdly, the broadcasting of committee proceedings. On behalf of my Australian Democrats colleagues, I indicate that we support, basically in terms of the disclosure, the retention of the 1984 position. I think, in fact, there are probably no other viable options, given the nature of the circumstances in this chamber. In regard to written questions in Estimates committees, I think the recommendations of the Procedure Committee ought to be adopted, as should the recommendations with regard to the draft procedures contained in appendices to the report on the broadcasting of committee proceedings. I think that that is a fair and reasonable set of rules that will obviously over time be developed as this procedure is used more often.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is only one comment that I would like to make on the broadcasting of committee proceedings and it is one which probably will come up more when we are looking at the possible broadcasting of this chamber; that is, I think that the selective broadcasting in itself can be a very unfair weapon, not only with regard to the committee or the people who are on the committee, but also with regard to witnesses. Likewise, selective broadcasting in this chamber could be a very unfair weapon. But more of that at a later stage. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the fourth report-on notices of motion-I think that the recommendation is a reasonable one. However, I think that it puts far too much of a political onus on the President. The wording in the recommended standing order is that the President `may' delete extraneous matters from notices and `may' require a senator giving a notice contrary to the standing order to reframe the notice. I think both of those should be written so as to contain the word `shall', because the reason that to date the President has tended to be fairly circumspect, shall we say, in using the powers which are obviously there under previous rulings of Presidents on these matters is that there is in fact that discretion. I think that the onus should be on the President to so remove those extraneous matters and to require the senator to recast the notice of motion. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the recommendations of the Committee that you chaired, Mr Acting Deputy President, the comments made by Senator Hamer are a full and accurate rendition of what we were attempting to do. However, I wish to make an additional point, that is, what we are looking at is a package. Fairly obviously, these types of changes can never be acceptable to everybody in the chamber. Nor can some of the changes be acceptable to people who are currently in opposition, and some of the changes cannot be acceptable to the people who are in government. What was done here was a fair and reasonable attempt to come up with changes, some of which do favour the Opposition and others of which tend to favour the parties in government. As a whole, they are neutral with regard to both sides. At the moment there is a reasonable amount of suspicion that, when we come to the final vote on these recommendations, we may get some up and not others. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, that political impasse is delaying adoption of these recommendations. That type of thing is to be expected, but I would hope that we might devise a method of dealing with these which simply takes them as a whole-and that they stand or fail on that basis. We get either everything or nothing, because that is the way the Committee looked at this issue. This Committee, unlike other committees, was given leave of the Senate to consult people outside of the Committee on a day to day basis. We have suggested a package and if we do not get it as a package I do not think that we can get anything at all. My feeling is that that these recommendations should not be put singly; they should be put as a whole and a vote taken as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation No. 8 relating to a quorum of the Senate will require legislative action. Reducing a quorum from one-third to one-quarter will obviously assist the Government, particularly Ministers. I think that that is a perfectly reasonable proposition. While the quorum is a tactic that oppositions will use and should be able to continue to use, I do not believe that it should be used, as is necessary in this chamber, to take senators who are Ministers of the Crown and perhaps in a Cabinet meeting out of that meeting. I do not believe that that is a rational and reasonable way for this chamber to proceed. The punishment of the Government, as it were, by the use of the quorum is sufficient because a third is still a very large number in the Senate once one takes out Ministers from any government in the foreseeable future. One is getting sufficiently at the Government, as it were, in terms of backbenchers because they would all have to turn up to make that third. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the new arrangement in the Senate, in terms of proportional representation with six senators elected at every half Senate election, the numbers in this place will not differ a great deal from election to election. By and large I think that that is a reasonable recommendation, but it does tend to favour the Government. On the other hand, the bulk of the recommendations of the committee of inquiry into government legislation favour non-government senators in this chamber. Regardless of the rhetoric, undoubtedly the Government wants its legislation to remain untouched. After all, it is its legislation. It managed to get it through the House of Representatives untouched. Presumably, that same force and fervour for every written word in the legislation holds true of the Government when it gets its legislation up here. A minute and detailed examination of each clause of legislation is not a most desirable activity from an executive government point of view, but it is something on which the Senate has increased its skills over the years. It will continue to do it well because this place will always, in the foreseeable future, have a non-government majority. Hence we are giving a very large weighting of the exercise to non-government senators. </PARA>
<PARA> Moving the thing somewhat back in the Government's favour, it is looking at reorganising Estimates committees to save time. One would like to say, publicly, a few things about the Estimates committees, but it would probably be inappropriate to do so in terms of getting people offside in the attempt to get these recommendations accepted. Referring to historical antecedents rather than the present company in the Senate, I think that all of us would have names that would leap to mind in terms of consuming probably 80 per cent of the time of the Committee of the Whole on Estimates. Not all were opposition senators although they tended to be in opposition at the time. I remember listening to some extraordinary speeches by a South Australian senator of revered memory in this place who on his own was able to consume vast quantities of the chamber's time on matters which undoubtedly were extremely important to him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not quite sure how important they were to anybody else or even to things outside, but they were certainly very important to him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Here lies the rub, I think, in that quite a number of senators feel that some individual senators will be deprived of their privileges in this chamber. I am not sure how fair it is to all other senators for one individual senator to take up literally 80 per cent of the time of Estimates committees, which, of course, on average have often run to 20 hours of sitting time. Twenty hours of sitting time is a vast amount of the time of this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> These recommendations aim at a fair distribution of time between all honourable senators. That cannot be done by giving any individual senator unlicensed, untrammelled time in this chamber. The only fair way we can deal with it is to have reasonably circumscribed speaking times. This chamber has recognised that. When I first came here in 1980, which is not too long ago, we were allowed to speak for an hour. I remember having to speak for an hour one morning between 2 o'clock and 3 o'clock because we were waiting for a Bill to come back from the other chamber. We were still in the old Parliament House. I could not see the person who was fronting for the Government or the person who was fronting for the Opposition because they were both flat out on the seats. The person in the chair was asleep at the time. I took that as a personal comment on my scintillating contribution to the debate from 2 a.m. to 3 a.m. Being a very junior senator at that time, I obviously knew what I was supposed to do, which was to keep talking until we could get the Bill back from the House of Representatives. The conclusion that the Senate very quickly came to was that it was fairer to all honourable senators to reduce that speaking time to half an hour. It was not a curtailment of the privileges of individual senators; it was a fairer sharing. Likewise, when we put limits on a variety of other items, it is an attempt to share the available time amongst all honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> Hence, recommendation 7 on urgency debates, as Senator Hamer quite fairly put it, is an attempt to share what is a political exercise between a number of people who may wish to speak. Again, any time that is taken up on an urgency motion is time not available for a committee stage debate on a Bill. The only alternative to the proposition I have just put is an agreement by honourable senators to expand the number of sitting days-and that does not seem to be on. I would be quite happy to move a motion for that to happen if I felt there would be a clamour of support for extending the sitting times, because then a number of these recommendations would not be necessary. But, if the time available is to remain static, every hour taken in discussing a motion for the suspension of standing orders that will be lost is an hour that is not available for a committee stage of a Bill. Some honourable senators do not seem to be able to understand those mathematics. There is a strictly limited amount of time available. </PARA>
<PARA> I see the scrutinising of legislation in committee as the primary task of this chamber and the task that differentiates it from the other place. Let us be clear that the second reading stage is, by and large, a political exercise. I would not be at all upset if it disappeared completely from this chamber because it is done well in the other place. Our contribution-and something that we do well-is to look at Bills in detail in the committee stage, or in committees outside this place. The more time we can make available for that exercise, the happier I will be. There are other things in the nature of politics in this country that we have to deal with and that we should deal with, but let us try to keep them in some kind of perspective. </PARA>
<PARA> We support these recommendations. We think recommendations Nos 1 to 7 should be taken as a whole. Recommendation No. 8 is necessary, of course, and I think we should express our support for it. We should then initiate the legislative procedure to bring it in. While each of these recommendations, taken on its own, might need to be dealt with differently, taken together I think they are a fair representation of what should be the position and would move us closer towards what ought to be a major task of scrutinising legislation. I think they fairly distribute between all senators the time that is available within a limited cake. </PARA>
<PARA> I would certainly recommend that we deal with these recommendations now. The motion we are debating suggests that we look at them on 1 December. I would hope that when we come to 1 December we actually have a vote. I hope that we will not have an exercise that we have had so often in this place of some individual senators delaying the vote which would determine the wish of the Senate with regard to its own rules and the way in which it conducts its business. Let us get an expression of the view of the Senate as to how it wishes to conduct its business. I think these are good, basic, rational, reasonable reforms that will take us forward. They are in the interests of the legislative procedure although they may not necessarily be in the interests of any particular party. Our task is to look in detail at legislation. These recommendations will improve that task. Let us support them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this cognate debate to address my remarks to the report of the Senate Select Committee on Legislation Procedures. I want to give very strong support to the general recommendation of that Committee that more Bills than at present be referred to committees and its recommendation for a procedure to encourage and give effect to that objective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Looking at the very useful and helpful appendices to this report, it is very interesting to note that it seems that the first recorded case of a Bill being referred to a committee by this Senate was on 13 October 1971, which somewhat to my horror I find was just after I became a member of this Senate. So this whole process of referring Bills to committees has occurred during the period in which I have served in this place. Certainly it is a development which I have always supported and which I strongly believe can be improved. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that it has taken us 18 years to get to the point where we now are suggesting that a formal procedure be established for the reference of Bills to committees. It may be another case of formalising matters when in fact the problem has been solved. It is quite clear from the appendices that the Senate has been increasingly developing this practice. Indeed, large numbers of very important Bills have been referred to committees. The first one was in fact a private member's Bill introduced in October 1971 by the then Leader of the Opposition, Senator Murphy. I remember it very well because I was on the committee to which it was referred. In the process of its consideration, that committee entirely gutted the actual working of the Bill, although the Senate subsequently had to determine the principle. But I think the process of referring that Bill to a committee greatly improved the quality of its drafting. </PARA>
<PARA> A very significant number of Bills have been referred to committees and governments of different shapes have accepted a large number of their recommendations. These facts are set out in the appendices. One that I might mention in passing is the Freedom of Information Bill which, as a result of my motion, was sent to a committee in 1978. That Bill resulted in a large number of recommendations and the acceptance of a large number of them by the Government. I notice that that is not in fact included in the particular appendix, but I just mention it by way of comment. However, the general principle is undoubtedly one that should be formalised in some way, and the proposals of the Committee are very sound in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make a cautionary statement in relation to this matter. I would not want to see us get too enthusiastic, so to speak, about referring Bills to committees. The recommendation is a very sober one, namely, that more Bills should be referred to committees, but there is no point in referring a Bill to a committee unless it is a Bill of a kind which is going to be benefited by a committee consideration. Clearly a large number of Bills that go through this chamber do not satisfy that criterion and, therefore, it would be foolish for us to go overboard and to start referring almost all Bills to committees. That would just choke up the system and would lose a lot of the benefits that can be gained. </PARA>
<PARA> Another cautionary note I would like to strike is that I would not like to see the development of referring more Bills to committees in any way reducing the role of this chamber in the work of the Committee of the Whole. I was interested in what Senator Macklin said in his strong support for the work that can be done in the Committee of the Whole. I do not think that is suggested, and it is certainly not suggested here; I am just mentioning it because it may deserve some caution. The value of a committee consideration and of a report to the Senate is that it can, of course, greatly improve the work of the Committee of the Whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there are many amendments which can be moved in the Committee of the Whole and which may not have found favour with a committee or which may not even have been considered by a committee. Committee work is of various kinds-not necessarily of varying quality, although that does occur-but also the attention that a committee gives to Bills may vary. It depends to a large extent, I suppose, on the amount of interest that is shown in it at that time by the people who come before it and make submissions to it, and so on. When a committee report comes up for debate in the Committee of the Whole, there are often other considerations and there has been greater study of Bills. Therefore, the work of the Committee of the Whole should not be reduced in any way simply because we have sent a Bill off to a committee. I would not like to see that attitude develop in any way. </PARA>
<PARA> The most recent example of a major committee debate in this Senate was that on the War Crimes Bill. The report of the committee on that Bill had been made many months before and pointed the way to a number of amendments which were subsequently developed, but the Committee itself had limited terms of reference and its report was greatly supplemented by many further amendments that were developed because of the public debate as time went on. </PARA>
<PARA> Another great advantage, of course, of sending Bills to committees is that the process enables members of the public to learn more about a Bill and gives them the opportunity of making their views known to the Parliament. One of the vices of the modern Parliament, one which this Senate has in recent years sought to correct, is the speed with which legislation is introduced, debated and passed. That is particularly apparent in the House of Representatives, which adds to that vice the even greater vice of the guillotine process. Senator Macklin said that second readings are debated very well in the House of Representatives. However, it could do even better if it had more time for second reading debates. It does not give itself enough time. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not subscribe to Senator Macklin's view that we should give up second reading debates. One of the important roles of the Senate is to hold up legislation so that the public can be given an opportunity to study it. Governments, and to some extent even ourselves as members of parliament, do not appreciate the difficulty that even expert lobby groups have in getting hold of legislation and getting time to give it proper consideration. It is a very time consuming process for our electors, our constituents. That is the great advantage of having a bicameral system, but even a bicameral system can fail. I have been here when several pieces of legislation have gone through both Houses of this Parliament in one day. There may have been special reasons for that. Fortunately, the Senate would agree to that only in very special cases. The Senate's tradition of looking carefully at legislation has led, I think, to a great improvement in the legislative process in Australia. Its experiment of referring Bills to committees is another tool that it has developed and it is an area which clearly can be improved. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal to establish a selection of Bills committee is a practical way of handling the matter. As I said, I think that caution must be exercised. That can be exercised by the Senate itself, in many cases on political grounds, but that is what we are here for. We should send only a number of Bills, perhaps not very many more than we have sent in recent years. I think that we worked out a pretty good method of selecting Bills to go to committees. I think that sound decisions have been made on that. Although I can see that a number of other Bills could usefully be sent to committees I do not know that a great many more Bills will be sent, or should be sent, under the new procedures but, nevertheless, it is valuable to have the process formalised. </PARA>
<PARA> I take a different view from Senator Macklin as to how we should go about this proposal. The motion nominates 1 December as the date for its further consideration. I suppose that date will come pretty quickly and we do have many other things to do in the meantime. However, I hope that on 1 December we will not try to get agreement upon this so-called package as a whole. I believe that there are two quite separate packages in the Committee's recommendations. The first deals with the establishment of a selection of Bills committee and the principles of sending Bills to committees. The second deals with proposals on saving time, as time will be lost as a result of sitting on committees one day a week. It is probably wrong to assume that the work of the committees can be done on only one day of the week. If there is a major Bill the committee will probably have to sit on non-sitting days anyway. I would prefer to see us working out how much more time is needed and how the committees can organise their time before getting into what will be very controversial proposals. I want to make some very strong criticism of one or two of the other proposals and indicate a feeling that I am sure will be shared by a number of other senators. </PARA>

What will be the total cost to business in this financial year of the changes to company tax and pay as you earn (PAYE) collections, changes which amount to a disguised increase in the rate of company tax?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator says that it is a great help to industry, but something that he has scarcely been prepared to acknowledge is that in the last four years in the period of this Government company profitability in this country has been at record levels. That is the second point I would make in relation to this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If I might recapitulate: revised company tax collection arrangements alter the timing within the financial year but not the amount payable. There is no change to corporate tax rates. From next year the initial instalment of company tax will be payable in the first month after the end of each company's 1989-90 income year, with the balance due nine months later.</PARA>
<PARA> There is an equity issue in this, as I have just pointed out. The tax deferral available to companies is not available to individuals and other taxpayers. What we are doing is removing essentially interest-free loans from the Government to companies, something which is not available to individuals and something which, of course, affects the level of aggregate public savings. I would also make the point that from 1 December 1989 certain employers with annual PAYE remittances-some 800 employers; the largest in Australia-will be required to make payments twice a month rather than once a month. This also increases equity by removing the benefits to large businesses from the deferral of tax payments. After all, corporations are in business. They have core businesses, and their core businesses are not usually gleaning interest from deferred tax payments.</PARA>
<PARA> These two changes have been made, as I pointed out, at a time of historically high company profits. If we are going to make these changes in the interests of equity and in the interests, if you like, of increasing revenue in one year, it is not a bad time to do it when company profits are at an historically high level. The changes are aimed at increasing equity in the tax system, not at increasing corporate taxation. I do not believe any particular damage will be done as a result of these changes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade provide the Senate with details of the circumstances of the death of Miss Jacqueline Hamill, the Australian hostage killed in the seige incident in the Philippines yesterday? Would it have been possible for the Australian Government to have intervened or taken any other action to assist the Philippines authorities in handling the tragic events in Davao city which might have led to the safe release of Miss Hamill?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="138" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today I received an interim report from the Australian Embassy in Manila giving the fullest details available at this time concerning the tragic death of Miss Jacqueline Hamill. As I announced last night when expressing the Government's shock and sadness at the circumstances of her death, I have instructed the Ambassador to make clear representations to the Philippines Government of the Australian Government's concern that fullest possible investigations be carried out. I have instructed my Department to stay in close touch with Miss Hamill's parents and family, as it did throughout the day yesterday and as I have done this morning, to extend all possible consular assistance in the aftermath of this tragedy. On the instructions of the family, the Embassy is making arrangements to have her body returned as soon as possible to Queenstown in Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is still some confusion and conflicting accounts about the events that took place inside the prison during the almost 48 hours of the seige. According to the doctor who examined Miss Hamill's body when it was brought to the Davao doctor's hospital, the cause of death was a gunshot wound from the back of the left chest region, exiting near the collar bone. There was no other visible evidence of injury. Reports that her throat was cut are quite incorrect. In the doctor's opinion, death was instantaneous and had occurred some hours previously, which would indicate that she was shot during the attempted escape incident in the morning.</PARA>
<PARA> The following is, on the latest reliable information available, an outline of what happened. Negotiating with the prisoners had been going on since early yesterday morning, 15 August. At approximately 10.30, while negotiations were still going on, the prisoners decided to break out using the hostages as shields to cross the compound and then take any available transport. During that escape attempt, gunfire was exchanged between prisoners and soldiers during which one of the prisoners and the hostage that prisoner was using as a shield-not Miss Hamill-were killed. The prisoners then decided to retreat to the prison with the hostages. Miss Hamill was seen to slump as the group retreated through a gateway to the inner compound immediately in front of the prison block. It is not clear where the fatal shot came from. That is, of course, one of the matters that we are particularly asking the Philippines authorities now to investigate. Miss Hamill remained there until after the soldiers stormed the prison at 3 o'clock-some 4 1/2 hours later. She was then taken to an ambulance by two soldiers and from there to the hospital where the examination to which I have referred took place.</PARA>
<PARA> In answer to the honourable senator's question about Australian Government intervention, it is important to remember that the police and security authorities of any state, any country, have the primary responsibility to deal with law enforcement incidents in their own country and within their own jurisdiction. That is an attribute of every state's sovereignty in international responsibility. The Philippines authorities did not seek assistance from the Australian Government during the course of this incident. That is, I suppose, not surprising, given that, of the 15 prisoners and 15 hostages we believe were involved in the whole matter, only one person was an Australian. Moreover, our own assessment was that in the circumstances prevailing yesterday and in the time available there was no practical scope for any direct Australian involvement which would at that stage have provided any basis for resolution-or a more satisfactory resolution-of the Davao crisis. The situation was urgent, local and specific and one in which foreign governments would have had neither standing nor local knowledge.</PARA>
<PARA> So, tragic as the outcome undoubtedly was, I am confident that, unfortunately, in all the circumstances and in the time available, there was no way in which Australia could have intervened or involved itself in any practical way which would have changed the course of events. We did, of course, have a consular official on the scene who went there immediately on the Monday afternoon when the news of the incident came through to Manila, and he was in touch with the authorities throughout. Beyond that, it was not possible for us to play any more substantial role. I do fully appreciate, as does the Prime Minister, the understandable grief and shock of the family, and I really do want to assure them publicly, as I have privately, that the Government and embassy did everything within their power to assist. I do want to take this opportunity again to express our very deepest sympathy to Ms Hamill's family over their most tragic loss.</PARA>

I note his reply to an earlier question from Senator Lewis and I refer to the same matter, that is, the Government's Budget changes to the timing of company tax payments and pay as you earn taxation instalments. Does the Minister agree that these measures will affect a company's cash flow position and its ability to save, and hence will reduce that company's ability to reinvest in plant and equipment ? As one of the reasons given by the Government to reduce the company tax rate to 39 per cent from 1 July this year was to stimulate business investment which was needed to trade our way out of our present balance of payments problems, why now is the Government offsetting this earlier measure with these latest punitive tax changes?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come back to the answer that I gave earlier. We are talking about companies which, by and large, in the last four years have enjoyed record profitability. We are talking about major companies-big companies. Senator Messner went on to ask me whether it would affect a company's capacity to reinvest in plant and equipment. In a marginal sort of way, it might. I just want to give him the figures which he can find in the Budget Papers. Who is he to ask questions about this? If he looks at page 239 of the Budget Papers, he will see that between 1984 and 1985 the increase in private business fixed investment was 10.8 on average. When the honourable senator was in government, in each of the periods between 1974 and 1979, and 1979 and 1983, the average investment in plant and equipment and so on was 2.3 and 1.6. The 1.6 figure covered the much vaunted and talked up resources boom. I simply make the point that investment levels in this country have been running at a record high in the last year or two. Company profits have been running at a record high. If he makes the point that reduction of cash flow might arise in one year from the timing of tax collections by the Taxation Office from businesses, yes, I think that is probably correct. But in terms of the larger picture, if I might borrow that phrase from a colleague of mine, it is not very significant.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hasten to say that I am answering the question in my capacity as the Minister representing the Minister for Defence. The Department of Defence has issued a request for proposals for the commercialisation of the Woomera range, and whether or not we will find an operator interested in doing that remains to be seen. I do not think commenting on any particular companies at this stage of the game would be of assistance, but if a commercial range operator were found, then obviously an agreement would have to be negotiated by the Commonwealth with that operator. That agreement would provide for all of the control measures that Senator Dunn might consider necessary to ensure the protection of Australia's national interest. No tests relating to nuclear weapons systems would be permitted. Acceptance of particular range customers would be a matter for the commercial judgment of the range operator acting within the constraints of the control arrangements that have been made with the Commonwealth. No range activities would be permitted on or near Maralinga areas where there is residual radioactive contamination.</PARA></TALK.START>

Secondly, does the Minister agree that the Budget allocations will send confusing signals about Australia's foreign policy interests because, while we are committing $50m to nuclear weapon capable countries such as India and Pakistan, the Government has refused in the Budget to renew funding to the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), which focuses on increasing food production in the poorest agricultural countries?

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="140" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Budget Papers, particularly Budget related Paper No. 4, make very clear, the cut in this year's Budget aid allocation, both in real percentage terms and as a proportion of gross national product (GNP), is really more apparent than real. I say that because of the particular circumstance which is explained in the Budget Papers whereby in round figures $100m of expenditure that would in the normal course have had to be incurred this financial year, 1989-90, was in the last weeks of the last financial year brought back into the 1988-89 figures. In particular I am referring to some contributions that were due to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank about which there was some flexibility of timing and it was, in fact, because of the constraints that I knew would be applicable in going better than the Forward Estimates so far as this year's Budget was concerned, and because of the very real problems I knew would be experienced in getting an additional $100m into this year's allocation to cover those additional imposts which were falling due in one way and another this year, that when the opportunity arose to bring forward that expenditure, as it did last year, I grabbed it-to be frank-with both hands with the result that last year's figure is inflated beyond that which was in the Budget projections. It is really a very respectable outcome indeed but by contrast this year's allocation does not look so good. It represents a decline in real terms and further decline in the ratio which would not have occurred had that $100m in fact been spent not last year but this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So in terms of the substantive programs themselves, the bilateral programs, the contributions to multilateral agencies and all the rest of the targets for our aid that Senator Macklin feels strongly about-and I assure him that I feel strongly about them too-we have effectively been able in all those areas to maintain the real value of our contributions or, where not entirely the real value, as is the case with some multilateral contributions, at least the nominal value and very often very close to the real value. So it is really a steady as you go outcome.</PARA>
<PARA> Some of the more extravagant claims that have been made about the aid budget, in particular from the spokesman from the Australian Council for Overseas Aid to the effect that there was a $20m cut in the aid program to Indonesia, are totally misconceived. In fact, as the Budget Papers make clear, there has been an increase in programmable aid to Indonesia from $45.4m to $48.3m this year. In terms of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, no further contribution is in fact due by Australia this financial year pursuant to our existing obligations and, as I have made clear publicly on a number of occasions, I am actively reviewing-and the Government, through the Cabinet, will very shortly be in the process of actively reviewing-the decision that was made previously to withdraw from IFAD. I cannot say any more about that at the moment but I acknowledge the force of the submissions that have been made to me from a very large number of people and organisations that IFAD is an organisation that delivers soundly targeted and effective aid and that Australia's position on that ought to be reconsidered.</PARA>
<PARA> It remains the case that if we look at the Budget in the way that I have said in fairness it should be looked at, we have in effect, for all practical purposes, maintained the ratio at around the 0.36 level, taking into account that $100m which was brought forward by a few weeks. That is still better than the average for developed countries in terms of their contribution but falls a long way short of the 0.7 per cent target as a proportion of overseas development assistance to GNP that we would very much like to be able to meet. It certainly falls short of my own private aspiration which I perhaps unwisely communicated publicly on a number of occasions. I would like to get that back up to around 0.4 per cent as soon as possible. But the difficulty remains that when we are in straitened budgetary and economic circumstances of the kind that this country is in, we cannot always realise our expenditure aspirations and to be able to maintain programs of this kind effectively in real terms is in all the circumstances probably the best we can do.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women. It concerns the provision of child-care facilities in new government buildings. As a member of the Joint Public Works Committee, I have been advised on many occasions by Commonwealth officers at public hearings that provision for child-care is not made when planning new buildings as this would be contrary to Government policy. This advice was again given to the Committee as recently as last Wednesday at the Hobart public hearing on the new Commonwealth Government centre. Could the Minister please clarify the Government's policy in this area?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator REYNOLDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a priority of the Government to provide community-based child-care centres, and I think that any reasonable person would recognise that this Government has an outstanding record in relation to child-care. But we emphasise that any government has to set priorities, and our priority has been community-based child-care. However, Commonwealth Government employees have access to these on the same basis as other members of the community. Commonwealth Government employers or unions have facilitated the establishment of a number of community-based centres, and I think this indicates a way in which Commonwealth unions can ensure that their members are getting access to the benefits of the child-care policy that this Government has pursued. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Staff Association child-care centre in Woolloomooloo is just one example: 50 to 70 per cent of users are ABC staff. At the Jennifer Lockwood Childcare Centre in Perth, which was initiated by the Australian Public Service Association, Telecom staff are among its main users. There is a centre adjacent to the Telecom industries group in Bentleigh East in Melbourne on land made available by Telecom, and again Telecom staff are among the main users. A child-care centre has been built by the Ku-ring-Gai Council on land leased from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). The CSIRO leased the land to the council on the condition that a child-care centre be built and that CSIRO have representation on the centre's board of management. However, as the centre is a community facility, the council cannot guarantee priority places for children of CSIRO employees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, I turn to an area in which I know Senator Newman will have a special interest-the Department of Defence. Department of Defence-owned houses may be used to run family day-care centres funded under the normal arrangements. Surplus facilities on bases are sometimes used for child-care on a self-help basis. Land on the outskirts of Holsworthy army base has been made available for a child-care centre for the use of local residents, including service families.</PARA>
<PARA> I think that reflects the fact that the Government's policy of giving absolute priority to community-based care is the way that we see child-care provision at this stage. It is obvious that Senator Devereux raises an issue that is of great concern to public sector employees, but it is important that we set our priorities; and we believe that the most important thing for the Australian community at the moment is community-based child-care.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I said that flows through into exports. I know what I mean; I am quite clear about that. Let me explain for the benefit of Senator Lewis. Let me give him a simple example which he might understand. In the last two years Australian exports of steel have fallen right away. Why? It is because there has been an enormous increase in domestic demand for steel which BHP could not satisfy. Not only could BHP not satisfy the domestic demand for steel; it actually imported steel on occasions to satisfy that level of domestic demand. Now if you reduce the domestic demand, that frees up BHP production for export purposes and it also stops it importing steel into this country. That is a simple example which the honourable senator might understand, I hope he does, I put it in those terms in order that there might be some understanding of this issue raised in Senator Stone's question. Senator Stone then goes on to ask: In the absence of anything being done about productivity in this country-and he knows he could get a pimple on his tongue for that one; it is an issue we debated yesterday-what is the Government doing about these issues? First of all, there is no absence of things being done. Everything which is talked about by his Party in this context is about long term measures which will not solve today's current account problem and he well knows that.

It did not happen. But likewise, Mr President, at the time that the 1988 Budget was presented, the Government's economic advisers from within the bureaucracy, and every private sector commentator or analyst that I know of, seriously underestimated the strength of domestic demand-an error which, I suggest, grew substantially out of the 1987 stock market crash. There had not been such an event, or anything remotely resembling it since World War II, and the consequences of it were pretty uncertain. Now because domestic demand was very much stronger than anticipated at the time of the 1988 Budget, both the inflation rate and the current account deficit unfortunately reached levels much higher than forecast in that Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>

Firstly, it provides information on the results of the superannuation reforms that have already been put in place by the present Government since 1983 and analyses the effects of the initiatives that were announced last night. In the years when the present shadow Treasurer was advising the then Treasurer-that is, in the late 1970s and the earlier 1980s-virtually nothing was done to promote occupational superannuation as a vehicle for true long term private saving for the provision of retirement income.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Instead of that, Senator Button, what we had were cherry picker schemes, superannuation cover for a well paid minority, cashing out lump sums several times in a lifetime. In other words, it was not superannuation. It was deferred wages, concessionally taxed. Once the lump sum had been obtained the proceeds were either spent or hidden in low income assets in order to double dip. There has been a vast change since then. As Chanticleer says in today's article:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Since the Hawke Government started fixing up the retirement incomes system in 1983, the superannuation pool has increased from $17 billion to $105 billion.</PARA>
<PARA>Chanticleer goes on to argue that with the additional policy initiatives announced last night, that pool could grow from the present $105 billion to $500 billion within a decade. I quote from the article again:</PARA>
<PARA>It would mean that within about 15 years, the savings position of the nation will have been transformed to the point where foreign debt of the size we are all now so worried about will either disappear or become irrelevant.</PARA>

<PARA>I suppose that could be summed up in short by saying that Chanticleer prefers meat to feathers. Of course, Chanticleer's comment is not an isolated example because those with a true understanding of Australia's saving investment problems recognise that the retirement income's policy announced by the Government is the responsible and proper way to tackle the two problems of insufficient, inadequate domestic savings relative to the level of investment required, and the longer term Budget outlays problem of an ageing population.</PARA>

I think any government would take the view that in a period of rapid social change which has affected the stability of marriages and which has been occurring in Australia for the last 10 or 15 years at least, the function of government in helping people in that process is probably a fairly limited one. That is to say, the size of the problem does not dictate the size of the amount we spend on it, which is the implication of the honourable senator's question. I do not know about the adequacy of marriage guidance facilities and so on, some of which, of course, are provided by government and some of which are provided by non-government organisations.

<PARA> The second question asks whether I am aware of a section of the Western Australian Act. Yes. I am aware of the Act but obviously that is entirely the responsibility of the Western Australian Government and not mine. I understand, Mr President, that the issue of sand mining on Dirk Hartog Island was referred to the State Planning Commission by the Western Australian Mines Department. The Commission advised the Mines Department that any proposals for mining and exploration on the island should be opposed as they would cause disturbance to the natural environment, so it is my opinion, therefore, that it would be quite proper if this application were disallowed. The third question was: On what date did the Heritage Commission include the island on the register? That occurred on 21 March 1989. Shark Bay, of course, is not entered on the World Heritage List and no nomination for it has yet been lodged.

The bulk of these funds are being channelled through the UN coordinator's office for allocation to the UNHCR, the world food program and the coordinator's office itself. Funds have also been provided to the International Committee of the Red Cross-$250,000-and another $50,000 has been provided to the agency coordinating body for Afghan relief, which is an NGO umbrella body.</PARA>
<PARA> Australian assistance for the Afghan refugees, including those located in Pakistan, for the period since the Soviet invasion in 1979, when it is all added up, totals almost $48m. It is expected that a significant part of the remainder of the $20m pledge will be spent in the coming year, a large part in the form of food aid.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The theme of Budget initiatives in child-care this year is affordability and equity. All honourable senators would know that the Hawke Government has financed an unprecedented expansion of publicly funded child-care services. The Government has more than doubled the number of child-care places, from 46,000 to 114,000, and targeted new services for people in need. Last year's Budget pledged another 30,000 new child-care places by 1992, and over 8,200 will be available by the end of this financial year. This year's Budget concentrates on ensuring that child-care remains affordable to lower income families. Honourable senators will recall that it was this Government which introduced fee relief assistance to low income families, in 1984.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For the first time now the Government has decided to index fee relief payments annually. Fee relief ceilings for government-funded child-care centres and family day care schemes will rise to $92.50 and $68 respectively. The Government has also decided to increase threshold income at which users start to pay more than the minimum fee from $255 to $280 per week gross. These initiatives will mean a rise of $7 per week per child in government assistance to families receiving fee relief, which will be adjusted each year in line with inflation.</PARA>
<PARA> Operational subsidies for all kinds of government-funded child care, including occasional care centres and family day care schemes, will also be increased this year. Further, the Government is proposing a new fee relief scheme to assist low income families using outside school hours care and will approach States to cost-share. These measures acknowledge the crucial role child-care plays in achieving the Government's social policy goals and are a major step in guaranteeing affordable quality child-care into the future.</PARA>

It is true that Waltanna Tractors and other manufacturers in various industries are paying tariff duties on various imported components. But there is a remedy for that which, hopefully, would lead the company to apply for a commercial tariff concession. The company has not done that, although it has been advised that it could. When I say that it has not done it, I mean that it has made one such application, in November 1988, for something which is described as a `log loader', a special purpose implement added to the front of the tractor-not a standard tractor part. I really think that companies such as this and, indeed, members of parliament who write letters to the paper on their behalf should be better informed about what the opportunities available to them are. I would hope that Waltanna Tractors would make the appropriate application, and that may be of some general assistance to the company.</PARA></TALK.START>

In so far as there is a device, as the honourable senator puts it, to avoid the payment of duty, particularly in respect of manufactured goods which are subsequently exported, there are two ways of dealing with the anomaly, and the device, so-called, has been written into the Australian tariff law for as long as-well, I cannot think of when.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is not an anomaly and it is not a device; it is the system. If the honourable senator does not understand it after his lengthy experience as shadow Minister for Customs, it is time he did.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Button does think it is a laughing matter. Senator Button says there is nothing the Government can do about first home owners losing their homes. Single women trying to make it on their own and be self-reliant are finding it increasingly difficult to acquire and retain a home of their own. Under this Government's policies it is getting more and more difficult for them to do so. Married women, women who are contributing to the maintenance of a family budget, are finding it difficult too. Even with a joint income these days, repaying the housing loan for an Australian family is becoming almost impossible to cope with. The Housing Industry Association told us only recently that 500,000 Australian families are at risk of losing their homes due to the high interest rate policies of this Government. The present economic situation and high interest rates have given rise to more problems for women than the Government cares to acknowledge. The Real Estate Institute of Australia says that in the March quarter of this year the average home loan repayment in Melbourne required 34.2 per cent of the median family income. Last year it was only 25.7 per cent. In Sydney, 41.1 per cent of the family income was needed in the March quarter to service a family loan, compared with 31.7 per cent a year ago-a 10 per cent increase over a year. Of course, both those figures are far and away above the traditional limit for loans of 25 per cent of income which was applied by lending institutions to assess applicants' ability. This situation is affecting women in a very real way. It goes to the core of their being and their need to keep a roof over their own head and their families' heads.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not just a question of housing. The Marriage Guidance Council (MGC) tells us that Federal Government's economic solution of high interest rates is contributing to marital stress and breakdowns and associated problems, such as high levels of sick leave, homelessness and youth problems. The Marriage Guidance Council claims that high home loan interest rates and house prices are causing more couples to seek professional marriage guidance. I am told that in Victoria there was a 25 per cent increase in the number of couples who saw the MGC between April and May this year; 1,981 couples were counselled in May. This figure represents only 80 per cent of those who sought help because one in five had to be turned away, put on a waiting list or referred to welfare. </PARA>
<PARA> In Hobart this month, the Marriage Guidance Council tells me, 40 people were turned away because its budget is now in deficit. That is because it has had to help so many people who cannot even afford the set fees. It escapes me how Government members can sit there and make comments like Senator Button did a few months ago that even if first homes are being put out of the reach of ordinary Australians there is little the Government can do. The Treasurer, Mr Keating, says that if he was in France he would be given the Legion d'Honneur, and the United States would dream up some congressional medal for him for his efforts on the economy. We know what we in this country would give him-the order of the boot. It is women who constantly suffer in regard to home affordability. They also suffer the family stress that goes with the breakup of marriages and the associated family problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us turn to small business. Small business is the largest single employer group in this country. It accounts for nearly 52 per cent of the total private sector work force. There were 248,700 women in small business in 1986-87, which were the latest figures I could get. That in itself was an increase of 15 per cent on a couple of years before. A third of all small businesses are owned by women. Most women start small businesses for two or three reasons. One reason is so that they can have flexible working hours to suit themselves-something which under this Government they have no hope of gaining. The accord between the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Government has been an unholy accord as far as women are concerned because they cannot get the flexible working hours that they need. There has also been an increasing trend for firms to contract services out and increased technology, which reduces the start-up costs for small businesses. Many women, like men, operate their businesses on an overdraft, and we all know what has happened to overdrafts under this Government's high interest policies. People are paying 23, 24 and 25 per cent to service an overdraft, thus crippling their small business. </PARA>
<PARA> How does this Government expect women, and men, to pay their overdrafts, housing loans and everything else that has to come out of their budgets and maintain an adequate standard of living? Mandrake the magician, commonly known as the Treasurer, keeps saying that everything is economically on track and that all will be okay with just a wave of his magic wand. However, he has been wand-waving for seven Budgets now and he has not yet pulled the rabbit out of the hat. I do not believe that he can. </PARA>

<PARA> Let us turn to inflation, having had a good look at interest rates and small business. Any woman, married or single, is finding it difficult to budget with the current escalation of costs. Women know what inflation is doing to the budgets of Australians. They do not need to read about it in the newspapers. Every time they open their purses they know what has happened to this country. I think the Treasurer of this country needs some instruction. Let me remind the members of the Government what has happened to prices. I have some figures for Hobart, which are replicated all over the country. I have figures for 1983 when this Government came into office and I have figures for this year. The price of a kilogram of laundry detergent has gone from $2.49 to $4.18; a bottle of strawberry jam from $1.30 to $1.90; a loaf of white bread from 83c to $1.16; a litre of milk from 74c to 88c; cornflakes from $1.15 to $2.41; baked beans from 60c to 86c; and petrol from 48.1c to 61.8c. Those are some of the prices that the women in Hobart are having to contend with under the inflation that has been presided over by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what has happened to car prices under the Hawke Labor Government-and, after all, Senator Button has had a great interest in this area. When the Fraser Government left office, 29 1/2 working weeks, at average weekly earnings of $231.90, were needed to buy a six-cylinder family car which was then priced at $6,850. Last year, 41.4 working weeks were needed to buy that family car although average weekly earnings had gone up to $483, which is more than double the 1983 rate. The price of the car had gone up to $20,000. That is the reality of what has happened under this Government in terms of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> With the inability to control inflation and bring down interest rates, women have been limited in their freedom of choice. That is, after all, what we claim that we all want for women. Many of them have been forced into the work force against their will. A recent study estimated that 38 per cent of the women in the work force were not there because they wanted to be. These are the women that we call economic conscripts. They are forced to work just to make their family ends meet and to keep a roof over their heads. These women are resentful of the Government because it has them in a financial bind. For many of them with small children, half of their wages at least are wiped out with the cost of child-care, the Medicare levy and tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Today Senator Reynolds, and Senator Richardson who spoke after her, tried to make much of what the Government has been doing in the area of child-care. The fact is that a lot of this is jolly talk-talk, talk, talk. There are inadequate resources. The fact of the matter is that the Government has no effective child-care policy. Consultations, brochures and talk take the place of adequate action. Right across the nation there has been an overwhelming plea for affordable and available child-care but the Government has ignored these pleas. Two hundred and fifty thousand women have joined the full time work force in the past decade. Women now account for 40 per cent of the work force. So there is an overwhelming need for extra child-care places. </PARA>
<PARA> A family with two infant children and earning more than $32,000 a year will have to pay $260 a week for 40 hours of child-care. For some lower income families, a 20 per cent increase in the child-care bill will put their daily child-care bill in excess of their daily income. Even at expensive child-care centres, places are few and far between and people are registering for places at birth. The Government is neglecting its commitment to provide in real terms a program to ensure that parents and children have access to quality child-care, regardless of cultural background, disability or geographic isolation and in proportion to income. Women, we know, are now taking children to lectures. Women are taking children to work or they are having them come to work after school. In my home town of Launceston I am told by a child-care centre that has already lost a number of children since the fee rises on 1 July that some of those children are now being left alone at home or are going back to granny for her to raise the next generation. </PARA>
<PARA> The fee relief that Senator Richardson was trying to talk to us about is simply a question of $2.50 a week. A family with three children is getting an extra $7.50 a week but since 30 June its costs have gone up by $60. Some help! It is sheer hypocrisy for the Government to say that it wants more women in the work force and then, on the other hand, to deny those women adequate child-care. The 30,000 child-care places that Mr Keating has been saying he will produce over four years, by 1992, is not enough even if they are provided. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has stated that 80,000 to 90,000 mothers, each with an estimated 1.5 children, say they would rejoin the work force now but they cannot find affordable or adequate child-care. If one estimates that 40 to 50 per cent of these women are looking for formal child-care, 60,000 child-care places are needed immediately-not half that number by 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's track record is full of rhetoric. One has only to look at the way it treats its own employees. I have not time today to go into this in great detail; I have done so over and over again in this place. The Government cannot produce a child-care policy for the Defence Force personnel it sends thousands of miles from their extended families. Yet it spends a lot of time trying to convince employers in the private sector that, on the grounds of productivity, they should provide child-care for their employees. Let us see the Government lead by example. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is also failing in the area of equal opportunity for its employees. Back in March this year the Australian Council of Trade Unions said that probably the most disturbing aspect of the Federal Government's attempt to legislate against discrimination has been the number of government departments that have still not submitted equal employment opportunity plans. In fact, as the Federal Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) was attacking private companies for failing to comply with the affirmative action legislation, his own Department still had not submitted its plans. It is just not good enough that the Federal Government pushes private enterprise around on the subject of equal opportunity but does not produce the goods itself. There are many examples of this that I could give, but time makes it very difficult. The Canberra Times said in its editorial:</PARA>
<PARA> There is some evidence that the affirmative action program changed virtually nothing in the Public Service except the modus operandi of senior administrators. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us just look at one small example. Senator Reynolds might like to take this home and study it. It is just a straw poll I conducted myself in recent weeks on the subject of Commonwealth cars. Has Senator Crowley ever thought of how many drive her around in Commonwealth cars? In Western Australia there are two. </PARA>

Those women are in the danger group for breast cancer, which kills about 2,200 women every year in Australia. But this Government has a wretched record in its approach to breast cancer. Even though it will try to tell us that something is being done about it in this Budget, the Government really has done no more than put its toe in the water. This is the only X-ray for which one cannot get a Medicare rebate. </PARA>
<PARA> Last night the Government said it will extend the breast and cervical screening program for a further two years at an additional cost of $0.6m. This does nothing to implement the recommendations of the National Health and Medical Research Council which five years ago said that all women over 40 should be screened for breast cancer. What a joke that is when we see that in this Budget over $40m has been given as a contribution to sport. </PARA>

This Government gives kicking a ball higher priority than women's health. On the 60 Minutes program on 5 March, the Minister for Community Services and Health, Dr Blewett, when asked about Government spending on screening programs for breast cancer, said that they will cost us about $50m a year and we have to make sure that it is spent in the most responsible, high quality way. He said, `You cannot go along and have an X-ray in this country just to see if there is anything wrong with you'.

<PARA> Let us look at the realities of what this Government has done. It has given us masses of glossies; a booklet on women's health that does not include anything about breast cancer; a glossy national agenda for women which is not specific only to women anyway; a women in sport glossy which came out in 1985; two papers on women in advertising which have not been made public; a booklet entitled Women in Advertising, Sex Portrayal in the Media which is soon to be released; and recently there has been a glossy called Child Care in the Work Place, which is basically a study into the cost and benefits of employer provided child-care with a do it yourself survey of child-care needs in the back. There is lots of gloss with this Government; there is not much substance. Let me just tell honourable senators one highlight that the women's Budget for 1989-90 produced. I was reading it this morning. It says that one of the highlights of last year's Budget-the highlight of the Government's activities last year-was that it achieved a chapter on non-sexist language for the first time in the Government Style Manual. Can it possibly be serious? How many Australian women would consider this a highlight, for goodness sake?</PARA>
<PARA> The true failure of the Hawke Labor Government in its dealings with women is shown by its abject failure to deal with the economic imperatives. Any Australian woman managing a family budget could do better than Mandrake Keating. Any Australian woman knows the reality of our economic situation better than he does. Australian women know how much things cost and how far the dollar has to stretch. If Mandrake took a few lessons from Australian women maybe he would get his spells right. As it is, all he can do is turn a hawk into a turkey. </PARA>
<PARA> An increasing percentage of Australian women are showing up in studies as being seriously concerned at the Government's economic management. It will be enough to change their vote and I warn Government members that they cannot take this lightly. A litany of measures on the periphery of this subject will do nothing to convince Australian women that they have any understanding of their needs and the problems they are facing. Australian women have already seen the Government's priorities and they are not in the area of economic management which is the area in which Australian women are hurting so desperately, as are their husbands, their lovers, their sons, their daughters. This Government stands condemned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to participate in this matter of public importance this afternoon. It gives me the opportunity, if anyone on the Opposition benches is interested, to table the National Agenda for Women: Implementation Report. Senator Newman has made a great play of rhetoric and said that the Government has not done enough. The Government is prepared to scrutinise closely its record in terms of the National Agenda for Women and in tabling this document I invite Senator Newman to read it and see what progress has been made. Unlike Senator Newman I would not boast and claim that all has been done for Australian women. That is probably because so little was done by predominantly Liberal-National Party governments over the last many years. I would not talk too loudly if I were Senator Newman about the Opposition's policies-what we know of them-in relation to the status of women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Newman started by talking about high interest rates; asking what we were doing for single women; and asking what we were doing about prices and child-care-a rhetoric of accusations. But what does the Opposition intend to do about interest rates? I have a press clipping here from the Australian of 3 August. `Mortgage Relief Not on the Agenda' says Senator Newman's Leader. Fifteen million dollars was added to the mortgage rent relief scheme. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator REYNOLDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I challenge Senator Newman to go out into the marketplace in Tasmania and talk to her constituents, to ask them which they would rather have-`Mortgage relief not on the agenda, says Peacock', or $15m additional to what the Hawke Government gives. That is the first thing that demolishes Senator Newman's arguments about interest rates because she, as the Opposition spokesman, cannot come up with any alternative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, she goes on about what we are doing in relation to child-care, what we are doing in relation to planning for single parents and for older women. Let me challenge her to detail her child-care policy. I have never heard of an Opposition child-care policy. Where is its equal opportunity policy? When will it be released? Will the Opposition maintain the family allowance supplement? Senator Stone, who unfortunately is not in the chamber-I do not suppose he is very interested in debating the status of Australian women-is very keen on demolishing assistance to Australian women and their families. Senator Newman is the one who lacks substance. She gets on her feet and does nothing but criticise the Government in terms of what it is doing in relation to the status of women. I must admit that I think I would prefer Senator Newman's colleague from South Australia to be the Opposition spokesperson. At least Senator Vanstone made her position quite clear in a statement to the Liberal Women's Convention-I think it would have been last year-when she quoted the Opposition's former leader, John Howard, saying, `What unites us is greater than that which divides us'. That was her response to dealing with the National Agenda for Women. I have always remembered that particular comment from Senator Vanstone because, for all the questions and the disagreements that we might have across this chamber, I believe that Senator Vanstone is committed to the National Agenda for Women. I imagine that she could be relied upon to fight for it to be implemented under the unlikely possibility of a coalition government. What does Senator Newman say about the National Agenda for Women? I will be closely checking the Hansard, but I did not pick up anything that indicated that Senator Newman, as the new Opposition spokesperson, was in the least bit interested in maintaining a commitment to the National Agenda for Women. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of great concern that an Opposition spokesperson is not prepared to give bipartisan support to the National Agenda for Women. Around this country Australian women recognise that the Hawke Government has been the first government to develop comprehensive policies for women and to be prepared to monitor how those policies are implemented. It is well known that the Australian Government is the first to adopt the United Nations Forward Working Strategies towards the year 2000 in terms of recognising the need to lift the status of women around the world, and the Australian Government is proudly the first government to implement its own Forward Working Strategies through the National Agenda for Women. It is also the first government in the world to produce a women's budget. Senator Newman is long on rhetoric about all the alleged sins of the present Government. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator REYNOLDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am coming to those facts in plenty of time. Senator Newman was very light on facts. We did not get anything of her policies. I come back to the fact that this is the only government that has been prepared to introduce comprehensive status of women policies. I now come to the implementation report. I challenge Senator Newman to come into this place and tell me three things: Firstly, will she guarantee that the Opposition will adopt, on a bipartisan basis, the National Agenda for Women? Secondly, I ask her, because she made such efforts to denounce the work of this Government, to come into this chamber and, on behalf of the Opposition, detail what her alleged government-she is boasting that the Opposition could be in government-would do about breast cancer screenings?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Stone sits over there saying `Cut, cut, cut'. John Hewson continually talks about cutbacks in expenditure. What would the Opposition do in the area of women's health policy? Would it be maintained? Finally, in regard to these three challenges I would like to know precisely what the Opposition's child-care policy is. Again, we hear absolutely nothing about the Opposition's child-care policy, about whether the Opposition would be able to maintain the very fine record of the Hawke Government. I certainly am extremely sceptical. </PARA>
<PARA> Far from failing Australian women, this Government is encouraging and supporting them and presenting them with real choices in their lives. When the Government came to power in 1983, only 44 per cent of girls completed year 12; now almost 60 per cent complete year 12; very recognisable progress. In 1983, the unemployment rate for women was 10.4 per cent. By June this year it had fallen to 6.6 per cent; again, clearly an improvement in regard to job opportunities for Australian women. By 1992 this Government will have provided an extra 98,000 child-care places, trebling the number of places available in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this Government the standard pension has increased by 8.3 per cent in real terms compared with a fall of 2.5 per cent over the seven years of the previous Government. Assistance to families has increased dramatically under this Government. Family allowance rates are now $9 per week for the first three children and $12 per week for each subsequent child. Could we rely on John Stone to maintain that kind of support for Australian families? Other payments for children have increased, too. The family allowance supplement-which is a Brian Howe and Hawke Government initiative-ensures for the first time that significant financial assistance is provided for the children of low income families. </PARA>
<PARA> This short list of facts and figures could be expanded on considerably if there were more time. What is important from this listing of achievements is the positive impact these changes have had on the day to day lives of Australian women. For the first time in Australian history we are providing women with choices in their lives. We are saying to them that is okay to stay on at school, that it is okay for them to expect the better paying jobs that come from a better education. We recognise that for most women their first priority is their children and we are providing women with the support to combine paid employment with child rearing if they choose. </PARA>
<PARA> For those who stay at home with children for longer periods, payments for families provide meaningful levels of assistance. The question is: What would the Opposition do with these payments if it were to win the next election? On the one hand, one half of the Opposition says that all government payments will be cut back and that the Government is spending far too much on health, education and housing assistance. Meanwhile, the other half of the Opposition says that this Government is forcing women not to have children because of the cost of living. Opposition members should make up their minds. The Opposition is trying to manipulate women into believing that the abolition of Medicare will not affect their families, that cutting back on education spending will not affect their families, that cutting back on funding for services to the aged and the disabled will not affect their families. We are presented with a saccharine sweet picture of the family on the cover of John Howard's Future Directions while the Opposition prepares to demolish funding for the very services which support and nurture the family. </PARA>
<PARA> The electorate was given the option to give the Opposition's divisive policies a go in 1987 and it rejected them. In any future election the electorate will be equally able to see through the image of cosy families to discern that the very supports of the family would be knocked out by Opposition policies. I cannot pretend that this Government has simple answers for women. Neither does this document pretend to do that. But this document indicates that this Government takes women's issues seriously and we are prepared to monitor closely and give a yearly account of what we have achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic circumstances that the Government faces are daunting. We have been honest with the electorate. We have not pretended that there are simple solutions. What we have done is ensure that one section of Australian society is not asked to bear a disproportionate share of the difficulties which have affected the economy. The Government's commitment to equity remains firm. `Equity' is not a word that I believe Senator Newman used in her speech. We have protected the very poorest and, despite the economic climate, we have increased the assistance they receive. This is important for women as women are the largest group of pensioners and are over-represented in low income groups. Women appreciate the importance of family allowances, the family allowance supplement and other payments for children. They are mostly responsible for paying the expense of the household and know the difference these payments make to the household budget. They also recognise that the child support scheme introduced by this Government means that they can now receive regular maintenance payments at a decent level. These are changes which have improved women's lives. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government is providing women with hope and the concrete assistance that they need. We are not failing Australian women. This Government is also providing women with a way out of their dependency on pensions and low incomes. The Government's policy on retirement incomes recognises that women's broken involvement in the labour force has meant that they have been unable to accumulate significant levels of superannuation in the past. We have modified the arrangements to better suit women's employment patterns, their broken patterns and their particular experience. In relation to that, honourable senators may be interested to know that Neville Norman, a well known economist, praised this move by the Government in its Budget announcements last night. He said this morning on, I believe, Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio, in response to a question about superannuation:</PARA>
<PARA>It's directed particularly to improving the position in relation to women. There is by the way a complete women's budget statement, which I spent part of the night reading. It's very good actually. It's written in more understandable language and I'd advise men as well to read that. </PARA>
<PARA>He later said:</PARA>
<PARA>Yes, it's very well done. I would actually recommend it. I read it out of intrigue and I kept reading and it tells you a lot more . . . </PARA>
<PARA>And so it goes on. I believe that that is considerable praise from Mr Neville Norman, who I understand is a conservative economist. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me return to initiatives under the Hawke Government that have assisted Australian women. The jobs, education and training (JET) program is about encouraging sole parents into employment. Senator Newman did not mention the JET program. I do not suppose she has bothered to make inquiries about how it is operating in her home State. She just talked about child-care and said that we were doing nothing in this area. I presume she has not visited one of the new centres that I know have been opened in her home State. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator REYNOLDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All right, the taxpayer. But because of this Government's priorities, taxes have been directed to child-care. Neither the honourable senator, John Stone, Andrew Peacock nor John Hewson have been able to reassure me, let alone Australian families, that the cutbacks that they are continually referring to will not impact on child-care. I will be delighted if Senator Newman can come into this place with policies and commitments that she will not go back on, without Senator Stone contradicting, to reassure me and to reassure Australian women. But I am not holding my breath waiting for that. The Government strategy for improving the lives of women is outlined in the national agenda. The document provides comprehensive details on strategies which the Government will implement. The agenda was not based on the whims of government; it represents the aspirations of women for their lives. The Government consulted with women in drawing it up. We continue to base policies affecting women on the needs of women, as expressed by women. In this year's Budget the women's health strategy draws on the needs of women for their health services. Likewise, before the retirement incomes policy was finalised the Government asked women for their views.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This consultative approach contrasts with the Opposition's bossy generalisations about women's lives which owe more to the fantasies of ad men than to the needs of Australian women. Nor does the Government assume that Australian women are a homogeneous group. We recognise that young women have different needs. We understand that women fleeing violent relationships need unique services, and we appreciate that women from non-English speaking backgrounds want different services again. But we understand that government has a responsibility to continue to improve opportunities and services for Australian women. </PARA>
<PARA> Against this I place the record of the Opposition. For all its rhetoric there was very little to show for women while it was in government. Among its achievements prior to 1983 we could list a recession that led to record rates of unemployment for women and teenage girls; and social security policies that condemned older women, sole parents and their children and the unemployed to lives of bitter poverty. Senator Newman was not in the Senate in those days but she conveniently forgets the record of the Fraser years. If Senator Newman can convince me that Andrew Peacock is a new broom, if she can convince me that Senator Stone, John Hewson and John Elliott will not be the ones to dictate the policies of the coalition, I will welcome her announcements. But I am afraid the Opposition has a long way to go before it assures Australian women that it is committed to any more than just political attacks on the present Government, which is doing the very best it can for all Australian women under tough economic circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating this afternoon a matter of public importance introduced by Senator Newman which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The record of the Hawke Labor Government in failing Australian women. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate, and Senator Newman, that while the Labor Government certainly holds sway at the moment and has, of course, since 1983 it does not control the Senate and while the Liberals are in opposition they and we combine to hold a majority in here. So much of the Government's legislative program can, if a majority in this place believes it to be inequitable to one group or another, be hijacked, shanghaied, amended, opposed, done to death or whatever. The fact of the matter, of course, is that many--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And occasionally passed. Senator Crowley has reminded me of the fact that the majority of the Government's legislation which has gone through the Parliament since 1983 has in fact gone through, not with the support of the Democrats but with the support of the Liberal and National parties, either together or separately. Of course, many of the things that are disadvantaging women; that are keeping women as the majority group living below the poverty line; that are hindering women in taking full advantage of some of the legislative programs that should be offering them full choice; have gone through this Parliament with the support of the Liberal and National parties. I refer to the delay of six weeks to the consumer price index increases in pensions in 1986 and the fact that 45-year-old women were required to go off the Class B widow's pension and onto unemployment benefit when their youngest child turned 16. Those sorts of things have gone through this place only because of the support of the Opposition parties. So to quite a large extent the Opposition has contributed to the parlous state in which many women now find themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the years women in Australia have had to put up with a great deal of prejudice, a great many hurdles, and all the inevitable inequities that go with that prejudice and those hurdles, as well as legal impediments preventing them from participating fully in the community. They have ranged from the most extraordinary judicial decisions which have defined women as non-persons, for one reason or another, through to the inability of women to vote in many States, or indeed to stand for election to parliament in some States until the early 1920s, and things such as women needing different grounds for divorce than their husbands needed to divorce them; lower pay scales; limited access to education and the employment and promotion that followed from that education and so on. Women in Australia have confronted all those issues through the decades and centuries. Rural, migrant and Aboriginal women have suffered from all those problems, plus additional ones. They have not been fully overcome. </PARA>
<PARA> We still have a situation where a man's average weekly earnings are $521.80 and a woman's, on average, are $338.30. About 3.15 million women are in the Australian work force but only 1.9 million of those are in full time employment, the other 1.2 million being employed part time. Australia does not have an across the board system with things such as permanent part time work with the pro rata benefits-access to superannuation and so on-that would allow women, and men too, to share the income earning and child rearing in families. Inevitably women are still clustered into the lowest paying jobs. A total of 73.8 per cent of all clerical positions are held by women; over 60 per cent of service, sport and recreation positions are held by women; and over half of all sales positions are held by women. Inevitably that means that they are in a minority, sometimes a quite small minority, in the higher paying, more promotion geared positions in administration, as well as executive and managerial positions. As a consequence of much of that women have limited access to superannuation. Considerably fewer than 40 per cent of employed women belong to some sort of superannuation scheme compared with over 60 per cent of men. That means that not only are they disadvantaged during their working life, but also they are considerably more disadvantaged than men in their post-retirement years. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the problems that women have are compounded for those who live in country areas or come from a migrant background. Women as a group spend more time below the poverty line than men as a group do. The pressure on rural women is much greater than that on their female colleagues in city areas. There are problems with access to public transport, the cost of private transport, the lack of educational facilities, the high cost of petrol and the high cost of all goods, given transport costs and the fact that freight is a component of sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Lack of decent affordable child-care affects women in rural areas much more than it does even women in the city and there is that additional pressure on women in rural areas to fulfil a multitude of roles as times get tougher on the land. I must say that if I hear one more woman who works with her husband on a property call herself `only a farmer's wife' I may commit an assault. Those women work on tractors and among the stock. They take their role in planting, harvesting and so on and then go back into the home and accept all the additional responsibilities that women have in the unpaid work force in the home of rearing children and getting the shopping, the cooking, the cleaning and so on done. Yet they will still persist in saying that they are only a farmer's wife. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, of course, fewer health services available in country areas and there is the additional stress of knowing that your child is often going to have to leave home to go to school and almost always leaves home to get a job. The isolated children's allowance has been eroded under this Government by inflation and by an unsympathetic ear as far as the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) is concerned. Migrant women face the sorts of problems that come from language difficulties, from being in many jobs that are non-unionised and from dealing with unions that perhaps do not particularly care about the role of women in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> Ninety-five per cent of all outworkers are women and large numbers of these are migrant women. They are working for the sort of pittance and under conditions that are not much different from the sort that women had to confront in the nineteenth century when they were forced to work long hours for very small pay. While women generally are still much worse off economically and as far as choice is concerned, both in education and in employment, than men are, there are a number of groups of women who are by comparison particularly badly off and those are women in rural areas and migrant women. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, many of the problems facing women in the community are the results of traditional attitudes about the roles of men and women. But others have had their basis in legislation or often, perhaps more properly put, the failure of governments to legislate or to lead the way for change in some way. In Question Time today, for example, the Minister for Local Government (Senator Reynolds) said that the Government's top priority in child-care was community-based child-care. Yet how can she, we or the community expect the private sector to look to work-based child-care as is being done not only in the United States of America but also in Europe if the Government will not look at government funded work-based child-care? It is important that we look to see what is happening in other countries and how not only the public sector but the private sector is coping with, and indeed helping, women in the work force. I might add that the whole attitude towards the status of women in the community has not been helped by comments made by people like Senator Puplick towards the Minister I was just referring to. He alleged a couple of months ago, with no real proof, that Senator Reynolds is on the front bench, not because of the number of neurones she can put together, but because of the number of chromosomes she can. That sort of comment made in the Parliament by a frontbencher from the Opposition parties does not do a great deal to improve the status of women in this place or outside it. I would suggest that Senator Newman take Senator Puplick quietly away in a corner and, after she has beaten him up a little, tell him that this is perhaps not the way that he ought to be talking about women generally. Senator Newman has a little work to do on her own colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Newman also claims that the Government has failed the women of Australia in a wide range of areas, and I mentioned earlier that not only has her own Party given the Government the support it needed to deny women real choices and a decent standard of living but also it has actively opposed some of the measures which were in the interests of women in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Women in Australia, I guess, have a lot to be grateful to the Labor Party for-in opposition and in government. Not as much, I acknowledge, as I would like to see. They also have a lot to be grateful for because from time to time the Democrats have been able to use a balance of power in the Senate. For example, back in 1981 under the then Liberal Government, Senator Chaney tried to get through the Parliament a quite draconian piece of legislation that would have punished the wives and children of men whose unions had taken them out on strike by denying them access to a range of social welfare benefits. We managed by a combination in the Senate to stop that. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, Opposition members in large numbers opposed both the sex discrimination legislation and the affirmative action legislation when they were introduced into this place. Women in Australia would also have been less hurt by the current Labor Government if some of its more draconian cost-cutting measures had not been supported by the Liberal and National parties. As I said earlier, in late 1986 pensioners would not have faced the delay by six weeks of the consumer price indexation of their pensions had the Opposition joined the Australian Democrats in voting against that measure. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned the problems facing 45-year-old women taken off the widow's class B pension and put on unemployment benefit. Cuts to Austudy for 15-year-olds in their last two years of school caused havoc, particularly to many sole parent families where the head of the family was a woman. She simply had to take the child out of school because there was not enough money coming into the family for her to be able to afford the excursions, the books and the adequate clothing that a child needs. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Newman mentioned high interest rates and the problems they are causing to women who are trying to buy their own homes and who are forced out into the work force, not from choice but because they need to supplement their husbands' incomes. That would not have occurred without the enthusiastic support of the Opposition for deregulation. I point out that a couple of months ago the Opposition voted against a measure to give mortgage relief to home buyers. The Opposition also supported the sales tax legislation introduced by this Government that increased housekeeping costs-that increased the price of milk products and, worse, soy milk products for families who have a child with an allergy. Fruit juice products and so on have all contributed to the housekeeping hardship faced by women in the community. Of course, imposing tertiary fees on students at university will make matters worse for many women and perhaps change the profiles of universities. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two remaining problems that I will not have time to discuss today that are facing women in the community. One is the need to change the United Nations system of national accounts definition of gross domestic product so that the unpaid work done by women, in particular in the home and the community, is recognised as productive. The other is to change attitudes of the business community to women, from promotion practices to maternity leave, to child care-to all the things that European employers recognise as contributing to productivity and to equitable work practices. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Today we are discussing a matter of public importance raised by Senator Newman which is examining `the record of the Hawke Labor Government in failing Australian women'. Senator Reynolds in her speech asked what we would do for women with regard to breast cancer. In answer to the question, at least we have a commitment to rebate the cost of mammography. The question we would bounce back to her is, `Why has the Government refused to do this?'. If there is so much commitment to women's health, why is not the cost of mammography rebatable? Also, I am interested to find that, during Senator Reynolds's introduction to the Labor contribution to debate on this issue, there seemed to be no men in the chamber on the Labor side who were at all interested in this issue-so much for rhetoric.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No-one can escape the impact of this Government's high taxing, high inflation, high interest rate, high indebtedness policies. Older Australians are no exception. In fact, with reduced and often fixed incomes, reduced mobility, and in some cases reduced ability to cope with changes in legislation and regulations, older Australians are particularly vulnerable. Over the next 35 years the number of elderly people in Australia will grow at twice the population rate of Australia as a whole. One-quarter of our population is presently over 50 years of age. In 2021 it will increase to one-third. The fastest growing group will be those over 85. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many more women than men at all ages over 65, and among those over 80 there are twice as many women as men. Over 90 per cent of older women live in private dwellings and half of the women over 75 in private residences live alone. So government policy on the aged impacts greatly on older women. As I said, nobody can escape the impact of this Government's high taxing, high inflation, high interest rate, high indebtedness policies. The least able to buffer themselves are the aged, and the bulk of them, as I said before, are women. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only are women bearing the brunt of Labor's economic mismanagement but the women in their middle years-the so-called `sandwich generation'-are sandwiched between the responsibility of dependent children, dependent parents and sometimes even dependent grandparents and, as Senator Newman said earlier in the debate, are now also looking after dependent grandchildren because of the low availability of child-care. As I said, 90 per cent of the aged live at home and it often falls to the daughter to assist in a myriad of ways-with transport, arranging for services such as visits to the doctor, shopping, laundry and so on. The Australian Bureau of Statistics is not even prepared to acknowledge the economic effort of unpaid work, the majority of which is undertaken by women. Let me assure you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that if it were not for the army of unpaid workers our aged care bill would be astronomical. </PARA>
<PARA> In talking about the aged care bill, let us not be fooled by last night's Budget figures. Assistance to the aged, we were told, is to increase by 11.6 per cent, and we are told that this is a 4 per cent increase in real terms. While this may be true in straight money measurement, all is not as it seems to be. With an ageing population, more people move into this category every year. If we were to calculate or be given the per capita increase for assistance to the aged we would see that it was less than 4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> As people get older the two things that concern them are their health and their finances. They have every right to be concerned and worried about their health. We have seen recently major changes to nursing home funding and nursing home care. The majority of people in nursing home care are women. A recent study was carried out in Victoria to examine the impact of the new Commonwealth funding arrangements for nursing homes. This study was carried out in 27 Victorian nursing homes. It gives great cause for concern. Four clear conclusions emerged. One hundred and thirty four people were asked to participate in a questionnaire. The first of the four conclusions was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>WORKING CONDITIONS</PARA>
<PARA>Working conditions for nurses and other staff are pressured and strained, and this is already causing major stresses in the system. </PARA>
<PARA>The second area of concern that was identified was communication with residents. This is what the repondents said:</PARA>
<PARA>A rushed atmosphere is discernible in homes which have experienced funding cuts and have accommodated these cuts by staff reductions. Nursing home activities and procedures are being reduced to necessary custodial care and communication with residents and their relatives has declined. </PARA>
<PARA>We have just recently had a report presented to us on residents' rights and standards in nursing homes, and we see a sham-Government cuts and changes in funding have produced the very sort of thing that is sought to be corrected in the residents' rights paper: reduced communication with residents and their relatives. The sorts of standards, the sorts of rights, that we ought to be concerned about are being denied because of the funding situation. The third issue that came out of this report was the diminution of choice. The conclusion was:</PARA>
<PARA>The overall pattern that was observable was one of paring activities back to medical and nursing necessities in a tense and pressured environment. This is seen as emerging from staffing cuts and from the need to accept only more dependent residents. The creation of a homelike atmosphere is seen as increasingly difficult in this context. The quantity and quality of external activities available to residents had been reduced, meal options were being constrained and residents' wishes were often seen as not being met because of pressure on staff. </PARA>
<PARA>A wonderful situation for our elderly people! As I said, the majority of these people are women. Another issue of major concern was that the maintenance of buildings and equipment was a casualty of the reduced funding. So the report talks about working conditions for the staff affecting residents, a reduction of choice, reduction of care and services and a reduction in the capital equipment. The report concluded with the statement that the overwhelming majority of respondents reported anxiety that the situation seemed set only to worsen further-a very different complexion from what we see when the Government talks about its record on aged care. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that I was heartened to see in the Budget the beginnings of the recognition of the particular needs of small communities in rural or remote areas. I hope it is not a case of too little too late. If it is and small rural institutions are forced to close, it will be aged rural women and their carers, mainly women, who will bear the brunt of being moved long distances, if they are residents, or travelling long distances to obtain services and to visit relatives in aged care. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the issues that last night's Budget failed to address was the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Eighty-two per cent of expenditure in this scheme is for pensioners and most of these pensioners would be age pensioners. We have had the problem of generic prescribing and brand names being on again, off again and now on again. This is all guaranteed to confuse the elderly. Who are those elderly? They are mainly women. If the never ending changes to the scheme result in the closure of pharmacies, it is again likely to be the less mobile, the elderly and again, mainly women who will be affected. </PARA>
<PARA> Older Australians will not be fooled by last night's pre-election hand-outs. They know that Medicare has not meant universal health care. What it has meant is longer waiting lists in public hospitals. Of elderly people, women are more likely to get sick than men and there are more older women. If we were to examine the May 1989 queue of 25,000 people waiting for a bed in a Victorian public hospital, we would have seen mainly women waiting months--</PARA>

I hope that the honourable senator does not need a hip replacement at some stage under Medicare because if she does she will have to wait a long time. Nor will the aged be hoodwinked by Budget hand-outs. What Labor giveth, Labor hath taken away. Over the past five years hundreds of millions of dollars have been stripped from the health funds, placing strains on these funds and the services they can offer, in particular services to the elderly. Some of the money that we have seen in the Budget is just the $200m that has been stripped off the elderly from another source. Those strains on the health funds will not be alleviated by the $20m fix that was offered by the Government in the last session of Parliament. Hopefully, the committee that the Senate has set up will be able to address that issue and try to guide the Government in terms of dealing with it in some sort of decent way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The rural aged in isolated communities know that Medicare is not synonymous with universal health care. Where there are no public hospitals available, the sick elderly can be cared for only in their own communities-and that is an important thing when one is old-in private hospitals. For that they need private health insurance. So much for universal health care. Pensioners are struggling to pay their health benefits so they can have the privilege-it seems, under this Labor Government-of being treated in their own community. </PARA>
<PARA> The other major problem which affects the elderly and those planning for their old age is their finances. That brings me to the centrepiece of last night's Budget-Mr Howe's Better Incomes: Retirement Income Policy into the Next Century. In November last year the coalition gave Australia its first ever retirement incomes policy. The Government has now given us an Opposition-driven policy. The Government has done nothing about inflation. Keating says that last year's inflation was too high, but then he tells us that the increase in the consumer price index is expected to be little changed at around 7.5 per cent. As a community, we must reduce inflation, but the Government does not apparently have to take a lead in this. </PARA>
<PARA> Inflation is eroding the value of retirement savings. Modest savings in traditional investment sources-banks and building societies-are being taxed not just on the earnings on the capital, but on the capital itself. Nothing is being done about these high interest rates, and they are affecting the aged in particular. Keating has presided over massive change to the structure and tax situation of superannuation funds in recent years, particularly with the change which took effect from 1 July. Nothing in the Budget undoes the damage of that new taxing regime. The fact is that superannuation has had an effective tax increase of 1,000 per cent under the robber baron of the Treasury. For people on low incomes, mostly women, there is now less, not more, encouragement to enter a superannuation fund, to try to provide for their own retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the 1 July tax cuts, a person on $15,000 a year pays tax of 21c on each extra dollar of wages, leaving 79c of each dollar for immediate spending. However, if the person's employer paid the same $1 into a superannuation fund, the employee would receive only the equivalent of 70c. Great incentive to invest in superannuation-79c in the hand and 70c in the investment fund! I know where many people who are on the breadline would put that money, the 79c in the hand. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other initiatives which the Government has put in. I do not have time to discuss them, but they include such things as home equity conversions, which are absolutely hopeless, whereby pensioners can borrow $40,000 against the value of their homes. I am sure there are a lot of pensioners who will be able to pay back $650 a month at 20 per cent interest! Superannuation schemes have also been looked at, and the Government has tried to do things to encourage women to invest in superannuation. Yet we see things like vesting being delayed for six years. What incentive is that? It is a policy which means that women who have not been able to stay in a job for 10 years would not be able to take advantage of that. This Government has failed women, it has failed elderly women, and it is failing all women. The Government will be delivered with the answer in the next election when women of Australia say no to the Labor Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just to remind the Senate and the listeners of what we are debating, it is a matter of public importance proposed by Senator Newman. I am not sure whether she is condemning it or not, or just listing it. But as I read it, it says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The record of the Hawke Labor Government in failing Australian women. </PARA>
<PARA>I have heard from both Senator Newman and Senator Patterson contributions that are entirely unpersuasive to this point. In fact, Senator Newman should get marks for what I think Senator Puplick would agree was metaphorical mayhem. We cannot resort to recollections of what Senator Newman was saying, but we had mixed metaphors as though they were going out of fashion, followed by a lovely line which I tried to write down: `A litany of measures on the periphery'. If ever I heard a statement of a litany of measures on the periphery, it was Senator Newman's contribution. That is an excellent assessment of Senator Newman's contribution. Senator, stay over there; stick on the periphery. We will go to the centre, the hard issues, doing things for women, as we have been doing since we got into government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fascinating to discover that those in the Opposition have now learned to spell `women', a bit of an improvement on their performance in the years before the Hawke Government actually put women on the agenda; and it is Labor governments, State and Federal, that have put women on the agenda. It is Labor governments that have the commitment-not only the record-into the future on what they will continue to do for and on behalf of women. </PARA>
<PARA> I have in this place a number of times debated issues of concern for women. I remember Senator Hill, from the Opposition, once accusing the Government of creating expectations for women. I was delighted to say then, and I am delighted to say it again, `You bet we have'. It is because we have created expectations, have addressed them all and are looking to keep on doing that that we are the government of defensible record on behalf of women. It is precisely because we have created expectations. Women know that this Government will listen to them. This Government has delivered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us see what the women of Australia say, let alone the men of Australia, at the next election. They know which government has put women on the record, which government has actually consulted with women. It is the Hawke Government that has done that. The Hawke Government consulted extensively, heard what women said, created a national agenda and itemised its priorities, and it is delivering on them. From time to time in this place one hears from the Opposition a litany of those measures at the periphery. The Government knows what the priorities are for women. They are as they have always been-income security, peace in the home and peace internationally, so that they have a place and a haven for themselves and their children. It has never been otherwise. They are the commitments that the Hawke Government has given them through its policies for women and all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Somehow or other Senator Newman believes it is appalling that families that are stuck with bills and difficulties to meet in terms of payments might actually have to go out to work to earn income. Even if I accepted her line-and I would like to make it clear that I do not-that women are being forced into the work force, I would have to say that they have a job to go to. They did not have a job under the previous Government, but they have one under this Government. One and a half million jobs have been created since the Hawke Government came to office in 1983. More than 56 per cent of those jobs have gone to women. That is what this Government has done for women. If women are out there in droves being conscripted into the work force I have not heard about it. They are not ringing me to say, `I've got to go to work'. They are ringing me to say, `I am so pleased I can go to work. I want to work at all sorts of things. I want an education to give me better opportunities. I've got them under the Hawke Government'. As Senator Reynolds said, before 1983 44 per cent of girls completed year 12. Now the figure is well over 66 per cent. For the first time ever more than 50 per cent of students in our tertiary institutions are women. Women have got the real gain under the Hawke Government. They have jobs, education, access to health care, Medicare and the benefits that it has for women. They have the things that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Opposition says is just amazing. Senator Newman took us through the shopping list. She told us what most everyone knows-that prices rise over time. Prices rise for baked beans and cars. But I am not too sure that her understanding has risen at all. None of that was too exciting. If she wanted to show the way prices have increased, why did she not list the way family incomes have increased? Why did she not list-I think that she was ashamed to do so-what this Government has done through the increased income that it has given families directly-tax-free income under the family allowance and the family allowance supplement?</PARA>
<PARA> Who indexed the family allowance for the first time so as to provide a hedge against increasing prices into the future-an absolutely monumental achievement? The Hawke Labor Government did. It did so because it is concerned about women, the costs that women bear on behalf of children and because of their commitment to families. That is on the record. Women appreciate those increases in their family allowance cheques as they come through. Honourable senators opposite should ask them about that, as I have. They say that they see the increase and are pleased to have it. They have also received an increase in the family allowance supplement. As of April last, that has gone to $34.10 per week, tax-free, for a child aged between 13 and 15. What a fantastic commitment! That is the sort of contribution this Government has made to working families on low incomes as well as those on pensions. If they cannot afford the baked beans under the Opposition they will begin to afford them under this Government because we know that payments made to women are spent on children. There is a lot of research to document that and the Government has targeted its increases for and on behalf of children to women through the family allowance and family allowance supplement. They are getting it; they are appreciating it; it is a huge and quite extraordinary contribution to the incomes of families to address the sorts of problems Senator Newman gave as a litany of costs. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also want to reiterate the points that Senator Giles made by way of interjection again and again. What are the Opposition's policies? Is the Opposition going to cut the family allowance supplement? Is that what we can conclude from what Senator Stone or Dr Hewson say? They want to see cuts in these areas. Are they going to cut the very things that Senator Newman is in here asking for? We do not know; she is not telling us. As for child-care, how dare Senator Newman stand in here and say that we do not have an adequate child-care policy. We have a comprehensive child-care policy. We have more than doubled the number of places. We have a commitment into the future for an extra 30,000 places. One thousand of those places are employment related. We have the data. Senator Newman calls information glossy; good luck to her. We actually plan on data and information. We have addressed the problems of child-care in the defence forces. Senator Newman is the very same senator who, time and time again in this place, has talked about the dreadful business of child-care that is assisting women to have their children placed into the care of the state, taken away from their nurturing and all of those sorts of things, and  then--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Newman can check the record as I have and as I have alluded it to her in the past. It took her a while to realise, `Whoops, I cannot come in here and demand child-care for the defence force spouses but on the other side of the argument be opposed to child-care'. It took a while; we needled her into getting her act together. Her policies, or at least her thinking, is now becoming consistent. We are pleased that she is at least learning that. We have a policy of child-care. We are implementing it. Our policy of child-care, like everything else this Government has done, is comprehensive, thoughtful, properly funded and targeted to those in need. In principle, the child-care policy provides the places and assistance for those at the lowest income level, fee relief for those in the middle level and full tote odds are paid by those who can afford the child-care places. The payment is related to the family income. That is one of the other things this Government has been concerned to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point that we need to make clear in this place is that child-care is something of a novelty for the Opposition; so are women as an item on the agenda. But if one goes back to the forward-looking strategies, and one does have to go back to them, one will find about two column-inches devoted to child-care. Can I conclude that the Opposition has abandoned its forward-looking strategies? Is that what I can conclude? Is child-care now going to get a bigger guernsey from the Opposition? Or is it that the forward strategies set Opposition policy and out of all those pages and all that rhetoric devoted to family, two column-inches go to child-care? I do not find that convincing and this Government's record stands. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it is not enough when you have to start from almost nothing and build against years of neglect under the Fraser Government. Of course we cannot achieve our objective straight away. But the Government is committed; it has its child-care places on the ground; it is increasing those; and it is looking at ways not only to increase the distribution of the places, but also to make sure the delivery of child-care places meets the varying needs of women. Whether women are in rural and isolated areas, whether they need family day care assistance, whether they need after hours school assistance, the Government's child-care policy is there. We have a policy. Senator Newman knows that. She can lag us in the Senate, but we know that that is mischievous and wrong. The Government's policy on child-care is in place and it is on target. It is welcomed and it is good. </PARA>
<PARA> The point the honourable senator wanted to make seemed essentially to be that this Government has not done very well for women because it has reduced their income. The facts point to the opposite. This Government has increased opportunities for women in an extraordinary way, providing them with job opportunities, education opportunities and the benefit of health care under Medicare which, as we all know, is of huge benefit to women because women not only seek health services on their own behalf but also, very often, on behalf of those in their care, such as children or elderly folk. Our achievements are on the record. Women in the community are experiencing the benefit of those right now. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Newman's misrepresentation of facts is, at the kindest, due to misunderstanding and at the worst, probably quite mischievous. If Senator Newman wants to go through the cervical and breast screening programs-my colleague Senator Giles will deal with them in more detail-the monetary figure the honourable senator cited is not for an allocation to the services, but for a continuation of a proper evaluation program. I am delighted to hear from Senator Patterson that the Opposition would rebate the cost of mammography in breast cancer screening. My goodness me! Has she checked how much that will cost with either Mr Shack or Dr Hewson? Is she sure that she can win, all the way to the next proposed Budget, and keep that piece of spending? Senator Newman might want child-care for the defence forces. I would be interested to see how she negotiates this, particularly when the Opposition wants to cut everything. Opposition senators come in here and complain about our not doing enough. Opposition policies are totally absent. It has a policy of cost constraint. Senator Stone suggests that things should be cut back in every direction, but will not tell us where. The Opposition criticises us by saying no more than that we are not doing enough. Well, get your act together, troops! Does the Opposition want to spend money in these areas or does it have a policy to cost contain? It is not convincing me. It is certainly not convincing the listening public. The Australian women know that this Government has policies for women and this Government has implemented those policies. It will continue to do so. It is a government on the record and with the record, and it is a government that the women of Australia appreciate and will stay with, for their benefit and for the benefit of all they care for. </PARA>

On those grounds I objected to the Government's high-handed attitude in trying to put a child care-centre in that location. I am, however, a strong believer in child-care as a productivity issue, not as a welfare issue. The Government has failed to provide any sort of leadership in the child-care area because it is determined that child-care will be provided only by the taxpayer, at enormous expense.

<PARA>The record of the Hawke Labor Government in failing Australian women. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RD4">Senator BROWNHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right; it is a poor record of the Hawke Labor Government that has caused this debate to be brought on. In the time that I have available today I would like to concentrate my remarks on how the Hawke Labor Government has failed the rural women of Australia. While this Government has failed rural people in a most cynical and calculated manner, the group who take the greater share of this discrimination are in fact rural women. There are 1.8 million women living in rural Australia. While I live in rural Australia, I cannot profess to appreciate the isolation, the loneliness and the sheer hard slog that women in the inland of this country and even in western New South Wales live under. I live some 110 kilometres from a major rural city and some 50 kilometres from a country town, but I do understand some of the concerns that are being expressed here today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Probably the three most important concerns for rural and regional Australians are our record interest rates, roads, and the increasing cost to the housewife, wherever she may be. In these three areas alone this Government, in last night's Budget, has done nothing. While the Treasurer might make a big splash about the $116m being spent on roads, that is not money that the Government has allocated for that purpose; it is money that almost entirely is coming out of fuel excise revenue, out of the pockets of the motorists, the people who live in the country and the city areas. On the question of interest rates, the attitude of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) appears to be, `Tough; sweat it out as best you can'. On inflation he says, `Let 'er rip'. These three issues alone have had an enormous impact on women living in rural areas. High interest rates for farmers have meant that wives are increasingly going off the farm to provide a cash flow to service interest debts. While outside careers might be the popular choice for city women, it is unbelievably harder for women in rural Australia to take a job off the farm. I will return to that point later. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent University of New England study of rural media advertisements concluded that the prevailing ideology in the country is that men are the real farmers and that women not only accept this but encourage the stereotype of themselves as homemakers. And they are. The women are a vital part of our community, because they help and encourage their male spouses, wherever they happen to be. This study covered 1,478 advertisements, and not one of them showed a woman doing a farm job. Yet a recent national survey of rural women commissioned by the Federal Government showed that 72 per cent of farm women do farm work. In fact, almost 70 per cent of farm wives are the farm's business managers-not a bad number. Additionally, more then 90 per cent of them do manual work on the farm, and for 5,400 farms women are the sole owners and managers. </PARA>
<PARA> For those women who have been forced to take work off the farm, the pressures have become enormous. They invariably do a day's work before they leave in the morning, often to travel a great distance over appalling roads; and at the end of the day their task is to buy the groceries or collect the children from the school before tackling the bad roads to go home again. Senator Bjelke-Petersen was saying to me only this morning that that is the place where women see the real inflation costs-when they go to buy their groceries and when they drive across the rural roads that are being neglected by this Government. This year, with the extended wet weather, of course, the roads in New South Wales are an absolute disgrace and a death trap. The Budget which was brought down last night gives no joy to people travelling on those roads. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has in recent years actually recognised that women living in rural Australia are disadvantaged. But what has it done? There have been surveys, studies and meetings, but that is all the Government has done: words and glossy brochures. Another glossy brochure came to the Senate today. When it comes to the hard cash and the real initiatives, the Government has done nothing. It has failed the women of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> A report issued by the Federal Government in February last year and titled Life has never been easy attempted to portray life for women in rural Australia. The study involved some 14,000 women across Australia, questioned with the assistance of the Country Women's Association. The dominant theme of this study was that isolation, loneliness, lack of medical services and inadequate transport and communication were the key issues. An equal number of women suggested the biggest problems facing country women were the rural crisis, the high cost of living and running a farm. They listed as priorities roads and transport. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there are other issues, such as Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport where the third runway should be put in to service the people of the rural communities. Women who send their children away to school and people who come to the country to visit women do not have a decent aeroplane service because this Government has neglected Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. </PARA>
<PARA> This report contains a litany of complaints, from rural women, mainly about telephone services-the difficulties of 21 sharing a party line; the cost of subscriber trunk dialling rates; the lack of radio and television services; and the difficulties of educating their children or themselves. The report showed that about half of rural women now work as wage or salary earners. For rural women volunteer workers are a necessary adjunct of their daily life. There is no local caterer for the clearing sales. Volunteers do it for fund-raising. Services such as meals on wheels, social workers and rape crisis centres do not exist in the country areas so rural women have to look after themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The survey was greeted with much fanfare. Of course, there is always fanfare when the Government produces bits of papers. The Government has spent its money on publishing the report but spends nothing on the implementation of its recommendations. That is where this Government stands condemned: it spends plenty on words but nothing on actually putting them into practice. </PARA>
<PARA> In March of last year the Government published another report, Overcoming distance: Isolated rural women's access to TAFE across Australia. In launching the report, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, John Kerin, said:</PARA>
<PARA>This is an important report. It contains recommendations that offer practical, cost effective solutions to overcoming the problems of isolation faced by women as well as men in country areas. While many of the problems faced by isolated women around Australia are similar, different solutions are often required. </PARA>
<PARA>They are fine words and enough to give one a great sense of expectation. A month later yet another report was issued titled A Fair Go: The Federal Government's Strategy for Rural Education and Training. It contained more fine words and led to further expectation. But this Government is still neglecting the people of rural Australia, especially the women. That is why honourable senators sitting on that side of the chamber stand condemned. </PARA>
<PARA> In a rather large document in the Budget Papers issued last night, Women's Budget Statement, at pages 23 and 24, we see more words, more reports and a notation that states:</PARA>
<PARA>A number of measures . . . will be taken within the existing policy and budgetary framework. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, despite all the reports and studies, the only funding available will have to come from some other area of education already squeezed to the limit. I say, `Big deal, big failure by the Hawke Labor Government to the women of Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA> Rural education is one area that has had a raw deal for a very long time. One needs only to talk with Mrs Helen Withers from the Isolated Children's Parents Association to realise that for rural women with children things have got progressively worse over the past six years. In 1973, for example, an isolated children's allowance of approximately half the cost of average boarding fees was paid to parents to enable them to send their children away, especially for secondary education. Today, that fee is exactly the same but is now only 20 per cent of the boarding component for education. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has neglected the people of rural Australia, especially the women. For years the Association has been trying to get tax deductability for governesses-a necessary addition to a rural family. The only alternative is to take the mother away from her outside farm duties to teach the children. Many families cannot afford a governess so the mother becomes the teacher. The children's education suffers accordingly when activities on the farm require her presence outside. There is no additional funding this year for equipment for teaching children at home; there is no assistance for travel when correspondence schools have their biannual get-togethers. In fact, one of the most common reasons that farm workers leave rural employment is lack of secondary education facilities. Again, there is nothing in this Budget for that-another failure for the women of rural Australia. The Gough Whitlam attitude-and I know that he did not care very much about the farm women-was that everyone had never had it so good, or words to that effect. That attitude is alive and well and living in the hearts and minds of those in the Labor Party today. They do not care about rural women. This Budget document-the yellow Women's Budget Statement-is evidence of that: two paragraphs full of platitudes and waffle and no substance. In fact, the Labor Party does not care about people generally, but especially the women of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The black hole of Australian poverty exists not in some run-down city ghetto or depressed industrial sector, but in the rural sector. Julian Cribb, the well-known rural writer, recently made the point that, of the 37 poorest electorates in Australia, 33 are in rural Australia. It is interesting that the Labor Party holds only 27 per cent of Australia's poorest electorates and 37 per cent of its wealthiest. That explains a great deal about why rural Australia is so neglected and so poor. The extent of rural poverty in country towns is largely hidden. It is normal for young people either to remain unemployed or to leave town to find work. Women have difficulty finding jobs in country areas, and this Government's policies of reducing country centres to ghost towns through squeezing small business is only making this situation much worse. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area that needs discussion is last night's decision on superannuation. Senator Patterson has already made remarks about this. While I applaud the Government's initiative in taking up some of the options outlined in our coalition policy which came out last year, especially in areas affecting women, it has done essentially nothing; and what it has done is not good enough. For example, the Labor Party policy enunciated last night said that a woman who is out of the work force for two years can maintain her superannuation contributions, but after that she cannot continue with her superannuation contribution. That means that after two years she is going to be forced back into the work force. I do not think that it is a good thing to be forced back into anything. Women are being discriminated against in that regard. Our policy says they can go out of the work force and they can make contributions for a lifetime. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent surveys into superannuation have found that most superannuation schemes do not appeal to women, because they depend on long and continuous service. Most working women have career breaks to have families and superannuation schemes do not cover such breaks. Our superannuation schemes will cover those breaks for those women who want to go out of the work force. If the Government is genuine about encouraging people to provide for their retirement, it ought to realise that women are a significant part of the work force. In fact, as at August 1988 there were some 2.5 million women in the work force and, of those, only 723,000-that is 28 per cent-had any kind of superannuation coverage. </PARA>
<PARA> Our superannuation policies do not discriminate against women, as the Labor Party's policies do. The Labor Party has failed the women of Australia. It has especially failed the rural women. It has taken no account of the enormous contribution they make to generating export income and the absolutely outstanding contribution they make to keeping home and family together and raising children. That is something that this Government-this Hawke Labor Government-stands condemned for. It does not care about the family; it does not care about the people who want to bring up their children in good surroundings and make sure that they have a good life ahead of themselves. It stands condemned for not caring about the women of Australia. This matter raised by Senator Newman earlier in the afternoon is something that I hope, if we were to divide on it, would be carried unanimously by this Government and this Party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance that we are debating this afternoon alleges that the Hawke Government has failed Australian women. I find this topic quite an extraordinary one to be debating in this place. A number of issues that have arisen this afternoon would have made excellent topics for the debate, and I hope that one day we will have the opportunity to go quite deeply into questions such as the relative merits of screening for breast cancer, for example. As it is, we are faced with an amazing barrage of allegations from people who are extraordinarily poorly equipped to debate the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to draw attention to the coalition's record on some of these issues. I am aware that I am dealing with history but it is quite easy to link some of these facts with what is happening today. For example, I recall very clearly the strenuous opposition from the coalition to sex discrimination legislation, to equal opportunity in the public service legislation, to affirmative action legislation-not only opposition, but filibustering and keeping us here almost until Christmas Eve on a number of occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> Okay, this is history; it happened some years ago. It is now just on five years since our sex discrimination legislation was proclaimed, and maybe we could forget what happened if it were not for the fact that we have been assured by the coalition time and time again that in government it would abolish the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Is it not relevant to today's debate that those opposite would remove the machinery whereby that legislation has been implemented? The Opposition has called for implementation. That is implementation, and it is implementation which the Australian community accepts very largely. The most recent poll I have seen on the matter showed that acceptance of sex discrimination legislation was in excess of 75 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The kindest interpretation to put on much of what we have heard this afternoon, and on other occasions, is that it has demonstrated an abysmal lack of knowledge. We have witnessed this time and time again when the coalition has raised issues concerning welfare, the structure of industry, the changing structure of women's place in the work force, and attitudinal matters. Even things that are actually under way seem somehow to escape the notice of the coalition, although they are being done very publicly. An example of this was a notice of motion on domestic violence brought before the Senate just a few weeks ago which was meant to be very embarrassing to the Government. We had no difficulty agreeing with this notice of motion because what it was calling for we were already doing. We had under way a campaign for awareness of domestic violence on which, we discovered when notes were exchanged, we could take a bipartisan position. It is a great pity that we do not see that bipartisan position taken more often, as used to be the case in the past. I must say it was very disappointing when we offered the coalition full briefing on the domestic violence issue to find that none of the Opposition women where able to attend. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems quite extraordinary that we hear from Senator Brownhill at great length about the difficulties of rural women. That is no surprise to this Government. It is no surprise to anybody in Australia. But one does wonder whether those women were having difficulties prior to 1983 or whether suddenly their isolation, loneliness, income problems and so on developed in 1983. One wonders why absolutely nothing was done about it prior to that. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, over the years there have been informed Liberal-National Party members and senators and we have had support from members of those parties on issues such as community child-care, education and work force issues. We have had absolutely splendid support from at least one of the shadow Ministers for women's affairs and Mr Macphee was gracious enough to join us in launching a document by the name of Fair Exposure. It was Senator Newman who raised the issue of non-sexist language when she poured scorn on the government Style Manual and its chapter on non-sexist language and wondered who in the name of fortune might be interested in that. I will tell Senator Newman who is interested in it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was one of the many highlights of the year. For people who deal with language and who like to use accurate language-and I might say that there are not too many on Senator Newman's side of the chamber-it was a very important event. However, we have another document that Senator Newman might be interested to find in the Liberal Party library, if in fact such a thing exists. She should have a look at Fair Exposure which, some years ago, was saying exactly the same thing, and which received total support from the shadow Minister for women's affairs. While I am talking about Mr Macphee, I would like to quote something he once told us. He said that the Liberals:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . still have the view that a woman's place is in the home and when she has children she stays there and doesn't go into the paid workforce and therefore you don't have child care and those sorts of issues, and I firmly stand for equal opportunity for women that they then paint this as being anti-family, it's not of course, but that's the way in which many of the delegates thought, the delegates themselves not having an experience of their wives or the women themselves being in the paid workforce. That was a problem, and I also found that they didn't understand even their own daughters-in-law who in fact held the same views as I did and wanted equal opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA>I think Opposition members have come a little way since then, but it is absolutely incumbent upon them to check their facts a little better than they have done on this occasion. What would happen if the Liberal Party were in power? I am just going on what we have been told over the years, not on anything very enlightening that has occurred today. We would have income-splitting-the most regressive way of treating the second income in a household. We would have regressive deductions, such as those for the costs of child-care which, of course, help those on the highest incomes and provide no extra places for low income people. We would have very little increase in the number of available child-care places as a result except, of course, from the private sector which has no obligation to provide child-care in the areas where it is most needed. It has no obligation to provide child-care for tiny children below the age of two or for those with special needs. What would happen to things like women's refuges, women's health care houses, the Child Support Agency that we have established, the family allowance supplements? We have gone through these things this afternoon. Would we go back to the federalism which put a stopper on any advance in any of those services during the years of the Fraser Government?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Maybe Senator Newman should have had a look outside that one shelter to what is happening in a number of other States and should take a more visionary approach than the one she appears to be taking. Let us consider women's employment. Senator Newman seems to be very worried about the motivation of women who work. Let us have a look at employment growth. I am sure that Senator Newman knows this, but since 1983, the women's employment rate has grown by over 5 per cent, the participation rate of women in the labour force aged 15 and over has grown by almost 7 per cent, the women's unemployment rate has fallen by four percentage points and the unemployment rate for young women has fallen by 10 percentage points-from over 27.5 per cent to 17.5 per cent. Is the Opposition suggesting that reducing unemployment for women-in other words, a growing economy, which gives people the opportunities to have money in their purses when they open them-is failing women?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I notice that the Opposition has been terribly keen lately to go into the reasons why women join the work force. It is very interesting. The Opposition was not too worried about the fact that when it was in government almost 30 per cent of young women were unemployed. Now it is a matter of national concern that some women may work to help to pay for their home. There is nothing new in that. Women in low income families have always had to work. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XG4">Senator GILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not skiting about that; it is absolutely true. Senator Newman's comment about women who feel they have been conscripted into the work force is very interesting to me. She gives no source for those figures. I wonder whether the question was asked: How many men feel they are conscripted into the work force. Why should there be any difference? I am aware of a report called Beyond the Stereotypes which was done by Clemenger and Associates. I am sure Senator Newman would find it extremely interesting. It is still available and there is a copy in my office if she would like to borrow it. It surveyed large numbers of women in all age groups-those in the home, those in the work force, those who had worked, those who were wanting to work, those who did not want to work and certainly those with small children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was discovered that the vast majority of Australian women would dearly love to be in the work force for the very same reason that men would dearly love to be in the work force-for luxuries like food, clothing and paying the rent. For women the question of whether to enter paid work is determined by many factors: their age, marital status, family and domestic responsibilities, the availability of child-care, their education and skills and the level of wages. Equally important is the availability of jobs, both full time and part time. The whole issue of jobs, the quality of jobs, the availability of a wide range of training opportunities, the availability of opportunities to progress through the work force is one of the extremely important features of the work that we have been doing for women in the work force over the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industrial Relations Commission in its May review of the structural adjustment principle under the wage fixing guidelines referred employers and employees to statements forming an important element of restructuring awards in Australia. I am referring here to statements made at a tripartite conference on legislative and award restrictions to women's employment which was held just recently here in Canberra. Is it failing young women actually to provide in low income families an amount of money which will allow them to stay at school rather than leave school and go onto unemployment benefit? Austudy has been one of the greatest reforms of this Government. I think if I were looking for one reform that is going to have long lasting effects for women, it might be encouraging young people to stay in the education system. </PARA>
<PARA> When we came into office the retention of girls to year 12 was around 44 per cent. It is now almost 62 per cent-a rise of about 18 per cent in six years. It means that a vast number of young women are now leaving school with a range of skills and a real chance of making their way in the world. In higher education women's participation has shown a similar pattern of growth-up from around 44 per cent to almost 51.5 per cent of enrolments. Women now recognise that it is worthwhile to invest in their own education because they see the opportunities are there through award restructuring and affirmative action. Discrimination is being removed through the legislation that we introduced and that many honourable senators opposite opposed. Their employment prospects are brighter because this Government has tackled the essential support structures such as child-care. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to a matter that I referred to a little earlier-screening for breast cancer. Reference was made to a National Health and Medical Research Council report which advocated widespread screening for women. That is still a very problematic issue. There is not a great deal of agreement about whether wide screening, as expensive as it is and subjecting people to doses of X-rays as it does, is the best way to go or that it is even very effective. There are international studies that show it is not necessarily very effective. I think in the meantime Senator Newman and I, and probably every public spirited woman, should be encouraging women to self-examine their breasts, to be conscious of the risks they face. I just have this feeling that it is as pointless to screen every woman in the community for breast cancer as it would be to screen every male in the community for enlarged prostate glands. Just as many men die from cancer of the prostate as women do of breast cancer. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This report for the calendar year 1988 covers the twenty-first year of operation of the Canberra College of Advanced Education (CCAE). As is well known, the college was established and a large number of colleges of advanced education (CAEs) were developed in this country as a result of the report of the Martin Committee on the Future of Tertiary Education in Australia. The binary system is at an end and we now have one system of higher education institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> This year, 1988, in many ways marks the end of an era for the CCAE, which now has to consider new options for the future. In another sense, this is a particularly important transition year in that the present Government, wanting to set the pace for amalgamation of higher education institutions, introduced legislation into the Senate to facilitate the amalgamation of the Australian National University and the CCAE. This was proposed by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) with inadequate consultation with those two important higher education institutions in this city of Canberra. The legislation has not proceeded because it is the view of the Opposition and the Australian Democrats that it does not have sound educational foundations, that it has many extra costs and, indeed, that it may well compromise the particular missions of the two institutions as they now exist. </PARA>
<PARA> At this juncture, the mission of the Canberra College of Advanced Education is well recognised, at least by the Opposition, as something that should be retained. It should not be lost by the college aping a university in the sense of pure research or in the sense of a greater emphasis upon research than on teaching. Rather, the college should remain true to its 20-year established record of serving, as a priority, the people of Canberra and this region. It should cater for the applied needs of a wide number of professions in a way which is now distinctly seen as being specific to colleges rather than to universities. It is important that the end of the binary system should not lead to a bureaucratic bar on some applied areas of higher education, including the full involvement in research and postgraduate degrees. There is direct reference in the report before us to these matters taking up a great deal of the college's time. On page 6 there is an important reference to the amalgamation procedure. The report clearly states:</PARA>
<PARA>The College Council expressed to the Minister-</PARA>
<PARA>Minister Dawkins-</PARA>
<PARA>its preference for the College to remain a separate institution. Despite this preference, Council agreed that the College should enter negotiations with the ANU and CITA over the terms on which the proposed merger might take place. </PARA>
<PARA>I note that another development is the report by the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly on the CAE and higher education generally. I note three of the findings of the report: namely, that the merger not proceed, that the CCAE be under the care of the ACT government and that it be redesignated a university as soon as possible. These are views that I expressed a year ago in this chamber. I note that and I note that these findings bear upon the institution directly, so it may well be that in a year's time when we see the annual report there will be developments in this direction. I wish the college well and acknowledge the substance of the report before the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are considering the Council report of 1988 of the Canberra College of Advanced Education (CCAE). As Senator Teague has mentioned, 1988 was the college's twentieth year and, as has been mentioned, the question of amalgamation was referred to in the report. It has been a fairly dramatic year for the college, I would suggest, in view of the things it had to face with the Federal Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) hell bent, one might almost say, on forcing amalgamations and in particular using those in which he was involved specifically for the purpose of doing so. He seemed to ignore the fact that other institutions around the country rejected the concept of merger. He certainly seemed to ignore the views of both the institutions in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). Only recently has he backed away from the merger in face of the criticism of a number of people in this Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian National University (ANU) and the CCAE are both tertiary institutions and they serve very different purposes. The CCAE has an excellent reputation. Anybody reading the report will be impressed by the college's range of activities and what it has achieved, providing courses for people in the ACT, the surrounding region and others who come here. It fills a vital role. Many people were concerned that what was happening would have amounted to a takeover by the ANU whereby the unique characteristics of the CCAE would be lost. I do not think that the ANU had such aspirations, but that was an aspect of the concern. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter has now been discussed by the ACT Legislative Assembly. It has reported and has recommended what should occur. It has recommended that the Commonwealth Government transfer the CCAE to the ACT Government with funding under the existing arrangements. It says that, whatever its eventual status, the CCAE should be established under ACT legislation as a university as soon as possible. It dealt with a number of other matters which, hopefully, will be considered by the Federal Minister. It is hoped that he will take some note of the report and the matters that have been discussed in it. It seems clear to me that any amalgamation ought to be deferred and looked at from the point of view of this report and the other views that have been presented. The earlier report that he commissioned dealt merely with how it would be done. I have never seen any evidence from the Minister that it was going to be good for students or anybody. It was merely to satisfy his whim that this, in fact, should be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been discussions, I understand, between the CCAE and Monash University for a sponsorship relationship to exist between the two. Many courses overlap between them and there seems to be considerable merit in looking at that aspect of the development. The CCAE has considerable strength in Asian languages which could also be a boon to Monash's languages institute. There are other ways of looking at working together than the blind amalgamation path that the Minister would have these institutions tread. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the matter will be looked at differently. The one thing of which we must be quite certain is retaining the CCAE's unique status. It has certainly been a baptism of fire for Professor Roger Scott who took over the position of Principal only at the beginning of last year. He has certainly seen turbulent times since then, but I believe that the institution is still-as is indicated in the report-flourishing. It would be my wish that it continue to do so and that no changes be made which would interfere with that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commence by congratulating the Principal of Canberra College of Advanced Education (CCAE), Roger Scott, and the others associated with the institution on another very successful year. In that context, it gives me great pleasure to join with those who have spoken to the report of the Canberra College of Advanced Education. This year has been very significant for two reasons. Obviously, there has been the discussion on amalgamation and I will refer to that subsequently. But, firstly, this has been the year of transition to self-government in the Australian Capital Territory and this has put new pressures on the tertiary institutions in the Territory and in particular on the CCAE which has, as is stated on page six of the report, seen its primary orientation as a higher education institution serving the Australian Capital Territory and the region. That particular focus has meant that its integration with the rest of the education institutions in Canberra and in the surrounding region is very important. It has always had a very sensible and progressive relationship with the technical and further education sector here and I welcome the fact that Roger Scott has joined the Australian Capital Territory Education and Training Council. He was an active member of the Australian Capital Territory Administration coordination committee in the days before self-government. The Council supported that because it was an important part of confirming that orientation, that regional direction, which is important not only for the CCAE, but also for the region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But this has also been a year in which the CCAE has been moving towards university status. I am not so concerned at the moment to debate how it makes that move, but it is important that it does make it. It cannot be left on the shelf as the only college of advanced education. Which route it takes to university status is a secondary question. For me, it is a matter for the institution itself to sort out, but I was concerned that it should not be forced down a particular route. I therefore welcome the Minister's assurance given to the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) and me that that will not be the case and the developments in relation to Monash are important in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> It is inevitable that there will be closer links between the CCAE under whatever name it subsequently operates and the ANU. They must work more closely together. The integration needs to be substantially enhanced. The engineering situation-I almost said fiasco, but will not-has been the prime example of the need for better coordination. But that brings me to the question of the very successful development that has taken place at the CCAE this year in the emphasis in engineering. It has made a planning decision to provide for growth in the areas of nursing and engineering in its educational profile. I think that is a very appropriate decision. It is suitable to the educational needs of the region. It is fitting into a niche that is required and I am very pleased that the Federal Government provided funds to the college for an information, sciences and engineering building and that in the draft Australian Capital Territory Budget for 1989 there is a proposal for a major new nursing education building, consistent with the priorities of the college itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area I want to refer to gets away from the more controversial and big issues of the year concerning self-government and the move towards the university. I comment on, and support, a development going on at the college with regard to the development of cultural heritage management and cultural heritage studies. It is something which the CCAE does almost uniquely and, in some ways, almost uniquely in the world. It is a very important contribution to the preservation of our Aboriginal heritage and it is very important that, whatever form of subsequent educational institution the college becomes, it retains the right and capacity to do that. It receives international funding recognising the unique contribution it makes in the study of the preservation of rock art and it does outstanding work in other areas. In concluding and in congratulating, as I did at the commencement of my speech, Roger Scott and the others, I want to make particular reference to Dr Galla, the lecturer in the cultural heritage management courses. They make a substantial contribution to Canberra and the region but, more broadly, to Australia and to the preservation of indigenous cultures throughout the world. I congratulate the college on that innovative contribution and on the centre which it recently opened to enhance that development. I look forward to commenting as positively on the further development of that and the nursing and engineering initiatives at the CCAE when discussing next year's report. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I rise to speak to the final report in the series Residents' Rights in Nursing Homes And Hostels. The principles on which this report are based are set out at the front of the report and include the principle that every resident of a nursing home or a hostel has a right to be treated as an individual. Other principles relate to information being available to the residents, to their having a sense of involvement, and to their rights not being reduced by their capacity to exercise those rights but to have those rights exercised for them.</PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia concern is being expressed by many people about the lack of involvement of patients in various hospitals and nursing homes in decisions which are being made on their behalf. I certainly believe that, if the proposed charter were to be implemented as set out in this report, many of those patients' rights would be addressed. In fact, in Western Australia a health watch group has been set up because of people's concern. This health watch group has set itself up to actually survey what is going on in hospitals and nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to draw the Senate's attention to certain of the clauses in the proposed charter. The second clause states:</PARA>
<PARA> The charter shall provide that all residents have . . . </PARA>
<PARA>   (ii)the right to maintain personal independence, personal choice and personal responsibility for all actions, including a recognition that some actions may involve an element of risk which the resident accepts and which should not be used to prevent or restrict those actions;</PARA>
<PARA>The health watch group has discovered that in some homes for the aged harnesses are being used against the wishes of the patients and against the wishes of the relatives of those patients. I regard that as something that needs looking into. Perhaps more seriously, clause (xi) states, in part:</PARA>
<PARA>the right to be treated with dignity and respect</PARA>
<PARA>It has also been brought to my attention, through the health watch group, that a very disturbing event is happening in some of our homes for the aged, C class hospitals and nursing homes. We have three completely independent reports from three different hospitals of what is happening. We are finding that some older patients are being given a drug called melleril, which is a tranquilliser. One of the side effects of this drug is incontinence. These people are having their underclothes removed, are being placed in short gowns, and are being seated on padded cushions as a result of the incontinence caused by this drug. In fact, one constituent has related how his 89-year-old mother, who while being cared for at home needed no medication whatsoever, when placed in a C class hospital in order to give some respite to the carers was given the drug melleril, with the effect which I have just mentioned. When she was placed back at home, of course, the incontinence disappeared as she was no longer on the drug. I believe that this is not a situation which can be supported by our society. I would, therefore, with all caution, refer also to clause (xix) of the charter, which says that the residents should have:</PARA>
<PARA>the responsibility for their own health, as far as is possible, and to undertake all prescribed medical treatment . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I think we need to qualify that with a mention of informed consent with regard to that sort of treatment, either by the patient or by the patient's advocate. This chamber may well soon be discussing the rights of the unborn, so surely we must place top priority on the rights of the living. I certainly commend this report and would hope that there would be full and open discussion on the proposed charter of the rights and responsibilities of residents in nursing homes. I would like to mention just briefly a report in today's West Australian that there has now been published a long-awaited report into patient abuse at Graylands Hospital which confirmed that mistreatment of patients by nurses had occurred. </PARA>

<PARA>The problem with the annual report of the Trustees of the Canberra Public Cemeteries for the year ended June of last year is that it is being presented to the Senate in August of this year. Quite frankly, there has to be a little more life in the office of the trustees-a little more effort in getting this kind of report, which involves the spending of public money and a considerable subsidy from this Government, before this Parliament. It is unreasonable, I suppose, to criticise the Chairman of the trustees because, according to this report, they sent the letter covering the report to the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, Mr Holding, on 20 December 1988. Unless it got lost in some dead letter office, it has apparently languished in his Department, the Government showing its usual contempt for this chamber by not bothering to table the report in the hope that no-one will know or care about the spending of Government money. The Auditor-General's report was dated 16 December 1988. There is no sound reason why there should have been any delay whatsoever in providing the Senate with full information. I draw the Senate's attention to this as yet another example of the contempt with which this Government treats this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The annual report of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Building Standards Committee is yet another of those very delayed papers representing incompetence by this Government. In relation to the ACT Administration Office of City Management, section 26A of the Building Ordinance of 1972 states that the Building Standards Committee shall, as soon as practicable after the end of each financial year, prepare and furnish to the Minister a report of the operations of the Committee during that year. `As soon as practicable' is an interesting concept when the year ended on 30 June last and now, in August of the following year, the Government eventually gets around to tabling the report. It is the Government's fault because this report was submitted to it on 20 December 1988. It is, as I say, another example of Government incompetence or of the Government treating this chamber with contempt. </PARA>
<PARA> A matter of some concern is omitted from this report. There may be a sound reason. It relates to the failure of the Silverton Centre in this city to be of a sufficient standard to be capable of safe occupancy. In fact, this centre has been vacant since February because of major structural faults. That has involved the Commonwealth in enormous expenditure. One department alone, which was occupying the centre on a tenancy basis, has been obliged to spend $170,000 simply to relocate its computer. As reported in yesterday's Canberra Times, there are strong suggestions from the union movement that it is pretty uneasy about any suggestions that the building could be reoccupied even after structural improvements were made because it is not confident that those improvements will render it safe. This is despite the fact that last month the building's owners, the Commonwealth Bank, said that it could be repaired, that remedial work was due to start soon and that the building was expected to be ready for reoccupation early next year. </PARA>
<PARA> My concern is this: how effective is the Australian building code if this kind of structural mishap can take place-a mishap costing hundreds of thousands of dollars to Commonwealth departments apart from whatever costs were incurred by private sector occupants? No doubt the question of negligence will get thrashed out in the courts sooner or later. But we have here in the ACT an ordinance requiring safety in the construction of buildings. Yet this building-a brand new, modern building-has been found to be structurally unsound. </PARA>
<PARA> What were the inspectors appointed for the purpose, and presumably paid by this Government, doing when this building was being put up? How were the certificates of its safety obtained? In view of the enormous cost carried at this stage by the taxpayers of Australia resulting from the failure of this building to have been safely built, I believe the Government has an obligation to let this chamber know what it is all about. It is disappointing in those circumstances that this annual report of the Building Standards Committee makes no mention of the Silverton problem. </PARA>
<PARA> It may well be that this report at last coming before us covers a period so long ago that there was no evidence at the time that the Silverton building was in fact structurally unsound. But that is another example or another instance of why it is ludicrous for this Government to keep presenting these reports so late that they do not even cover a matter of enormous significance relating to building standards in the ACT-building standards that have been shown to be grossly inadequate and which have put many lives at risk because a report has said that this building could in fact have collapsed at any stage. </PARA>

<PARA> The point I want to make is that it is evident from this report that the Senate and senators are receiving a particularly unfair deal from this Government in that their staff are obliged to come to Canberra and to live away from home on about 41 per cent more occasions than the House of Representatives staff are required to and yet there are no arrangements of a permanent or reasonable nature made to compensate those staff members for coming to Canberra to work. In the last financial year the House of Representatives, according to this report, sat for 63 days, the Senate for 89 days. This is obviously because we are a much more thorough House and are not under the control of the Government. The gag cannot operate to rush through vitally important legislation as this Government has consistently done in the House of Representatives. It is significant, I think, that the Senate has given far greater scrutiny to the legislation coming before it, has, in fact, amended and rejected a lot of inadequate legislation and has sat for 41 per cent more time in the latest financial year than has the House of Representatives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commenced my remarks on this report yesterday and some of the things I wanted to say I said then, so I will confine my remarks more than I would otherwise have done today. There is a great deal that can and should be said about the fourth report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which deals with the funding of political advertising during election campaigns and with the disclosure by political parties and third parties of income and expenditure for ongoing or maintenance activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The time for debate today is extremely limited, so let me just touch briefly on what I see as the real motivation behind the recommendations of the majority of the Committee, that is, essentially the Australian Labor Party members of the Committee and the Australian Democrats member, Senator Jenkins. As the Senate now knows, the Committee was deeply divided on its report. The three coalition members of the Committee, Dr Wooldridge, Mr Cobb and I, prepared a dissenting report which is to be found on pages 115 to 134 of the document-a dissenting report that I commend all members of the Senate and the wider community to read because we are talking about a report, the majority findings of which pose very real threats to the whole of our political and democratic system. </PARA>
<PARA> The three Liberal and National Party members totally rejected all the content and recommendations of the majority report. Those majority recommendations-there were 14 of them-to me boiled down to the following main proposals: first, that in future there should be no paid advertising on radio or television by any political party or interested organisation or individual during an election campaign; secondly, instead existing political parties should be provided with free time by the commercial radio and television stations on a rigidly controlled formula basis; thirdly, new political parties would be permitted to receive free advertising only if they not only contested Senate seats but also contested more than 50 per cent of the seats in at least the State in which they operate; fourthly, no other organisation or individual would be allowed legally to advertise at all on radio or television any matter even vaguely relevant to the issues of an election; and fifthly, political parties would be forced to disclose publicly all sources of income and expenditure for their ongoing day to day operations in addition to the existing provisions for public disclosure of revenue and expenditure for election purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> These recommendations are arguably the most anti-democratic recommendations ever put to any parliament in Australia by any parliamentary committee. They constitute a massive form of censorship on a scale and of a nature that we could never have envisaged possible in this great and free democratic nation. They make it virtually impossible for new political parties to receive advertising coverage on radio or television during election campaigns. What is even more draconian and totalitarian is that they would legally prohibit legitimate interest groups in our community from getting their views across on radio or television during election campaigns. For instance, the Australian Conservation Foundation would legally be prohibited from advertising its views on the environment. The National Farmers Federation would be legally prohibited from advertising its view on such issues as rural issues, economic management, interest rates, or the like. The Australian Council of Social Service would not be permitted to advertise its view on behalf of its social service clients. The Australian Automobile Association would be prohibited from advertising its view on road funding, and so on. The ban would apply to each and every interest group in our community. Freedom of choice for political parties and for legitimate interest groups would be dealt a death blow. </PARA>
<PARA> There is much more that could be said about these big brother, Orwellian, anti-democratic, and totalitarian proposals. Briefly, they are also discriminatory. They put all the cost of political advertising into commercial radio and television stations. Why should they have to bear the cost? Why should not political parties, if they want to advertise, pay for their own advertising?</PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations are illogical. For example, they do not include print media advertising. The only reason why they do not include that is that the Federal Government does not have the power in this area. Indeed, even the radio and television advertising recommendations are relying on the Broadcasting Act, not on the Electoral Act, as they should. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposals in respect of public disclosure might superficially be thought to have some higher and principled purpose, but that is not so either, because the only real effect of those proposals is to massively advantage the Labor Party. Under these proposals, for all practical purposes, the millions of dollars that are poured into the coffers of the Australian Labor Party from the trade unions would not be affected at all. This is because everyone knows of the compulsory trade union contribution to its political wing, the Australian Labor Party. It is an historic association; it is a formal association; it is something that everybody knows about. But not once in the majority report are trade union contributions to the Labor Party even acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA> Taken as a whole, the recommendations of the majority report are nothing more than a blatant attempt to gain massive political electoral advantage at the next and following elections, and the Senate should note in that respect that all the recommendations will apply equally to State elections and to Federal elections. There again, the Committee, without any comment on it at all, blandly moves its way into the whole area of fundamental Federal-State relationships and the constitutional and other issues that that involves. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations, which were supported neither by the evidence presented to the Committee nor by reasonable analysis, amount to no more than a ringing endorsement of the Labor Party's own formal submission to the Committee's inquiry. The crude, naked politics behind the majority recommendations of Labor members of the Committee were supplemented yesterday by the introduction of another transparently political document, namely, the Budget-a Budget which completely ignored the fundamental problems facing the nation, which complacently accepted our dangerously uncompetitive inflation rate, our crippling level of interest rates and our horrendous $130 billion overseas debt, and which even accepted a larger balance of payments deficit for 1989-90 than the $17 1/2 billion deficit of 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been the Deputy Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and I am very pleased about and proud of that. That Committee and its predecessor, the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform, have done a great deal of very useful work over the last five or six years. What I very greatly regret is that in the preparation of this report we have seen the blatantly naked party political approach to very important issues that I believe does the Committee a disservice, the Parliament a disservice and the Australian Labor Party itself a disservice. </PARA>
<PARA> But the important thing is to recognise the recommendations for what they are-a blatant political attempt at grandstanding, and the introduction into this country in the area of political advertising of an anti-democratic totalitarian set of proposals that I would never have believed it possible to see introduced into this Parliament. </PARA>

I have not heard one person explain to me what is the difference at the moment. There is censorship on paid broadcast on television and radio. The definition of the censorship is, `do you have access to large amounts of money?'. By 1990 it is estimated that on Sydney television it will cost $10,000 per 60 seconds. There are very few organisations in this country that have access to the large amounts of money needed to buy that sort of advertising. If democracy in this country is to be based upon the ability of people to buy advertising, and that alone, we will have a problem in the long term with the operation of democracy as we know it. Democracy does not represent money; it represents people and ideas. What we have with paid television and broadcasting in the way it is operating at the moment is a selection process based on one's access to money. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen what this is doing to political parties. We had the extraordinary evidence given by Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen to the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct that people used to go into his office and leave brown paper bags full of money on his desk but he could not remember who they were or how much money was involved. He just used to take it and put it into the Bjelke-Petersen fund. What was that fund used for? It was used overwhelmingly to pay for television and radio advertisements for the National Party of Australia at recent elections. It is estimated that the National Party's expenditure in the last week of the 1986 Queensland State election campaign was in excess of $1m and that went overwhelmingly on television advertising. It has been said that in the last three or four days of the television campaign most of the money was spent on buying every available election spot on commercial television in Brisbane to get the National Party over the line to maintain its absolute majority, still with 39 per cent of the vote. We have the evidence, the clear admission by the former National Party leader and Premier in Queensland, that people used to leave brown paper bags full of money on his desk or in his office, but he could not remember who they were. We all know the purpose for which the money was needed. If there was no paid advertising during an election campaign, the need for even the National Party in Queensland, as corrupt as it is, to go and solicit large donations from people it wishes to forget would not be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent days evidence has been given to the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales that both parties, the Labor Party and the National Party, have received donations from land developers in northern New South Wales. There was the extraordinary evidence of the Deputy Premier of New South Wales that it was just a coincidence that on or about the day he signed the approval for a development in northern New South Wales a cheque from the developers turned up in the National Party office. But there was also evidence from the Labor Party that it had received donations from the same developer. The only motivating factor for the parties to receive those donations was the extraordinary expense of election campaigns in Australia, and in particular New South Wales, to buy television advertising. They needed the money so they took decisions that most of us would probably disagree with if we did not have the pressure of raising the money to pay for an election campaign. I would like to know who is contributing the million dollars for the present paid advertising campaign on television by the Liberal Party as part of its mock election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> It comes down to a question of whether we want democracy in this country based upon our ability to raise large amounts of money from whatever source it can be had or whether we are to have democracy based on ideas and the representation of people. This report illustrates clearly the dangers to our democratic system by the power of money. I have never seen any definition of democracy that says that money is basis of democracy. My colleague Senator Puplick, a small `l' Liberal, has written much about small `l' liberalism and has written books. I have read some of those books and I cannot remember him describing money as being the basis of democracy or how one gets representation in parliament. We have a major problem and it will get worse unless some action is taken. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also states that the system has to operate for State elections, there has to be full disclosure by all political parties at all times and there can be spot audits by the Australian Electoral Commission. Of course the National Party in Queensland-even the Liberal Party-is totally opposed to that. It does not want the people who turn up with brown paper bags full of money to be exposed because it would probably be very embarrassing to it. However, I think that in a democracy such as the one on which we pride ourselves in this country, the community has the right to know who contributes to political parties. As the title of the report says, `Who pays the piper calls the tune'. That has been said about the trade union movement in terms of its donations. People opposite do not realise that every donation from a trade union to the Labor Party, whether it is for administrative purposes or for elections, is publicly declared in the annual accounts of that union lodged with the Industrial Commission in each of the States or at the Federal level. If one gets the annual accounts, one will see listed how much was contributed to the Labor Party. If the honourable senators opposite are so keen about this, why can we not see them putting up a proposal that every publicly listed company that makes a donation to the Labor Party, the Liberal Party or the National Party will be required to divulge in its annual report whom it gave its money to?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report which has now been brought forward by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters is illustrative of two important trends that are taking place in the political arena at the moment. It is typical of a government and its allies in a group like the Australian Democrats, when they perceive some electoral threat-particularly when the Democrats perceive some electoral threat-that the first thing they try to do is to corrupt the electoral system. This is precisely what this report attempts to do-to corrupt the Australian electoral system. Nobody had adduced the slightest degree of evidence that, in terms of the Federal elections which have taken place in this country since Federation, money or other influence has corrupted the political process. Nobody has adduced any evidence which relates to that particular allegation. Nor can they, because the evidence is not there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a couple of things which I wanted to start talking about in relation to comments made by Mr Lee, the honourable member for Dobell and Chairman of this Committee. In the statement which he produced and which was released together with the report, he says this:</PARA>
<PARA>The majority of the committee believes that if nothing is done political parties will become increasingly dependent on large donations from companies and wealthy individuals. </PARA>
<PARA>You will note, Mr Acting Deputy President, that he does not include in that trade unions. He does not include in that the question of disclosure but the question of increasing dependence upon particular sources of funds. And he identifies companies and wealthy individuals. It is clear from that statement that that is what this report is all about-identifying particular people and particular companies for the Labor Party's and the Democrats' political purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Schacht says that secrecy is incompatible with democracy. I presume that he does not extend the same argument to the secrecy of the ballot, because it used to be argued that the secrecy of the ballot was one of the things which corrupted the democratic process. Senator Schacht does not argue that, presumably. He argues that secrecy corrupts the political process. He says that, if an individual, an ordinary Australian citizen, wishes to make a donation of, say, $20 to a political party, that should be public information, that the privacy of that individual should be raped by the political connivance of the Labor Party and the Democrats, and that that particular person and private donation by an individual of a small sum of money should be made a matter of public concern, presumably so that people can say, `We see that you were a donor to Party X. How about becoming a donor to Party Y? And do you understand the consequences if you do not?'. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the other proposition in this report about the gagging of particular groups from advertising during election periods. Again, I quote from comments of Mr Lee, the Chairman of the Committee. An article in the Australian on 8 August, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Lee agreed these recommendations would have the effect of `gagging' lobby groups, for example conservationists or farmers, from political advertising during election campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA>And, as Ross Dunn said in the Australian Financial Review on the same date:</PARA>
<PARA> This provision is likely to greatly discriminate against green independent candidates who are expected to contest spots for the Senate, riding the new wave of concern for the environment. </PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, is the particular reason that the limpet fish of the Australian Democrats want to introduce this particular gag. They have seen the results in Tasmania, they have seen the results in the Australian Capital Territory where they cannot get themselves above one or 2 per cent, where they are having their constituency stolen from them by the Australian Conservation Foundation, by Green Independents, by Senator Vallentine, by Senator Dunn and all of the others. This party with a case of terminal electoral misfortunes visited upon it has decided, now that it is an established part of the system and now that it is particularly concerned about being in a terminal political position, that in terms of keeping the bastards honest, what it now wants to do is make sure that the bastards that are stealing its constituency will not be able to have access to advertising on the electronic media during critical periods of an election campaign. That is what the agenda of the Australian Democrats is all about. That is the particular concern of the Democrats in this report. </PARA>
<PARA> The sheer nonsense of the recommendations about enforced advertising on particular stations or in the electronic media is exposed if one reads the evidence that was given to the Committee. Page 65 of the Committee's report deals with specialisation in radio markets. What will it mean to those specialist market sectors in the Australian radio industry to be forced to take political advertising without wanting to? One can imagine what a station like 2JJJ in Sydney will think about the fact that all of a sudden it is required under the Labor Party and Democrat proposals to start running political advertising. Presumably, the audience listening to 2JJJ will be absolutely riveted by the sort of advertisements that it is likely to get, and yet the capacity of that radio station to make its determination about what advertising it takes or does not take is typical of the way in which the Labor Party seeks to enforce on a sector of the mass media in this country its own political agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> You will note, Mr Acting Deputy President, that what the Labor Party and Democrats do not go on to say is that this should be required in the print media. They have the capacity to do that. It is not a matter of constitutional requirement, but a matter of saying that newspapers shall not fail to take advertisements submitted to them in a particular fashion by the political parties in the same way as the electronic media will have to take them. They could have gone that far. They have not. They have decided to concentrate this impost on one particular sector and it is simply an indication not of their concern about matters of principle but the extent to which they have determined that their political agenda is best served by the corruption of the political process and by the corruption, because that is what this amounts to, of a political system which has demonstrably served this community and this Parliament extremely well for a prolonged period of time. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, in fact, if one reads the evidence, nothing which would lead one to the conclusions that the Committee has reached. That is not surprising because those conclusions were predetermined well before the evidence was bothered to be called for. It is a good Alice in Wonderland type of situation, and one can see the various Queens of Hearts who are in charge of this particular exercise. It was a matter of the verdict first and then the trial. That is precisely what has occurred with this report; it was always predetermined that it was going to come out in that fashion. This report, and the comments of its Chairman after its publication, specifically indicate the extent to which they think the trade unions ought to be excluded from this particular process. They indicate the way in which the privacy of individuals should be traduced in this process and the transfer of the costs of this, in effect from the political parties to the public purse, because the consumers at the end of the day will pay for the shortfall in revenue in the broadcasting sector. The report is just typical of the agenda which corrupt political parties like the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats would seek to put into the electoral system. </PARA>

The worst interpretation is that Opposition members have something to hide like their National Party colleagues in Queensland or New South Wales. No amount of hyperbole can mask the fact that there is a problem and not facing this problem does not assist the process of democracy in any way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To talk of corruption in what we are proposing here and to deny the obvious corruption that has happened all round the Opposition, particularly in Senator Puplick's own State of New South Wales but also in Queensland, is to be two-faced in the extreme. There are numerous examples of abuses which herald possible directions for this so-called democracy which Senator Puplick refers to here-this democracy that he seems to believe is so free of abuse-there are international examples from Watergate to the Recruit scandal in Japan. </PARA>
<PARA> But closer to home, of course, the report of the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct with its litany of abuses is beautiful, although very disquieting, reading. I will give a few examples of some of the things that are mentioned by Mr Fitzgerald: he talks of the Citra donations in relation to the Bundaberg Hospital and the Citra and Electric Power Transmission donations which happen to link up very closely with the contracts that were let for the electrification of the railways in Queensland. There was Joh's personal slush fund, the Kaldeal business. The funds went into the campaign that Joh was running to get into Federal Parliament. Despite the many large brown paper bags of money that went into it, it did not amount to enough to get him here. </PARA>
<PARA> There was the Asian businessman who gave very large donations-again, in a very secret way, in cash and in brown paper bags. There were the many unknown donors who are mentioned who, again, gave their donations in brown paper bags and sometimes in six figure sums; there was the alleged selling of knighthoods and the links that are made between the funds that were given to the National Party's campaign and the very closely juxtaposed granting of knighthoods. To pretend that there is no corruption in Australian politics while these sorts of things are going on or to turn to the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) in New South Wales and the sorts of things that are going on there, is simply burying one's head in the sand. Alternatively, the Opposition has something to hide; it does not want to let loose the sorts of things that have been let loose by the ICAC reports and also by the Fitzgerald report. The pressure is already there-from the exponential increases in costs which have occurred, particularly in television, which is where the bulk of the problem lies to the consequential increased dependence on corporate donations. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Schacht has already referred to the fact that for the next election it is estimated that a 60-second spot in prime time in Sydney will cost $10,000, it already costs around $9,000. That is the worst case but there are very good examples of similar costs in every other State, although not quite to the same degree. Between 1984 and 1987 television and radio costs, mainly as a result of the television component, rose by 137 per cent while public funding, which is related to the consumer price index, rose by only 31.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The juxtaposition of those exponentially increasing costs with the arithmetically increasing capacity of political parties to raise funds is going to present a problem. It has already presented a problem in Queensland and New South Wales that we are aware of in the Australian context, but it has presented problems in many other countries, which they have acted on. In some cases they have reacted in direct response to scandals. Watergate is a classic example. The legislation that was brought in in the United States limiting the way that political campaigners can raise their funds was introduced as a direct result of Watergate. There is no doubt that in Japan, as a result of the Recruit scandal, similar legislation already being talked about there will be introduced also. Other countries have brought in legislation of a similar sort anticipating the problem that they think will face their political parties as costs run ahead of the ability of political parties to raise funds.</PARA>
<PARA> It is ridiculous to say, as Senator Short did, that the union movement is not mentioned in the report-it is. It is however ridiculous to compare the scale of union donations to the Australian Labor Party with the scale of corporate donations to all political parties, and it is also ridiculous to compare the nature of those contributions. Firstly, as Senator Schacht has already pointed out, they are disclosed not only because of Federal legislation or legislation in New South Wales which demands disclosure of political donations over a certain figure but also in the accounts of those unions, which have to go to the members. Believe me, the donations are not large, and they are going down as a proportion of the total amount of funds raised. </PARA>
<PARA> I spent six years as State Secretary of the Labor Party in Western Australia and am currently its Vice-President at the national level. I have been involved in numerous campaigns. I have been in fund raising drives. I have actually had to give back donations that have been given to us on the grounds that there were strings attached. I know that numbers of other people do not do that, and the Queensland situation is ample testimony to that. But, importantly, I learnt from that that the union movement's contributions as a proportion of total contributions, even with the Labor Party, are going down because unions simply are not able to afford the sorts of contributions that are necessary to keep pace with the exponentially increasing costs that I have already talked about, particularly in television. </PARA>
<PARA> Page 40 of the report lists a number of countries which demonstrates that there is nothing unusual, nothing draconian in our proposals. Some of the hyperbole that has been used in this debate amazes me-`draconian', `totalitarian', `Orwellian', `anti-democratic'. I have already heard Senator Schacht refer to Mrs Thatcher and the situation that pervades in the United Kingdom, where no political advertising is allowed at all. Page 40 of the report lists 19 countries. Only two-the United States of America and Norway-do not provide some sort of free time for a start, but many ban political advertising altogether. Some of them ban political advertising for the total period, not just the period of the election campaign between the issue of the writs and election day. So there is nothing unusual about the Committee's proposals. It is very common overseas. It is common overseas because it is a recognised problem. Those countries have not only the gumption, but also the interest and the probity across the political spectrum, to want to do something about it and they have done something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is choosing to bury its head in the sand, to talk of a threat to democracy or to pretend that nothing is happening. This or some similar reform must be introduced. I say that because there are alternative ways of approaching this matter. But it is a very difficult area because we do have to try and influence the State political parties as well as the Federal political parties. Otherwise, the whole question of disclosure has no meaning because there are ways around it. That is what has happened in some of the situations in New South Wales and also nationally. The Carpentaria issue in the Northern Territory, for example, where the Liberal Party simply refused to allow spot checks on its books and got away with it, and where money has been filtered through slush funds, obviously leaves us with a problem. So the whole approach is to hold out a carrot in the form of free television and radio advertising in return for the stick which is compulsory disclosure across the country. This or some similar reform must be introduced. The alternative is to set the country on the inexorable path towards a Queensland-style democracy. That is not something that I am very happy about, although it is something that Liberal Party senators opposite seem to be quite comfortable with. We have to act now. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on report No. 4 of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters entitled Who Pays the Piper Calls the Tune. This report is correctly perceived as boldly radical, concerned with the reality of democratic structures and systems and, therefore, controversial. The New Right conservatives, predictably, are attempting to rationalise their opposition to it. Their press releases, statements and the remarks by Senator Short today are reminiscent of the protests of the entrenched conservatives of the time against such innovations as the abolition of slavery, the removal of the property qualifications for the right to vote and to stand for parliament and votes for women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report has 14 recommendations. In essence, these are: the full disclosure of all forms of income and expenditure by registered political parties; accountability of third parties which, although not standing candidates themselves, give open or covert support to a political party; and a recommendation for changes to political broadcasting during the election campaign period only. </PARA>
<PARA> We must remember that, unlike most Western-style countries, Australia has a compulsory voting system. In other words, Australians are obliged to participate in the democratic process of electing their Federal and State representatives. In such a compulsory voting system, it is all the more important that political parties are fully accountable. The present system, whereby only donations for campaign purposes are to be declared, is filled with loopholes as has been, in fact, acknowledged by the Electoral Commissioner himself. </PARA>
<PARA> Since one of the main objectives of political parties is, by definition, to achieve the election of its candidates to one of the Houses of Parliament in this country, full disclosure of income and expenditure is warranted. Moneys used for rental purposes or to pay the salary of a party worker or to pay for between election advertising are as surely being used for campaign purposes as any other. The people of Australia are entitled to know which big businesses and enterprises, which unions, are contributing to which parties. Likewise, when third parties or non-candidate interest groups become involved in the democratic process through advertising in the electronic media for a particular party, then it is only right and just that they should also be subject to full disclosure of income and expenditure with regard to their campaign activities. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, if these recommendations are implemented, there would be no restriction on use of the print media which is, for the most part, the media used by these third parties. We have heard discussion that maybe these recommendations should be extended to the print media. I would like to emphasise at this point that the Committee was well aware of recommendations which could only be used as guidelines and that has been stated in the report itself. I hope that there will be full and open discussion of the recommendations because they are recommendations for change, and all change that is mooted in such a system should certainly have full and proper discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to remember that when the electronic media is used for advertising during election campaigns they are not selling soap powder; they are selling the government of Australia to the people of Australia. The people of Australia are entitled to know who is pulling the strings, who is calling the tune. During the recent Western Australian State election earlier this year Mr Bill Hassell, a Liberal shadow Minister in the Western Australian Parliament, announced that Mr Alan Bond had made donations on a vast scale to the Australian Labor Party. That claim was never substantiated. Mr Hassell would have appreciated full disclosure of donations over $1,000 within the State system, I am sure. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations and the substance of this report have been subject to much misinformation in the press. That is very much to be regretted. Unfortunately, this misinformation started before the public tabling of the report. I refer to the Sydney Morning Herald of 8 August. Before the report was even published we were told that free broadcasting time would be allocated on the basis of the number of Federal members of parliament elected in the previous election. This proposal was discussed by the Committee and might even have appeared in one of the earlier draft versions of the report, but it certainly was rejected by the Committee and has no place in the present report. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority of the Committee believed that it would be most regrettable-in fact not tenable-for emerging parties and independent groups not to have access to free advertising. I would like to place on record here the fact that that concern was expressed right across party lines by most members of the Committee. Therefore, we made particular provision for that in the report. We recommended and express as a guideline only that some 5 per cent of free advertising time should be made available to emerging parties, which obviously could not have had a voting record in any previous election. In fact, we debated that issue and related issues at length and came to the conclusion that it would not be correct for our Committee to come down with firm guidelines in that respect and that the proposed party political broadcasting committee should look at regional circumstances and make the final decision. My own reservation in the report states-even more strongly than was expressed in the report itself-that that committee should have a say and that our Committee should not lay down heavy rules in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect which has been subject to misinformation is the recommendation that some 17 minutes per day should be the time available. I was very surprised by an article by Peter Ruehl in the Australian Financial Review of 9 August in which he asked, `Why 17 minutes? Why not 15 or 20 minutes?'. Mr Peter Ruehl and others who made similar comments obviously do not realise that is the current situation. Seventeen minutes per day during election campaigns is allowed for advertising on television. So what the Committee proposed was a very logical approach to the allocation of free broadcasting time-that the 17 minutes per day should still be available but that it should not be taken out of the current advertising time or the advertising tied up in advance by the commercial TV stations, therefore depriving them of income. There would be no deprivation of income. The extra minute per hour during the specified times would be taken from the promotional time used by the stations to promote their own programs. So, as I said, there would be no loss of income. In fact, the commercial television representatives who gave evidence to the Committee went to great pains to explain that they did not make a great deal of money out of election advertising and that the advertisements were a nuisance because they got in the way of their pre-planned programs. It may well be that we should go down the path of not allowing any advertising at all by political parties on electronic media during election campaign periods. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a suspicion that a lot of people in the electorate would be delighted not to see the sorts of advertisements which we frequently have on television at that time. In fact, a person giving evidence on behalf of the Liberal Party stated in his submission to the Committee that he preferred 30-second advertisements because in 30 seconds one can get across a message which would be slightly adulterated. That is what we are looking at-messages which can be an insult to the electorate. At least if time is restricted--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters I felt that I should enter the debate at this juncture, and I am glad that you have given me the call to do so, Mr Acting Deputy President. The Committee made recommendations in two broad areas. The first area related to the requirements on disclosure of donations to political parties and candidates, and the second area related to the provision of free advertising time by the electronic media to political parties. In respect of the first issue, I have not dissented from the recommendations contained in the report. It is my view that there should be full disclosure, and the political parties should surely have no qualms about that. The second recommendation, however, I am strongly opposed to for a number of reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First of all, let me broadly detail the two major reasons for the recommendation that the electronic media provide free political advertising time for political parties. The two major reasons that influenced the majority of the Committee to make such a recommendation were these: they were based, first of all, upon the right of viewers of commercial television and the listeners to commercial radio to be informed of the issues in a particular election period, and, secondly, upon the belief that the free advertising time would release parties from the implied reliance of those parties on major donations which are required to pay for the time on the electronic media. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations contained in this report are unlikely to achieve those stated objectives. Voters who rely on the commercial electronic media for information about the issues in the election period should indeed have the opportunity to hear the considered views of political parties and candidates on major public policy issues of concern to those voters. But I ask the Senate seriously, `Does that occur now?'. At the present moment during elections for the most part there are the 10-second grabs on the news media, on television and radio, and there are the costly television launches of policy speeches, which are becoming more razzamatazz. Most typically, they are informed, so-called, through political advertisements which, for the most part, are sheer sloganeering. The old days when people had to get up in a hall and speak to the electors and be prepared to answer questions from the floor are gone. The electors currently are not able to ask about and be informed of the issues that affect them. Very often the elections come and go without the voter knowing where the candidates of the political parties stand on the issues that are of concern to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Over a considerable period there has been an abuse of the electronic media by the party machines, which has fostered the dominance of image over substance in election campaigning. No-one around here surely can deny that. That is the fact. The proposition that is currently before us will not overcome that problem; it will in fact exacerbate it. Why? The money saved by the political parties that would have been spent on paid advertising time on the electronic media will be poured into the production of more lavish political advertisements. The public will be afflicted with those lavish political advertisements, and image over substance will be entrenched even further. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no recommendation in this report as to the format that is to be used by the political parties in putting forward information in the advertising time. At least on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation at present there is some format used, although the free time that the ABC provides to political parties is getting more towards political advertising. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard around the chamber today a great deal of concern about the cost of political advertising and the need for political parties to rely, presumably, on major political donors. If that is the problem, is there not a simple solution to that? Is not the solution to put a ceiling on the amount of money that can be spent by a political party or candidates in political elections? Is that not a logical solution to the problem? Of course, that was not the recommendation of the Committee. In fact, ceilings are not unknown in the political arena. In my State, for example, in the upper House, ceilings are imposed. There is not a recommendation in the report that even imposes a ceiling on the amount that can be spent by political parties on the production of the political advertisements that are going into these free time slots. If the money that is saved from purchased broadcast time is used merely for Cecil B. de Mille launches or to produce a myriad of television and radio commercials that will become extravagant exercises in political sloganeering, or if it is diverted to other forms of electioneering propaganda, the political parties, as the report seems to imply, will remain dependent upon their major donors. So the second reason advanced for the recommendation falls to the ground. </PARA>
<PARA> One other point I would like to raise is in respect of recommendation 13, which seeks to dilute current legislative requirements so that political advertisements can be unmistakably identified. At present, when a political advertisement comes on we know it is a political advertisement because we are told it is a political advertisement, both before and after it. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal that has been put forward by the majority of the Committee is that a one-second visual should suffice at the end of the advertisement. I suggest that a one-second visual at the end of a political advertisement is insufficient for the purpose of unmistakeably identifying that political advertisement, and particularly is this so in the event that a party uses subtle sophisticated advertising techniques to denigrate the views of other parties or candidates. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to say that the ban on advertising for other people in political campaigns is undemocratic. I take, say, the Royal Automobile Club of Australia's concern about the amount of money it has paid for road funding. Surely to prohibit that organisation and similar interest organisations from advertising during political election campaigns is a denial of democracy. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although I have not seen the report, which has come down only now, may I say that it is refreshing-I say this as a critic of the Government and various departments in their normally slow way in reporting to this Parliament-that on this occasion the Department of the Senate is presenting early in August its annual report for the year that ended only in June and where credit is due, I think it should be given. I must say there are some matters I would have liked to have raised about this report had I had the opportunity to see it and I hope that it will come forward for discussion at a later time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to draw to the attention of the Senate the fact that the Senate and the Department of the Senate are consistently under threat of attack by this Government, certainly by way of funding, and that unless there is adequate funding of this House of review the process of government is at some risk. In this context I am very disturbed to note some correspondence from the Minister for Administrative Services in which there has been a discriminatory decision in favour of members of the House of Representatives relating to their postage allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope, Mr President, that you will be able to take some action about this. It is extraordinary to me that members of the House of Representatives are to have their postage allowance more than trebled to $30,000 a year which will enable Government members, for example, particularly in marginal seats to conduct very extensive direct mail campaigns to secure those seats while Opposition senators will be prevented from exercising exactly the same sort of right in response. I believe it is an absolute disgrace and another deliberate attempt by the Government to diminish the capacity of this chamber to conduct its affairs properly. I hope that this matter will be looked into very seriously by you, Mr President, and by the chamber and taken up with the Government. It is yet another example of this Government treating this chamber and its members with contempt. It is totally undemocratic to give this absurd benefit to Government members in borderline seats to prevent senators such as me from conducting our very proper contact with as many residents of the areas that we seek to provide alternative representation for, particularly in a region such as mine, which unfortunately has seven Labor representatives blanketing it. Those people are being denied the sort of access to and relationship with a senator that they should have. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor members are being given additional points of contact in what I believe is an utterly disgraceful, discriminatory and politically self-serving way from a government which continually seeks to denigrate this chamber because in fact it stands in the way of this Government by providing the only safeguard against its exercising the sort of arrogance and power that it displays in the House of Representatives when it gags vital bits of legislation late at night and thus denies the opportunity for proper debate. As we noted from the annual report of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet just a few minutes ago, this chamber sits on many more occasions-41 per cent more-than the House of Representatives sits. As a result, there is a greater burden on this chamber and on its members and their staff than, I submit, there is on the House of Representatives. Yet you see a Minister-the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West)-in a discriminatory way aiding his marginal seat holders. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know that the Labor Party is at present engaged in a new lot of direct mail initiatives which require a very large volume of stamps. Those direct mail initiatives are politically oriented election initiatives. They are aimed at inundating the people of Australia with direct mail material. Yet this Government is deliberately setting out to deny the same sort of access to mail to members of the Senate so that they can counter this insidious campaign. I believe it is grossly improper. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish I had had the opportunity of seeing the report of the Department of the Senate, but I say in conclusion that this unfair approach to senators is not something that we should take lightly. There have been consistent attempts in the past by the Government to freeze and limit the expenditure on this chamber; in other words, to limit its capacity to examine matters of enormous moment. Its committees have been threatened with reductions of funding. Its capacity to examine many items has been limited. I would say to the people of Australia that they must recognise that the Senate is the only thing that stood between them and such undemocratic matters as the Australia Card, the Bill of Rights, and you name it. </PARA>

It is the functioning of this Senate which is the guarantee of democracy, particularly when we have an authoritarian and dictatorial Prime Minister like the one who, in the other place, rammed through vital legislation. I think the Bill of Rights legislation was rammed through in one night, as I recall it, and gagged so that there was inadequate debate.

I have 3.5 million voters in New South Wales, yet I am being restricted to having a postal allowance of $9,000 on the say-so of executive government which is taking the function away from a proper determining tribunal and, at the same time, giving somebody with an electorate of 70,000 people $30,000 to spend. We have just had a debate in this chamber on a report on proposed electoral reforms. I had to sit and wear the so-called moral high ground of the Government saying that it intends to prevent political parties having paid advertising so they can refute what a government does with government money-what an entrenched Labor Party does with government money-so it can, very simply, free up the amount of money that it would otherwise spend on television advertising and spend it on direct mail. Now the taxpayer is to subsidise it further by Labor Party members having $30,000; whereas senators who are placed strategically in areas where they serve people and give them a choice are to be restricted to $9,000, even when they have an electorate the size of mine with 3.5 million voters. I get very incensed when I hear so-called moral high ground speeches from the government benches and see people trying to have this debate curtailed too, by saying that what is said is not relevant, when the truth of the matter is that this is all part of what one could be pardoned for saying is a conspiratorial plot.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the view that has been put by Senator Michael Baume and Senator Bishop. My fundamental concern is the level of funding which is presently available to the Senate which I judge to be less than adequate for the minimum functioning of the Senate for the purpose for which it is intended. I can only assume that the printing and the style of this report are in line with the new fiscal constraints imposed by the Government. For instance, page 47 of the report purports to show a photograph of the members and staff of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure at a public hearing in Coolangatta, Queensland. It is totally impossible to discern who is in the photograph. Yet it is in the report to be of some enlightenment to us.</PARA></TALK.START>

Can I say that there are some very real concerns expressed by a vast range of senators from both sides of the chamber about the levels of funding and simple matters such as having an adequate folder in the printing office. The fact is that there is no envelope stuffer. I understand that if there were one it is judged that a couple of million letters could be stuffed. I am not certain of the cost but perhaps it is $15,000 plus labour.

<PARA> Mr President, I do not want to transgress your ruling. But I fleetingly say that the problems we are now confronted with in respect of the stamp allowance for the Senate are symptomatic of a wider problem. In many respects what has happened seems to me to be a measure of the respect that the Government has for this chamber, its responsibilities and its functioning. It has decided that it is important for members of the House of Representatives to be able to communicate with their constituents by mail once a year up to a maximum of 70,000 constituents, whereas in the case of senators this is deemed totally inappropriate. In my case I have over a million constituents and yet I attract one-third of the funding available to communicate--</PARA>

The truth of the matter is, for my part, that I seek to represent all my constituents, not a twelfth of the population of Western Australia.

I have no doubt, for I have foreshadowed legislation, that if this Government had its way, we would see the Parliament managed by the Government and not by the Parliament itself. I have no doubt that if the Government could get its hands on the Department of the Senate, it would run it as it runs a government department. In my view, that is hardly an appropriate way to see the Westminster system of government, which we purport to have in Australia, operating.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I wish to talk about a related issue. I am not quite sure whether this transgresses your ruling or not. It is a general issue which actually subsumes the one that Senator Walters was referring to. Quite some time ago there was a dispute, which was finally settled by Senator Tate when he came into the position of Special Minister of State, as it then existed, with regard to the disparity between computers provided by the Department of the Senate in this place and those provided by the Department of Administrative Services in the electorate offices. At that stage it became very clear that greater communication was needed between those two departments with a view to providing reasonable services and avoiding duplication.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some time ago there was a change in the procedures with regard to the issue of stamps in the Department of the Senate. That had to be reorganised on the basis that it had been eliminated from the deliberations of the Remuneration Tribunal. It was through you, Mr President, and Madam Speaker that that issue was successfully resolved. The issue that Senator Walters and Senator Michael Baume have raised with regard to the stamp allowance and the differentiation between the allowances provided by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) and the allowances provided by the Department of the Senate has again given cause for this type of exercise. I believe that ultimately the entire services offered to senators and the entire services offered to members of the House of Representatives should be provided by one department. I think the present situation is absurd. From the checking that I have done, no other Westminster system anywhere in the world has two separate departments running the provision of services to members in a way which can cause mere duplication. I believe we are about to see another exercise in massive disruption which could be easily avoided by having one department-I believe that in this case it should be the Department of the Senate-providing the resources not only here but also in our electorate offices. It makes sense. It would, I believe, avoid a lot of the problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Oddly enough, the push that has gone on is for the reduction of the parliamentary departments, but no attention seems to have been given to the fact that the major duplication is not within the parliamentary departments but between an Executive department and a parliamentary department. The exercise that the Minister for Administrative Services is attempting to undertake may very well be met by other devices, and certainly by legislative devices which I would predict are likely to be used. The issue that has given rise to this particular exercise will not go away as long as we continue to operate with duplication, as long as we continue to provide different types of resources across the board. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I wish to raise briefly-and I congratulate the Department of the Senate-is the excellent transition that has occurred in the past year from the old Parliament House to the new Parliament House. It has meant an enormous amount of work by the staff of the Department of the Senate. The fact that it was done with such expedition and done so well-in fact, with hardly a hiccup-gives credit to the quality of the staff, particularly the senior levels, of the Department of the Senate. I think it shows that we have been in fact well served by the people in the Department of the Senate. On behalf of my colleagues I would certainly like to express through you, Mr President, our thanks for the work that has been done by those officers in the very difficult transition year just gone that was in fact reviewed in the annual report. </PARA>

<PARA>We are all interested in getting the report of the Department of the Senate printed, and it is quite clear from the comments which have been made by senators in this debate that there is a high level of concern about the Government's attitude to the Senate as an institution. I heard Senator Crichton-Browne contributing and I was thinking, as he was talking, of the experience of you, Mr President, of me, of Senator Crichton-Browne, and of a number of other people-including, one would have hoped, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, but he is more distinguished by his absence than his presence-on the Senate Appropriations and Staffing Committee. Mr President, you would be aware of the very significant difficulties that that Committee has faced because of Government non-cooperation. I have been pleased, Mr President, that you, as the President of the Senate, have seen fit to raise with the Government the attitude which has been shown by the Government over a period now of a number of Budgets and which has been contemptuous of the Senate resolution of, I think, 1985, which suggested that there should be a proper degree of negotiation between the Senate and the Government on the vital question of appropriations, which was the main subject of Senator Crichton-Browne's comments. I think it is fair to say that Opposition senators generally have seen that as simply one of the straws in the wind with respect to the Government's attitude to this institution and its preparedness to choke off the activities of this institution against the national interest. Today we have received a circular that most people would regard as extraordinary. It is open to two interpretations. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I think there are actually two interpretations. One interpretation is that, since the Government has a majority in the House of Representatives by definition, a grant of a very extensive addition to the stamp allowance of members of the House of Representatives-an increase from something like $9,000 to $30,000 a year-gives the Government a considerable advantage in terms of its approach to electors over the coming election period. I do not think it requires a high degree of political cynicism to see that that could be the Government's motivation. I make that comment because that is a quite separate motivation from the motivation which has been discussed so far by honourable senators contributing, who, as one would expect, have been directing their attention to the apparent slight to senators and the differential treatment which has been meted out to senators as against members of the House of Representatives. I want to put on the public record that I think that the public are likely to see this as a cynical use of taxpayers' money by the Government to try to gain an electoral advantage at a time when it is in electoral peril.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second interpretation is, however, the one which has been focused on by Senator Bishop, Senator Crichton-Browne, Senator Walters, Senator Michael Baume and others who have spoken, namely, that this is another turning of the screw against the Senate. The second interpretation is, however, the one about which I think there could be no matter of greater concern to honourable senators and, therefore, it warrants the suspension of Standing Orders to enable this matter to be discussed now and not at some later time. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have is a situation where some senators represent four or five million electors-I am not sure of the maximum number in any State; perhaps four million electors in New South Wales, perhaps more. I think all honourable senators here would claim that the requirements being put on them by their electorates are increasing steadily year by year. Members of the House of Representatives represent 70,000 electors. The proposal is that a member of the House of Representatives should be able to communicate with each of his or her electors once a year by mail. </PARA>

<PARA> The second area of concern is the denigration of the role of the Senate. Some of these matters are not matters for the Government. The Senate might well address the Remuneration Tribunal on the extraordinary difference between the charter and other allowances available to members of the House of Representatives in larger seats, but that is an issue for another day. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply say, in moving this motion, Mr President, that I think you will find that a significant number of honourable senators on this side-in fact, all of them-will join with me in saying that it is appropriate that we should suspend Standing Orders. Indeed, the debate on this suspension enables them to put that view. I hope that you, Mr President, will think about it in light of the leadership you have given on the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing issue. You might even vote with us on this suspension so that we can follow through in a proper manner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The circular is on the letterhead of the Minister for Administrative Services, the Hon. Stewart West, MP, and is addressed to all senators and members. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>POSTAGE ENTITLEMENT-MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT</PARA>
<PARA>In its 1988 Review, the Remuneration Tribunal determined that Members of the Parliament be provided with access to the full range of postal services provided by Australia Post subject to an annual limit of $9,000. This facility is seen as an essential cost of operating Senators' and Members' offices rather than a remuneration issue and, accordingly, the Government has decided the entitlement is more appropriately one for consideration by Government. This is in line with the arrangement whereby entitlements and facilities necessary for Senators and Members to establish and maintain an office in their State or electorate are determined by Government. </PARA>
<PARA>In this context the Government has decided that the existing postage entitlement limit applying to Members of the House of Representatives will, with immediate effects, be increased so as to significantly improve their capacity to communicate directly with their constituents. The limit on the entitlement has been increased by the equivalent cost of sending a letter once each year at the bulk mailing rate applying from 1 September to each constituent in an average sized electorate (ie 70,000 in the electorate). The new postal entitlement of $30,525 will be indexed to movements in the mailing rate. </PARA>
<PARA>The existing entitlement available to Senators will also be indexed to the mailing rate. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate my comment that the existing entitlement available to honourable senators will also be indexed to the mailing rate. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> The postage entitlements available to senators and Members are to be used for material relating to parliamentary and electorate business but not for commercial purposes. Consistent with longstanding practice, amounts not expended in a financial year may not be carried forward. </PARA>
<PARA>I thank the Senate for the leave to give that information. I simply add while I am on my feet that this follows the change of the former quarterly provision of postage to an annual provision of postage. I think this is another indication of the Government's desire to use this, not for the purpose of servicing the electorate but for the purpose of seducing it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is one of the arguments against what Senator Chaney is suggesting. Indeed, I would have hoped that he might move that we actually have a debate on the particular letter. Nevertheless, I would wish to support the motion that he has put forward because I think it is a matter that would concern the Senate. It may be that a separate motion could be moved to enable those who have already spoken in the debate to speak again at a later stage. I am sure Senator Walters will in fact organise such a motion very rapidly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the Senate has to have a debate on this matter and this seems to me to be as good a place as any in which to hold it. Fairly obviously, as Senator Chaney has already said, this matter affects the Senate and hence it is something which the Senate needs to debate. Fairly obviously, Standing Orders need to be suspended to enable the Senate to debate a private piece of correspondence between a Minister of the Executive government and senators and members. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also necessary for the Senate to debate this matter because of the misrepresentation in the letter of our position. I refer here to the misrepresentation that House of Representatives members have constituents but senators do not. A fair exercise obviously with regard to this would be to increase the entitlement of senators to give them the ability to correspond with each of their constituency. That would be a fair operation if this is going to be the new principle. So I think that the Senate obviously has an intense interest in this exercise. It is impossible for us, I think, to let pass the notion that we have no constituency. My primary vote, even without counting the preferences I get, is larger than three of the House of Representatives constituencies in my State. So certainly I should get at least three times what those members are getting, if not more. The whole thing is an utter absurdity. It has to be debated. I and my colleagues will be supporting the suspension of Standing Orders. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I support the suspension of Standing Orders. As you would know, I have not really spoken on the debate because you sat me down earlier. I have very strong feelings regarding the letter that we have received. I believe it is imperative that it be debated for many reasons, mainly because no reason has been given in the letter as to why things should be altered. Also, the suspension of Standing Orders will enable Government members to support us and demand that the Executive not treat this place in a fashion different to the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am well aware that Australian Labor Party policy has been to abolish the Senate, but I am quite sure that while Government senators remain in this place they would at least like to have the same rights and privileges as members of the House of Representatives. There is no doubt that the Executive finds the Senate a bone of contention. It finds the Senate very disruptive. It wants to push through legislation and because it does not have the numbers in the Senate it is unable to do so. Indeed, it is tradition in this place that we do not gag and many Bills have been amended quite properly in this place as opposed to the House of Representatives. We certainly have convinced the electorate that we are worth our weight in gold. It was because of the Senate that such things as the ID card were thrown out. It is because of the Senate that the Government cannot ride roughshod over the Parliament. Indeed, if the proposal in this arrogant letter received from the Executive by members of the Senate is allowed to go ahead any issue that the Executive feels it ought to take out of the hands of the tribunal and take over itself could eventually result in additional remuneration being given to members of the House of Representatives as opposed to members of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> For the Executive to give to the House of Representatives $30,525 a year for an electorate of 70,000 people is quite unexplained in this letter. I do not know what the taxpayers of Australia will feel, but I assure honourable senators opposite that they will feel the wrath of the people of Australia if this proposal goes through. There is no way that this can be hushed up and not given publicity, that the taxpayers will not know about what the Government is doing. On top of that the taxpayers will foot the bill. They should not for one moment misunderstand the fact that if paid television advertisements are brought in the taxpayer will be paying for them in one way or another. The Government is attempting to rip off the taxpayer for its own purposes. Mr President, I support Senator Chaney fully in his motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. </PARA>

Obviously the massive amounts of literature that they are sending out is exhausting all the Labor Party postal allowances. This is the root of the problem. The Labor Party, in its marginal electorates, coming up to an election has got all hands and the cook manning the franking machines. They are running out of postal allowances, as they are trying to use Government funds to electioneer and convert postage stamps to votes. That is why the system is being rorted by those in the Labor Party, and that is why they need an increase from $9,000 a year to $30,000 a year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the last week of June and the first two weeks of July I visited India, Nepal and Pakistan. Given the limitations on time today I foreshadow that tomorrow I plan briefly to outline to the Senate some of my observations and conclusions about India and Australia-India relations. But in my remarks briefly now I will refer to Nepal and to Pakistan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As an undergraduate many years ago, I took a particular interest in South Asian history and politics and visited that region for some two months in 1966-67 as the leader of an Australian universities delegation. Now I had the opportunity to return for this substantial visit to these three countries. So it was my second visit to Nepal when I went with my wife for five days. I was able to call on the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister, the Minister for Finance and the secretary to the King. I met with many members of parliament, religious leaders, academics and other community representatives. It was a busy time, greatly facilitated by the Australian Ambassador who is doing a magnificent job of representation for this country in Nepal. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal matter that I will focus on is that which the Nepalese Government regards as the most important and one which was most raised with me in all my discussions, that is the present border problem between Nepal and India. As is well known, India has unilaterally closed 13 of the 15 border points common to these two countries. This is an act on India's part, it would appear, to assert some degree of punishment or to try to gain some kind of discipline over Nepal in economic, defence and foreign relations matters. </PARA>
<PARA> India is concerned that Nepal has made a deliberate decision, with popular support, to be like Switzerland, a neutral country, and a zone of peace between its two immediate, very large neighbours, China and India. India is also concerned that, given the development of the Terrai, that rich agricultural area bordering India-Nepal wanting to maximise the economic benefits for its citizens-Nepal has introduced work permits which restrict some Indian citizens who, over some decades, have worked from time to time with more ease in the bordering country. India is also concerned that, following a controversial incident when India transgressed Nepal's sovereignty by violating Nepal's air space, within two months Nepal bought some military equipment, including some anti-aircraft guns, from China, which arrived in a convoy of trucks direct from China in June last year. I might add that Nepal has very limited military equipment and capacity. This decision, made by this independent and sovereign country, Nepal, appears to have annoyed India. </PARA>
<PARA> The main effect of the closing of the border points and of the impasse in general bilateral relations between Nepal and India has been a cessation of the distribution of petrol diesel and kerosene that had been, up to this point, the natural extension of the distribution of these products within India. Accordingly, Nepal is now taking new steps to set up a distribution system within Nepal that is able to import these products directly destined for Nepal, not as an extension to India's distribution system. In the current Budget considerable attention is given to the infrastructure costs of this system and to securing a reliable source of purchasing these materials. Materials coming from posts in the Bay of Bengal and destined for Nepal must go across a land bridge in India. The finance Minister in Nepal has pointed out to the Nepalese Parliament that prospects for the country's economic growth are only one per cent this year, rather than the expected six per cent, had there not been these difficulties on the border with India. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make it quite clear to the Senate that Nepal asserts most vigorously and firmly its sovereignty and independence. Whilst it is acknowledged that 70 per cent of Nepal's economic relations are with India, its traditional close neighbour, Nepal has never been a part of India and is an independent and sovereign country. It is disappointing for me as an Australian senator to observe, from both Delhi and Kathmandu, that there has been an enormous and surprising absence of constructive discussion between representatives of the two countries. It is a great surprise to me that India has been a leader of the non-aligned movement, and which has prided itself on the principles of independence, both prior to 1947 and subsequently-India has accepted the principles of the United Nations Charter-has not extended those principles to its neighbour. </PARA>
<PARA> The appearance is given to many in Nepal and others in the South Asia region, such as the countries making up the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), that India appears as a bully and as not granting to Nepal the kinds of principles that India very much asserts for itself. That is a perception that is shared by Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Bhutan. I can only appeal, as I tried to do, to officials and Ministers in India to avoid any patronising approach to small neighbouring countries and to genuinely think through the implications of compromising in any way the independence and sovereignty of those countries. It is axiomatic that in all the years ahead Nepal will continue to have its main economic relations with India. I think that it is short-sighted for India not to repair this essentially political and foreign relations problem as soon as possible and to establish this on the basis of sound principles that would be recognised in this chamber and, indeed, not only in Australia but also in all fair-minded countries. </PARA>
<PARA> This dispute, with implications and examples drawn from other neighbouring countries to India, has already endangered the actual work, the business, of SAARC. The SAARC headquarters are in Kathmandu and I called on the Secretary-General. Of course he was very diplomatic in not referring to any of these contentious matters, but I know that the recent meetings of SAARC Foreign Ministers were disrupted over the Sri Lanka matter on the ground that there had been some bullying by India in not acceding to the request of Sri Lanka to withdraw Indian troops from that country. Given the similarity of perception in the neighbouring countries to India there is a quite significant problem for the repairing of sound relations in this important part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in regard to Nepal, I only have time to mention the excellent bilateral relations between Australia and Nepal and the way this has been furthered by our representation in that country. I commend directly the work of the Australian Ambassador, Ms Di Johnstone, who is well known to members of this chamber. This is her first posting as an ambassador and I think that every one of us can be proud of the excellent work that she, together with her staff, has done in that country. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish briefly to commend Australia's development assistance projects in Nepal, including airport technology and, most especially, forestry projects. With the ambassador and an Australian forestry officer, but mostly, I should say, with the Nepalese village people themselves, my wife and I were able to trek to a high mountain to actually plant some trees in a joint Nepalese-Australian project which has transformed the forestation of the middle heights of hills and mountains throughout the eastern part of the country and has the prospect of having an enormous effect on agriculture and the economic prosperity of the village people. We stayed in a village one evening away from Kathmandu and we are grateful for the excellent hospitality that was given to us. It was a pleasure to have visited Nepal and I thank all those who assisted me in this visit. As the time that I had set for myself has now elapsed I will refer to Pakistan, along with India, tomorrow. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with a certain amount of regret that I rise to speak tonight, but I wish to address some points made by Senator Jenkins on the last evening of the previous session-on 16 June 1989. Senator Jenkins directed her remarks to the empire resettlement scheme under which orphaned and abandoned children were brought to Australia. That system operated in other countries, but we are concerned with Australia. The scheme also settled children in Rhodesia, Canada and I believe New Zealand under Acts of the British Parliament. Contrary to Senator Jenkins's statement, the scheme was well known. She said it was very little known. Her lack of knowledge I can understand, because she is a rather late arrival in Australia. In fact, in 1944 Mr Chifley, then Treasurer in the Curtin Government, proposed to bring 5,000 war orphan children out from England to settle in Australia. This was put into effect by Mr Calwell as Minister for Immigration in the Chifley Government in years to come.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Catholic child migrants were `transported' to Western Australia under the Catholic migrant scheme-`transported like convicts', were Senator Jenkins venomous comments, not mine. She went on to tell the Senate that the children were fingerprinted, interned in various institutions and treated like prisoners. The fingerprinting, which I will come to later, is completely untrue. These remarks were probably brought about by the screening of a video or film called Lost Children of the Empire. Senator Jenkins has an obvious propensity to have a crack at various Catholic institutions around Australia and in particular, Western Australia, such as Castledare, Bindoon and Tardun, which were and still are run by the Christian Brothers, as well as St Joseph's Orphanage at Wembley and Nazareth House in Geraldton. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jenkins went on to claim that the children were used as slave labour, ill-treated and sexually abused. I consider that she should have researched more extensively the accusations that she made. For one thing, contrary to what Senator Jenkins stated, the scheme was under the office of the Secretary of Lands and Surveys in Western Australia and the institutions and the children were visited by officers on a very regular basis. It is unbelievable that 40 years have passed without any complaints about cruelty being lodged. Senator Jenkins at this time needs any band wagon that she can get on for the coming election. Her statement drew some media attention at the time on which I commented. The response brought out a vastly different picture from that which was created by Senator Jenkins, with a great number of people giving very different accounts of what happened. </PARA>
<PARA> I will fill you in, Mr Acting Deputy President, on how I got an unbiased view. About two weeks ago I was in a small shoe shop in Western Australia waiting to be served. A fellow started serving me and in the usual chatter that goes on between a shop assistant and a client, he asked me what I did. I said I had a rural background but I happened to be in politics. He said, `I was a member of a political party at one stage'. I said, `Oh yes, what party was that?'. He went on to tell me it was the National Party. But he only lasted six weeks or so. I am not having a go at the National Party. He had his own reasons for resigning. But I said, `Why did you join the National Party? You must have a rural background'. He said, `No, I was brought up in Bindoon'. I said, `Were you now? In which years were you there?'. He said, `1947 to 1952', which are exactly those years that were mentioned. I did not say another word from then on. He said to me, `Don't believe all those stories that you read in the papers and that are floated around'. He spoke for 20 minutes while I sat there, resulting in my nearly getting a parking ticket. He gave me the whole story. All those things that had been said were totally untrue. </PARA>
<PARA> I made a comment on a report in the West Australian at the time and my office received four or five rather nasty phone calls the first day, but when I replied it was a totally different story. When I questioned what happened things started to change. Then out of the woodwork came all the support for the other side-support for my point of view and support for the institution concerned. I will quote selectively from an article in the Subiaco Post-a weekly local-of 4 July, but later I will seek leave to have it incorporated. Obviously, sisters of the institution were accused of forcing children to touch corpses or of locking them up in a room with corpses. I will just give a few quotations:</PARA>
<PARA> Friends sprang to the defence of Wembley's Sisters of Mercy last week after reports . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Another reads:</PARA>
<PARA> ``Welfare officers came to the orphanage every week to see if the children were treated all right. Why didn't they complain then?''. </PARA>
<PARA>Referring to a woman who worked at the institution at the time, the article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> She said she remembered the migrant children as no better and no worse than the other children staying in the orphanage. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the article incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The article read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>We didn't touch corpses, says orphanage child</PARA>
<PARA> Friends sprang to the defence of Wembley's Sisters of Mercy last week after reports in a daily newspaper that they had mistreated migrant children in their care some 40 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time the Sisters, many of whom are now dead, ran the St Joseph's Orphanage on the site of what is now the Catherine McAuley Centre. </PARA>
<PARA> The migrant children were a group shipped to Australia after the war and a small number of them spoke out last week criticising the treatment they received. </PARA>
<PARA> But Barrett Street resident Dot Patterson, one of this year's Perth City Council civic medallion winners for her community work, said the reports were blatant lies. </PARA>
<PARA> ``I was brought up by the Sisters at the time the migrants were there and they were wonderful to me,'' she said. </PARA>
<PARA> ``I still go round to visit them often and I wouldn't do that if they had made my life miserable, would I?''</PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Patterson said the report which had caused her and those Sisters still living the most grief, was one in which one of the migrants claimed the nuns had locked a child in the room with a corpse because she refused to kiss it. </PARA>
<PARA> ``We weren't even allowed to touch the dead, let alone kiss them,'' Mrs Patterson said. </PARA>
<PARA> ``I don't know why they come up with this 40 years after they claim it happened and after most of the people they are slandering are dead. </PARA>
<PARA> ``Welfare officers came to the orphanage every week to see if the children were treated all right. Why didn't they complain then?''</PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Patterson said of the girls she had gone to school with at the orphanage, many had been so comfortable with the Sisters they had gone on to join the order. </PARA>
<PARA> She also credited the Sisters with giving her the upbringing which had turned her to community work. </PARA>
<PARA> ``I remember those days as the best days of my life. We went on picnics, the Sisters taught us singing and dancing and looked after us,'' she said. </PARA>
<PARA> ``They went without themselves, so that we could have more. </PARA>
<PARA> ``It is a tragedy, now that many of them are dead, that these people are saying these things.''</PARA>
<PARA> Sister MacTill, one of the Sisters working at the orphanage at the time and who now lives in one of the cottages built on the grounds, said the reports had also distressed her. </PARA>
<PARA> ``In all honesty, I don't remember the children being allowed to see the corpses, and they certainly weren't allowed in there on their own,'' she said.</PARA>
<PARA> She said she remembered the migrant children as no better and no worse than the other children staying in the orphanage. </PARA>
<PARA> ``But many of them were Welsh and they had the most beautiful singing voices,'' she said. </PARA>
<PARA> ``Everyone used to say I favoured them too much, because I always brought them out to sing on special occasions.''</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While I am sympathetic to the causes of the migrant children of those days, I consider that they were given a good chance to settle in a prosperous country-or a country that was prosperous at the time. There is quite a deal of doubt about that at present. I consider that most of them made good of their opportunities. Institutions were not the only places in which life was hard. It was no different for, say, a child migrant brought up on a developing farm in the rural areas around Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I go on to the positives, I would like to carry on a little further along that line. As I said, I am sympathetic to the cause of these people, but the point is whether they are laying the blame for their problems in Australia, if there is any to lay, at the feet of the right people. Sympathetic as I am, I have to say that before they came to Australia someone gave them up to put them in institutions. Someone had to do that. These institutions did not go to England and kidnap them off the streets. They were given up in the first place. So if there is any ire amongst those people, that is where, unfortunately, it has to be directed. </PARA>
<PARA> Now let us look at the positives. There is now a society called the Child Migrant Society Inc. of Western Australia. The members of this society are joining together to help each other find their identity. I know that the Christian Brothers are helping with the records. I had a meeting with them last week before coming here. I had intended to speak on this matter. They have not burnt those records, as Senator Jenkins told us back in June and would have had us believe. I also know that the Department of Community Affairs in Western Australia is working on the matter. That Department is sympathetic, and there are far more records around than we were led to believe. Having worked on these files, I know that there are in Western Australia quite a few files which are completed as far as those in Western Australia can go. In other words, they have all the knowledge that they need. </PARA>
<PARA> These files now have been sent to England and to Ireland for further research. That is where the problem lies; the people that work overseas on the problem are either voluntary or part time workers. Of course, people overseas working on these files need investigative skills, rather than just being social workers, to be able to track down where these children came from. This is where the Federal Government can take a role-in providing funds or personnel. Senator McKiernan probably understands that, although the large populations in places in Ireland do not move far away, there are a lot of records to go through. I believe that the Commonwealth Government has a role to play, because Western Australia was not the only State that took child migrants. I know that New South Wales did, and I am pretty sure Victoria did the same. As I said, it is an Australia-wide problem, and I think that the Minister responsible should take it on board to try to work in that way. Time is important, because these migrant children are now in their fifties. I will quote from Senator Jenkins's speech:</PARA>
<PARA>Now a lot of these past child migrants are adults. They are searching for their records-and, indeed, their very identity . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I certainly hope that they are adults, because they migrated at least 40 years ago. As I said, they are now in their early fifties and the chances of their parents being alive are quite minimal and diminishing, but at least they may be able to find the rest of their families. Of course, finding their parents or their families might not be a pleasant surprise, nor might the family find it a pleasant surprise. That is why there is a need for better skilled personnel. That is where I believe the Federal Government should help, because we need the types of people who can convey messages, rather than people being given the shock horror of being told, `This is the son or the daughter you gave up and now he or she is back and knocking on the door'. Many of those families do not want to see their children any more, which is very sad. I consider that, even though problems may occur with their finding their families, these people in Western Australia, and anywhere else for that matter, should be given the chance to find their identity. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jenkins accuses the Christian Brothers of ill-doings which have not been substantiated because no complaints have come back for 40 years and we cannot find anyone who said anyone did this. All they tell us is that it happened to someone. We have not had anyone come forward who has said: `This happened to me'. I am speaking on this matter because I do not like to see these institutions and others, whether they belong to this faith which I am talking about or any other faith, being accused after 40 years. Most of these people are not around to defend themselves. Their families can hardly hop in and start defending them because they were not there on a first-off basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not like attack on the work that these orders have done and on those that have spent their lives in the care and education of someone else's children, as in the case of the Christian Brothers. I am proud to say that I am Christian Brother-educated. Many people in remote areas and many other migrants would not have had an education past a very basic primary school education if these teaching institutions had not existed. Not only did these institutions exist, but they provided education at a very low cost. If one looks around Australia one can see some very successful people who received that sort of low cost education. The teachers in these institutions gave up their lives to help others. As I said earlier, it is with regret that I stand up and speak on this matter, but in fairness to all concerned I thought that Senator Jenkins needed to be answered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not aware that Senator Panizza was going to raise these matters this evening, so I will speak only briefly. What I related in my speech about child migrants was information given to me personally, by people in my office for the most part. Indeed, as Senator Panizza knows, I had some of that information for some months before speaking out at all. Senator Panizza spoke as if I had stated that every child migrant in these institutions was cruelly dealt with. I did not say that at all. What I said was that certain of these children, who are now adults, of course, had come to me with great concern, primarily about their papers, but secondly, about the very cruel way that they were dealt with in some cases and about how they regretted that they had had to hide this fact all of their lives. In fact, most of these people, believe it or not, hid the fact that they were child migrants. Many women, for example, would deliberately keep this information from their neighbours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two books, that I have read and that I am aware of, have been written by ex-child migrants. These books are called Geordie and Lost Children of the Empire. There has been also a television program in the United Kingdom called Lost Children of the Empire. After my words in the Senate-and I must say that I have not put out a single press release on any of the issues; I merely delivered my speech in the Senate-two articles appeared in the West Australian. Some ex-child migrants telephoned the West Australian and told of other events of which I had not been aware because these people had not contacted me. About a week later, a journalist of the West Australian, Kent Acott, produced a front page article on this very subject. He spent a whole evening with a group of ex-child migrants who had formed themselves into the Child Migrant Friendship Society. Senator Panizza should also talk to Kent Acott of the West Australian, who may have other stories which he can relate to him of which I am not aware. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt in my mind that some children at the time were cruelly treated and abused. But I am not suggesting that this happened to every child. Undoubtedly, the whole scheme was set up with the best of motives. What we have to remember is that these children at the time were particularly vulnerable. They had no family to turn to. In many instances their schooling was also inside the institution, so these stories were simply never told. I have in my possession a photocopy of a letter-I have seen the original, a hand written letter-which describes unbelievable cruelty which took place in an institution in Scotland. The person concerned came out to Australia as a child migrant hoping to have left that cruelty in Scotland, where he had his fingers broken with a cane and was denied hospital treatment for some days. When he came to Australia he hoped for better things, but he was one of the unfortunate ones who did not have a better time in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Since these remarks were made public I have had a very angry telephone call from a woman who also has been institutionalised. She was Australian born. She, and others like her, have formed another society called `Children who have suffered from institutional abuse', or some such title. She berated me for referring only to children who came here as migrants and for not bringing up the matter of Australian-born children who were reared in institutions. She recently obtained her records from child welfare. I have seen her files. All I can say, without having them before me, is that they show remarkable insensitivity. At some later stage, because I have her permission to do so, I will table the photocopies of the file. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret it if some of the institutions which have been mentioned felt offended. That was not the reason I spoke out. But when I am confronted by people in my electorate of Western Australia who have come to me with these concerns and problems, I feel that I cannot ignore them. Because this matter has been made public some of these people have had access to their files. I am helping people write letters to the editor and these are being published in newspapers in the United Kingdom-England, Scotland and Ireland-where people are trying to trace relatives and there seems to be no other way of doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government departments are now being more helpful and that is to be commended. However, many of these people still have a long way to go. Many still have not been able to make contact with relatives who might still be alive. Some have. In some cases, they have made contact with a parent, even though they are middle-aged themselves-sometimes a parent is still alive-and in others with brothers and sisters. This is an unpleasant matter. It is not something which we like to talk about, but I believe that it is also not something which should be hidden, especially when the people concerned want the facts brought out. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) and (2) In respect of the second part of the honourable senator's question, the Government has allocated $6 million to the Hopevale Aboriginal community under the 2 year Priority Communities Development Strategy; $3.8 million in 1988/89 and $2.2 million in 1989/90. Works undertaken under the strategy include roadworks, house construction and the provision of water and sewerage facilities. Consideration was not given at any stage to withdraw, defer, or decrease funding to the Hopevale Community as the Government recognises the need in this area and has always considered the funding to be essential.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) An outcome of the meeting on 16 November 1988 in Darwin was a subsequent meeting of a number of government agencies with the Aboriginal community at Brunette Downs. The Aboriginal community at that subsequent meeting sought assistance from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to improve their living conditions. There are complex legal questions in placing fixtures on land which is owned by another. As the community does not have title to the land they live on, the Department was obliged to seek advice from the Attorney-General's Department on what steps could be taken to assist them by placing improvements on the land. As a result of advice received, an agreement was negotia-ted with the Northern Territory Government and the pastoral lessee, the legal owners of the land, permitting the placing of limited improvements on that land.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) At the time the Government decided to close the mining operation on Christmas Island it made $500,000 available for rehabilitation of areas which would afford the Abbott's Booby the greatest protection as the Phosphate Mining Corporation of Christmas Island had not set aside any rehabilitation funds.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Government's rehabilitation program has commenced with re-establishment of an Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service plant nursery on the Island. Plants are being propagated in the nursery and will be replanted in previously cleared areas of the island focusing initially on areas affording the Abbott's Booby the greatest protection.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Yes. The Government's conservation strategy for the Island which focuses on the preservation of the Island's rare flora and fauna is being implemented. The strategy includes:</PARA>
<PARA> a Commonwealth funded $0.5 million programme for the selective rehabilitation of rain-forest clearings to promote breeding success of the endangered Abbott's Booby;</PARA>
<PARA> a major extension to the Christmas Island National Park, (which will increase the size of the present Park to cover between 60-70% of the Island);</PARA>
<PARA> the development of an appropriate plan for Park management; and</PARA>
<PARA> land which will remain outside the new Park boundaries will be managed in sympathy with Park management objectives.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) See (3) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Since July this year, in accordance with Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service policy and under the provisions of the Territory's Prohibited Imports Ordinance 1988, no eggs, poultry or poultry products are permitted entry into Christmas Island unless they are sources from the Australian mainland.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) The Senate Hansard of 15 March 1988 records ``I am considering a further extension of the national park, which will almost double its size. Hopefully, I can announce that and a plan of management for the enlarged area very shortly.'' At the time of formal notification the agreed park boundaries exceeded the initial estimate quoted by the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) No formal consultation had occurred.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) Mr Bennett wrote to the Prime Minister on 9 May 1988 outlining his concern that the possible extension to the National Park may impact adversely on the proposals to reopen the mining industry. In the same letter Mr Bennett also requested that the local community be given the opportunity to make submissions on the proposed new boundaries.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) The former Minister for the Arts and Territories, Mr Punch, replied to Mr Bennett on behalf of the Prime Minister on 2 September 1988. In his response Mr Punch informed Mr Bennett that representations on the proposed new boundaries would be called for from interested organisations and the public as required under Section 7 (12) of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975.</PARA>
<PARA> (13) The proposed new park boundaries were established on the basis of known research and incorporate all areas identified by an independent consultant in 1985 as wildlife habitat of national or international significance and/or areas of high landscape value. Other areas of the Island subsequently identified in these categories have also been included. Areas of the Island of high local conservation value although not included in the park extension will be managed in sympathy with the park and are areas where some tourist development could proceed. These boundaries will be kept under review.</PARA>
<PARA> (14) It is considered that all areas included within the park boundaries were justified. Further areas which are currently excluded will be reconsidered for inclusion at some time in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> (15) See (13) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (16) See (13) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (17) In July 1988 the proposal to extend the National Park was agreed between the Minister for the Arts and Territories, (Hon. Clyde Holding MP), and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, (Senator Richardson), on the basis of a joint submission from my Department and the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service.</PARA>
<PARA> (18) The Department has no record of any such comment by Mr Braithwaite. Mr Braithwaite was quoted in the ``Canberra Times'' on 22 March 1988 as saying that a coalition government would rehabilitate areas already mined and would be prepared to triple the area of rainforest currently included as national park. The article does not report Mr Braithwaite as saying that he would treble the size of the National Park. In fact the same article goes on to suggest that the Government should not limit private mining concerns to clearing stockpiles and that the Government should be prepared to allow the clearing of an additional 80 hectares of rainforest. In his media release of 21 March 1988 Mr Braithwaite does not rule out the need to clear additional areas of rainforest for a future mining operation.</PARA>
<PARA> (19) Officers of the Department were aware of the article, however, the Department does not have any record of the ``Canberra Times'' article specifically being brought to the Minister's attention.</PARA>
<PARA> (20) See (17) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (21) Prior to formal notification in April 1989, the proposed extension to the Park was informally raised by the Administrator with local community members and representatives both individually and in Community Consultative Group meetings. The formal consultation process has now commenced with the public being invited to provide comments as part of the formal notification process under the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Services Act. Information on the proposed extension is available on the Island in English, Chinese and Malay. The Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service will fully consider any comments before final gazettal occurs.</PARA>
<PARA> (22) On 11 February 1988 the former Minister for Arts and Territories, the Hon. Gary Punch MP, stated in a media release that the Government would not allow any further rainforest clearing as this was not consistent with the Government's long term strategy for the Island. Potential mine operators were advised that mining was to be conducted only in previously mined and cleared areas on the Island.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) With reference to the press release issued by the then acting Minister (Senator Richardson), at the time of the sacking of the Christmas Island Assembly, specifically the part which said, `Despite appeals from the Department over many months, and Mr Brown's recent personal intervention, the Assembly has shown itself unwilling or unable to take decisions to place its affairs on a satisfactory basis' and that `the Assembly has been unable to balance the budget of its municipal authority, the Christmas Island Services Corporation', did either the Minister's Departmental Head or First Assistant Secretary for External Territories have a role in drafting or approving this release; if so, what role.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) With reference to the media kit prepared at the time the Government closed phosphate mining on Christmas Island,</PARA>
<PARA> (a) did the Minister's Departmental Head and First Assistant Secretary for External Territories read and approve this media kit;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) did this kit say that `the Assembly did not seek assistance from the Department in over-coming this problem . . . The Department nevertheless decided to assist . . . (and) . . . arranged for a consultancy to be undertaken into the Services Corporation's financial base, management practices and structure'.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) With reference to a minute from the Assistant Secretary for External Territories to the Minister of December 1988, which noted a projected deficit for CISC of $7.245 million for 1988-89, how is it that the Assistant Secretary could contradict Senator Richardson's remarks at the time of the Assembly sacking, by saying that it would be `unfair to blame the Assembly entirely for CISC's financial malaise and indeed they instigated a round of redundancies with UCIW support in 1987'.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Why did this minute of December 1988 say the Assembly `asked the Department for support and we provided them with accounting support and management/local government consultancies', thereby totally contradicting the statement in the media kit of November 1987 about the Assembly not seeking assistance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes, the acting First Assistant Secretary External Territories drafted the media release.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The media kit stated:</PARA>
<PARA> ``The Assembly did not seek assistance from the Department in overcoming this problem because of the position those members of the Assembly in the Union have adopted over the years. The Department nevertheless decided to assist.</PARA>
<PARA> ``As a first step to assist both the Assembly and the Services Corporation in addressing this immediate problem, the Department arranged for a consultancy to be undertaken into the Services Corporation's financial base, management practices and structure''.</PARA>
<PARA> The problem referred to in this statement was described in paragraph one of Attachment D of the media kit.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Assembly's inability to properly manage the financial affairs of CISC was exacerbated by significant structural problems in CISC. The Minute of December 1988 to the Minister states that despite the introduction of realistic charges by the Acting Assembly, CISC was still over-staffed, less than fully productive, had an excessive wage rate and allowance structure and was involved in commercial activities more appropriate to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The media kit actually states that the Assembly did not seek assistance from the Department in overcoming the problem it had in balancing the Services Corporation budget during the second half of 1986. The Minute of December 1988 states that the Assembly asked the Department for support and it provided them with accounting support and management/local government consultancies. This refers to the assistance sought by the Assembly in April 1987 following the receipt of the Malcolm and Malcolm report which was commissioned by the Department to help CISC in addressing its financial difficulties. The assistance sought by the Assembly included financing the secondment of officers with local government, accounting and personnel management expertise and also a training officer with particular computing expertise.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) As a statutory authority, CISC is responsible for evaluating its own financial position and reporting to the Minister in accordance with the CISC Ordinance. Following the resignation of the Director in March 1988 and delays in appointing a new Director until July 1988, estimates of receipts and expenditure for 1987/88 were not submitted to the Minister, although CISC briefed the Department on its financial position at regular intervals as requested by Mr Brown in October 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The following figures should be read in the context of the Island's population and employment levels. At the time of the dissolution of the Assembly, the mine was operating with PMCI also providing housing subsidies and maintaining much of the Island's infrastructure. The Island's population was approximately 1800 with 650 employed. This resulted in CISC having a larger revenue base and greater economies of scale when compared with the situation in late 1988 when the mine had closed and CISC's revenues were diminished due to a relatively large pool of unemployed and a campaign by the UCIW which involved the majority of residents in refusing to pay appropriate charges for electricity and housing. The Island's population in December 1988 was 1228 with 267 employed. Against that background the information sought is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The Director CISC advised in August 1987 of a projected deficit of $238,000. At that time there was also a possible further liability of $590,000 and debatable revenue of $291,000 which may have resulted in the deficit realising $1.12M.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Department on 2 December 1988 briefed the Minister for the Arts and Territories advising that CISC in October 1988 had a projected deficit of $7.245M and recommending a range of measures required to rationalise CISC. The projected deficit did not take into account $2.9M made available in the 1988/89 financial year to underwrite operating losses in the electricity and housing functions.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The Director CISC on 28 April 1989 advised that he would balance the budget for 1988-89 making an allowance of $1.4M for bad debts and Commonwealth subvention of $3.516M. The budget estimate for bad debts resulted from the Union of Christmas Island Workers (UCIW) instructing its members to pay less than the cost recovery rate for electricity, housing, water and sanitation charges. The Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories met with the UCIW on Christmas Island during May 1989 and negotiated a Heads of Agreement which included UCIW members paying monies due to CISC in accordance with the Heads of Agreement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Neither the Minister nor the Department are privy to the arrangements employed by Elders Resources to help develop their proposal although it was known that Mr Hoare had been employed by Elders as a consultant.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. The Liquidator has advised that he did not receive an expression of interest in a successor mining operation from Mr Gardiner and Mr Ronaldson. However, he had been forwarded by the Department a copy of a facsimile sent to the Department by Mr Gardiner and Mr Ronaldson stating that they were preparing a submission. Mr Gardiner later advised the Liquidator that he would not proceed with a submission.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Yes.</PARA>

<PARA> ``And, what I am suggesting to you is that the instruction that Mr Yeomans gave was not carried into effect? (answer) Effectively it was physically impossible.</PARA>
<PARA> And, another reason was, I suggest to you, that there was a deal of resentment amongst the staff against the union because they felt, that is the staff felt, that in a real sense the union had cost them their jobs? (answer) There was a degree of resentment and that feeling was certainly evident in the management. However, at that time it certainly was not clear-the only thing that was clear to senior management of the PMCI was that that mine was being closed and it was not clear to us at that time that the Government were going to actively allow or seek proposals for a new operation to commence. So when the Arthur Andersen representatives arrived on the island, we thought it was actually a bit of a waste of time.</PARA>
<PARA> And, that is not withstanding that Mr Yeomans gave you that instruction? (answer) Yes, he asked us to provide the answer within the time constraints available.''</PARA>

<PARA> That is right. And from that you understood at the time that it could affect the result of that application? (answer) Yes.''</PARA>

<PARA> (12) The evidence given by Mr Gardiner in the recent Court case was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> ``And as a result of your experience over those five years you had difficulty in being sympathetic to something that the union was involved in, I take it, or Mr Bennett was involved in? (answer) I would have been wary on the basis of past industrial activities.</PARA>

<PARA> Yes. But if they were to become involved in the consortium you would be somewhat wary about what they might do? (answer) In terms of industrial activities based on past experience, yes.</PARA>
<PARA> Yes. And by ``they'' I mean not only the union but Mr Bennett? (answer) Well, I would think probably more Mr Bennett than the union actually.</PARA>
<PARA> Had you formed strong views about Mr Bennett? (answer) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst you were there? (answer) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> And they were not favourable to him; they were unfavourable, were they not? (answer) In terms of industrial activities, yes.''</PARA>

<PARA> And there was a tendency to denigrate him in conversation that you were involved in? (answer) Well, personally I tried to avoid discussing industrial relations or Mr Bennett whilst on Christmas Island because it was a very small community and out of work it was more pleasurable to avoid talking about such things.</PARA>
<PARA> Yes, but you did talk about such things? (answer) Occasionally, yes.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Relying in part on information supplied by Austrade, the answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Innovative Agricultural Marketing Program (IAMP), an initiative of the Hon John Kerin, MP, Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and administered by the Australian Trade Commission (AUSTRADE) provided a grant of $126,794 to Serpentine Leather Pty Ltd of Townsville for production and marketing of Australian marine and reptile leathers (including fish and crocodiles) for export to Europe.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I am advised that AUSTRADE has no knowledge of any other grant.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The IAMP requires all applicants to meet the criteria of innovation, agricultural base, developed marketing plan, export or import replacement orientation and private sector involvement. Serpentine Leather's application met all these criteria. The provisions of the Australian Trade Commission Act 1985 disallow disclosing how the applicant met these criteria.</PARA>
<PARA> In the course of assessment of the application the project activity must be within the law. This was seen to be so in Serpentine Leather's application.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The grant was provided to produce leathers of marine and reptile animals, including fish and crocodiles, for export. Up to now there has been minimal production of crocodile leather in Australia. The majority of crocodile skins produced are exported in salted form for tanning overseas.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) AUSTRADE has informed the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service that the applicant, Serpentine Leathers Pty Ltd, advise they intend to draw their supplies of crocodile skins for tanning from:</PARA>
<PARA> Edward River Crocodile Farm in Queensland</PARA>
<PARA> Northern Territory crocodile farms</PARA>
<PARA> Edward River Crocodile Farm Crocodile skins may be exported from Queensland under the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 as they are derived from animals bred in captivity in a breeding operation recognised by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).</PARA>
<PARA> Crocodile skins derived from Northern Territory crocodile farms may be exported after tanning in Queensland because the Northern Territory has a management program for crocodiles approved under the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The export of items derived from crocodiles and sea snakes requires a permit by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. Serpentine Leather does not need a permit for domestic trade in snake skins. Therefore I do not hold records of its domestic processing of snake skins. Serpentine Leather does not hold a permit to export sea snake skins. No export permits will be issued for sea snake leather or crocodile skins derived from animals taken from the wild unless an approved management program is in place. The Act provides penalties of up to $100,000 or 5 years imprisonment for individuals who attempt to illegally export wildlife. The Australian Customs Service is the agency primarily responsible for enforcing the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act, including inspection of goods and permits.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator Button</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It appears that there is no systematic research being carried out on the extent of naturally-occurring dioxins in either inland or off-shore waters.</PARA>
<PARA> There are 75 possible isomers of dioxin. The isomer of most concern is 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Many of the other isomers may well be very toxic, but toxicological tests have not been carried out. The concentration of TCDD is very difficult to measure accurately because of the complexity of mixtures in which it occurs and its extremely low abundance (in the order of a few milligrams in a million tonnes).</PARA>
<PARA> We are not aware of any company operating a pulp mill that has carried out a baseline study of dioxins in natural waters, but most would have had some analyses of dioxin levels in their effluent carried out by overseas companies. These typically cost about $1200-$1300 per sample. One of the major overseas laboratories being used is the Chemistry Division of DSIR in New Zealand, but there are other specialist laboratories in the US, UK and Sweden.</PARA>
<PARA> There are currently 2 government agencies gearing up to monitor dioxins. They are the State Water Centre Laboratories, Adelaide and the State Government Laboratories, Perth.</PARA>
<PARA> The State Water Centre has purchased a gas chromatography mass spectrometer. The equipment is more accurate than the model currently being used by the United States Environment Protection Agency to monitor pulp and paper mill effluent. The equipment was commissioned. The Centre is currently evaluating the EPA analytical method and standards and quantitative software. With the expertise built up at the Centre in the past few years in analysing the by-products of disinfection (chlorination compounds in water)-these are just as difficult to analyse as dioxins and it should be able to tackle this problem. The Centre should have the facility operational by now. I understand that its forthcoming work includes analyses for APM and APPM in Tasmania, and for the Latrobe Water Sewage Board in Victoria.</PARA>
