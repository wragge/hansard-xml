<TITLE>Community Services and Health Legislation</TITLE>
<PARA>To the President and members of the Senate assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> We, the undersigned medical students and medical practitioners of Australia, oppose changes to general medical practice contained in the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989. We believe:</PARA>
<PARA> All Australians should have equal access to our health care system and that there should not be two tiers of medical insurance rebates for general practice and we reject the concept of a vocational register for general practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA> Undergraduate training in general practice should be upgraded and that ongoing medical education should continue to be controlled independently by the profession.</PARA>
<PARA> The mechanism for establishing the vocational register proposed in the legislation violates the ethics of the medical profession as embodied in the Declaration of Geneva, and is totally unacceptable. (See Medical Ethics on the reverse side.)</PARA>
<PARA> We pray that the proposed changes to general medical practice contained in the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 should be rejected outright by the Senate and that it should be replaced with a broadly based consultative process to address the problems within general medical practice and general practice training.</PARA>

<TITLE>Community Services and Health Legislation</TITLE>
<PARA>To the President and the members of the Senate. We the undersigned oppose changes to general medical practice contained in the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act. We believe there should not be two levels of Medicare rebates for general practice. We also believe there should be upgraded undergraduate training and postgraduate training for general practitioners to obtain appropriate skills. Current and proposed Medicare rebates for general practitioner services are inadequate, and there should be appropriate Medicare rebates for doctors who provide out of hours consultations.</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore we humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled will support general practitioners to achieve the above.</PARA>

<PARA>that your petitioners deplore the Federal Government's decision to remove 53 Pharmaceutical drugs-including the best available for the treatment of high blood pressure, cancer, epilepsy, high cholesterol and uneven heartbeat-and place them, for cost saving reasons only, on a special list requiring Authority from a Canberra Bureaucrat, and;</PARA>
<PARA>that we believe a patient's doctor is clearly the best judge for medication needed for their particular illness and that it is therefore wrong and unfair to force that doctor to waste valuable time referring a case to a person in Canberra who has no personal knowledge of that case.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Senators in parliament assembled will call on the Government to immediately abandon the proposal and keep its election promise of high quality and universal health care for all Australians.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The members of the Australian Armed Forces who served in the Vietnam from 1962 to 1973 did so with distinction, valour and professionalism, upholding the traditions of the Armed Forces.</PARA>
<PARA> After World War 2 and the Korean War the Australian Government approved an End of War List of Gallantry Medals for individual acts of bravery that were not rewarded during wartime.</PARA>

<PARA> Your humble petitioners pray that</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government reverse the decision of the Whitlam Government and thus approve an End of War List for the Australian Armed Forces personnel that served in Vietnam.</PARA>

<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and the senators in Parliament assembled: The Humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That every abortion kills an unborn human baby.</PARA>
<PARA> That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Government's first duty is to protect this right to life.</PARA>
<PARA> That the most defenceless and threatened lives are those of unborn babies for whom the Government is duty bound to take extra steps to protect.</PARA>
<PARA> That in 1987/88 taxpayers funds through Medicare provided Medical Benefits for 61,879 abortions totalling $6.4 million.</PARA>
<PARA> That in the same year Commonwealth grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State Public Hospitals.</PARA>

<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>The Honourable President and members of the Senator assembled in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA> Medicare cannot pretend to be a Universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. These who will be hardest hit by proposals to restrict access to items 6469, 274 and 275 on the Medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pursuant to the procedures provided by the resolutions of the Senate of 25 February 1988, Senators Hamer, Teague and Newman have written to me raising a matter of privilege. The matter raised is an alleged unauthorised disclosure of a report of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade before the presentation of the report to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the Senate's resolutions, I am required to determine whether a motion to refer the matter to the Committee of Privileges should have precedence over other business. In making this determination I am required to have regard to the following criteria:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the principle that the Senate's power to adjudge and deal with contempts should be used only where it is necessary to provide reasonable protection for the Senate and its committees and for senators against improper acts tending substantially to obstruct them in the performance of their functions, and should not be used in respect of matters which appear to be of a trivial nature or unworthy of the attention of the Senate; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the existence of any remedy other than that power for any act which may be held to be a contempt.</PARA>
<PARA>In making determinations in the past, I have indicated to the Senate the way in which I have interpreted and applied these criteria. I have given precedence to motions relating to matters which are capable of being regarded by the Senate as meeting the criteria in paragraph (a), provided that there is no readily available other remedy.</PARA>
<PARA> The matter raised is clearly capable of being regarded by the Senate as meeting those criteria, if the facts are as alleged. The unauthorised disclosure of a document confidential to a committee, which includes a report not yet presented to the Senate, is declared by the Senate's resolutions to be a matter which may be treated as a contempt. The Senate has in the past treated such unauthorised disclosure of committee documents as a contempt. There is no readily available other remedy.</PARA>
<PARA> I have therefore determined that a motion to refer the matter to the Committee of Privileges should have precedence over other business. Any of the honourable senators who wrote to me may now give a notice of motion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Chaney, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That in relation to the decision of the Government to increase the postage entitlement of the members of the House of Representatives as announced in the letter dated 16 August 1989 by the Minister for Administrative Services (Stewart West, MP) there be laid on the table of the Senate, not later than 2 p.m. on 29 August 1989, a written statement by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Ray)</PARA>
<PARA> (a) explaining in detail the reasoning behind the Government's decision to increase postage entitlement;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) indicating why the Government chose to ignore the recommendation of the Remuneration Tribunal in its 1988 Review that members of Parliament generally be provided with access to the full range of postal services provided by Australia Post subject to an annual limit of $9,000; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) explaining why it is considered that while a significant increase in the existing postage entitlements of members of the House of Representatives is necessary with immediate effect, senators should continue to receive their existing entitlement indexed to changes in the mailing rate. </PARA>
<PARA>This matter was debated in the chamber last evening. It has been the subject of a number of press releases and statements to the media and has received a run in the press. The motion which I have moved today gives the Government, in effect, until the first day of the next sitting week to come forward with some proper explanation to the Senate as to what this is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> The Remuneration Tribunal in its determination in 1988 determined that senators and members of the House of Representatives receive a postal allowance of $9,000 a year. I do not recall the Government jumping up and down about that or indicating that it was not adequate for members of the House of Representatives, but now when we are in a position where it is clear that the Government has become quite desperate about its chances of winning the next election, it has taken this decision out of the hands of the Remuneration Tribunal-at some stage during the debate I will be seeking to ask the Government whether it is entitled to take these matters out of the hands of the Remuneration Tribunal; I hope that we will get some assurance that it is entitled to do so-and made a decision which massively increases the allowance for members of the House of Representatives with regard to their postal allowance from $9,000 a year to approximately $30,500 a year, or thereabouts. An increase of about $21,000 in postal allowance at this particular time is a very strange decision and I think the Senate is entitled to a proper and adequate explanation. </PARA>
<PARA> At a time when the Government is talking about cutting back, here it is prepared to spend an additional $3m, or thereabouts. Further, previously the $9,000 was to be expended over the full term of the year; in other words, by quarterly allowances. The Government has said, `Look, we have backdated this to 1 July. You can go ahead and spend it as soon as you wish'. In other words, as soon as the Government decides on an election date they will be able to go out and absolutely flood their electorates with material in relation to the forthcoming campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has its direct mailing arrangements in order. No doubt it has distributed the discs around to the various members of the House of Representatives and they will be ready to fire as soon as the Government presses the button. This is a blatant political gimmick. There is not the slightest doubt that this Government has become absolutely desperate to hold its seats. What gives the game away is that the Government has not said, `We will give this to all senators and members of the House of Representatives', it has given it only to members of the House of Representatives. The reason it has done that is that it has a vast majority in the House of Representatives. There is an enormous advantage to the Australian Labor Party in granting these funds to the members of the House of Representatives. Not only is this a significant political disadvantage for the non-Government parties, but also the whole timing of the arrangement, the fact that the money can be spent at once, in effect puts the Australian Labor Party in a position where it can conduct a massive direct mailing campaign. It is clearly politically driven, as is the Budget itself, as we have pointed out. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier today I gave a notice of motion providing the Senate with an opportunity to debate the matter of whether any expenditure of this amount should be made before the Budget is passed. That is another matter which is of grave concern to us. We will be very unhappy if we discover that the Government has used funds out of the Advance to the Minister for Finance to enable some members of the House of Representatives to go on and undertake expenditure in excess of the $9,000 allowance divided quarterly at any stage since 1 July. </PARA>
<PARA> We are saying that this is an Australian Labor Party rort. There is no doubt that it is rorting the system for pure political purposes in an attempt to spend taxpayers' money to get itself re-elected. It has spent a massive amount in the Department of Social Security, promoting itself on television advertising all over Australia-a massive amount of taxpayers' funds, not Australian Labor Party funds-and is talking about having free time on television. The Labor Party has got itself to a stage where I am sure, if it could pass some sort of motion whereby we do not ever bother to have another election, it just remains in office forever, it would take that step. The Labor Party is rorting the system for pure electoral purposes and we want an explanation the day we come back as to what this is all about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always my wont, as Manager of Government Business in the Senate, when I sit in my office, hopefully working hard, to leave the television set switched on with the sound turned down so I can have a rough idea of what is happening in the chamber. At about six o'clock last night I glanced at the television set several times, and I admit to this chamber that I was worried because there was a verve, an elan, a sort of magic look in the eyes of the Opposition senators as they ripped into us on some issue. I saw Senator Michael Baume, Senator Crichton-Brown, Senator Walters, and at least one other Opposition senator, and I thought, `What are we getting a hiding on?'. I have never seen such enthusiasm. At first, I assumed that they were attacking the Australian Democrats again. I thought that was the reason for their enthusiasm. I turned up the sound at about 6.30 to find out that it was about postage. It was not about interest rates, as I had assumed, it was not about nuclear disarmament, and it was not about taxes. The issue that really excited them, that has given them the greatest thrill, and made them express such enthusiasm, was the issue of postage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have remarked before that the one issue that will get a good debate going in here is Opposition senators' own incestuous rights. If they really want to excite people, they talk about their own rights and privileges. If they throw in a bit of chauvinism, they have a recipe for a marvellous debate conducted with enormous enthusiasm. Fancy giving that lot a postage entitlement; they are sitting in here listening to me-and what a waste of time that is!-instead of sending out business letters. Instead, they choose to sit in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I put on the record my view that, in general, I support equal entitlements for the House of Representatives and the Senate. It has always been my view that we should not vary them too much; that we should keep a degree of equality. But it is not true that the entitlements are not varied. They are varied in two ways: in actual entitlement and in timing of delivery. On the question of the timing of delivery, it is quite clear that senators in their electorate offices generally got computers later than did House of Representative members. That is one example of a differential in the timing of delivery. The same thing happened with fax machines. It may well be the case with postage entitlements. There might be a difference in the timing of delivery. </PARA>
<PARA> Entitlements are not equal; there are differences. Let me outline some of the differences that exist. For example, senators get an electoral allowance of $21,005. House of Representatives members get $21,005, $24,977, or $30,458, depending on the circumstances. The logic is the need to provide a greater degree of service in particular electorates. Another example of where the entitlement is different is in charter entitlement. Some House of Representatives members get no charter entitlement. All senators at least qualify for that entitlement. </PARA>

Some in Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania, get a $5,000 charter allowance. Some in Queensland and Western Australia get $10,000, and those in the Northern Territory get $25,000. There are five different entitlements in the House of Representatives according to different criteria. A further example is that some House of Representatives members get a second electorate office. Those members are those who represent the electorates of the Northern Territory, Kalgoorlie, Maranoa, Grey, and Kennedy.</PARA></TALK.START>

There is a differential and there is also a differential in timing of implementation.</PARA></TALK.START>

Quite possibly, with the slack lower House representation in four seats in Tasmania, all the work comes to her rather than to Max Burr, Bruce Goodluck or any of the rest of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I conclude I want to make two other points. I was asked by Senator Lewis, `Has the Government the right to resume jurisdiction from the Remuneration Tribunal?'. Absolutely. The Remuneration Tribunal was set up to consider salaries and allowances. All those other matters that it has ruled on over the years have been referred to it by government for recommendation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that the subtlety of this misses the honourable senator. I was asked by Senator Lewis whether a government is legally entitled to resume those areas. Currently, it would not be entitled to resume the area of salary or allowance. All those other entitlements were referred to the Remuneration Tribunal by government for arbitration and acceptance by government. As the honourable senator would know, those other matters were not even binding on government. For instance, when the decision was made to have a third staff member it was not made by the Remuneration Tribunal; again a classic example where the power was resumed by the Executive and granted by the Executive.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am applying my mind to what has happened in the past. I did not hear anyone on the other side object to the Executive resuming that section of what was the Remuneration Tribunal's recommendation to the Executive. Not one Opposition senator objected. Of course, the final point, and I think it should be put on the record, is this: what has the Liberal Party of Australia ever done for members of parliament and their entitlements? It has done nothing. When in government it treats members of parliament like stray dogs; it gives them nothing. The first ever staff member for MPs was allocated by the Chifley Government. When did MPs get their second staff member? Under the Whitlam Government. When did MPs get their third staff member? Under the Hawke Government. Every time honourable senators opposite are in government they give MPs absolutely nothing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me go through the record to show what we have done in the last six years to improve the lot of MPs. We have taken the size of the electorate office from 60 square metres to 120 square metres. We have provided one and in most cases two-or we are getting there-computers in the electorate offices. We have provided facsimile machines. We have provided more flexible staff travel arrangements. Time and time again the Labor Government has looked after MPs. Under Menzies, Holt, Gorton, McMahon and Fraser, MPs were given absolutely nothing. Not one honourable senator opposite would object; they are all toadies, crawling to a Prime Minister because they want to get in the Ministry and they do not have an elected Ministry. They have all got to crawl and grovel to the great leader and not criticise him over entitlements or anything else. Under the Liberal Government, members of Parliament got absolutely nothing. They never got anything. The only time they showed a bit of spunk and a bit of guts was in June 1981 when Doug Anthony was in charge and said, `Yes, we will take the pay rise. Trust me. We'll deliver. Bill Hayden, come out and support it'. When the great leader, who is now a candidate for the secretaryship of the Commonwealth, got back he ratted on the deal. It is typical of the Liberal Party. In my view, this postage allowance is a harbinger for the future. It is another entitlement for members that inevitably, in my view, although not necessarily in any one else's, will flow through to senators over time. </PARA>

It does not say much for her persuasive powers that she cannot persuade them all to give some of their entitlements back. I reiterate that, in my view, entitlements to senators and members of the House of Representatives should generally be the same. That is not necessarily the case at the moment; there are variations. I repeat that there are variations in time. When fax machines were introduced to electorate offices we wrote to each party leader and asked that leader to nominate who should get them. Guess who was missing off the list-senators. John Howard did not put one senator on the list. Barry Cunningham, who has the devolved responsibility for the Australian Labor Party, did not put a senator on the list. When we said, `Because workloads are increasing a second computer is necessary', how many senators were put on the list? Absolutely none. So the Opposition's own leadership has said that the workload in the House of Representatives must be much greater than in the Senate. But I do argue that over a period of time any increase in entitlements to one House should flow through to the other. I am sure everyone here today is going to urge Mr President to cut out the third newspaper. Honourable senators get three newspapers while the members across the road get two newspapers. So let us cancel the third newspaper today as a result of the passion honourable senators have shown.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue which has prompted Senator Lewis's motion today is not simply the question of postage entitlement. Postage entitlement is part of what is now becoming an extraordinarily serious question for the Parliament to address-that is, the consistent pattern of attempting to shift the burden of financial responsibility for the election campaign of the Australian Labor Party away from the Labor Party and onto the shoulders of the Australian taxpayer. That has been achieved in part by a number of devices. I do not propose at this stage to go into all of them but simply to indicate what they are and to say something very briefly about this overall pattern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first and most obvious has been the misuse of the National Media Liaison Service-the deliberate attempt to use public funds to pay for the monitoring of statements made by the Opposition and their circulation to the Government's alleged political advantage. The second arises from the report of the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters-the attempt to transfer the cost of political advertising from the political parties to the commercial television stations. The third was an attempt by this Government, prevented only by combined activity by the Opposition parties, to use public funds to promote one side of a particular referendum case. The fourth has been the production of a whole series of glossy publications which were referred to yesterday by Senator Newman and others in terms of departmental publications allegedly put out for the purposes of public information which, nevertheless, are simply propaganda documents for the Government and its policies of the day. The fifth is this question of postal allowances. I will come back to that in a moment. Essentially it relates to the transfer from Labor Party members in marginal seats of the cost of their direct mail activities for re-election purposes to the public purse. The sixth deals with the cuts which Senator Crichton-Browne was talking about yesterday: the deliberate attempt to ensure that the Senate, where the Government does not possess the force of numbers, is systematically wound back in its capacity to play its proper role in the parliamentary process and to scrutinise the passage of legislation. The Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) is deliberately seeking to hobble the Senate by the restrictions that he places upon it. </PARA>
<PARA> The next part of this shabby deal, I predict, will come when the Government starts fiddling with the media reach legislation in order to ensure that the quid pro quo with its friends in the media is carried on to a situation in which the Government makes offers to the media barons about the extent to which it proposes to increase their power and influence. But the whole overall pattern is a quite clear, quite deliberate, quite planned pattern of activity. It goes to the question of shifting the cost of the re-election campaign of the Australian Labor Party off the shoulders of the political party and on to the shoulders of the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> This tactic is part and parcel of the whole Government strategy. Let us remember that it was the Labor Party which introduced the system of public funding of election campaigns which the coalition parties have said that we will repeal upon our election to government. I put it to you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that that public funding, the `Animals' operation, the changes in the cost of election advertising, the attempts to advertise only one side of the referendum questions, the production of the departmental glossies, the increase in postage, and the restrictions on the power and capacity of the Senate to manage its matters are all part and parcel of the current systematic attempt by this Government to shift on to the shoulders of the Australian taxpayer the costs which would otherwise have to be borne by the Australian Labor Party itself. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have an increase in the postage allowance that puts into the pockets of members of the House of Representatives the additional sum of $413 per week, which I suggest ought to be offset against and compared with the sum of $2 per week to be put into the pockets of Australian pensioners. The $413 is to be backdated whereas, with the $2, it is a question of waiting for another six months before payment actually flows through. This is perhaps an indication of the relative importance which the Government gives to its own re-election strategy compared with the importance it gives to the benefits it will give to the Australian pensioner community. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Lewis rightly pointed out, we believe that the Remuneration Tribunal is the appropriate body where these matters should be determined. Section 7(1) of the Remuneration Tribunals Act 1973 provides:</PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal shall, from time to time as provided by this Part, inquire into, and determine, the allowances (including allowances in accordance with section 48 of the Constitution) to be paid out of the public moneys of the Commonwealth to members of the Parliament by reason of their membership of the Parliament or by reason of their holding particular offices, or performing particular functions, in, or in relation to, the Parliament or either House of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>We accepted that it was correct and proper to view the postal allocation as part of the allowances which the Tribunal should determine on the basis of representations made to it and on the basis of evidence put before it. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West), in his circular to honourable members and senators in relation to postal services, said:</PARA>
<PARA> This facility is seen as an essential cost of operating Senators' and Members' offices rather than a remuneration issue and, accordingly, the Government has decided the entitlement is more appropriately one for consideration by Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will note that the statement says that the matter is one that is to be considered by the Government. Therefore, the Government has made a determination about the expenditure of money out of public revenues, but it has sought to backdate it and therefore, presumably, to make it available to members of the House of Representatives to expend, prior to the passage through this Parliament of an appropriate appropriation for the department concerned to pay for that. That itself raises a very serious question which goes to the notice of motion that Senator Lewis gave for debate on another occasion-namely, the allocation to members of parliament of money to spend on political purposes prior to the Parliament passing the appropriation to authorise that money to be expended. That is equally a serious matter for consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> In the statement of the Minister for Administrative Services, the facility is described as an essential cost of operating `Senators' and Members' offices'. The determination is, then, made by the Government-not by the Tribunal-that on this occasion senators and members are to be dealt with separately. Members are to be provided with an increase from $9,000 to $30,525 and senators are to have their allowance increased only by an indexation to the mailing rate. That is not a determination made by the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ray previously dealt with the question of differential allowances made by the Tribunal in relation to charter or in relation to electorate allowances. I have made representations to the Tribunal saying, for example, that senators' electorate allowances should be fixed at the same rate as the maximum allowance made to members of the House of Representatives. The Tribunal has examined that matter and decided not to proceed along those lines. But that was done by the Tribunal exercising its independent judgment about what it thought was the correct and appropriate way for that to be handled. This decision, however, has not been made by an independent body like the Tribunal. It has been made by the Government to discriminate positively against senators. The Government was not unaware, for example, of the disparity between the representation on our side of the chamber compared with the representation on the Labor Party side of the chamber in both the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. The Government has therefore quite clearly indicated that in terms of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory it knows full well that this advantage is one which can be exercised at the moment only by members of the Australian Labor Party. The Government has made that decision quite consciously. </PARA>
<PARA> In his remarks yesterday, Senator Macklin pointed to the question of the number of constituents he has. He described the number of people who voted for him in terms of a first preference vote being something like the equivalent of three divisions in Queensland. Senator Harradine has made the same point. Many honourable senators are established and well known for the amount of electorate and constituency work that they do. It is simply not possible to argue that senators do not have constituency responsibilities and that they are not entitled, therefore, to the same degree of communication with their constituents as members of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that, when the Australian Constitution was being framed, one of the things that were looked at was the parallel with the American Constitution. At the time of the adoption of the Australian Constitution, American senators were still elected by their State legislatures. They did not become elected by the people of the States of the United States until 1913 or 1914. The constitutional fathers of this country decided that the principle that they wished to enshrine was not that senators should be elected by State legislatures but that senators should be directly elected by the people of the States and that they should have direct constituency contact through the process of direct election. So it has been fundamental to the nature of the Senate to establish the principle that senators were elected directly by the people of the States acting as their constituents. The argument, therefore, that they are not entitled to the same consideration in relation to the communications which they have with their constituents in the same way as members of the House of Representatives has never been a valid one. This is therefore not an attempt to resolve this on the matter of principle that the House of Representatives people have constituency responsibilities and senators do not; it is an attempt by the Government to resolve it on a deliberate ploy of discriminating against senators in terms of their capacity to communicate with their constituents, the people to whom they are responsible and from whom they derive their legitimacy by election to this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not propose to take any more of the time of the Senate this morning because this matter will come back for debate in August, if the resolution is passed. But I do make these points. First, the argument that senators do not have direct constituency responsibility is false and always has been false. Secondly, the argument put forward by the Minister, Mr West, in his letter was that this increase in allowance was necessary in order to allow members of parliament to operate in the most effective fashion. It is the Government-not the Tribunal-which has made the determination to allow members of the House of Representatives a privilege, an advantage, an allowance, which it is not prepared to allow to members of the Senate. Thirdly, I repeat the point which I made previously about the overall strategy which this Government is putting in place of transferring the costs of the Labor Party's election campaign from the shoulders of the Labor Party to the shoulders of the taxpayers through those devices of public funding, the `Animals' operation, the changes to electoral provisions about free advertising time, the attempts to advertise only one side of a referendum campaign, the departmental glossies which are being put out in support not of public information but of government policy, the changes to the postal allowance which we are currently debating, and the cuts to the Senate in order to prevent it from exercising its proper political role in this bicameral system. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I refer to the steps which the Government will undoubtedly take to do some sweetheart deals with its mates in the media about ownership and control issues. I put it to the Senate that it is important to carry this resolution so that this matter can come back for debate on 29 August, when we will be in a position to scrutinise precisely what the Government seeks to argue and to expose the fact that it is arguing nothing other than that this is to the political advantage of the Australian Labor Party and the taxpayers will have to cop the burden of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I suggested last evening in a discussion with Senator Chaney and Senator Lewis that it might be better to move a motion so that rather than debate the matter today we could debate it later when the Government has an explanation, I thought today's motion would be carried with only a short debate. However, it has not turned out that way. I suppose, therefore, that I should put our view on the record. It differs from that of the Opposition. The numbers in the House of Representatives differ by only 16. Therefore, we believe the support provided is not support of Government members, as such; rather, it is support of the House of Representatives vis-a-vis the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our problem with the statement put out by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) is that it did not justify the increase. No justification was provided in the statement for the increase. We have a mechanism for providing that type of justification-the Remuneration Tribunal. It would have seemed to us sensible and reasonable to go to the Tribunal to argue a case. If the Tribunal had then said on the weight of the evidence that the increase should be granted, I am sure there would not have been a debate in this place. There has been no inquiry into the weight of work done by members of the House of Representatives vis-a-vis the work done by senators. Everybody knows-it is not a secret-that some people in this place do what is called in the trade `sweet stuff all'. It is the same in the other place. Other people work their tails off. It is the same in any of the political parties: some people do nothing; some do a lot. But if we do an averaging exercise we have to do it between the average work senators do and the average work that is done by members of the House of Representatives. I think that that exercise is better not done by somebody in the House of Representatives or somebody in the Senate. We all tend to gild the lily in our own favour. An independent tribunal would be the sensible way to do it. </PARA>
<PARA> I have just made some notes here in terms of my own position in Queensland. There are 125 paid politicians in Queensland at State and Federal levels. There is one Australian Democrat. I welcome anybody to come into my office to look at the pension and immigration inquiries I get, at the inquiries about roads and about everything else. I have to travel over an entire State. Many senators do that. It is grist to the mill. Senator Collins represents the Northern Territory and we have made a differential allocation to Senator Collins. The differentiations that were mentioned by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) are there but they are based on certain principles. They are based on geographical distances, for example, or the fact that Senator Collins has an island attached to his electorate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two islands separated by enormous distance. The Remuneration Tribunal has given Senator Collins the ability to fly to those islands. He cannot represent the people on them if he cannot get there. But, as a senator for Queensland, I cannot go to those islands, despite the fact that they are part of Australia. I am not complaining about that; I am saying that the differentiations that have been made to date have all been based on the principle that individual members or senators have to represent a particular type of electorate. No one worries about that at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we look at the principle that has been put by the Minister for Administrative Services with regard to this proposition, however, it is one of having constituents. Nothing else was mentioned in the letter-not that people had to fly to distant islands or that they had a large geographical area to cover but simply that they had constituents. When Senator Puplick raised this issue I think I heard Senator Ray say by way of interjection that nobody was arguing that. I hope not. As Senator Puplick pointed out in the history, from the very beginning this has been a fully elected House. At that stage the upper House in Britain was hereditary. The upper House in Canada-that is, the Senate-is still nominated by the government of the day and the American Senate is elected by the State legislatures. This Senate, however, has always been elected by constituents. </PARA>
<PARA> So we have constituents. Those constituents, in terms of the differentiation of power between the two Houses, since it has shifted towards the Senate, make astute political judgments about who they see. They do not bother going to see people in the House of Representatives any longer; they come and see senators. Why do they do that? Members of the electorate in Australia can add up. They know it is useless to go and see members of the House of Representatives, because nothing can be done. People will go along and see a senator, however; the numbers are different in the Senate and something might happen. </PARA>
<PARA> If any independent tribunal sat down and started to look at who came knocking on whose door, I would be quite happy. We would come out a long way ahead. It is useless to go knocking on the door of most of the people at the other place-except Ministers' doors. Nobody else can do anything. Members have been hived off into Caucus committees to keep them happy and working hard so that they do not interfere with the Government. Opposition members pound at the door. They do not get anywhere so they come and talk to their senators to try to get something done. It happens not only with members of one's own party; I get representations from members of the House of Representatives from all parties. That is an absurd situation. There are representations not only from those in the electorate but from people in the other place. Let us have a bit of sanity. I am sure that any independent inquiry would disclose that. </PARA>
<PARA> We would accept whatever decision the Tribunal made because the inquiry would be done in an open, fair and reasonable manner. Our concern is not that they have got $30,000 and we have got $9,000 but that no justification whatsoever has been offered. Therefore, we need Senator Lewis's motion to be carried to find out what the justification is. Secondly, there has been no inquiry. On a matter such as this, quite frankly, I think there should be an inquiry. The people of Australia are entitled to an inquiry when there are significant increases in costs. When I looked at the Budget Papers on Tuesday night it struck me that the $4.2m there for postage would surely excite somebody's breast. Why was it there? Where did it come from? I had not heard that we were getting an increase in postage allowances. When this matter came out in a letter the following day I had to read it two or three times before I believed it. </PARA>
<PARA> By the way, the figures in the letter are wrong. The figures actually show that there can be one postage per person in an average electorate. Members of the other place have been given $30,000, which actually covers three mailings to each person in an electorate, not one. Those doing the calculations did not bother to take into account the discount postage one gets for bulk mailing and the fact that within an electorate 70,000 people do not live in 70,000 houses. It is basically three mail-outs. The reason for retrospectivity is so that members can get the entire amount for this year rather than part of the amount. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator MacGibbon asks how they can audit it. It could not possibly be audited. I have been a strong proponent of the idea that the obligation in all these matters should be taken away from the departments and given to members of parliament. I like the American system where the member of parliament has to account for the dollars that he or she spends. We all now have computers. It is a very simple process for us to have an accounting system in those computers. I think we should be keeping the figures, the bureaucrats should not be keeping them. However, that is a different debate. I think we and not the bureaucrats should be accountable for what we spend. The bureaucrats do not represent the people; we do. I would be quite happy to do that and to account for every dollar I spend. I think then the people would know what was going on and it would be a much more open and accountable system, with the people of Australia being able to scrutinise what we spend. I think that is only fair and reasonable in any democracy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think these things should be hidden in bureaucratic budgets; I think we should stand up and be accountable for what we spend. We should say, `We spent that in this way and people have got good value for dollar'. People could look at what we do.

<PARA> It seems to me that this is another silly exercise that has gone on without much thought. I am not sure that I agree with an interjection by Senator Michael Baume that this was a massive conspiracy. I must admit that I still go along with my previous leader on this matter: if one has to choose between a stuff-up and a conspiracy one always goes for a stuff-up around this place. I think that is what it is. I do not think this is a conspiracy. I do not think the Government even thought about it. I think it should now go away and think about it. That is what this motion provides. When those responsible come back they may have an explanation for what they are doing. I am sure that if we had asked them today we would not have got an explanation. Senator Robert Ray, as usual when he is really on the back foot, made a very entertaining speech. He shines very well in that situation. He talked about the Opposition shining last night. Senator Robert Ray always comes in here and does his best when he is defending the indefensible. He did that again today in a splendid speech but, if one looks at it, he did not try to defend the proposal. He referred to only one principle throughout the entire speech, and that is that the allocations made to senators and members should be equal. That is the only principle that he said he upheld. During all the rest of his speech he was trying to pull the wool over our eyes. We need an explanation for this. I hope the explanation will include a justification for the taxpayer being hit again for this amount of money and upon what basis only members of the House of Representatives should be considered to have constituents while senators are not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I rise to close the debate. It has been demonstrated today that the Government, so far, has not given any explanation at all-let alone any satisfactory explanation-and no justification for this massive increase in the postal entitlement of members of the House of Representatives. It appears that this allowance has been granted by the Government for blatant political purposes to help its members in marginal seats to hold their seats by enabling them to conduct a substantial mailing campaign in their electorates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I agree with practically everything that Senator Macklin had to say, except that I disagree with him when he said that this exercise had not been given much thought. If one examines the way in which the Australian Labor Party has been conducting its political campaigns over the last decade, one will see the degree of expertise applied to a vast range of tactics. One can observe the way in which the National Media Liaison Service operates now, and the fact that yesterday an alleged statement by one shadow Minister was purported to contradict something that another shadow Minister had said-but that is doubtful. Such incidents are blown up in the newspapers so that there appears to be a major crisis within the coalition parties. It is, of course, absolute nonsense that there is a crisis. It indicates the political strategies and capabilities of this Government. Believe me, nothing is done accidentally or without much thought in relation to the Labor Party and its campaigns. </PARA>

I said earlier that I have not the slightest doubt that the discs have been prepared, the money will be in the bin and, at some appropriate stage just prior to the election, the buttons will be pressed and the mail will go out.

<PARA> There is no doubt that the Labor Party's strategies are very clever. As I said, the Labor Party has examined all of the things that have been done in the past by coalition governments. It has examined things that have happened overseas-campaigning techniques in the United States and Great Britain-and has adopted and adapted those systems and techniques so as to become a past master and an expert at campaigning. In particular, at this stage in its campaign for the next election, the Government is trying to mislead the public by pointing to problems that do not exist. We really cannot tell just what will be the far-reaching consequences of this postage entitlement proposal. As I say, there is not the slightest doubt, having regard to the debate which has taken place here today-including the remarks of Senator Ray-that there is clearly no explanation of or justification for it, yet there is a desperate need for an explanation to be made to the Senate. I say to the Senate and to the Government that if the explanation and the justification are not satisfactory when we return here on 29 August, there will be a very substantial debate about the matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a second reading debate on one of the three Bills-the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill 1989-which make up the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) package of the Government. They are the most important pieces of Aboriginal legislation we will see in this decade. The Bill before us seeks to establish ATSIC. It seeks to make necessary arrangements; it seeks to abolish other pieces of legislation; it seeks to abolish all the arrangements that exist with the States on Aboriginal matters; and it seeks to abolish, in clause 202, the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). The Aboriginal Development Commission Bill will be the subject of another second reading debate, and I will speak on that at that time. However, I say at this stage that we shall oppose the emasculation of Aboriginal self-management and the nobbling of the Aboriginal Development Commission, and we vigorously oppose any attempt that might be made actually to dismember the Aboriginal Development Commission ahead of ATSIC arrangements being put in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We enter this debate after a year and a half of unprecedented turmoil and disturbance in the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs. During this time the ATSIC legislation has been floated and promoted. Eight acting commissioners of the Aboriginal Development Commission have been sacked. The reputations of those eight acting commissioners have been traduced. During this past year and a half scandals were revealed about the administration of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the portfolio agencies, which culminated in the dismissal of the Secretary of the Department; we learned of activities on which the Auditor-General has reported so adversely; and there was the appointment and report of a select committee of the Senate into the administration of Aboriginal Affairs. During all of this time, with all these things happening, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand), rather than concentrating on the reform and improvement of the Department for which he was responsible, concentrated on the development of the ATSIC concept. He did so, initially at least, with little or no input from officers of the Department. Also during the past year and a half misleading answers were given to the Parliament by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs on several significant and distinct matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Those of us who have spent part of our lives working with and on behalf of Aboriginals have become deeply and permanently affected by that experience. I suppose one could say we have become marked by what we have learned of the evidence of deprivation and disadvantage. We have become committed to overcoming that deprivation and to the lessening of that disadvantage. Certainly the various people who have been Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs or who have been involved in Aboriginal affairs might have different ways of giving expression to that concern. Certainly we on this side differ from Mr Hand on questions of political theory and practice, but because it is neither necessary nor helpful, we do not question the commitment of Labor Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs to the task before them. I observe, however, that it is regrettable and unfair that the present Labor Minister has not made the same acknowledgment of the motives of his predecessors. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, and the good intentions of the Minister are not enough. Wanting to improve outcomes does not, of itself, improve outcomes. Neither does it justify the ATSIC proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to this Bill for an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. I can do no better at the beginning of my remarks than to quote the words I wrote with Senator Boswell for the dissenting report of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs which investigated and reported on this proposal. Those words were:</PARA>
<PARA> The proposal for an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) is unjustified, unnecessary, and culturally inappropriate. The detailed proposal that has emerged in the Bill is faulty and unsafe. </PARA>
<PARA> If pursued it will operate to the detriment of the very people it is designed allegedly to serve. It is likely to lead to worse outcomes than those produced by the bodies it is to replace, to worse services for Aboriginal and Islander people, to less accountability of the Commission and its servants to the Aboriginal and Islander people, and to less accountability to all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>If those assertions are even partly true-Senator Boswell and I believe they are correct-then it is incumbent upon us not to allow this legislation to proceed, and if we are determined to have it proceed, not to let it proceed in the form now before us. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty is that views differ. What I see as likely outcomes, some see as imagination; what I see as facts about what is happening in Aboriginal Australia, some see as error. On this side of the chamber we have a crystal clear view that these undesirable outcomes will be the legacy of this legislation. Labor Party senators who served on the Senate Select Committee did not at any stage challenge the proposition underlying ATSIC: they were bound by the Government and Caucus decisions on the threshold issue that there would be a new Commission; they were bound by decisions that it would incorporate other bodies, that it would combine administrative and elective functions and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats too seem to have accepted the threshold proposition and thereafter have concentrated their attention on questions of detail and process-and they are important questions. But if outcomes for Aboriginal people will not be improved demonstrably by this new Commission, then ATSIC fails. If it does not produce better outcomes, it fails. I am talking about better process outcomes as well as better outcomes in health, education, employment, enterprise formation, housing, land acquisition, lower rates of imprisonment and better police statistics. Those are the outcomes that must flow and which we must be able to expect. They are the outcomes that Aboriginal people need so desperately. I hope it is a multi-partisan concern that those outcomes be achieved; that is, we should all want to see the most disadvantaged, depressed and hopeless Australians strengthened and allowed to succeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Estimates document from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs last year, 1988-89, contains a portfolio overview, which sets out in stark point form some of the more awful statistics of Aboriginal disadvantages. About the aims of this program it goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>Government and other services should be adapted and expanded as necessary and certain special benefits-not generally available to other citizens-should recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders' unique circumstances, their history and identity. </PARA>
<PARA>But the problem is that not all approaches, even by well meaning people, will achieve worthwhile outcomes, certainly not the worthwhile outcomes I outlined a moment ago. We think ATSIC will not work. We fear that it will fail to deliver. We believe that outcomes will actually be worse. Further, when one reads the Bill one sees how the Commission will be structured. We fear that the structure will lead to Aboriginals inevitably being blamed when ATSIC fails. We see this as a setting up exercise. The Commission will not work and Aboriginal people will be blamed when it does not work. It is, in short, a set-up of Aboriginal people by the Labor Government. I am charitable enough to believe that it may be a set-up motivated more by ignorance and foolishness than by malice. But this ATSIC legisla- tion is flawed. It is an awful Bill. It is unnecessary; it is incomplete; it is ideological in its purposes and approach. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a very major change to Aboriginal administration and it is notable that there has never been a justification for ATSIC made by the Labor Government that introduces it. There has never been a coherent justification-certainly no justification has ever been made known in any credible way. This is not just point scoring; it is vital to the future of Aboriginal people. Just to talk about self-determination is not enough. I remind honourable senators that at the same time we are introducing ATSIC in the name of self-determination, the Government has prepared another Bill to destroy the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC), which exists in reality as an instrument of self-determination by Aboriginal people. The Government has never explained why it is necessary to destroy the ADC. </PARA>
<PARA> If no convincing justification has been offered for change, then why make the change? I have been told by colleagues that there is an old saying from New England which states, `If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it'. Why, for instance, should we not prefer an alternative approach? Why should we not try to reform the existing portfolio agencies? There is no a priori justification for this quite radical suggestion for an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and there is no justification which flows from any of the events of the last few years. On the contrary, those of us who have worked in the portfolio and who know many of the people remain convinced that the outcomes, which we are willing to accept are the goal of every Minister for Aboriginal affairs, could better be achieved in other less radical, less threatening and less destructive ways. </PARA>
<PARA> As an Opposition, it is not our job to justify or defend any alternative proposition. Nor is it our first responsibility to propose improvements to meet the basic purposes of the Minister; it is the obligation of the Minister, of the Labor Government and of those who want to introduce ATSIC. It is the obligation of those who are proposing radical change to offer some credible justification for what they propose. So far they have not ever done so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has justified his approach on the basis of his claims of consultation with the various Aboriginal communities. For a start, this is not an adequate justification for this structure. Even if it were, the Senate Select Committee unanimously voted that the claims of the Minister to have consulted widely were unjustified. We all-Labor, Democrat, Liberal and National party members-found that the consultation process had been inadequate and incomplete, and that it had been less than had been promised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Boswell. The Minister, during the earlier consultation period promised, at 46 community meetings, that he would seek their agreement in principle and that he would return with details of the proposed legislation before it was introduced. He promised that he would allow people to have some say in the details. He told them that all he was seeking was approval in principal for his general thoughts. That is not the way it panned out. Honourable senators may have seen the Sydney Morning Herald of yesterday in which Mr Charles Perkins is reported in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Perkins said that ATSIC was a good concept but that the-</PARA>
<PARA>then it quotes Mr Perkins-</PARA>
<PARA>`mechanics are flawed dramatically' and more consultations were needed with Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest to the Government and to my colleagues in the Senate that we should pay particular attention to the claims of Mr Charles Perkins that the mechanics of ATSIC are flawed dramatically. He would not have said that without some reason. He said it because it is correct-the mechanics are flawed dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is grieved as much as it is upset by what is going on. One would have expected a Labor Government committed to the highest principles of public administration to have responded to the report of the Senate Select Committee by redeeming its promises and by completing the processes of consultation. One would have thought that the Minister would have responded by correcting what he had failed to do even though he had promised to do it, but of course the Government and the Minister did not redeem their promises. The Minister did not answer the specific criticisms of the Senate Select Committee. Honourable senators may recall that we invited him to show a little charity and courtesy for the eight dismissed commissioners. Did he do that? He did not. He did not redeem his promises as he should have done and he did not redeem his promises as some other Ministers would have done; he simply repeated his determination to proceed with the ATSIC legislation. He repeated the very same mistakes that the members, including the Labor members of the Select Committee, had complained of-failure to consult adequately. That is a major objection. He has never, ever redeemed that mistake. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor members of the Committee, who are in the majority, identified clearly-as, in fact, did the entire Committee-failures of process and failures to deliver promised consultation. The Government, while it did pick up some of the recommendations of the Select Committee, decided to ignore others. There is no reason priori why government must automatically accept every recommendation of every committee-I do not expect that-but neither is there any reason for those associated with unanimous recommendations not to persist with them if we think that they have merit. One thing we can say about that Select Committee is that it took a lot of trouble over the recommendations it put forward. We may have a chance to try to persist with some of our recommendations later. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us come back to what this Bill is all about. The Minister asserts that a new structure is necessary to enable better outcomes to be achieved for Aboriginal people. There is nothing in the new arrangements that logically or necessarily gives promise of any better outcomes. The Minister then asserts that self-determination by Aboriginals is essential for the outcomes of Aboriginal people to improve. It is his version of self-determination, it is his concept of what it means, that makes the ATSIC proposal so mean. The Minister has promised the Aboriginal people power over decisions affecting them, to use his language. He has promised them money to put the decisions into effect, and he has promised them support for the decisions that they take. In fact, and in law, they are not going to receive those things. It is a cruel and cynical deception. Aboriginal power over decisions will remain in important respects subject to ministerial veto. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Boswell says, he has total power. Funding will remain, I must say properly and inevitably, as it was always going to be, subject to the normal processes and constraints of government and of the Budget cycle. But that was not made clear to people. In any event, the arrangement is conceptually flawed. It is like putting out to the Australian public a proposition and saying to veterans' organisations that all decisions on veterans' affairs and all public funds for veterans' affairs are to be placed under veterans' control independent of the general community or of the normal mechanisms of accountability to the Parliament and to the public which provides the cash. Such a proposal would be laughed out of court. It would be seen as a fraud; it would be seen as being inconsistent with constitutional proprieties; it would be seen as being inconsistent with the administrative or financial realities and imperatives. But the ATSIC proposal proceeds on the same or equivalent basis. It is a proposal which is crazy in every way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The public administration of Aboriginal affairs is to be taken outside the structure and processes of government and placed in a new structure supposedly based on what the Minister has called `community', and what the Minister has also called `grassroots'. It seeks to replace a department that has been magnificent in the past and which could be magnificent again were it not for the fact that the Minister it now has is administratively incompetent. The failures of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs are, more than anything else, failures of the Minister, Mr Hand, of his administration, and of the amateurs and zealots with whom he surrounds himself. He has worked to destroy the effectiveness of the major Aboriginal controlled organisation in Australia; that is, the ADC. He sacked a competent and professional board and replaced it with sycophants and cronies. They were able to force out the chairperson, Shirley McPherson. But even in that supposed victory the Minister was ungracious, and Shirley McPherson, the chairperson for five years and a Commissioner for seven, went with scarcely a word of thanks from the Government. The Minister insists on incorporating the functions of another Aboriginalised body-that is Aboriginal Hostels Ltd-into the new structure. There has been no justification for that ideological decision either. </PARA>
<PARA> My objective, and the objective of the Opposition, remains the achievement of better outcomes. Our objective remains the achievement of outcomes such as less illness, fewer Aboriginals in prison, more effective Aboriginal participation in education and the education system, greater Aboriginal longevity, more people housed, better housing, more people in employment, more Aboriginal people in senior administrative positions, fewer alcohol and drug problems, and so on. The question before the Senate now is whether or not ATSIC is the vehicle to achieve the outcomes. Sadly, it is not. This proposal is more likely to remove Aboriginal Australians from the mainstream of Australian life, to emphasise Aboriginal separateness, to require Aboriginal people to operate in a system different from other Australians and to make them into welfare recipients forever. If ATSIC proceeds, they will be the victims of a new paternalism. The damage which ATSIC will do to Aboriginal Australia may be irremediable; at the very least it will take a generation to fix. </PARA>
<PARA> At the very least the ATSIC Bill will require amendment to the extent recommended by the Senate Select Committee. It will require an attempt at the very least by the Senate to make the Bill workable. The Opposition will oppose this legislation at the second reading stage and at the third reading stage. In another debate we will do what we can to defend the Aboriginal Development Commission from the attack made on it. At the committee stage we will discover whether the many amendments, which we think are necessary to bring about some of the improvements, can be achieved. I conclude by saying again to the Senate that if this legislation passes it may be a parliamentary victory for the Government but it will be a very sad day in the longer term for Aboriginal Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After some considerable time the Senate is debating the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill 1989. It has been a long time getting here and, certainly, it is not before time. The Bill concerns particularly and specifically 1.4 per cent of the Australian population-200,000 Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. I explain at the beginning of my contribution to this debate that I do not consider myself to be an expert on Aboriginal affairs. I do not seek to match my experience and understanding of the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio with that of the previous speaker, Senator Peter Baume, nor with that of many other honourable senators in this place. That is not to say that I have not had some involvement with Aboriginal communities both in the State of Western Australia, which I represent, and in other parts of Australia. Despite the stories and the television reports, I was shocked to see the conditions under which some Aboriginal people live in some parts of Australia-not all of them but certainly far too many-in this latter part of the twentieth century.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I shall not seek to reply point by point to the contribution made by Senator Peter Baume. However, he made the point that the Opposition is looking for better outcomes in this legislation. It is a point that the Government and I think every resident of Australia should be considering when looking at the question of Aboriginal affairs. It is unfortunate that this Bill is not going through this chamber with bipartisan support. Certainly we will argue about individual points of policy but, overall, we should look for, as Senator Baume said, better outcomes. I believe-and this is where we differ from the other side of the chamber-that this Bill will provide for those better outcomes. What better outcomes do we need? What yardstick are we after? What is the situation at the moment? For explanation, let me run through some points of measurement that can be used both now and in future years. As I said, Aboriginal people account for only 1.4 per cent of the Australian population. Their average life expectancy is 15 to 20 years less than what it is for other Australians. That is a deplorable state of affairs and it is a yardstick that we will be using in future years when this legislation comes into effect. Aboriginal infant mortality is three times that of non-Aboriginal Australians. Aboriginal people suffer from a higher incidence of both communicable diseases such as hepatitis B, and lifestyle diseases such as diabetes and heart attacks. Aboriginal unemployment is six times the national average. Nobody should be unemployed at all, but that a section of the population experiences six times what the rest of Australians experience is pretty deplorable. On average, Aboriginal people earn only half the income of other Australians. Many Aboriginal families live in substandard housing or in temporary shelter. Some live in appalling conditions. I am sure that honourable senators have witnesses this for themselves and have been as shocked as I have been. It is not something one gets used to; it is something one works to change for the future. Aboriginal imprisonment rates, which Senator Baume referred to, are 14 times higher than those of other Australians. I make the point in passing that we have currently an inquiry being undertaken in Australia on black deaths in custody. It is one of the ramifications of this horrible statistic. Again, it is an issue which is not directly measures by the legislation or its contents but one that can hopefully be addressed with goodwill once it is in place. </PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginals in remote communities are often without basic essential services which the rest of Australia takes for granted, services for which the rest of Australia continually demands improvement and rightly so. Some communities do not even have running water. We know how important water is to human life in this country. Some of the people live in areas with a very harsh climate. Recently I was in the Rudall River region of my home State and experienced for a few brief hours just what it is like to need water. The Aboriginal culture is being threatened continually, and in some cases already has been destroyed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am talking about destruction. Let me move on. I think this will be a fairly fiery debate because there has been much point scoring in the lead-up to the debate in this chamber today and there will be over the next few sitting days and perhaps weeks. There have been a number of inquiries and investigations into the Bill. Some have been referred to already by the previous speaker. One such inquiry was by the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. I will quote selectively from page 20 of the dissenting report and we all understand what dissenting report means. Under the heading `Aboriginal Affairs in disarray' the report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the past few months, a picture of utter disorder in the administration of the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio has emerged. This is thanks largely to the persistence of Opposition senators . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I make no apology for using selective quotes because it is a fair political tactic. The persistent attacks by Opposition senators have resulted in a number of inquiries. A report by the Department of Finance on the financial management of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) was presented in March 1989. There was another report from the Department of Finance entitled Report on certain staff classification matters in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs; reports from the Public Service Commission entitled Reports on allegations about personnel management in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs; and a special audit report from the Auditor-General on the Aboriginal Development Commission and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. An inquiry was also instituted entitled Inquiry by Mr A. C. C. Menzies into Allegations as to the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. An interim report was presented in April 1989 and a final report was presented in June 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the catalysts for all these reports? Banner headlines appeared in newspapers right around Australia which alleged that a black mafia was in existence within Aboriginal affairs portfolios in Australia-within the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and within the whole aegis of Aboriginal matters. Further allegations of patronage, favouritism, nepotism and implied corruption were also made. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, we have had-and I went through them individually-a series of reports. The last report of Mr Menzies was presented in this chamber two days ago. In my reading of those reports nowhere has any of those allegations been proven. In the final stages of getting this legislation onto the books I challenge the Opposition to present evidence of those allegations. I have challenged the Opposition and we will await the evidence, as it is not contained in these reports that have been presented to us. The allegations have not been substantiated in any way. If the time were available, we could go through each and every one of the reports to see just where they are. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a sad affair that the political parties have split so dramatically on this portfolio. I will go back to the outcomes that we are looking for. There is an obvious need for governments and for politicians to do some work to improve the lot of the original inhabitants of this wonderful country. But what do we do? We turn it into a political bunfight. We point-score between ourselves in the hope of winning votes and, on the way through, we forget about the main objectives. It is obvious that political parties will point-score. But I think that the Government, in addressing these allegations and smears over the past year and a half or so, has kept in mind the firm objective; that we have to improve the lot of the original inhabitants of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We have listed very carefully what those objectives are. The Hawke Labor Government works for social justice for all Australians. The Australian Government is committed to this objective. It seeks to establish a fairer Australia and to eliminate the disadvantages due to language, religion and culture. But in a multicultural society the Australian Government seeks to ensure that all Australians have full and equitable access to available programs and services. One of the highest priorities that we have set ourselves in the social justice arena is a strategy to advance the economic, social and cultural position of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. Aboriginal Australians hold a unique place in our multicultural society. The promotion and maintenance of this uniqueness is integral to government policies and programs. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Opposition's alternative to the sentiments I have just expressed? We get accusations of patronage, favouritism, nepotism, cronyism and corruption. It has been said that individuals who do not have the right to come into this chamber under parliamentary privilege to defend themselves against accusations are accused of being sycophants and cronies. I was particularly disappointed that Senator Peter Baume used terms like that. I expect that from some other Opposition senators; I certainly did not expect that from Senator Baume. But I still hold that honourable senator in high regard. </PARA>
<PARA> We are trying to achieve with this legislation a fair and equitable social justice system in our multicultural society. I know that sections of our community reject the fact that we are a multicultural society, but there is living proof, before the eyes of Australia, in the fact that I, as a migrant to this country, am evidence that such a society exists. The legislation which is before us today provides the means by which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people can be directly involved in the processes of government, particularly as those processes affect the rights of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. That is a commendable objective but one which, in turn, finds disfavour with some Opposition senators. There have been accusations that what we are putting forward in the Bill is culturally inappropriate to Aboriginal people. The argument used by Opposition senators and many others is based on the reality that traditional Aboriginal society did not develop representative structures and placed a high value on individual autonomy. Perhaps that was so in the long distant past, but recent experiences, under coalition governments as well as under this Labor Administration, disprove the allegation that this Bill is culturally inappropriate. The major flaw in the argument is that it ignores present day realities of a pluralist society which places great store on the representative structure at all levels. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, Aboriginals have about 20 years experience with community-based bodies and organisations. They have shown in that 20-year period that they have the ability to adapt in order to take advantage of the social, political and economic structure of modern day Australia. Some examples of Aboriginal bodies which were established by the previous Fraser Government are: the National Aboriginal Conference, the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee, the Council for Aboriginal Affairs and the ADC. Senator Baume, in his contribution, also alluded to these examples. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the allegations which I have referred to went into the area of finance-how it is spent and how accountable are those organisations receiving taxpayers' funds. Certainly the reports show that there have been difficulties in certain areas. Those difficulties that are referred to did not just emerge when the Hawke Labor Government took office or when Gerry Hand was appointed Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. They emerged under a previous administration. There have been previous examinations-auditors' reports, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the ADC-which pointed out that there were a number of flaws in the way in which funds were accounted for. Those flaws have been addressed over a period. Certainly the Department of Aboriginal Affairs has had its problems, as has probably every other department of any government since this nation was established. </PARA>
<PARA> The ATSIC Bill incorporates a range of strengthened accountability measures which will ensure that the Commission's expenditures and programs are fully accountable to the Parliament. These measures do not detract from the rights and responsibilities of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It has been argued that by putting in this clause we are enhancing and furthering the control of bureaucrats over the affairs of Aboriginal people. Perhaps that is so, because the politicians are the elected representatives of the people. We have got control over how taxpayers' money is expended. In turn, we have got to be accountable for those funds and the expenditure of those funds. If we are not, then the taxpayers will take it out on us at the ballot box when the elections are held. We have to have accountability. The buck has to stop somewhere-that was not meant to be a pun-and it must stop in the Parliament with the Executive Government and with the Minister responsible. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to this Bill, we were aware of some of the deficiencies that existed in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the ADC. We have learnt from those experiences and we have built into the ATSIC Bill strengthened accountability measures which will protect taxpayers' funds. Despite the statistics I went into at the beginning of my speech, there are some Aboriginal people in Australia who are taxpayers. I hope it is not put on a banner and carried around the streets that we want more and more Aboriginal people to become taxpayers, but really that is what we are talking about if we want to get them into the labour market. If they start earning salaries and wages, they will, in turn, if they are paid enough, become taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> The ATSIC Bill, once it has been passed, will ensure that decisions designed to advance the welfare of the indigenous people will be made with the full participation of those people. They will be involved in the decision making process. It will not be some bureaucrat sitting in Canberra, Perth, Melbourne or wherever making the decisions. There will be an enormous involvement in that decision making process by Aboriginal people from the remotest parts of Australia. While there have been moves in the past to provide administrative measures to ensure such participation, this is the first time that such participation has been given legal force and embodied in legislation. I mention in passing the National Aboriginal Conference which did some good work for a period of time. It probably outlived its usefulness, but it did provide for a degree of participation that was not there before. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only are we taking that a step further but we are also actually legislating for such participation to be allowed to happen and, furthermore, to be encouraged to happen. It is unfortunate that in Australia there are some who look upon the Aboriginal people as second class or even lesser class citizens. I regret that I was not in the Parliament during a Western Australian election campaign some years ago, when Aboriginal affairs became the No. 1 issue. It was a particularly nasty campaign which will be long remembered with shame, I would suggest, not only by Western Australians but by all Australians for the degree to which it went in playing down the role of Aboriginal people in that State and their legitimate claims and demands. </PARA>

Hopefully, Senator Chaney will not jump on the bandwagon as well but will stick to debating the philosophy and the merits of this legislation rather than get into the slanging match on this legislation that occurred in Estimates committees and other places.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is the first occasion on which I have had an opportunity in this chamber to put my point of view on Aboriginal affairs. I regret that I will not now have time to say so many of the things that I had to say on this legislation and in the area of Aboriginal affairs. I hope that once the legislation is passed there can be an acceptance by all sections of the Australian community-and that includes Opposition parties-that the situation for Aboriginal people must be improved. If people do not think that it needs improvement, I refer back to the statistics I used in my introductory remarks this morning. If that is not good enough, people should come out to some of the remote communities in Western Australia, which I obviously know better than those in other States. They should go to such places as Wingelinna, Kiwikurra, Warburton-which is actually on the map-and Frog Hollow in the Kimberleys and see the conditions that human beings are living in today. I am sure that once they have seen them and witnessed the conditions for themselves-I am not necessarily addressing these remarks to the individuals in the chamber because I know that honourable senators opposite do travel and have visited some of these communities-they will see why passion is generated when we talk about this portfolio. They will know what a disgrace it is for Australians to travel abroad and have to admit that their fellow citizens are living in conditions such as these people are living in in some of these areas. I do not just pick on the names of the communities I have mentioned as bad examples. They were the names that came into my head. I do not hold them up as being the worst or the best; I note them because they are examples of the appalling living conditions that some Aboriginal people are faced with in Australia today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a very real sense it is quite inappropriate for the Senate to be debating this legislation. I draw attention to the fact that last year we celebrated the so-called Bicentenary of Australia. We celebrated 200 years of predominantly white European settlement in this country. Only a little attention was given to the fact that when we came into this country we progressively displaced and brutally treated a people who had been here for 200 times as long as that. It is estimated that those people had occupied this country for something in excess of 40,000 years. If the Aboriginal people have been in this country for 24 hours we, the representatives of the white people, have been here for seven minutes. Yet here we are in this chamber debating the future of those original inhabitants. It is in that sense that it is perhaps inappropriate that we should be debating this matter at all. Nonetheless-and I am picking up on what Senator McKiernan has just said-the appalling conditions of Aboriginal people are clearly related to what has gone on and their displacement from traditional lands and traditional cultures. Because of that we are in a position where we must address this very serious problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill 1989 is an attempt to give back to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, as far as is now possible under the existing conditions, the ability to determine their own future and the future of their peoples into some indeterminate future. It is important because the Aboriginal culture is still markedly different from the mainstream culture of Australia. I will return to that shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Australian Democrats are coming to this legislation and to this issue-the issue is really what second reading debate speeches are about-from a somewhat different perspective to that of the Opposition and the Government. Despite what the Opposition and the Government say about the recognition of cultural difference and cultural pluralism in Australia, the mainstream culture in Australia does not accept Aboriginal culture as a legitimate and separate culture. The mainstream culture in Australia is exploitative and is oriented towards economic and material values, and the difference is well exemplified by our attitude to land. Very often one finds that if one talks about Aboriginal land rights many people in the mainstream culture say, `But if you give Aboriginal people land they don't do anything with it'. This represents a total failure to understand the relationship between Aboriginal people and the land. This is also the case in relation to a number of other cultural elements. It is therefore important in the Democrats' view to recognise and preserve that cultural difference. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said during the Bicentenary, I believe that different culture has a very significant message to give to the mainstream culture. We are now aware of the damage which 200 years of white settlement has done to Australia and to the environment in this country. That difference, expressed through Aboriginal culture, of caring for their environment, is something that we desperately need to bring back into our mainstream culture. It is important that it be preserved and enhanced and that its importance be recognised in the mainstream culture. For that reason the Democrats are supporting this legislation. We believe that even though there are faults in the legislation-emphasis has been placed on the differences between ourselves and the Government-it is a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier Senator Peter Baume said-I think I am quoting him directly-that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs has had a magnificent past. He spoke about outcomes. When we look at the outcomes-Senator McKiernan dealt with some of them-we find that they are dismal. The Aboriginal people in this country are still among some of the most deprived in the world. They are deprived in a material sense. It is interesting that Senator McKiernan placed emphasis on that material sense. In other words, he was using white-type criteria to estimate that deprivation. That is significant in terms of the cultural context I was referring to a moment ago. In terms of those outcomes the result has been abysmal. Senator Baume also stressed that it is not just outcomes but process that is important. He seemed to forget that later in his speech. Surely the process should involve more Aboriginal participation, determination and self-management. That is what this legislation is about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aboriginal Development Commission was a step in the right direction, but it was an appointed body and was still subject to very strong government intervention. This Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission proposal goes somewhat beyond that. I will deal with some of the defects later, so I can pick that point up then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation is about process. The process should be, as far as possible, to allow Aboriginal people to determine the way they want their culture, their lifestyle and those material criteria to be addressed. Those who are opposing this legislation are saying that the Aboriginal people will do worse than they have already. The only point I am making here is that over the last 200 years white administration has not done very well. It has done very poorly. I think it is about time that the Aboriginal people were given a go and given an opportunity to see whether they cannot do better. At least coming from their cultural position they should be able to understand the situation of their own people within the terms of their own culture. </PARA>
<PARA> The principle to which this legislation is giving effect is to allow Aboriginal people to self-determine and self-manage as far as that is possible, given that we have had 200 years of white occupation and white domination. Inevitably, whatever is put in place must dovetail and fit in with that administrative process. Nonetheless, the principles are to elevate as far as possible self-determination and self-management. </PARA>
<PARA> Several days ago a number of newspapers around Australia ran an article about the Treasurer, Paul Keating. It was a very long article. I think it appeared in most papers on Saturday. All the copies of this article which I saw had a quotation from the Treasurer which said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats are a party without structure, without disciplines. It's a party without policies. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Adelaide Advertiser the next four or five paragraphs were quite deceitfully and deliberately deleted because the article in other newspapers then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> This, of course, is not true. The Democrats have had a comprehensive-and uncompromising-set of environment policies for a decade. </PARA>
<PARA>In relation to self-determination and self-management I would like to read into the record precisely what the Democrats' policy is because a number of journalists have claimed that the Democrats do not have policies. Our policies are ones which are adopted by the total membership in a thoroughly democratic way. They represent the views of our members at large and not those of any elite group within the party. We have in our policy document a heading `Self Determination' and it follows an extensive preamble which outlines a number of broad principles. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA> 1 In pursuit of the principles set out above, the Australian Democrats hold that the government of the Commonwealth should:</PARA>
<PARA> - guarantee and facilitate the return of the Aboriginal land base and sacred areas;</PARA>
<PARA> - guarantee land to Aboriginal peoples as compensation where this is unobtainable (eg. land excisions and land purchases);</PARA>
<PARA> - guarantee the establishment, in the manner proposed by the Aboriginal people, of a autonomous national Aboriginal Commission fully representative of their people to receive all compensatory funds for disbursement. </PARA>
<PARA> 2 Further, until such time as full Aboriginal control of Aboriginal affairs is achieved, it is recognised that in any field where responsible Aboriginal controlled agencies exist, such agencies should receive preference in allocation of funds. The Australian Democrats will support the national Aboriginal Commission if it decides to negotiate a treaty or charter having constitutional authority. </PARA>
<PARA>I will come back to that point in relation to the preamble to this legislation. That is the declared policy position from which the Democrats approach this legislation. It is certainly true that the ATSIC legislation is not supported by all Aboriginal people. Indeed, when the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs travelled around Australia, I think it is fair to say, the majority of Aboriginal witnesses were opposed to the ATSIC legislation. That is not surprising when we have any committee of inquiry into something which is controversial. It tends to drag out those who are opposed to the proposition rather than those who are in favour of it. However, as a consequence of that Senate Committee report the Government has adopted a significant number of recommendations for change to the legislation. The legislation was withdrawn, redrafted and re-presented. </PARA>
<PARA> However, a number of significant changes recommended by the Committee have not been accepted by the Government. In recent weeks we have been in close negotiation with the Government to see whether further advancement could be made on the acceptance of those further recommendations. Some advance has been made in that respect. I stress again that this negotiation has not been done from a position of opposing the legislation, as distinct from the Opposition's position. It has been done from the position of supporting the principle of the legislation, but being concerned that the legislation work as well as possible once it is in place. </PARA>
<PARA> It is certainly not true, as many Aboriginal people vehemently in favour of the legislation have asserted, that any attempt to modify the legislation represents opposition to the legislation. That has not been our position. Our position has been to attempt to modify and to improve the legislation as far as that is possible. Clearly, this is a major attempt to give back to Aboriginal people these principles of self-determination and self-management and to put in place the mechanisms which will allow that to occur. It is vital therefore that this legislation work and that it not fall flat on its face. Should it do so, it is doubtful whether any government would want to approach legislation of this sort in the near future. The abysmal state that Aboriginal affairs is now in would probably sink to an even lower level. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the question of mainstream culture. It has been obvious to me that there are in Australia a number of people with a quite frank racist outlook who are opposed to anything that would advantage Aboriginal people. Indeed, just yesterday my office had a phone call from a lady opposed to the ATSIC legislation. When we were setting out our reasons for supporting the legislation the lady's comments became extremely heated and the conversation concluded with this communicant saying that it would be better had all Aboriginal people been poisoned in those early days and that that would have solved the problem. That is the attitude of some people in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall particular interviews I have seen with former United States citizens who had come into this country and taken up land. When asked why they had come to Australia to take up land they said things like, `Well, you know how to deal with your niggers in this country'. So there are extreme racist views among some people. As a consequence there is probably very little mileage in this particular debate on either side. One hopes therefore that the debate will not descend into a party political slanging match. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated earlier, the legislation is imposing on Aboriginal people something which is not basically Aboriginal. It is inevitable that that is the case because it is a piece of legislation that does not sit with traditional culture in any way. However, one of the significant amendments which the Government did accept from the Senate Select Committee's report is that one of the first and important features of the 60 regional councils, when they are established, will be their right to review the boundaries of those regional areas and also to look at their own electoral processes and to advise the Minister if they wish to make an appropriate change, having received advice from the Australian Electoral Commission to ensure that any recommendations along that line are properly democratic. It is possible that over time the ATSIC structure will evolve throughout Australia and be different in different parts of the country but still meet the desires of people in different areas. </PARA>
<PARA> There are marked divisions between the cultural integration of Aboriginal people into mainstream European society. One finds marked differences in the educational level in the adoption of mainstream values, for instance, between the urban Aboriginal people in Sydney and the more traditional people in Arnhem Land. Clearly it is desirable therefore that the processes of election and the way in which the management is conducted at the regional council level be determined by Aboriginal people. That, after all, is the principle to which this legislation is to give effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Peter Baume also used an expression which I have heard him use before. He quoted the aphorism, `If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it'. My simple response to Senator Baume is that it is broke. Aboriginal Affairs is not working and nothing is a better indication of that fact than the sorts of claims which have been made by the Opposition over the last 12 months. It is time to try something better and something different. It is certainly true that Senator Baume can point to defects in the legislation. He and I would probably share some of the concerns over those defects. But it is not necessary that the legislation be perfect. What is necessary is that we put in place something substantially better than what we have now. The legislation can at least do that and, given its ability to evolve over time and that the mechanism for the evolution is given to the Aboriginal people, eventually we will see better and better operation of this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> The goals of self-determination must not be merely material. They must not be merely better health, better housing, the sorts of things that Senator McKiernan referred to. Those goals could be achieved in an autocratic way. One could say to Aboriginal people: `You will be healthy whether you like it or not. We will control your water supply. We will control the nutrition that you get. We will control the houses that you live in'. This legislation is not just about outcomes in that sense. It is about processes and about those outcomes coming about through Aboriginal people taking control of their own destiny and determining such things as water supply, the sorts of health services, educational processes, housing, and so on, that they want. </PARA>
<PARA> I totally reject the view that the legislation is similar to putting into the hands of veterans the administration of veterans' affairs. That analogy would hold if we were comparing veterans' affairs in the hands of veterans with, for example, pensions in the hands of pensioners. Here we are talking about a people within this country who are substantially culturally different. Therefore, it is appropriate that they be given this sort of control over their own destiny. Their culture is clearly not understood by mainstream Australians and that is where a lot of problems have come from. </PARA>
<PARA> I will briefly pick up on a few of the problems that I still have with the legislation. These will be dealt with in more detail in the committee stage. Attached to the front of the legislation is a preamble. The Australian Democrats would certainly not disagree with one word in the preamble. However, it has been made quite clear to us that the preamble has no force in law whatsoever. It has no force in law because, firstly, there is no clause in the legislation the amplification of which in a court hearing could be clarified by reference to the preamble. Secondly, it has no force in law because--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Cook" NAMEID="RF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Are you absolutely sure on that point?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) has said so and legal advice has been obtained on that. Secondly, any court seeking clarification of an Act can look to the second reading speech of the Minister. The second reading speeches on both the first and second presentations of the Bill contained the Minister's declaration that the preamble had no force in law. So the concerns which have been expressed in some quarters that the preamble should be removed because it has some force in law are totally without foundation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, for quite contrary reasons, the Australian Democrats believe that the preamble should be removed from the Bill. The reason is very simply that it has no force in law; it has no weight whatsoever. When the Act that we hope the Bill will become in the not too distant future is printed, that preamble will be attached to it. People looking at the Act in six months' time, a year's time or two years' time will read those very important words and think, `Gee, this is good; this has some force in law'. They would be misled. Therefore, it is dishonest to attach something like this, something which has no force, to legislation. I gave notice yesterday that at the appropriate time the Australian Democrats will move to separate the preamble from the legislation and to put the words in the preamble in a separate motion which we will seek to put through the Senate in a cognate debate. We believe that will advance the intention of the Government more than attaching the preamble to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason is that the preamble currently is seen by the Government as the second step in a three-step process. The first step was the passage through both Houses of Parliament on the first day of sitting in the new Parliament House of a motion recognising prior Aboriginal occupation and dispossession. The Government sees that the second step is this preamble and that that will lead to the third step, which will be a negotiated treaty-I would prefer to call it a memorandum of understanding and reconciliation-between the Government, representing mainstream Australians, and Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> In taking the words in the preamble and putting them as a separate motion to follow the Bill, I would seek to add at the end of the preamble words which say that that is indeed the intention of the Government. In other words, it is tying the Government to what it says is its intention and it is putting that before the Senate so that everybody can be quite clear that that is the third stage in this process. We believe that is more honest. It advances what the Government wants to do. I mention it here because the technicalities of removing that preamble and having it as a separate motion may not be understood. But that precisely is the effect of the motion of which I gave notice yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> I could pick up briefly one other matter at this second reading stage-that is, the payment of dividends and taxes on the capital fund of what is now the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) but which will become a capital fund within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Development Corporation. Again, the reason for this is a matter of principle and I hope the Government will see fit to assent to it. That capital fund was established when the Opposition established the ADC as a compensatory fund. It was established in recognition of Aboriginal dispossession and all that flowed from that. For that reason, it is quite wrong that the Government should seek to levy dividends and tax on earnings from that capital fund. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Select Committee accepted that view and recommended to the Government that that fund should not be expected to pay dividends or tax. It is a matter of principle. The Government may say that in terms of Government revenue the same effect could be achieved simply by allocating less money from revenue to the capital fund. That is perfectly true. However, the other proposal is a more honest way of proceeding. If the Government puts less money in, at least one knows that that is what is being done; there is not a backdoor leakage of earnings from that capital fund by way of dividends and tax. That is an important amendment which I will move at a later stage which I believe will recognise that principle which is incorporated in the preamble. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the Democrats are and always have been committed to the principle of this legislation, that of self-determination and self-management. It is an important step forward for Aboriginal people. There are still defects in the legislation. We will seek to improve the legislation as far as that is possible, but nothing could be worse than the situation which has obtained for the last 200 years in which Aboriginal people have become among the most disadvantaged in the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter that is definitely of public interest which is particularly of concern to a large body of my constituents because it has the potential to affect the welfare of 17,000 employees here in Canberra, the employees of the Australian Capital Territory Administration. It is a matter which arises somewhat unfortunately from some irresponsible and ill-considered remarks of a member of the ACT Legislative Assembly, Mr Bernard Collaery. Unfortunately, in the pursuit of publicity at any price, this gentleman seems to have ignored the serious responsibility to consider the consequences of his actions, a responsibility imposed on him by his new office. I refer in particular to the proposal which he made which I heard reported on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio news this morning that a separate ACT superannuation fund should be established for employees of the ACT Administration-that is, removing them from the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust which governs the superannuation of Commonwealth public servants, and the corollary which implied a requirement that that body would invest disproportionately, or more than commercial requirements would indicate, in the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposal causes me concern not because I am opposed to investment in Canberra-which of course I support-but because it raises three particular problems. Firstly, it is a barrier to transferability of employees between the ACT Administration and the Commonwealth and therefore erodes the terms and conditions of employment of those people. Secondly, it undermines the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust. Thirdly, it endangers the earnings of any potential ACT super fund and therefore the potential return to its members-those employees to whom I referred. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the problem of the barrier to transferability, a very important part of the discussions which led to self-government in the ACT was that people who went to work for the ACT Administration would not find themselves in a second-class environment with second-class conditions, that they did not become second-class public servants, that the ACT did not become a ghetto. I think that the governing of the ACT is a very important matter and it is therefore very important that we ensure that we have the highest quality public servants available. At the moment we are very well served in that regard. It is important that those people do not have their career opportunities diminished, their transferability into and out of the other arms of Commonwealth government limited, or the terms and conditions which were negotiated on the transfer undermined. This proposal would significantly undermine those conditions and I am opposed to it, firstly, on that ground. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I am opposed because it may well undermine the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust. The ACT employees, as far as I have been able to establish during this morning's research, constitute some 4 per cent of the contributors to the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust, and that is a significant erosion of its potential. Mr Collaery seems to fail to understand that the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust is a big player in the Australian financial and property market. It is the major ACT based financial institution. It is the player that brings us into the major investment game in a large number of those areas and provides, here in Canberra, employment opportunities for people wishing to participate in those sorts of financial management areas, in funds management, et cetera. It is not the only player-there are other substantial ones-but it is the biggest and a very important institution and should not be lightly and cavalierly undermined. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, and of particular concern, the implementation of the proposal as outlined endangers the earnings of any proposed ACT superannuation fund. If such a superannuation fund is required to invest on criteria other than maximising return to the members and contributors, it will lead to only one of two outcomes. Firstly, there could be reduced returns to retiring employees. They would not receive the same benefits as Commonwealth employees when they retired. If the same benefits were to be legislated, then it would require a major input of taxpayers' funds to top up the shortfall in the returns on the investment because they were failing to maximise the commercial return on the investment. In my view, that also offends the normal trustee principles. It would put the trustees of the fund in an intolerable position. They would find that investment `A' delivered the maximum return to their contributors, their members, the people who had given them money in their trust, but that the requirement to invest other than commercially required them to deliver a lesser return. For those reasons I think the proposal ought to be reconsidered by its author and thrown away. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be that at some stage a fund will be established for the employer's contribution from the ACT Administration-that contribution which it is required to make, on behalf particularly of the employees in its statutory authorities, to the Commonwealth to fund its share of the responsibilities of an employer. That would be a much smaller fund; it is certainly not the fund that was being referred to by Mr Collaery this morning. In my view, that would not be the most financially sound and sensible way to proceed, but at least that would have some logic. However, it would be a very small fund relatively and would not make the contribution we are talking about to undermining the Superannuation Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to Mr Collaery and anybody who supports a similar proposal: do not endanger the interests of 17,000 employees of the ACT Administration carelessly or by ill considered remarks. I emphasise in conclusion, Madam Acting Deputy President, that membership of a body with legislative powers is a serious responsibility. It should be taken seriously. Actions by people in such bodies should not be the same as the legitimate activities of one-issue groups which do not aspire to government, do not have legislative responsibility, and therefore do not have to consider the implications and the implementation of their proposals. I urge Mr Collaery to reconsider his proposal and to remove this threat from the employment conditions of 17,000 employees here in Canberra. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, for three weeks in June and July I was able to visit India, Pakistan and Nepal, and in a speech yesterday I made some observations about my visit to Nepal. I shall continue now with some observations and conclusions with regard to my visit to Pakistan, and if there is time to complete all that I wish to say, with regard to India as well. I am given to understand that I may have been the first Australian senator ever to visit Pakistan. If I was, then you, Madam Acting Deputy President, would have been the second, because a few days later your own itinerary took you to Pakistan, and perhaps the Senate will hear of that visit more widely. Certainly I am interested to learn of your meeting with the Prime Minister of that country. I was able to visit several Ministers in the relatively new Government of Pakistan, and I will come to that in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, four members of the House of Representatives have visited Pakistan in the last 10 years: Foreign Minister Peacock in 1980, Foreign Minister Hayden in 1984, Trade Minister Duffy in 1988, and the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, in February this year. But it is surprising to note the limited contact that there has been by parliamentarians and Ministers, representatives of the Australian Government, over a long period. There have been long-established, excellent diplomatic relations between Australia and Pakistan at the official level, and indeed, with some small beginnings in business contacts in recent years we are not entirely absent from the field. But there needs now to be much greater attention given by Australians and by this Parliament to understanding what is happening in Pakistan. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three principal reasons for my call for a greater interest in Pakistan. The first is the return to parliamentary democracy and an elected government. There is no longer a military regime governing the 105 million people of Pakistan. As we all observed very closely at the end of last year, the then Opposition and the most vigorously progressive party gained sufficient numbers in a wide and well-conducted election to become the Government of Pakistan, led by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. This was eight months ago, and in my visit I was able to meet several Ministers of the Government. I observed, as many others have, a newly exciting atmosphere of responding to the people that the Government represents, a new openness, and a commitment to being accountable to the electorate and for developing the country in a refreshing participatory way by seeking to serve the people. </PARA>
<PARA> Reform is in the air. Pakistan also wishes to become a member of the Commonwealth of Nations again. The Parliament in Pakistan is interested to ensure that parliamentary democracy is effective and that new procedures are adopted, including any that may be deemed appropriate after listening to the experience of other parliaments, including Australia. There has been a strong commitment to human and political rights in Pakistan over the last eight months. This refreshing return to democracy is welcomed in Australia and, I am sure, is welcomed by senators in this chamber. We need to take account of this and to make sure that we have increased contact and discussion and that we pay attention to these events. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, there ought to be increased contact because the prospects for trade between Australia and Pakistan are considerably increased and increasing. In 1988 the level of Australian exports to Pakistan stood at $A127m, and Australian imports from Pakistan in 1988 were somewhat less, $A73m. So there is a modest trade of some $200m, which, in the next few years, could well double. The opportunities for increase are real and there is a new outwardly looking, much more export oriented approach in Pakistan. The Pakistan Government, business, and indeed-and in a quite bipartisan way, it is not a controversy between various areas of political opinion within the country-everybody in Pakistan is looking for the economy there to be a part of the international economy. There are infrastructure needs for capital programs and the wide range of economic development needs in a developing country. </PARA>
<PARA> There is not sufficient awareness in this country to the opportunities for Australians to become a part of that growing economy and, indeed, there are opportunities for Pakistan exports to meet some of our needs. So, I believe increased attention should be given to Australia-Pakistan trade. This is in a general pattern of Australia looking much more carefully towards the whole of South Asia. Our trade with India is very considerable at the moment. It stands at a half a billion dollars of exports and a quarter of a billion dollars of imports. Trade with Pakistan is considerably less but it is, relative to the populations in the two countries, very comparable and when we in this chamber and in Australia look to our links with South Asia we need to make sure that all the opportunities in India and in Pakistan are taken up. </PARA>
<PARA> The third principal reason why we should take an increased interest in Pakistan is that after 10 years of civil war in the neighbouring country of Afghanistan there have been some recent achievements which will lead to a greater expectation of some resolution of the conflict there. After enormous international pressure, including that from members of this chamber on all sides, the Soviet Union has withdrawn its substantial number of troops from Afghanistan following 10 years of occupying that country. Whilst the Soviet military assistance to the present government in Kabul is enormous-plane loads and truck loads on a daily basis that are fearsome in their huge quantities of armaments and that are fuelling a continuing civil war-there is, nevertheless, a recent call by Prime Minister Bhutto for a negotiated settlement between the various elements in the civil war in Afghanistan. This call by the Prime Minister of Pakistan has been supported in the United States and more widely and therefore there are considerable prospects that the mujahideen and the various elements resisting the present Kabul government will take very seriously the option ahead of negotiating to achieve free elections and a stable government in Afghanistan. </PARA>
<PARA> The impasse in the battle of Jalalabad has been a fact for the last four or five months. This strategic battle on the main road between the Khyber Pass and Kabul has led to there not being a victory by either side. A great deal of the ground has been won by the mujahideen forces and yet the actual citadel of this provincial town, Jalalabad, has not fallen. Again, a fearsome amount of armaments from both sides is being thrown at each other in that battle. All the more this means that the prospect of a negotiated settlement that leads to a stable outcome for Afghanistan is the prospect that we in this Senate chamber should all look to. </PARA>
<PARA> Afghanistan is so closely the neighbour of Pakistan that some four million Afghans who have fled their homes have become refugees in Pakistan. This is the greatest refugee concentration anywhere in the world. The repercussions of this prospect for more stability in Afghanistan affects the whole region, and not least Pakistan. </PARA>
<PARA> For these several reasons these new developments over the last nine months have led us all in this chamber to give much more attention to Pakistan and we should pursue these interests, I believe, very carefully. Pakistan has 105 million people-only about one-eighth the population of India-and it has a gross national product (GNP) of some $US38 billion. Compare this with India, with $233 billion, and Australia, with even more-$246 billion. We see a small economy and a very low GNP per capita statistic, but it is an economy of comparable size with the Philippines, and a little smaller than Thailand, and one that is in our region and which has development needs which we need to take account of. </PARA>
<PARA> The defence needs of Pakistan ought to be very apparent to us. It sees itself as being in a precarious situation, bordering four much larger neighbours-India, China, Iran and the Soviet Union-and having a long common border with the buffer country, that very troubled country, Afghanistan, to which I have referred. Throughout the entire existence of Pakistan these last 42 years it has been in this precarious situation. It therefore has a very active defence policy and a very careful foreign affairs assessment of its own security within that region. Very rightly Pakistan is making sure that it is ready to meet any threat to its security. We in this chamber need to take account of those tensions and do all that we can to ensure that those tensions do not get out of hand. </PARA>
<PARA> Very briefly I should refer to Australia's involvement at the diplomatic level. I wish to commend the representation that we have in our Embassy there and the leadership of Ambassador Geoffrey Price and his staff. They are doing an excellent job. We have a new location for a new Embassy building and I would implore the Government to get on with it and actually commit the funds to seeing it established. Also I believe that Austrade should be represented full time by a resident person with access to Islamabad and Karachi. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I look forward to the visit of the Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan, Mr Wasim Sajjad, and other senators I met while I was there who were very welcoming to me and whom we in this Senate should be very welcoming to when they come in October. I thank all of those who assisted me in my preparation for the visit to Pakistan, including Australian academics, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Parliamentary Library, my colleagues, those who met me in Lahore and Islamabad and everyone who assisted me so admirably in this most valuable visit on my part to Islamabad. I will need to continue my remarks about India on a subsequent occasion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Has the Minister noted today's report that Australia's biggest employer, Coles Myer Ltd, estimates it will have to borrow another $67m a year because of the changes in the collection of company tax announced in the Budget, and that this will cost the company a net $7m in added interest payments? In view of the very significant amounts involved in this one example-and there are obviously thousands of others-I ask the Minister: has the Government any estimate of the likely cost to companies of its Budget proposals? If so, what is it? If no estimate is available, is this just another example of a bright idea of Treasury to increase Government revenue without any detailed consideration of the practical impact of the decision?</PARA></TALK.START>

I suppose it is one of the biggest companies in Australia and, no doubt, the figures relating to that company would probably be higher than for any other company. I was asked a question yesterday about the cash flow effects of this tax. If Coles Myer claims it will cost it that sum each year, as has been put in this question, that is incorrect.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the report to which Senator Colston refers. I think it is under section 51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act that radar equipment, if it is fitted to a car and assuming the car itself is tax deductable-let us say it is a business vehicle and not a private vehicle-just like a wireless, air-conditioning or, for that matter I suppose, the brakes and radiator, is part of the vehicle and is, therefore, tax deductable. I understand that the Treasurer has suggested to the Premier of New South Wales that the appropriate way to deal with this problem is for the States to legislate against the fitting of radar devices to private vehicles rather than adopting the more clumsy way of trying to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act for the same purpose. I presume the Treasurer has made the same suggestion to other State Premiers who have approached him on the matter, but I am not sure of that.</PARA></TALK.START>

Following Mr Keating's remarks yesterday, as reported in the Sydney Morning Herald today, that it is really the Treasurer who determines social welfare matters such as `family allowance supplements . . . superannuation . . . pension changes, assets tests' and so on, I ask: will the Minister explain why the Budget did not include extending the pensioner health benefit (PHB) card to all aged persons at a cost estimated by the Life Insurance Federation of Australia of $165m, given that this would still have produced a Budget surplus of $9 billion? Given that the PHB card benefits are subject to a sudden death income and assets test and have a profound influence on the investment behaviour of many retirees, would not the general availability of the PHB card increase incentives for retired persons to maximise their retirement income without fear of losing the card and, hence, the benefits that go with it?</PARA></TALK.START>

There are 165 million reasons why it was not done. To say that because there was a large surplus therefore the Government should blow $165m here and $100m or $1 billion somewhere else is not, in my view, a very impressive argument. It is true that the cutoff is a sudden death cutoff but, if the PHB card were to be made available to all persons in receipt of full or part pensions, there would still be a sudden death cutoff at some other point, that is, the point at which a person loses entirely entitlement to a pension.</PARA></TALK.START>

I remind the Minister that last year the Government was quite prepared to cut company tax by 20 per cent from 49c to 39c in the dollar at a cost of $2 billion, at a time when many companies were paying no tax at all.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been a lot of changes made to taxation, over the last four years in particular. It is true that so far as cash payments are concerned, the company tax rate applicable to this financial year and to last financial year's income has been reduced. It is also true that company tax collection-I will not guarantee these figures because I am going from memory-is in double figures this year, in spite of the reduction in the company tax rate, following an even higher increase in company tax collection for the previous year. That does not include the fringe benefits tax which is largely paid by companies, the estimated revenue for this year from which, I think, is in the order of $1.3 billion. The estimated revenue for this year from capital gains tax is $500m. In other words, the net effect of the changes that have been made to the tax law in the last four years is generally to reduce rates by broadening the base. That is a major reason why we have produced a Budget this year with a surplus in excess of $9 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>

Revenue, as a proportion of GDP, is not lower than it was in 1981-82, he is suggesting that the timing of payments should have been changed. As a result of the broadening of the tax base and, of course, the growth that has taken place in the previous year, we have been able to produce a Budget with a very large surplus, with taxation levels being maintained-or slightly more than maintained in real terms-as a proportion of GDP at what they were in the previous year, in spite of a very big reduction in personal income tax collection, a reduction in rates, some adjustment of thresholds and the cut in the company tax rate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a result of the Government's review of its youth strategy, the Government announced in the Budget that it will spend $100m over the next four years to ensure that disadvantaged young people benefit from the reforms in the youth area achieved by the Government since entering office. While the Government's present youth strategy has been successful in increasing school retention rates to year 12 to 58 per cent and halving youth unemployment since 1983, that is not sufficient. The Government recognises that some young people such as the homeless, those from low income families and those who have been unemployed for long periods have not been able to share fully in these advances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Key elements of the package to which I have referred include, first, responding to the needs of homeless youth through more than doubling the availability of secure accommodation and, importantly, funding a mediation service designed to prevent the circumstances in which youth homelessness develops; secondly, providing from January 1990 an extra $14 per week to homeless youth and others who have clearly established independence from their parents; thirdly, providing money for the development of an innovative health service for young people targeted especially at those in high need locations; and, fourthly, providing improved access to information and advice for disadvantaged young people, including the opening of 20 new youth access centres.</PARA>
<PARA> I know that Senator Childs, who asked this question, has a particular interest in the education and training of youth. I am sure he will be pleased to learn that additional assistance will be given in these areas. I refer to two particularly important measures: first, improved participation in education for a new initiative targeted at government schools with low secondary retention rates; and, secondly, significant upgrading of labour market measures to encourage and assist unemployed and other disadvantaged young people to make the transition back into employment, education and training. This will mean that all 16- and 17-year-olds who have been unemployed for 12 months or more will be assisted through a comprehensive package of assistance including joint interviews by the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Department of Social Security, access to labour market program assistance and new incentives to get back to work, such as a $50 employment entry payment.</PARA>

I refer to the Minister's attempt yesterday to defend the Budget decision on company tax collections by arguing that companies enjoyed a deferral not available to individuals. Does the Minister acknowledge that the proposal to collect 85 per cent of company tax within 15 days of the end of the financial year could lead to great cash flow difficulties because of extended credit terms inherent in business operations-sometimes between 90 and 120 days-offered by certain types of businesses? In other words, does he agree that the circumstances of companies and individuals are different because wage and salary earners get paid evenly over the year whereas many commercial enterprises have an uneven cash flow and that cash flow generally lags reported profit? Does he further agree that there will simply not be enough accountants to finalise the accounts for small corporations in time for them to pay the first instalments of tax within 15 days of the end of the financial year? This will be particularly critical in circumstances of declining profitability compared with the previous year. Will the Government reconsider its Budget decision to penalise small businesses which will either have to estimate income for the year just ended or pay tax on the basis of the previous year's income, which may bear little relevance to their current situation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The change that has taken place in the fiscal outcome, the Budget bottom line, or whatever one wants to call it, since Labor took office in 1983 is that a $9 billion deficit has been turned into a $9 billion surplus. That has been done whilst revenue remains at the same proportion of gross domestic product (GDP)-that is, 26.2 per cent-as it was in 1981 and 1982. The bottom line is that a deficit of $9 billion has been changed to a surplus of $9 billion while revenue has remained the same. The reason is that during the last four years an aggregate of 8.1 per cent has been taken off outlays in real terms. During the same period, and indeed a couple of years prior to those four years, the economy was also growing. So outlays as a proportion of GDP-that is, of the whole economy-have fallen by almost six percentage points.</PARA></TALK.START>

So revenue is the same. A deficit of $9 billion has been turned into a surplus of $9 billion. There is no mystery about that. Outlays have been brought down in real and absolute terms four years in a row while at the same time the economy has been growing. If Senator Baume's Party ever gets back into government, I will be amazed if it produces a Budget bottom line or a fiscal record anywhere near that. Throughout the 26 years that those opposite were in government-between 1953 and 1983, with a break of a few years in between-it did not produce one Budget surplus.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have heard expressions of concern about the matter that investment might be secured in favour of real estate investment, or non-factory construction investment which, with the possible exception of tourist hotels, is not likely to have any significant impact, or any impact at all, on our external account problems. At a breakfast which I attended in Melbourne this morning, Mr Loton from Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd echoed those concerns. Many of us share those concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There was a spectacular example reported on the front page of the Daily Telegraph this morning that the New South Wales Government has a particularly grandiose plan to blow a lot of money on a bit of construction investment that certainly will not do anything for our current account problems. I know some people might say that the same could be said about this building, but the plans to construct this building were really set in concrete about 10 years ago. Whether it was a good decision at the time or not, there was not any realistic option but to continue with it from the time this Government came into office. In saying that I am not being particularly critical of the Government which made the decision to build it, although I think its costings were probably a bit shonky, and deliberately shonky, from the beginning. It may be said that this is also an extravagant building, but the proposals by the New South Wales Government for its building are reported on the front page of the Daily Telegraph in these terms:</PARA>

<PARA>This is a particularly inopportune time, or stupid time, to be incubating plans to do that sort of thing. I would have thought it was painfully obvious that such a proposal would do nothing for the country's fundamental economic problems other than aggravate them. I may say that I am surprised that Mr Greiner is a party to this-if, indeed, he is a party to it. In my view, Mr Greiner, particularly taking into account the handicaps he has to work under-by which, of course, I mean having the lead weight of the National Party in his saddlebags-seems to have governed reasonably well. There have been occasions when he has not been able to keep the National Party Ministers away from the honey-pot. He has not been entirely successful at that, but policy-wise he seems to have adopted the gratuitous advice I gave him about 12 months ago, which was to ignore members of the National Party, just ride roughshod over them and put the boot into them. Basically he seems to have done that, and I am very pleased that he has taken my advice. I wish he could also keep them away from the public honey-pot more successfully than he has done, but perhaps he will improve in that respect. If the report in the Daily Telegraph is correct, I trust that Mr Greiner in his own interests, in the interests of the State of New South Wales and in the broader interests of the nation puts a stop to it very quickly.</PARA>

The Government did consult with the States and the Northern Territory in developing its position on the declaration. However, the legislative responsibility of the State and Territory governments for local government is explicitly mentioned in Australia's statement of support for the declaration. The declaration is a code of conduct for dealing with local government. It does not have the status of a treaty, as I said before. The Government recognises that the declaration can act as a useful guide in developing the relationship between central governments and local government.</PARA>
<PARA> There have been moves in relation to this by individuals and organisations of fairly dubious political merit. I do not say that in any gratuitous way because I know there are senators on the honourable senator's side of the chamber who do agree with the Government's stand in relation to giving this in principle support. I will not embarrass them by naming them, but I know because I have spoken with them about it. So regardless of what the honourable senator's official Party position will be on this matter, I know that those members who genuinely support local government agree with this in principle support.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I was not aware that Mr Porter was under any pressure to resign. I am certain that sort of behaviour never occurs in this Parliament. It is unthinkable that such a thing could occur. I have gone on the public record, maybe in a sense of history, in justifying by-elections. I certainly justified the by-elections in Adelaide and Oxley. I certainly did not mind the other one that occurred in Groom. I really think that politics is a process of renewal. I do not want to get renewed yet. However, politics is a process of renewal, and I think an occasional by-election on both sides of the House is a pretty good idea, especially if it is not in a marginal Labor seat. The cost-at least in a direct sense, including public funding and the various costs-of the last three by-elections was $231,000 for Adelaide, $198,000 for Port Adelaide, and $195,000 for Groom. That does not include all the hidden costs that come to the taxpayer by Ministers and shadow Ministers uselessly trooping through one after the other like a troop of baboons trying to get votes. All those hidden costs probably double the total cost in the end, but they never show up in any of the expenditure. I am sure that if there is a desire by Mr Porter to leave parliamentary life now he has no future in politics he would attune that to his future employment needs. I do not think we can condemn someone, if a job comes up and his own Party has deserted him, for jumping at the opportunity and for allowing-what was his name?-Mr McLachlan to come into Parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are several elements to the question asked by Senator Hamer. As to the last point, I can give him an absolutely categorical assurance that the Director of Public Prosecutions-being an independent statutory officer and to that extent I guess we could say created and protected by this Parliament-would not be subject to any pressure whatsoever from this Government in relation to the discharge of his very onerous responsibilities. It is in a sense to the contrary as this Parliament has indicated, particularly by the amendments that were properly carried late last year, that it wants all the ordinary processes, both at the prosecution and trial levels, which are a feature of our criminal trials system in Australia, to operate. That would, of course, include, as I said, the independence of decision making by the Director of Public Prosecutions. He would certainly be under no pressure from this Government to, in the honourable senator's terms, justify the legislation by securing a prosecution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the cost of the Special Investigation Unit, the total expenditure as at 30 June 1989 has been $3,713,871.76. I will table the complete breakdown of that expenditure. As to the state of the particular investigation that has been undertaken, I believe that the 609 files that have been opened as at 11 August 1989 have been divided into categories. This more or less accords with the information I have relayed to the Senate before. Some 345 have been suspended for such reasons as the person not being able to be located in Australia, or an Australian citizen is permanently living abroad and extradition is not appropriate, and so on. The remaining 264 files have been categorised as being still active. Of those remaining 264 files, it is Mr Greenwood's opinion that fewer than 50 will result in probative evidence being obtained with only a percentage of those possibly resulting in prosecution.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator REYNOLDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am continually reminded by local government that road funding is a very important issue for it. I know it is difficult for local government to maintain roads to the levels that it believes it should keep. However, I believe that the Federal Government has been extremely responsible in the level of road funding that it has given over its period in office. This year $1.3 billion has been allocated for Australian roads. This level of funding represents an increase of $120m, or almost 10 per cent, over the 1988-89 levels of funding. Local government, along with all fair-minded people in this chamber, will recognise that a 10 per cent increase for road funding in the current economic climate is extremely responsible. I am sure Senator Walsh would agree that it is extremely generous. Of this money, $890m will be spent on the national highway and the national arterial road systems, and more than $440m will be allocated for State arterial and local roads. The local road element will be maintained in real terms again this financial year at $303.1m for 1989-90, and an estimated $297.4m will be passed on to local government for its purposes. Mr President, I think you would agree that, as much as the Opposition might criticise the Government for every effort it makes in its Budget Statement, nevertheless we have been extremely responsible-indeed, generous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to acknowledge the interest of honourable senators opposite in raising the matter of road funding and funding to local government. In reference to my earlier answer to Senator Bishop, it is good to know that there are honourable senators on the other side of the chamber concerned about local government and road funding issues. However, while Senator Panizza, Senator Bjelke-Petersen, Senator Calvert and I am sure a number of others have raised concerns in the past, I am sure that they will be somewhat surprised to find that Senator Stone, who would have responsibility for determining levels of finance in any unlikely future coalition government, has a very different view in relation to local government and certainly in relation to road funding. At a public meeting in Goondiwindi in Queensland, with local government representatives present, Senator Stone said:</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know if we, as a Nation can afford good roads . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I am not sure why Senator Boswell is smiling, because here is his colleague in Queensland, a senator representing the National Party of Australia, I assume, saying that he does not believe that we as a nation can afford good roads. Wait for this! He also said:</PARA>
<PARA>I would not be prepared to increase road funding.</PARA>
<PARA>The local government people present at that meeting in Goondiwindi, being generally of a mind to support the parties sitting opposite-represented by people such as Senator Boswell, Senator Stone and Senator Bjelke-Petersen-were most concerned to hear this. No doubt they gave Senator Stone their No. 1 vote, yet he then turns around and says, `No money for road funding'. In fact they subsequently passed a resolution which, Mr President, if you will permit me, I will take up the time of the Senate to read:</PARA>
<PARA>This conference appoint a Deputation to meet with leaders of the Liberal and National Parties in Canberra to discuss road funding, particularly in rural areas.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question of the inflation adjustment of interest payments for tax purposes has been discussed for a long time and was the subject of 20 or 25 pages in the 1985 draft White Paper on taxation policy that was prepared by the Australian Treasury. Debate on the issue appears to have been sparked off by some rather loose comments made by the Leader of the Opposition a couple of weeks ago during his mock election campaign, and it is not at all clear what Mr Peacock plans precisely to do. I note that most of the senior members of his front bench have been running away from the proposition at 100 miles an hour ever since. But I did see the Treasurer's paper delivered last week which sets out eight problems associated with implementing a Peacock-type proposal and of course it would, as the Treasurer's paper showed, introduce major distortions into the taxation system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will not attempt to deal with all the distortions or all the points the Treasurer made but a very important distortion relates to the type of grandfathering of existing debt which is a key element of most of the proposals of this type which are put up. I can give one example. It was reported in the Australian on 5 June that the shadow Treasurer, Dr Hewson, in partnership with one of his merchant banker mates, had spent $900,000 on a property at Bowral. The property was reported to be rented for some $15,000 a year-a very low return on a $900,000 property. If Dr Hewson and his partner borrowed, say, $800,000 of the purchase price and were paying 18 per cent interest and they had equal shares, the exercise would provide Dr Hewson with a tax deduction of at least $64,000 and a tax benefit of around $32,000. If the proposition were to be introduced and to be grandfathered, as I understand was suggested, those sorts of investments would be totally protected from the change in the rules. So purely passive investment-some people might even call it speculation-would be grandfathered but, at the same time, a genuine entrepreneur who wanted to borrow new money to build a factory, start a mine or do something that would actually help to deal with the country's fundamental economic problem, the continuing current account deficit, would be penalised. It is difficult to see where the economic efficiency is in that sort of proposal or where the fair go is.</PARA>

However, given the announcement in the Budget that a prerequisite for the receipt of the young homeless allowance will, from 1 November 1989, be the provision of a tax file number, has the Government any plans to cater for the strong likelihood that young people who have left home, sometimes fleeing from a violent situation, will not necessarily have stopped to ensure that they have the necessary documentation such as a birth certificate, school report or whatever?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This will not take very long. It is probably of interest to Senator McGauran as he is probably young enough to qualify for these. In terms of the Government's commitment in this area, the Government has been keen to provide adequacy and accessibility through the youth homelessness allowance and to provide assistance. In the Budget brought down two days ago these two priorities were met. In doing so, we were mindful of the Burdekin report which asked us to address assistance levels and the waiting period problem. We were also mindful of a Department of Social Security survey on long term Jobsearch allowance recipients which showed that those who were in receipt of the youth homelessness allowance were among the most disadvantaged young people. They had the highest housing costs and were also the most unlikely to have family support. So the initiatives that Senator Powell mentioned provide for an increase in the allowance of $7.50 a week and also indexation from January 1990 in line with the annual indexation of the independent rate of Austudy for 16- and 17-year-olds. There are also changes to Austudy payments for those who qualify for the living at home rate, as well as higher rates for Jobsearch allowance recipients under provisions announced on Tuesday night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another part of Senator Powell's proposition relating to reduced waiting periods should also be tackled, because waiting periods are not only being reduced-generally, across the board, waiting periods will be reduced from six weeks to two weeks-but also they will be abolished in circumstances where young people cannot live at home either because of domestic violence, sexual abuse, or for comparable exceptional circumstances. In essence, that is a picture of some of the Government's initiatives in this area.</PARA>
<PARA> The other part of the question goes to the utilisation of the tax file number. It is true that the tax file number will be used, but it is also fair to say that under an agreement which has already been reached with the Australian Taxation Office the problems that Senator Powell raised should and will be accommodated. The problem was raised of those clients who cannot under a normal regime prove their identity. Under the existing procedures there is already allowance for that. The Department of Social Security will be able to certify as to people's identity in cases where applicants would have difficulty under the guidelines used in post offices and, in so being able to certify, the sorts of problems raised should be accommodated. We do not intend to negate the direction of our policy in this area. It is a policy which has been comprehensively worked out, and we will ensure that the people to whom Senator Powell refers, who are probably the most in need, will not miss out on benefits because of that sort of hiccup.</PARA>

The court ruled that there were no extenuating circumstances. As Senator Collins has said, they were convicted on the basis of so-called common purpose with a mob of 300 that attacked the policeman's house. The Upington murder took place against a background of heightened racial tension after police tear gassed a meeting, and the murdered policeman is alleged to have fired on the crowd in question.

Lawyers for the Upington 14, as they now are, have petitioned the Chief Justice of the Appellate Division for leave to appeal against their conviction and death sentences. Leave to appeal was originally refused by the trial judge. This current petition constitutes the last step in the legal process. Should it be rejected, clemency will be sought from the State President. The Australian Government, in accordance with normal practice in these matters, will await the outcome of the appeal process before taking any further action on the matter. However, should the appeal fail the Government would wish to make further strong representations in order to try to save the lives of these people.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Australian Government deplores any act of wanton violence, particularly if it leads to death. However, we have consistently and universally opposed the imposition of the death sentence as being a cruel and inhuman form of punishment. If the sentences are proceeded with, as many people fear will be the case, they will only exacerbate an already very tense political climate which is caused by the continued denial of political freedoms to the vast majority of South Africa's people.</PARA>

<TITLE>PRESCRIBED DRUGS: ABUSE</TITLE>
<ANSWER PAGE="271" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="RESOURCES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Tuesday Senator Knowles asked a question of Senator Richardson, who was then the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health. Since I have returned and I am now in that position, I can answer the question that was put on notice then by Senator Richardson. I presume that Senator Knowles's question related to a general slur on the medical profession by Dr Andrew Dunn of Perth which appeared in an article in the West Australian newspaper on Monday. Dr Dunn made the extraordinary and baseless allegation that doctors are abusing Medicare bulk billing systems to line their own pockets and to overprescribe drugs to drug addicts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The facts of the matter are that within the last week the Medical Board of Western Australia has advised the Health Insurance Commission (HIC) of the names of three doctors who have been before it in relation to prescribing practices. One doctor has been suspended for three months while the other two have been found guilty of improper professional conduct and have been reprimanded. Four other doctors are believed to be under investigation by the Medical Board. I point out that Medicare data held by the HIC does not contain information about the nature of a consultation, such as what drugs a practitioner might prescribe for particular patients. The HIC can examine a doctor's medical servicing profile to determine whether there are any irregularities. The HIC has provided advice that it believes in this instance these doctors' medical servicing profiles should be examined. However, the Government believes that the Medical Board of Western Australia is the appropriate body to examine these doctors' prescribing habits. I also point out that the Board has made no reference to these doctors' use of bulk billing and neither would it be logical to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that doctors would be able to exchange a quick easy prescription for a consultation charge, as Dr Dunn puts it, whether or not bulk billing existed. A doctor could just as easily bill the patients but accept the rebate as full payment as many doctors do and have done under Medicare and under previous private health insurance arrangements. Thus the patient has not been bulk billed but still faces no out of pocket costs; the effect is the same. In any event, it seems strange that Dr Dunn could seriously argue that `druggies', as he calls them, who want additional prescription drugs are not going to be prepared to pay an extra couple of dollars above the Medicare rebate for doctors' visits. After all, unless they are pensioners or disadvantaged people the prescriptions which they get are still going to cost them up to $11 or $12.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the insinuation about doctors who bulk bill, experience under Medicare has demonstrated that doctors who bill their patients are just as likely to overservice as those who bulk bill Medicare. I point out that some 60 per cent of all general practitioners' services in Western Australia are bulk billed. That means that most Western Australian GPs bulk bill at least some of their patients and many bulk bill a large number of patients. The Government therefore regards the allegations made by Dr Dunn about `unscrupulous bulk billing doctors' as an unsubstantiated slur on a largely honourable profession.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) report on bleached kraft pulp mills is of great significance to the future of the pulp and paper industry of Australia, an industry which in this time of record balance of payments deficits offers a positive solution to this problem. This report followed recognition by the Government that it was not equipped to evaluate properly the technical status of North Broken Hill's proposed bleached kraft pulp mill for Tasmania, or the status of the bleached kraft pulp mills in general. CSIRO scientists with experience in chemical pulping technology, oceanography and fisheries went to Finland, Sweden and North America to investigate modern bleached kraft mills and government controls in other countries, and to report on possible alternatives to chlorine bleaching. </PARA>
<PARA> The findings of this committee, in summary, were as follows. Firstly, the only significant international market for short fibred pulp obtainable from eucalyptus is bleached kraft pulp, and to achieve the brightness demanded by the market there is currently no alternative to using chlorine. Secondly, the countries visited, although often having a history of intense environmental concern compared with Australia, were not curtailing the development of their bleached kraft pulp industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, modern bleached kraft pulp mills were using considerably less chlorine than a few of the old mills which had been associated with environmental problems and there appeared to be no short to medium term risk of damage to the environment. Because none of the new mills had been operating for a long time, the possibility of some environmental damage in the long term could not be discounted. However, the scientists noted that so long as base line studies were conducted, followed up by continual monitoring and a commitment to introduce new commercially proven technology, if appropriate, then the long term risks to the environment, if any, would be minimal or insignificant. </PARA>
<PARA> The report is not only significant because it supports the belief that modern bleached kraft mills can operate at an acceptable level of risk to the environment but also significant for Australia because 4.8 million tonnes of woodchips-which, when exported, are currently valued at approximately $350m-have the potential to earn $1,200m as bleached kraft pulp. The difference represents an $850m net reduction to the deficit. Australia has a significant and growing trade deficit in forest products. The deficit in forest products has grown from a mere $573m in 1980-81 to over $1.6 billion in 1988-89-a threefold increase in less than a decade. During the decade exports doubled but were overwhelmed by the doubling of the value of imports from a much greater base. </PARA>
<PARA> The major component of the forest product trade deficit is paperboard and pulp. Yet the major export category is woodchips. During the history of the woodchip export industry a combination of economic and market constraints has prevented the development of an export based pulp and paper industry. When these were overcome last year environmental concerns further delayed development. Hopefully, the adoption of the CSIRO report, coupled with the production of environmental guidelines acceptable to government and industry, will result in our wood resources being fully processed at home, thus greatly increasing our export earnings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am afraid to say that this report-Pulp Mills: Modern Technology and Environmental Protection-is very disappointing. It is quite obvious that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) team came back with the information which it knew would most please the Government, which controls its purse strings. The blinkered findings are nothing more than a chlorine bleached whitewash of the Wesley Vale type kraft pulp mills. If we need any verification of that it is that Senator Watson supports this report. Of course, he would support anything which would be environmentally hazardous to the State of Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report reveals its bias in a number of areas. For one thing the CSIRO dismisses the wood efficient thermomechanical pulping process, even though the Swedes have just built a new plant to supply environmentally friendly paper for the highly demanding computer industry. An article entitled ` ``Green'' look for computer print-outs' in the New Scientist of 15 April states:</PARA>
<PARA> One of Europe's largest suppliers of paper this week launched the world's first `environmentally friendly' stationery for computers. Roffs Stralfors, a Swedish paper company, has run trials of the paper on the Swedish market and now plans to exploit the large potential market in Britain. </PARA>
<PARA>I will refer to that market later because CSIRO said that it is declining. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>This market has been created by growing concern over the use of chlorine as a bleaching agent in the paper industry-</PARA>
<PARA>CSIRO says there is no concern and that there is no market for this paper; the New Scientist seems to indicate differently-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . and its implication in the release of harmful dioxins into the environment. </PARA>
<PARA>This report by the CSIRO also does not seem to realise the present state of thermomechanical pulping in Tasmania. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>Thermomechanical pulping in its present stage of development is not suited to processing mature eucalypts. </PARA>
<PARA>What has Australian Newsprint Mills Ltd (ANM) been doing at Boyer if not using mature eucalypts from our Tasmanian virgin forests-400-year-old trees? The CSIRO people are not even experts. They are biased, certainly, but they are not experts. They take the line of always saying what will please the people who want Wesley Vale kraft-type pulp mills. They dismiss biological damage. On page 6 of the report, it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Such findings and actions are obviously cause for concern. However, in the Australian context these must be evaluated in the light of a modern pulp mill discharging effluent into receiving waters which have not been subjected to some 80 years of pollution from pulp mills. </PARA>
<PARA>Bass Strait has been subject to pollution from pulp mills for many years. The CSIRO scientists do not seem even to recognise the fact that Associated Pulp and Paper Mills Ltd (APPM) has been pouring effluent into Bass Strait for years. </PARA>
<PARA> The most damaging indictment of the CSIRO I can make is that it distorts the facts on the future need for unbleached paper. Unbleached paper is the fastest growing section of the paper industry. The demand for it is burgeoning. In this country the paper products division of the oil company Castrol has signed contracts with the Swedish Government to import unbleached toilet paper, unbleached sanitary napkins and unbleached coffee filters because of the growing demand for such paper. All over the world people are turning to processes which are environmentally friendly. They are now aware that the environment is harmed by chlorine bleached papers and kraft-type pulp mills. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other ways of making paper. We can re-cycle paper, certainly, but we can make new paper in an environmentally friendly manner by using thermo-mechanical pulping and hydrogen peroxide bleaches, methods which the CSIRO dismisses because it knows that this Government and the industry wants to use the cheap, nasty and dirty kraft pulp mill process and chlorine bleaches. It expects us to swallow it; we will not. As a nation, we will not swallow the stuff. That is why I am reiterating my call for a full-scale inquiry into pulp mills. This report is nothing but a whitewash and should be disregarded. </PARA>

<PARA> I also take Senator Sanders up on one other point. On the basis of an article in the New Scientist, Senator Sanders said that there was a burgeoning market for unbleached paper. He wants to believe that, because it happens to suit his position. The market for unbleached paper in terms of the development of the pulp and paper industry in this country is totally unrealistic for us. One reason is that we would then belong to a captive international market-place largely held by the Japanese, not an open market-place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before making specific comments on the report entitled Pump Mills: Modern Technology and Environmental Protection, I associate Opposition senators with the comments made by Senator Button in defending the scientific integrity of Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation officers who were responsible for the production of the report. Whatever one may think of the conclusions of the report, it is not correct to impugn the scientific reputation and integrity of the officers who produced the report. Indeed, the only thing I can say is that I am not surprised that the attack was made, given the fact that the report is a scientific analysis which, on the basis of the known facts, has come to conclusions fundamentally unacceptable to the Australian Democrats. It has been evident today that Senator Sanders, therefore, instead of playing the ball, has played the men and impugned the integrity, motivation and competence of those who prepared the report. I join Senator Button in rejecting that attack.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report would not have been produced had the Government not been forced by pressure put upon it by the Liberal and National parties to undertake a proper evaluation of the circumstances surrounding the construction of pulp mills in Australia following the debacle of the Wesley Vale pulp mill proposal, which was occasioned primarily by the Federal Government's failure to develop and promulgate guidelines which investors and people who might be interested in establishing pulp mills in Australia needed to have available to them. </PARA>
<PARA> In the statement released by Senator Button, by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, on 20 July, an undertaking was given by Senator Button that guidelines would be finalised and made public by no later than 30 November. I hope it will be possible for the guidelines to be finalised at an earlier date so that the Parliament will have the opportunity before it rises to debate the pulp mill guidelines which the Government will develop. I would not like to see those guidelines brought down during the parliamentary recess period and not available for immediate public debate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to note some of the primary conclusions of this report. In part, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>The complete elimination of toxic substances from the effluent of a bleached kraft mill is presently not possible. However, large reductions in the toxicity of these effluents have occurred during the past ten years, and, with the continued intensity of research that is being undertaken around the world, further significant reductions are likely. </PARA>
<PARA>The report also states:</PARA>
<PARA>There are a number of reasons why the complete replacement of the chlorine with chlorine dioxide is not a practical alternative in a pulp mill producing bleached pulp for export. </PARA>
<PARA>The report indicates quite clearly that the future trend in the development of pulp mills throughout the world will be in terms of pulp mills using the kraft process. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>The kraft or sulphate process is the most commonly used of the chemical pulping technologies and its predominance is increasing. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to indicate that in the countries which were visited-Sweden, Finland and Canada, which are major producers of pulp and paper-despite the fairly stringent environmental controls which countries like Sweden have pioneered, there is no indication that they will allow regulation to seriously impact the contribution of this industry to their economy. The report states that in all of these countries capacity is being expanded. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a useful and significant report because it analyses a large number of controversial scientific questions which need to be addressed. It makes quite clear that development of our paper and pulp industry will be in a particular direction, that the kraft process will be the predominant process used, and that demands for a totally toxin-free waste from these facilities is impracticable but that substantial progress already has been made and will continue to be made in getting down the levels of toxic emissions. We welcome the report. It will allow us to continue the debate about appropriate guidelines and we hope that the Government will produce those at the earliest possible date. </PARA>

<PARA> The bulk of analysis in the review focuses on bleach kraft mills, with only a brief and dismissive treatment of non-chlorine pulp processes and marketing opportunities for unbleached pulp or non-chlorine bleached pulp. With the exception of its scant analysis of the market potential for unbleached and chlorine-free bleaching of chemo-thermo-mechanical pulp, the CSIRO study's findings are generally logical within its terms of reference if certain assumptions are made. I want to question these assumptions. It is important to highlight, as well as to question, them precisely because they have not been subject to analysis and are not automatically accepted by many community groups and concerned individuals, nor should they be. </PARA>
<PARA> The first assumption is that a pulp mill in Australia will be based, at least initially, on the forest industry's access to mature native eucalypt forests as per current woodchip licence arrangements. This allows the further vertical integration of the dominant forest products companies from logging to merchandising paper. Despite the stated success of the chemo-thermo-mechanical process with hardwood pulp in Canada and its experimental use with eucalypts in Australia, that process is rejected because of its current limitations in processing mature eucalypt, which is expected to provide the bulk of the raw material for an Australian export pulp industry, as stated on page 45 of the report. In this regard it is interesting to note that F. H. Phillips of CSIRO's Forest and Forest Products Division in Victoria writes in a recent edition of Australian Forester:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the sawlog tree is not necessarily the ideal pulpwood tree . . . eucalypt pulp from selected species grown under more or less ideal conditions is equal or superior to other hardwood pulps, e.g. birch kraft pulp. Unfortunately, this does not apply to the bulk of domestic eucalypt pulp made in Australia or to the potential of a large part of the current eucalypt wood resources. These resources are mainly mixed-age, mixed-species, cut-over native forests and will not provide premium-grade pulpwood. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we appear to be locking ourselves into the sacrifice of mature native forests for woodchips for pulp production when even-aged eucalypt plantations are a superior resource for this purpose. This is quite aside from the enormous cost to conservation values when mature native forests are logged for the supply of woodchips. </PARA>
<PARA> The second assumption is that a pulp mill primarily will produce for the export market. The Federal Government is committed to tariff reduction to ensure that industry investment is channelled into areas where Australia can be internationally competitive, restricting pulp and paper industry investments to international-scale operations. That needs to be questioned. </PARA>
<PARA> The third assumption is that the current market definition of `high quality paper' means bright, white paper for a vast range of uses. The proportion of world paper consumption that must be bleached for essential functional reasons, as opposed to lack of choice and concerted marketing effort, is not seriously addressed. In addition, the report does not question the criteria for marketing quality pulp, such as the arbitrary industry standard of bleaching to a brightness intensity many degrees beyond which the human eye can distinguish. In the report's discussion of essential characteristics of paper which are achievable only by chlorine bleaching and `perceived quality perceptions of the marketplace' the report's discussion is disappointing in its ready acceptance of what could be defined only as luxury so-called needs in paper quality. For example, the potential for newsprint to be modified to facilitate the use of colours in newspapers is mentioned in relation to essential paper qualities. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth assumption is that poor recycling records in Australia, West Germany, Great Britain and Sweden prevent the use of recycled waste paper for high quality uses. This is a very fatalistic attitude in the context of high public awareness and the widespread desire to do the right thing environmentally if only recycling were given appropriate Government support. The fifth assumption is that the only way to really test the toxicity of a bleached kraft mill effluent using eucalypts in Australian conditions is to build a full scale pulp mill-that is, experiment for ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously these assumptions deserve objective analysis because they effectively restrict any future pulp mill developments in Australia to kraft or modified kraft and chlorine bleaching processes. Not surprisingly, the CSIRO delegation found that bleach kraft pulp mills pose long term environmental impacts of great concern which are impossible to predict with current levels of understanding. In relation to the prediction of the environmental impacts of bleached kraft mill effluent (BKME) in Australia the report states on page 22:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that BKME contains a variety of compounds that exhibit chronic toxicity-some at very low concentrations-to equatic organisms. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today's news in Tasmania emphasises the closure of two major building concerns. Last week the Government announced that it was putting a stop to development of a whole range of public works. Two months ago there was an announcement that there would be no pulp mill, that there would be no entrance to existing forests, and that the Government would prevent exploration of all sorts of mining operations in Tasmania as well. Where is Australia heading? What will we sell to pay our bills? How much debt can this country stand?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We will soon be facing a debt of $150 billion. Do we want it to go up to $180 billion? Do we want it to go to $200 billion? Investors coming to Australia at present consider three particular items. The first is that we are totally unreliable on supply, quality and delivery, and that our industrial relations are just not good enough. Secondly, potential investors are up against these ridiculous prevent-everything groups. Their attitudes-Australia-wide, and in Tasmania in particular-are threatening us every day. Thirdly, we have this crazy pumped up dollar that nobody in the world can live with and nobody can understand. Who is prepared to gamble on that right now?</PARA>
<PARA> The pulp mill was a very spectacular issue. It resulted in a campaign of fear and mis-information second to none. I regret that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) fell for it and got involved with all these matters without bothering to get the facts that he should have had. However, I think that, unwittingly, he has done us a public service. The committee that was commissioned to investigate modern technology and environmental protection in relation to pulp mills was as good as could have been selected in the whole of Australia. There was not a thing wrong with the committee. Whether I like its findings or not, in every case I accept it as being the best we could have obtained. It was widely representative, highly skilled and most professional. The terms of reference were most adequate and the results are very clear. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be remembered that we are facing this on the basis that we have a $135 billion deficit, growing at the rate of $1.7 billion a month. The wood products deficit alone has grown from $250m a year in 1977 to $1,500m a year in 1988-or six times. We must grow more trees and harvest more wood. We must get the turnover and pull our weight in the international situation. We must continue to make the timber industry cleaner and safer. Tasmania is already by far the cleanest State in Australia and we want that improved still further. We must pull our weight in wood production internationally. We must add value to the 4.5 million tonnes per annum of exported woodchips and we must do more in the whole area of wood treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> The report, Pulp Mills: Modern Technology and Environmental Protection, says that we are on the right track and that the rules and regulations which were laid down by the Tasmanian Government were first class. The effluent treatment has been vastly upgraded. The stack emissions are virtually approved to background levels. Dioxins became the big fear word of the whole campaign, but I am told by a leading Canberra scientist that there would be more dioxin emitted in Canberra on a sunny, Sunday summer afternoon around the barbecues than there would be from a pulp mill at Wesley Vale. </PARA>
<PARA> The last paragraph of the summary says that new pulp mills in Australia will create a demand for well trained researchers in relevant fields. Let us concentrate on the positive aspects. There is so much in this that we can make into positives. Let us not fall for this useless, negative group of people who just want to see Australia become a third world country, carrying water, hewing stone, and things like that. This country has got to get to where it pays its bills and survives. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This report is of major significance. It gives the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) an overwhelming clobbering. It denies the basis upon which the Budget was brought down this week and it rejects outright his total bunkum on expectations of falling interest rates. It denies the nonsense that the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) of all people, went on with today in response to a question when he said that he expected there would be a fall in interest rates. This damning of the Keating Budget is quite striking in the Reserve Bank of Australia annual report. It is very heartening to see the Reserve Bank being prepared to stand up to this bullying Treasurer (Mr Keating), this bullying Prime Minister, this incompetent Government, and to report things as it sees them without fear or favour. In relation to interest rates the Reserve Bank report actually states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . may need to remain high for quite some time to achieve the desired effect. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, dampening growth in private demand to an extent where all categories of spending would be diminished effectively so that the economy would be in a sound state. It does say that the current setting of monetary policy is now dampening growth in private demand but, I repeat, it will need to remain high for quite some time to achieve the desired effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Why, therefore, do we keep having the Prime Minister and Senator Button creating this totally false impression that cuts in interest rates are just around the corner? The Prime Minister said this before the Western Australian election and that produced a 2 per cent rise in housing loan interest rates. Now we have him saying it again, so I suppose that must indicate we are about to have a Federal election. Heaven knows why. An election is not due until the middle of next year, but the fact that the Prime Minister is already panic stricken enough to be waving this carrot of reduced interest rates seems to suggest the potential for an earlier date than the one popularly expected. Even worse, the Reserve Bank warns as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The size of the task should not be underestimated. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of mess this Government has got this economy into. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Inflation appears set to remain above the average for industrial countries, even if demand pressures are contained. </PARA>
<PARA>Even if the high interest rate policy works, according to the Reserve Bank inflation is set to remain above the average for industrial countries. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> The inevitable rise in debt servicing costs will add to the turnaround required in our trade performance if the current account deficit is to be reduced. Nevertheless, it is imperative that there be a return to the progress on reducing both the rate of inflation and the current account deficit over the coming year. </PARA>
<PARA>The Reserve Bank says it is imperative. What does the Budget do? Under the Budget, inflation gets worse and the balance of payments deficit gets worse. This Government has let the ball go through to the keeper on both the issues that the Reserve Bank says it is imperative something be done about over the coming year. In this Budget it has done nothing to improve either of those matters. In fact, the Budget forecasts that they will get worse. I repeat: this Budget has done nothing to resolve the two elements on which the Reserve Bank has said it is imperative that there be a return to progress. </PARA>
<PARA> Another crack at our incredibly economically literate Prime Minister comes in the next sentence of this report:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bank does not share the opinion expressed in some quarters that, since most of the debt-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, foreign debt-</PARA>
<PARA>is owed within the private sector rather than by government, it is a matter of little consequence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The Reserve Bank is not prepared to be intimidated by this Government, its leader or its Treasurer. It has been prepared to say it does not share the opinion expressed in some quarters-I suppose that means quarterwit rather than halfwit-that since most of the debt is owed in the private sector it is of little consequence. The Bank goes on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The extent to which resources must be diverted to its future servicing is the same whether the debt is publicly or privately owed, and the investment which it has enabled will not automatically ensure that these resources are available. </PARA>
<PARA>The Reserve Bank, in its summary, goes on to say that monetary policy simply cannot carry everything. There is a clear inference that perhaps it has been overused. Certainly in the detail later on it says that the exuberance of markets led to an easing of monetary conditions before the other policies had taken up the slack. This is basically an admission that the other policies were inadequate and there was an excessive reliance by this Government on monetary policy. I remind the Senate that as this was in the early months of 1987 this was just before the last election. Quite frankly, I do not find it very comforting to see that these magic mistakes seem to occur just prior to an election. The corrections of these mistakes have then involved us in major disasters with interest rates and the foreign exchange situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Reserve Bank reinforces a point I made during the last session about the perverse effect of tight monetary policy on the balance of payments. In fact, an exchange rate appreciation can be produced which brings about exactly the opposite results to those the Government is seeking to achieve. As the Bank states:</PARA>
<PARA> On its own, monetary policy will not produce the longer-term structural benefits Australia is seeking. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet once again in this Budget there is undue reliance on monetary policy, particularly because of this Government's failure to bring about any vestige of the micro-economic reform we need. There is excessive dependence on monetary policy, despite the Reserve Bank's warning that it will not produce the longer term structural benefits Australia is seeking. The report states that it may even inhibit the structural change because of the effect of high interest rates on investment of all types. Here we have consistent, strong, persuasive and effective criticism of the whole economic strategy that is evident in the Government's Budget. The Reserve Bank says, in what is clearly a criticism of the failure of the Budget to address the need for structural change:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia needs a major shift of resources into the traded goods sector to stimulate increased exports and, more importantly, to replace imports. This cannot be achieved if domestic demand is growing faster than productive capacity but simply slowing demand is not enough either. </PARA>
<PARA>That is one of the problems with this Government's economic policies. It has set out to slow demand and to clobber the corporate sector with additional taxes of $1.4 billion this year at a time when it is supposed to be helping invest Australia out of its problems. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>There is also a need for greater productive capacity, improved productivity and a better overall price performance, at least as good as our competitors. </PARA>
<PARA>They are the Reserve Bank's priorities, and those priorities do not appear at all in the Government's Budget brought down this week. No attention has been paid to those problems; they are not addressed. Yet the Reserve Bank says they are top priorities. It says there is a need for greater productive capacity, improved productivity and a greater overall price performance. It is almost as if the report were written by members of the Opposition as part of our economic policy because these are exactly the sorts of policies that we have been encouraging the Government to adopt-policies that will bring economic recovery, not the sort of economic disaster, massive interest rates, worsening debt and higher overseas interest payments that are a direct result of this Government's deliberate economic policies, particularly deliberate pre-election economic policies. The Bank goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>We need also, if possible, to fund a greater proportion of investment from our own resources and not by borrowing abroad . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we need more savings and less consumption. The Senate is certainly well aware of that fact. For many years the Opposition has been stressing the need for an increase in savings and for policies that encourage such increased savings. The Reserve Bank report also notes:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . income moderation must continue to be pursued in the interests of lower inflation and the increased competitiveness of our goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA>We have to see to what extent the Government will provide that vital lead because in the Budget we saw a threat of further increased costs to employers, certainly by way of additional superannuation costs. In particular, there are the increased costs of $1.4 billion as a result of fiddling with the timing arrangements of corporate tax payments so that businesses will be paying tax on profits they have not yet received. Senator Watson's question at Question Time today was very perceptive, but Senator Button's answer revealed the depths of the Government's incompetence in this area. Apparently it had not struck the Government that when businesses deal in 30, 60, 90 or 180 day terms they do not even have the money in on which they have illegally made a profit. Yet they are required to pay tax to this Government and have to borrow the money, at the huge interest rates this Government's policies have brought about, to pay the tax on profits they have not yet received. </PARA>

If there is any diminution of the sort of spirit that allows a Reserve Bank to tell the Government how incompetent it is-because that is what this Reserve Bank report does-and how misdirected its policies are, if there is any reduction of that independence under this arrogant Treasurer who seeks to assert that dominance, then I believe that we are facing an even more serious problem because it is only by public airing of these policy disagreements within the arms of advice to government that we can get a fair and reasonable view of the extent of this Government's incompetence despite the best advice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also vital that members of parliament also have access to this kind of comment so that we and the people of Australia can judge what sort of advice this Government is rejecting when it goes on with economic policies that have brought us to economic disaster, that are forcing people out of their homes because of huge interest rates, that are increasing costs to levels far higher than those of our trading partners, and that are pushing us further and further into debt internationally, for which this Government is directly responsible, as the Reserve Bank points out, despite the attempt by the Prime Minister to say that because the debt is largely from the private sector it does not matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a director of the Board and a member of the Board ex officio. Normally it is fair to say that the Reserve Bank is noted for the caution-indeed some people might even say circumlocution-of its language. While that characteristic is true also of this report to a degree, nevertheless there are a number of most significant statements in this report relating to the conduct of policy, including particularly monetary policy, during the past year and to the future of the Government's economic policies as presently constituted. I think that those particular remarks gain added weight from the fact that the Reserve Bank has not in the past been noted for the total frankness of its language. One has always been able to find what it meant, but one has sometimes had to read between the lines to do so. There is no need to read between the lines in many aspects of this report today. Let us start with one or two comments of the bank on developments during 1989. On page 6 it is stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This package of policies-</PARA>
<PARA>the package I have just been describing-</PARA>
<PARA>produced a marked increase in investment spending in 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA>We certainly have been aware of that. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has emphasised that point at almost every press conference he has had during the past 12 months. He has been trying to explain to the increasingly sceptical journalists why it is that the balance of payments deficit for the month just past has, once again, hit a new record. The Treasurer has time and again referred in that connection to the large rise in investment spending in 1988-89. We all know that that is only a partial explanation, indeed not even the major explanation, of what has been happening; nevertheless the Treasurer has laid great emphasis upon it. Having acknowledged the fact that investment has risen significantly, the Reserve Bank goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>While much of the investment should contribute to future productive capacity, some of it. . .was in areas not especially oriented to increasing output in the traded goods sector. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it was directed to meeting Australian domestic consumption demands rather than to delivering an improvement in the balance of payments. After going on to comment about the rapid rise in the level of our current account deficit on the balance of payments, the bank notes:</PARA>
<PARA>Our international indebtedness rose in consequence, resuming the upward trend as a ratio to GDP that it had followed in the years up to 1986. </PARA>
<PARA>Now we come to the present. What is the current economic situation? The bank expresses the following view:</PARA>
<PARA>While the indicators are still mixed, the Bank believes the current setting of monetary policy-</PARA>
<PARA>monetary policy, mark you, not fiscal policy-</PARA>
<PARA>is now dampening growth of private demand. Higher interest rates gradually seem to be having an impact on all categories of spending. </PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to say, and I think this passage was also quoted by my colleague Senator Michael Baume:</PARA>
<PARA>However, the general buoyancy of the economy has been such that rates may need to remain high for quite some time to achieve the desired effect. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not quite what the Treasurer has been saying in his Budget Speech and not quite what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has been saying at various breakfasts, dinners or other occasions that he has been attending since the Budget was delivered. The bank is not content to make that rather blunt statement. It goes on to warn the Government, stating:</PARA>
<PARA> The size of the task should not be underestimated. Inflation appears set to remain above the average for industrial countries, even if demand pressures are contained. The inevitable rise in debt servicing costs will add to the turnaround required in our trade performance if the current account deficit is to be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA>In a later passage in small print on page 13 of the report there is a further comment on that same point. The bank specifically again draws attention to the external debt servicing problem and, more generally, to the risks to which the Australian economy is presently being subjected. The passage states:</PARA>
<PARA>The external debt servicing burden increased, making the task of correcting the current account deficit position that much more difficult. The higher level of Australian dollar assets held overseas also adds to the potential for sharp movements in both the exchange rate and security yields in response to shifts in demand for such assets. </PARA>
<PARA>That, if I may say so, is an example of what I call Delphic Reserve Bank language. It means that we now have an economy which is extremely vulnerable to shifts in confidence on the part of overseas investors in this country. We are extremely vulnerable to such shifts in confidence and the shifts in hot money which can flow from those shifts in confidence. The bank goes on to say, on page 7:</PARA>
<PARA>Nevertheless, it is imperative-</PARA>
<PARA>I ask honourable senators to note the word `imperative'-not merely desirable or needful, but imperative-</PARA>
<PARA>that there be a return to progress on reducing both the rate of inflation and the current account deficit over the coming year. The Bank does not share the opinion-</PARA>
<PARA>and again my colleague has referred to this paragraph, but it is sufficiently important and authoritative to be worth quoting again, indeed more than once-</PARA>
<PARA>expressed in some quarters-</PARA>
<PARA>by that it means `expressed by the Prime Minister'-</PARA>
<PARA>that, since most of the debt is owed within the private sector rather than by government, it is a matter of little consequence. The extent to which resources must be diverted to its future servicing is the same whether the debt is publicly or privately owned, and the investment it has enabled will not automatically ensure that these resources are available. </PARA>
<PARA>What the Reserve Bank is saying there is rather like what the Treasurer, Mr Keating, said to, I think, an Australian Financial Review luncheon a few weeks ago in Sydney when he was referring to some ideas that the Prime Minister not long before had been putting into the public arena. He referred to these ideas as `simplistic nonsense'. He did not name them as actually having come from the Prime Minister, but we all knew who he was referring to. In the same way we all know who the Reserve Bank is referring to today in this document. It says it is simplistic nonsense. The bank has not used that term but that is what it means. </PARA>
<PARA> The Reserve Bank, again in expressing its view about the current course of policy, refers to the policy of keeping interest rates very high. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>This should, with a lag, cut into the demand for imports and thus the current account deficit. However, this is not the primary objective. In fact, in the short run-</PARA>
<PARA>It is now a rather long run; it is already 17 months old, having begun in April last year-</PARA>
<PARA>there may be perverse effects on the balance of payments if higher interest rates produce an exchange rate appreciation. Some of those effects were evident in 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA>If I may say so, they are still evident. The bank has obviously felt sufficiently concerned about that matter to refer to it again, on page 11 of the report, where it says:</PARA>
<PARA> Tighter monetary policy, by slowing aggregate demand, will tend to slow imports. </PARA>
<PARA>That, we understand, is what the Government has been trying to produce-a slowing in imports. The bank goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>It also raises the cost of investment through higher interest rates and a higher-than-otherwise exchange rate, and thus tends to slow the likely growth of future productive capacity. </PARA>
<PARA>What that boils down to is that the bank is totally dissatisfied with this Government's unidimensional policy. It uses an exorbitantly high level of interest rates, which has been maintained now at an increasing level for the last 17 months, as the Government's only apparent instrument to deal with what it regards as the excessive demand in this country. The bank further states:</PARA>
<PARA>On its own, monetary policy will not produce the longer-term structural benefits Australia is seeking. Beyond the point-</PARA>
<PARA>and I would say that that point has been well and truly reached-</PARA>
<PARA>it may even inhibit the structural change because of the effect of high interest rates on investment of all types. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet what view was taken in the Budget Speech last Tuesday night to the existence of that clear and, by the bank at least, clearly perceived, threat? We have seen simply a policy of `Stay on course; steady as she goes'-or I should say, `Steady as she sinks'. There is to be `No change', the Treasurer has said, in the existing one dimensional higher and higher interest rate policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The bank goes on to note, as every analyst does, that we need a major shift of resources into the traded goods sector to stimulate increased exports and, more importantly, to replace imports. The bank says:</PARA>
<PARA>This cannot be achieved if domestic demand is growing faster than productive capacity-</PARA>
<PARA>but very significantly it adds:</PARA>
<PARA>but simply slowing demand is not enough either. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, of course, what this Government is doing at the present time. It is simply slowing demand by the application of crushing interest rates. The bank then touches upon a particularly sensitive point. It remarks:</PARA>
<PARA>The setting of incentives and disincentives at the microeconomic level has played a role in creating some of our present economic imbalances. </PARA>
<PARA>There is another example of what I call Reserve Bank Delphic language. What it is saying there is that at the micro-economic level-by which it means the price of labour-the setting of incentives and disincentives at that level has played a role in creating some of our present economic imbalances. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Changes there are essential if we are to avoid a re-emergence in the next upswing of the problems of the past year, but the vital key is inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>Again I ask: What attention did our Treasurer give to that vital key, inflation, in his Budget Speech last Tuesday night?-apart from telling us that inflation this financial year would run at virtually precisely the same level as it ran in 1988-89; in other words, that inflation is stuck at 7 1/2 per cent, according to the Government's own forecast, for the year as a whole, and it does not even decline significantly during the course of the year, although the Government has been very keen to tell us that we should be focusing our attention on this occasion not upon the year on year averages but upon the way in which the economy is moving through the course of the year. Although the Government is very keen to direct our attention in that regard, apparently it is not displaying much eagerness to publish any information, such as quarterly breakdown of the national income forecasts, which will enable us to make those kinds of judgments. But we will see what Senator Walsh has to say on that tomorrow, by which time I have not the slightest doubt he would have had time to consult the Treasurer as a result of the question I addressed to him at Question Time today, at which time he said that he did not know whether such forecasts existed. I think he will find that they do exist. I am sure that, when he has satisfied himself on that point, he will be only too happy to bring them to the Senate for our information and the information of the general public, including the media. </PARA>

Undoubtedly, tomorrow he will bring those quarterly forecasts into the Senate for our better guidance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I propose to conclude on this point: the Reserve Bank looks briefly ahead in one small paragraph. I will quote that paragraph, which appears on page 13 of the report, in full:</PARA>
<PARA> Retention of the present stance of policy-</PARA>
<PARA>of very high interest rates-</PARA>
<PARA>should produce more significant restraint of spending as 1989/90 progresses. Whether this will also be sufficient to lay the groundwork for winding back the current account deficit is uncertain; there are risks that it may not. </PARA>
<PARA>The Reserve Bank of Australia is talking about the retention of the present stance. It is not holding out the hope, the optimistic bauble which the Prime Minister is holding out to his listeners, that interest rates will come down. The Reserve Bank is saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Retention of the present stance of policy should produce more significant restraint of spending as 1989/90 progresses. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Whether this will also be sufficient to lay the groundwork for winding back the current account deficit is uncertain; there are risks that it may not. </PARA>
<PARA>The Reserve Bank concludes on this point:</PARA>
<PARA>These risks will be much greater if there is a substantial slowing of world growth and a decline in commodity prices. </PARA>
<PARA>I join my colleague Senator Michael Baume in expressing my gratitude to the present Board of the Reserve Bank of Australia, which no longer has on it Mr Bob Johnston-I think he retired in mid-July. The Reserve Bank is presently under the chairmanship of the Deputy Governor, Mr John Phillips, who, as we all know, was passed over for the position of Governor. I congratulate the Board for having produced, by Reserve Bank standards, this very frank account of Australia's problems and the unlikelihood of the present policies of this Government producing real and, above all, sustainable answers to those problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the 1988-89 annual report of the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing. I shall not detain the Senate for longer than a few minutes. The thrust of the report ought not to go unnoticed by honourable senators because it goes to the very heart of the processes of funding the activities of the Senate, its duties and responsibilities and the responsibilities of all its members. The Appropriations and Staffing Committee, of which I have the dubious distinction of being a member, met on five occasions during the year 1988-89 to determine its charter, the estimates and the additional estimates of the Department of the Senate for that year and for the purpose of considering any other matters relating to departmental administration. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me paraphrase from the report because it very much summarises what I want to say. The Committee, at its very first meeting for the year 1988-89, considered the processes by which the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh-he is notorious for this-reduced the levels of funding for the Senate, or at least reduced the estimates proposed for the Department of the Senate. These had been determined by the unanimous vote of the Appropriations and Staffing Committee on 31 May 1988 in accordance with that Committee's terms of reference. Of course, I need not remind my informed colleagues that the Appropriations and Staffing Committee is made up of--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Aulich" NAMEID="JE4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not going to say `highly intelligent members'; I was going to describe the parties but, to the extent that the honourable senator has reminded me, he is absolutely right. The Committee is made up of highly intelligent members of this chamber-senators from all political parties-and includes, ex officio, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button. He is on the Committee presumably for the purpose of ensuring that the Government has a proper opportunity to consider the appropriations and, where the view of the Government ought to be put, that view is put by Senator Button. In the event that the Government considers that the appropriations being proposed are too high, Senator Button will proffer that opinion and demonstrate where he believes the appropriations can be properly reduced. Of course, that goes for all political parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That process was undertaken carefully and diligently by all present and the appropriations so arrived at were carried unanimously by resolution of 31 May. The Minister for Finance did not at that point, or at any material point immediately afterwards, suggest any substantial reductions in the estimates until very late in the procedure of determining the content of the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill. In other words, the Committee, including the Government's representative, resolved a determination. Departmental officers from the Senate and from the Department of Finance had informal and formal negotiations outside those meetings and agreed to the levels of funding. On the very eve of the introduction of the Budget the Minister for Finance, capriciously and in a delinquent and irresponsible way, wrote to the Department unilaterally announcing that the appropriations would be reduced to the levels he judged to be sufficient for the proper functioning of the Senate. Let me remind the Senate of that Committee's responsibilities and its terms of reference. The report states inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) in relation to the Estimates-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) determine the amounts for inclusion in the Parliamentary Appropriation Bills for the Annual Estimates and the Additional Estimates, and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) report to the Senate upon its determinations prior to the consideration by the Senate of the related Parliamentary Appropriation Bill;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) In relation to staffing-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) make such recommendation to the President as it sees fit, and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) report to the Senate on any matter it considers necessary; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) make an annual report to the Senate on the operations of the Senate's appropriations and staffing, and related matters-</PARA>
<PARA>which is the consequence of this report. In other words, the Senate has charged the Committee to determine the amounts for inclusion and that was done. The resolution of 2 December 1985 reinforced that reference. If my memory does not escape me, that resolution of 2 December 1985 was moved by Senator Richardson, who was the Chairman of the Committee and is now a member of the Government. The resolution was carried unanimously by the Senate. As I say, the report says that it envisaged the Department of the Senate's estimates should be-not could or might-those determined by the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing. The resolution goes on to say, to paraphrase it, that any disagreement on the part of the Government, represented by the Minister for Finance, with the estimates determined by the Committee would be resolved by a process of discussion involving the President, the Standing Committee, the Leader of the Government in the Senate and the Minister for Finance. Due to the lateness of the hour in the Minister for Finance's correspondence, that process of course did not take place because it was impossible. </PARA>
<PARA> At its meeting on 2 March 1989 the Committee resolved, again unanimously, that Mr President should write, as Chairman of the Committee, to the Leader of the Government in the Senate regarding the importance of ministerial representation at Committee meetings at which the Department's estimates were being considered. That letter was written to ensure that never again would the Committee be confronted with correspondence by the Minister for Finance at the twelfth hour, unilaterally determining that the estimates should be less than those judged to be appropriate by the Committee. That mechanism would ensure that the Minister representing the Government and, presumably, the Minister for Finance-unless he stands outside the Government in these determinations-is in a position to proffer the views of the Government in respect of appropriate funding for the Senate. It was hoped, and certainly intended, that the Minister representing the Government would be properly informed, properly briefed and properly equipped with the views of the Government when he attended the meetings. It was hoped that that would avoid a repetition of events that took place in the previous year and would resolve irreconcilable differences of view between the Committee and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> At meetings on 5 and 8 June 1989, the Leader of the Government in the Senate was represented by Senator Bolkus, the Minister for Consumer Affairs. Senator Bolkus advised the Committee that it would be his aim to represent the views of the Government in respect of the estimates of the Committee at the meeting. Senator Bolkus attended the meetings on 5 and 8 June and made a contribution. At those meetings the level of funding was, after very careful deliberation, determined unanimously by the Committee-with, as I say, Senator Bolkus in attendance. </PARA>
<PARA> I had hoped that the presence of the Minister would ensure that the level of appropriations as determined by the Appropriations and Staffing Committee would be the level to be appropriated. Although the matter has not been determined and it is inappropriate for me to enlarge upon the facts, difficulties have again surfaced. The Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, has again conducted himself in the same way as he did the previous year. That ought to come as no shock to any member of this chamber, because when I raised the matter of the unanimous resolution in this chamber with Senator Walsh, which he supported and voted upon, he said, `Well, I voted for it because it was irrelevant, useless, a waste of time then, and it still is'. In other words, he was contemptuously dismissing the resolution of this chamber. We now find ourselves confronted with the same situation with the Minister for Finance corresponding with the Committee and arbitrarily seeking to make sharp cuts in the level of funding. </PARA>
<PARA> Without going into any detail, in the event of this matter not being resolved fairly and reasonably I hope that Appropriation Bill (No. 2) can be amended to contain a funding level which the Senate deems to be appropriate for its functioning and provide it with a capacity to fulfil the obligations with which it is charged. The Committee has bent over backwards to be frugal and careful in determining the level of funding, to the point, if my memory serves me correctly, without disclosing the activities of the private meetings, where with the assistance and initiative of the Opposition cuts have been made to the point where funding is now barely tolerable. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of requests from the Minister for Finance to move certain items out of Appropriation Bill (No. 2) into Appropriation Bill (No. 1), in each case we have, with a caveat in one case, complied with the wishes of the Minister. Of course, the reason for moving those line items out of Appropriation Bill (No. 2) into Appropriation Bill (No. 1) is that one Bill can be amended and one cannot. I am quite sure that if Senator Walsh had his way he would have all the funding and appropriations for the Senate in a Bill which could not be amended. It will be over my dead body if that is unanimously agreed to in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> It is to be hoped that this Government will act with decency, and if not with decency with common sense, in respect to funding for the Senate for this coming year. Sadly, this Government has got a long, miserable record of seeking to reduce the funding of the Parliament per se and the Senate in particular to the point now where the view of three political parties represented in this chamber is that it is not fulfilling its obligations to the level it ought simply because of a reduction in funding. We know the regard in which this chamber is held by Senator Walsh and a number of his colleagues. That has been demonstrated by their endeavours to introduce Bills into the Parliament to amalgamate the Department of the Senate with other departments so that we have one super department, no doubt having the Speaker as the titular head dancing to the tune of the Executive Government. When the Executive Government manages and controls the Parliament one no longer has an independent parliament. One no longer has a parliament able to make determinations and decisions and arrive at conclusions free and unfettered; rather one has a parliament bending, dancing and bowing to the wishes of a government, which is bound to cast it into disrespect and simply make it a rubber stamp for the Government. </PARA>

If this Government had its way it would simply have the Parliament rubber stamping its determinations and decisions. The very fact that it guillotines legislation through the House of Representatives prior to the conclusion of proper and exhaustive debate demonstrates the lack of regard it has for the processes and forms of parliament. The only reason why the Senate conducts itself with some pretence of freedom, democracy and single spirit is that the Government does not have the numbers in the chamber. If the Government had the numbers in the chamber without doubt any Bill which was difficult, controversial and took time to deliberate would be guillotined. If this Government had the numbers we would not have had the fulsome and healthy debate we had on matters such as the identity card, the Bill of Rights and all those other obnoxious pieces of legislation which the Government in its subtle and surreptitious way sought to slip through the Parliament without the public noticing and without the attention and diligent application of senators.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly on paper No. 1, the operation of the Fishing Industry Research Act 1969, on which I intended to speak on 25 May. Unfortunately, this is the first opportunity we have had to discuss this matter. I would like to make a few points. I want to draw the attention of the Senate to the significant contribution which has been made by Tasmania in the field of fisheries research. As most of us would know, the fishing industry has been of vital importance to Tasmania for many years. I am very proud to say that Tasmanian scientists and other professionals working in the field have established a worldwide reputation for the quality of their research work and the products themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For some time Tasmania has fostered a very valuable export industry. These days when we need to bring in export dollars it is good to see that we have an industry that is growing quite quickly. It is not uncommon to find Tasmanian seafood products in such destinations as the United States, Japan and Asia. During a trip by a parliamentary delegation to Asia last year I was very pleased to hear that importers were very impressed by the high quality of products being exported by our fledgling aquaculture industry, particularly products such as Atlantic salmon, Pacific oysters and trout. </PARA>
<PARA> The report notes that Tasmania was allocated $1,787,703 during 1987-88. It spelt out a further allocation of $2,523,048. This represents a figure of something like $4.3m. I am sure that in research terms it is money very well spent. It will enhance a very major growth industry in our State. There are numerous projects outlined in the report. I refer in particular to work that has been done in the scallop industry. Many Tasmanians would know that unfortunately our scallop industry has been decimated by overfishing. Research work has been done into receding scallop beds in the State. Similarly, research has been undertaken by the tuna fishing industry on the movement of tuna, which will benefit the Tasmanian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter I am really concerned about relates to the orange roughy situation. In 1987-88 an amount of $170,000 was spent to determine the size of the orange roughy resource on the continental slope and to estimate the potential sustainable yield for orange roughy. For those who are not aware, at present on the east coast of Tasmania, off St Helens in particular, two new hot spots, as they are called, have been established. Very large catches of orange roughy are being taken. Unfortunately, research to date has shown that these hot spots occur when the fish are spawning. This leads one to believe that fishing when they are spawning will reduce the resource. I am very concerned that we do not know enough about these fish at this stage. There is a real risk that they will be overfished and decimated, as have been our other fishing industries over the years. When we see boats being able to harvest between $250,000 and half a million dollars worth of fish in a day, we can understand how quickly this industry can be devastated by pure greed. Something should be done to further research so that perhaps the resource can be maintained. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to oppose the Industrial Relations (Directions to Stop Industrial Action) Amendment Bill 1989 and to indicate quite clearly that the Government regards this Bill as, first of all, an unnecessary measure and, secondly, a measure that could cause more problems than it is intended that it solve. It is predictable because this is not the first time that Senator Chaney or other Opposition spokesmen in the industrial relations area have pursued this particular course. The course that the Opposition has basically been pursuing and is suggesting that the Government take is that of enforcing compliance in the industrial relations arena, separating industrial relations from the prevailing governmental ethos and the social and political ethos that surround it, simply turning it into another aspect of the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The solutions that the Opposition has been advocating over a long time have centred on the need to use the law to enforce compliance, as the Opposition puts it, upon both parties in any industrial dispute. Yet Opposition members know full well that in any industrial dispute the advantage necessarily accrues to the group which, first of all, has legality on its side and, secondly, is in the box seat. That box seat in most industrial disputes is generally held by the employer in the sense that employee organisations and individual employees have nothing to negotiate with but their labour. That labour can be withdrawn: that is the only weapon they have. I will return to that point later because it relates very much to some of the provisions laid down in Senator Chaney's Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill, to put it colloquially, has a very cute title, just as a number of the provisions contained in it could be described as cute. But the Opposition is covering up for a very hard line taken on industrial relations matters. Some very hard solutions are being propounded by the spokesman that occupies the industrial relations chair for the Opposition. It is not the first time that the Liberal Party of Australia has pushed this particular line. It is in fact an overreaction to a significant industrial dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> One recalls during the Fraser period when the Liberal Party and the National Party of Australia were in government that there were a number of industrial disputes-single, one-off disputes. For one reason or another, probably related to vote buying or vote getting, the government of that day decided to bring in what it regarded as important or emergency legislation. The net result was that that proposed legislation did not get through this Parliament, was irrelevant to solving a particular industrial dispute or, in some cases, was embedded in an ever growing Conciliation and Arbitration Act or in the Trade Practices Act. That did nothing to help provide a better industrial relations climate in this country. As with economic and taxation measures, the Fraser Government for a very long time sought to fiddle with the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and other Acts relating to industrial relations in this country, usually stimulated by one significant dispute. The Fraser Government would pick a dispute which made the press at the time, in which there was some concern by the public and probably by all members of parliament, and use that as an excuse to try to change the framework. We ended up with an Act that was in many ways unworkable, complex and subject to challenge in the courts and in the field. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again the Liberal Party brings forward its traditional approach to industrial relations, as embodied in the Bill. The Liberal Party is wrong in more than the specifics of the way the Bill is set out. The approach of the Liberal Party to industrial relations as a whole is wrong. Its basic mistake is that it has not learned from the past. Senator Chaney, of all people, should have learned from the mistakes that he and his Government made when they were in office. I know that Senator Chaney is very touchy about any mention of his term as a Cabinet Minister in the past failed Fraser Government. He usually takes a point of order when it is mentioned. I think even he is bored with his Bill. Senator Chaney has some problems not only in taking an active interest in his Bill, but also even in getting people to come and listen to him speak at dinners about industrial relations. That is how irrelevant the Liberal Party's approach to industrial relations has become. </PARA>
<PARA> To get back to the point I made, it is not that the Liberal Party is technically wrong in the amendments it may want to make to the Industrial Relations Act. It is just that it does not understand that industrial relations is part of an integrated activity that bears upon a number of areas of Australian society: inflation, social welfare and pensions, taxation, and employment are all part of the industrial relations arena or are interwoven with the industrial relations system. When the Government came to power it did not seek to make minor and ad hoc amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. It said to the unions and to the employers, `We have to take a new look at industrial relations in this country'. What we write in the Bill as it comes through Parliament is only part of the picture. What we create by way of an understanding or a prevailing ethos in the community is much more important. We are talking, first, about the prevailing ethos and, secondly, about the way in which people act in accordance with the spirit of the law. Thirdly, we are talking about the degree to which all parties in industrial relations consider the interests not only of themselves but also of the whole community. </PARA>
<PARA> This ad hoc amendment to legislation that has been passed only within the last 12 months or so is an example of the Liberal approach which is to play around with the law and not seek to create a new ethos in the community. Its approach does not seek to get cooperation, but to punish. We must have learnt from experience, through industrial relations history, that enforced compliance with the law or with the spirit of good industrial relations is not the solution because, in the end, industrial relations is not just about bargaining between employers and employee organisations. It is not just about enforcing compliance with some agreements or awards. It is about the understanding that people have that they are operating in the interests not only of the people whom they represent, but also of the whole community. I know that some people on the Opposition side of the chamber believe that that is the appropriate way to go in industrial relations. Many say that there has to be give and take. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot write industrial relations Acts in the way we can Acts that can be interpreted in other jurisdictions, for example, equity law or other areas of the law where the black-letter is absolutely necessary. Many Opposition senators have that view. Unfortunately, the decline of Ian Macphee in the Liberal Party has indicated symbolically that the Liberal Party has been hijacked by people who will take a harder line on industrial relations, people who are the New Right radicals. Perhaps in some ways the influence in the community of such people has waned in terms of their capacity to sell their theories and ideas. It has not waned within the structure of the Liberal Party. This Bill is very much an example of the approach that has been taken by these Old Right or New Right radicals. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney was made the shadow Minister for industrial relations in an attempt by those forces further to the right than the average person in the community to put a passable front on their extreme approach to the solution of industrial relations in this country. They thought, `Here's a gentleman; here's a man with a reasonable image; here's a man who during his time as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs showed that he could talk to people and knew what consensus was about'. Here was a man who was known as Red Fred, slightly left of centre, a Minister who was prepared to take on his Prime Minister over a number of issues, for example, those related to Aboriginals. He was a man with a reasonable left of centre image. Members of the Liberal Party thought that by putting him in this position they could then help to sell a much more extreme view of industrial relations than the Australian community would otherwise have tolerated. </PARA>
<PARA> I sincerely hope the Bill is not all Senator Chaney's own work. Senator Chaney has to take advantage of one industrial dispute which he knows will upset the Australian community if and when it goes into full operation some time this weekend, that is, the airlines dispute. He has taken that one dispute and his solution has been to whack another Bill through Parliament. This has to be the most ham-fisted approach ever taken towards solving an industrial dispute or towards creating a better climate to ensure that such disputes do not occur. It has to be the most ham-fisted attempt I have seen to head off a dispute and then to create a better climate. </PARA>
<PARA> There is every evidence that the Government, the Opposition, and the Australian community will not tolerate the banditry of the airline pilots. None of us in this chamber will tolerate people who, first, are so naive or, second, so aggressive about pursuing their aims that they cannot understand that times have changed around them. No-one in this chamber will accept the approach that they are taking. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested the other day to hear that one of the airline pilot officials indicated that he and his union would be seeking equity only with judges and politicians. I was with two or three politicians at the time when I heard that come over the news. We calculated that in order for the airline pilots to get equity with us in this chamber, they would need to drop about $25,000 to $30,000 a year in salary. That is how naive they are. I have indicated that their naivety is also shown by the fact that they do not understand that industrial relations in this country has changed-and significantly-for the better. It has changed in terms of the number of man-hours lost through industrial disputes and the responsible approach that the trade union movement has taken in looking at the interests of the total economy and the total community when it takes action and pursues its long-term goals and also in terms of the way the employers have responded to the consultation process that this Government has opened to all bodies in the industrial relations arena, bar the extremists who want to blow the whole system apart. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not a perfect system. Industrial relations is primarily about negotiation. A negotiation that ends perfectly is one I have yet to see. The industrial relations arena is not a court of law; it is an arena that can be messy, where there are long-term consequences that sometimes flow upon bad decisions being taken where there are problems right in front of people. For example, every one of us here in this chamber can make decisions about changes that were made to section 45 of the Trade Practices Act and changes to various other provisions that flow from that. We could all make a decision about whether or not the moves that were made by the Fraser Government or the decisions that were made by this Government in relation to section 45d were appropriate. We can ask, `Did those changes work? Were they appropriate?'. The answer is that nobody really knows. We can say, for example, that the Mudginberri disputes had an effect. We know that certain unions that had been a little more likely than others to lead with their chin, and occasionally engage in industrial disputes which were not in the interests either of the community or of their own members on some occasions, learned a lesson and that the responsible unions around this country said, very quietly-in some cases publicly-`Mudginberri is a lesson to us'. </PARA>
<PARA> In some ways I am not even pushing aside the viewpoint that has been expressed by members of the New Right. They had their viewpoints on particular disputes and taught us that in the end the worst possible thing to do to improve industrial relations in this country is to get people into the courts and the common law system. That is the worst possible way for people to go if, first, we are going to solve individual disputes on the whole or, second, we are going to create a climate of industrial relations harmony that helps us as a country to maintain a reasonable reputation. </PARA>
<PARA> I was in Japan in 1987. I met the former Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Suzuki, a number of Japanese unions and some of the important business people in the Japanese community. One comment they had to make about their perception of Australia under the Hawke Labor Government concerned what they described as the dramatic improvement in industrial relations in this country. They said that it was such an improvement that it actually affected decisions that they were making about investment and joint ventures; it affected their long-term views about investment in Australia. That was the view of members of a society which, on the whole, does not have much time for unions-all appearances to the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA> Amongst many of our trading partners and people in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development who have looked objectively at the labour relations situation in this country there is nothing but praise for the dramatic improvement that the Hawke Government has brought about in the industrial relations area. I would never be the first to say that our record is perfect but at least we have been the first government to have taken industrial relations and put it in the public arena. We have put it into the public forums of this country and said, `Industrial relations is a broad activity; it is not just wages and conditions or bargaining between employers and employees. It has to do with the whole ethos of the way a nation looks at work, handles its tax system and social welfare system and the way people live'. Industrial relations is not to do with the 40-odd per cent of people who belong to trade unions or the thousands of businesses and business organisations that belong to their peak councils in the business area. It is not their province to run industrial relations as a club; industrial relations belongs to the whole community. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole community has an interest in industrial relations; therefore what counts is the ethos that is created in the whole community and the understanding that is created about the way people ought to look at work, the way we get governments and unions to cooperate with employers in long-term strategies for this country, not these minor ad hoc amendments to the Industrial Relations Act, which went through this Parliament only last year. That is not how we solve industrial relations problems. As compelled as members of the Opposition may be to gather votes out of a dispute which they know--</PARA>

Because there is a dispute which may escalate this weekend and leave people stranded in airports. An irresponsible trade association, against the wishes of the majority of the trade union movement, has decided that it will tell the Government and the employers to get lost. It has decided that it will tell the Australian community that it will take what it wants for its members regardless of whether its demands in any way are justified in the current economic climate on any work value basis, comparative wage justice basis or any other basis that has been used as a measurement for gaining increases in wages and conditions in this country over the last decade.

If he believes that, he is as naive as Tony Street, Ian Macphee, Andrew Peacock and Ian Viner. They were the four industrial relations Ministers who came in, walked around for a while in the industrial relations arena under Fraser and then went down the chute again, leaving behind them a legacy of similar sorts of amendments and an industrial relations situation that was in absolute tatters. It was the joke not only of the rest of the world but even of the business community in this country. Those people left the economy in tatters, with inflation and unemployment sitting up at 11 per cent. Even now they do not have the decency to understand and acknowledge that one of the strong points of this Government, one of the most productive activities that this Government has been involved in, has been the creation of a better industrial relations situation. It is not perfect but it is certainly something that has worked beyond the dreams of anyone who in 1983 thought that the accord would bring long-term intelligence into the industrial relations arena, at a time at which intelligence had gone out of the window.

Instead of having to deal with a Bill such as this, why do we not have from Senator Chaney a position paper about industrial relations which sets out his total approach? Let us debate that, but for heaven's sake, Senator Chaney should not come here on the eve of a major dispute, hand us a slip of paper and say, `This is the solution'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industrial Relations (Directions to Stop Industrial Action) Amendment Bill grasps the political opportunity created by current industrial actions of pilots to make the point that there are inadequate compliance provisions in the Industrial Relations Act 1988. While that is a reasonable point to make, the irony of the situation is that the compliance provisions introduced into the 1987 version of the Industrial Relations Bill could have been used today if the Opposition and employers had supported the 1987 provisions instead of putting pressure on the Government to drop them. The 1987 Bill also spelt out what penalties would apply for non-compliance with the directives of the Industrial Relations Commission. The Bill before us today leaves the magnitude of penalties open-ended-an inadequacy which the Australian Democrats cannot accept.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the most contentious aspects of the 1988 Industrial Relations Act is the extent of the powers of the Commission. Some employers argued that the powers of the Commission were too expansive and trouble would flow from too broad a definition of the Commission's powers. They complained, as was argued by the Opposition in the debate in relation to the 1988 Act, that the Commission created by the Act would prove to be an even more all-embracing institution than the one it replaced. It is still feared that the Act will undermine the possibility of a shift to the enterprise level. The Opposition is now trying to give the Commission more power and also increase the power of employers in relation to their employees. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note in this context that recent national wage case decisions have included in wage increases some direct negotiations between employers and employees to implement productivity and restructuring trade-offs. We believe that is still likely to be the future path of the industrial relations scene in Australia. It is working at the moment because it has the imprimatur of the Commission. To reduce the powers of the Commission now and to throw all negotiations on to the employer and employee at enterprise level, which the coalition would still like to achieve, would be a radical lurch away from the path we are already travelling with much success. Such a radical move would endanger this success. It would create industrial relations chaos, which would undermine our international trading position. Surely an evolutionary process that is working is preferable to that. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not surprising that employers tend to regard existing compliance provisions, such as stand-down provisions, as not good enough. It is similarly not surprising that unions regard the existing compliance procedures as being too tough on unions. In the 1987 Industrial Relations Bill, to satisfy employers' demands the Government proposed a new directions and injunctions process with higher monetary penalties for non-compliance. It also introduced a more efficient process for resolving secondary boycotts before sanctions were necessary. That Bill had the virtue of pleasing neither of the major combatants, which was probably a reasonable indicator that it hit the right spot. The Australian Democrats indicated then that they were prepared to support that legislation; however, the Government withdrew it before the 1987 election. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition Bill now before us is designed to introduce a compliance system which is heavily weighted towards employers but which does not have a complementary list of penalties for non-compliance. I do not believe that all employers would welcome this as the reaction of the unions would create industrial chaos. I understand that the Opposition must attempt to woo back to its fold business people who increasingly prefer a Labor Government to the ideology of the New Rightists who have hijacked the Liberal-National Party leadership. Their amendments cannot be seen as a constructive addition to a sensible industrial relations policy. Even the Australian Council of Trade Unions was reluctantly prepared to support the compliance provisions in the 1987 Bill in return for legislation to bring sections 45d and 45e of the Trade Practices Act into the Industrial Relations Act. As I said, the Democrats indicated to the Government their willingness to support those provisions. The Liberal and National parties, however, opposed this. As a result, the Government announced early in the 1987 election campaign that it would drop from the 1987 Bill the compliance provisions and the proposal to bring sections 45d and 45e of the Trade Practices Act into the Industrial Relations Bill, which it eventually enacted in the Parliament in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats agree that this is an area which is sadly inadequate in the field of industrial relations. We would welcome discussions with the Opposition and the Australian Labor Party with a view to reintroducing into the industrial relations legislation some form of a balanced range of compliance and penalty provisions which were dropped from the 1987 Bill. That would be a sensible way of addressing the problem. We are not, however, inclined to support a piece of political grandstanding designed to make a cheap political point and likely to hinder, rather than help, the current situation with the pilots. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1987 Industrial Relations Bill included a directions process quite fundamentally different to the process proposed by the Opposition at the time and espoused by the Bill before us today. </PARA>
<PARA> During the committee stage of the Industrial Relations Bill, the Opposition moved to include in the Bill a directions process involving directions being given by the Commission and injunctions for breaches or attempted breaches of such directions, with the ability to make applications to the court for damages resulting from any breach. This bears some similarity to the proposal before us today, and it is useful to look at the reaction at the time of the Government to that amendment. The Government gave several reasons for opposing the amendments suggested by the Opposition, in particular the vague nature of the wording, and the fact that the proposed scheme might delay the availability of remedies for industrial action because there is a clear risk that enforcement proceedings in the court could undermine attempts by the Commission to resolve the underlying industrial issues. Given the severity of the remedies and the lack of a sensible process of cooling-off, it would be understandable if the Commission and employers treated directions as a process of last resort and were reluctant to use them for fear of inflaming a dispute. These problems are equally evident in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The wording of the proposed section 187a, such as `impending' and `probable', is likely to incite rather than resolve conflict. The wide interpretation possible would not promote stability in the field of industrial relations. Similarly, the term `such directions as it thinks possible' would be open to very wide interpretation and could be used to impede the operation of small businesses and trade unions. Section 187c would enable a person to sue an individual involved in an industrial dispute carried out in breach of section 187a and which has resulted in loss or damage. This provides the opportunity for any one individual to be isolated and victimised because of loss or damages arising from an industrial dispute. That individual could be sued by members of the public and such legislation could bring a small business to its knees or destroy a trade union official. The ability to sue three years after the loss or damage has occurred virtually places into the legislation automatic retrospectivity once this provision is accepted by the Parliament, and one involved in industrial disputes over the previous three years would be liable to be sued. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Opposition is making a political point by bringing about a debate on this Bill now, it is unlikely that a parliamentary debate based on the pilots industrial dispute now will be at all helpful. It is more likely to inflame and encourage industrial unrest rather than be conducive to providing a settlement. I believe at the moment, at least temporarily, the pilots are complying with the directives of the Industrial Relations Commission. Perhaps they do not intend to continue to do so. Pilots are, of course, a powerful union because so few people are trained to do their job, and it is one which many of us find convenient, if not essential, to make use of. Strangely enough, what the pilots are doing in this dispute is engaging in free collective bargaining. They are, in effect, doing what the Opposition theoretically wants every employee to do under the coalition's industrial relations grand plan-to reach agreement with their employers outside the guidelines of a centralised industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA> It can be reasonably argued that the pilots dispute brings into focus the effects of that alternative model. We are experiencing the industrial chaos of a type that the Opposition industrial relations policy may possibly inflict on Australia. We are facing a wages breakout because of this industrial action. We are facing the realities of increasing strike action and the massive inconvenience this will cause. We are facing a decline in our tourism industry-an industry which earns foreign currency for Australia, and which has already been damaged by this dispute. All of this is likely to get worse rather than to get better. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, the Opposition's position on industrial relations has been and still is extraordinarily inconsistent and contradictory. The Opposition's response in this Bill is to give to the Industrial Relations Commission-which it wants to abolish-the power to enforce its decisions on a group that is engaging in the very process of collective bargaining which is the centrepiece of the Opposition's industrial relations policy. If the Opposition had acted sensibly instead of playing politics in 1987, or if the Government had proceeded with the 1987 legislation, the Commission would have had compliance provisions to use today. But the Opposition does not appear to be interested in a workable industrial relations system which can help resolve disputes without grave disruption to the economy. It is potentially inflaming the situation in making a political point which is inconsistent with its own industrial relations alternative model. This inconsistency is an important one. Today Senator Chaney has on his Napoleon hat. He is ready to inflict unspecified penalty, under the provisions of this Bill, on those who want higher wages. At other times, wearing his John Stuart Mill hat, he talks of free collective bargaining and espouses the liberty of individuals to make decisions without legislative direction. What does the coalition stand for in the industrial relations field? Does it stand for a centralised system, a decentralised system, both, or neither, or perhaps no system at all?</PARA>
<PARA> This is the second Opposition attack on the industrial relations system we have seen in this chamber in the three days we have been sitting this session. Could Opposition senators too be playing in the pre-election political games of which they have today so disparagingly accused both the Government and the Democrats? Of course they are. The Democrats will not be supporting this Bill. We would, however, as I have said, welcome discussions with the Opposition and the Government about the introduction into our industrial relations legislation of a set of sensible, balanced and comprehensive compliance provisions, with attached and understood penalties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The inadequacies in the compliance provisions of the Industrial Relations Act have been highlighted on numerous occasions by the Opposition. Quite contrary to what Senator Aulich claimed in his remarks earlier today, the reintroduction of this legislation is not an overreaction to a particular dispute. There have in fact been a number of like disputes over recent years which highlight the need for more effective compliance legislation. Quite simply, there is no effective mechanism under the Act to make those who seek to take advantage of our industrial relations system effectively subject to it. Senator Aulich should remember that this is the third occasion in less than two years that the Opposition has introduced legislation to establish effective compliance provisions. So it is not simply in reaction to this current dispute that we have introduced the Industrial Relations (Directions to Stop Industrial Action) Amendment Bill. We have introduced it on two previous occasions because over a period of years we have recognised the inadequacies of the present situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While there may be a current dispute involving the airline pilots, as I said at the outset, over the past couple of years we have seen numerous examples of like disputes. These have covered the building industry, the Plumbers and Gasfitters Employees Union of Australia, a situation with a minority of metal workers in Victoria, and another involving the Federated Storemen and Packers Union of Australia in New South Wales. It is often a feature of these situations that the unreasonable behaviour of a few renegade elements destroys progress towards cooperative behaviour. We can only hope that today the Government will come to its senses and support our initiative. The most recent example of industrial disputes which highlights the need for effective compliance provisions is the campaign of industrial action by the Federation of Air Pilots of Australia, in complete defiance of the Industrial Relations Commission. As I said, that is just the most recent of many examples, some of which I have given, of the impotence of the Commission while the Act continues to lack enforceable compliance provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> All we have heard about this week is soft landings. The reality is that, like Keating's Budget, Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines cannot even get off the ground because of the present pilots dispute. The dispute could completely destroy the Government's wages policy-to the extent that it survives anyway-with even more detrimental consequences for Australia's vulnerable economy. The pilots have asked for a 29 per cent pay increase. Are they being greedy or are they just anticipating the inflation rate of the next 12 months? A conciliation and arbitration structure which effectively binds only one side of the employer-employee relationship-namely, the employer, who is subject to effective sanctions while employees are not-is completely inadequate as we move towards the twenty-first century. The current procedures for enforcing a bans clause under the Act remain complex and impractical to pursue. That is why even former Minister Willis described them more than two years ago as disreputable and substantially moribund. That is why the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and the Metal Trades Industry Association Inc. have all highlighted the need to equip the Industrial Relations Commission with an effective means of disciplining trade unions which defy Commission decisions and rulings. That is why this week the Opposition has introduced for the third time its proposed amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> The detailed provisions of our legislation were enunciated at length by me in October 1988 when I moved them as amendments to the Industrial Relations Bill, and earlier in November 1987 by Senator Chaney when he introduced the same compliance Bill as we are debating today. It suffices today to summarise the provisions of our Bill as, firstly, empowering the Industrial Relations Commission to give directions to stop industrial action; secondly, empowering the Federal Court of Australia to grant an injunction where such direction is breached; thirdly, allowing people to sue for damages caused by such breaches; and, fourthly, retaining access to common law and other external legal actions for those detrimentally affected by breaches. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past the Government has opposed this legislation on several grounds, all of which are fallacious. It is claimed that the grounds on which an injunction may be issued are vague, but I have full confidence in the capacity of the Federal Court to determine the need for an injunction. The Government has claimed that the issuing of a direction could undermine the potential for conciliation, but the opportunity for conciliation is available and all such avenues would be exhausted well before such a direction would be sought and issued. An injunction would be used only as a last resort when conciliation and arbitration had well and truly broken down. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also claimed that our amendments are inferior to the proposals contained in its own 1987 industrial relations Bill. From Senator McLean's remarks a few moments ago, it seems that he has fallen hook, line and sinker for those false claims. The need for a certificate for an injunction to be obtained from a Full Bench, as was then proposed by the Government, would unduly delay the settlement of disputes, and time is often of the essence in avoiding financial ruin for employers. Treating breaches of injunctions as contempt of court, as we propose, will allow the court to determine penalties related to the circumstances and seriousness of the contempt, an approach far superior to the Government's 1987 proposals for arbitrary restrictions on the power of the court to punish appropriately. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's claim of unions being subject to double jeopardy under our proposed retention of common law rights for aggrieved parties, in addition to the compliance provisions, just does not stand up to close scrutiny. The fact is that there is already overlap between sections 45d and 45e of the Trade Practices Act, the common law and the existing bans clause provisions. But of course all these claims on the part of the Government that I have just dealt with are red herrings anyway because at the behest of that de facto member of the Cabinet, Simon Crean, the Government abandoned its 1987 compliance provisions in the Bill which passed through both Houses last year. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard Mr Keating and Mr Hawke debate each other's sex appeal recently, but this country's problem is not reproduction, it is production, and when it comes to that they cannot raise it. The fact is that improved production and productivity require major changes to Australia's industrial relations system. Senator Aulich talked about the need for a new ethos in industrial relations. That certainly is required and that is what the coalition's policy on industrial relations will achieve. The changes we propose will allow employers and employees to make their own agreement on employment conditions and wages at the individual workplace level. This will engender a new spirit of cooperation and enhance productivity at individual enterprises-cooperation and productivity which are desperately required by this country. Our approach will get industrial relations out of the hands of bureaucrats and the industrial relations club and back into the hands of those whom it really affects-employers and employees in their own workplace. Our policy will lay the groundwork for much better cooperation between employers and employees and, as employers and employees share the mutual benefits to be gained from this freer system, the Industrial Relations Commission will decline in significance. However-this is a point which Senator McLean ought to recognise-until that occurs after our policy is implemented we must have effective procedures, as provided in this Bill, to ensure that parties subject to the Industrial Relations Commission's rulings comply with those directions.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not contradictory for the Opposition to be introducing this legislation when it has a policy which overall seeks to free up the system. Obviously that will take time to implement and it will take time for the benefits to be recognised by employers and employees. Until that time the Industrial Relations Commission's decisions will remain of significance and, therefore, it is important to have compliance provisions as part of our industrial relations legislation to ensure that its directions are followed. Our legislation is fair and practical as a solution to one of the most serious issues in the day to day practice of industrial relations, and it has been recognised as such by the on-the-ground industrial relations practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA> This week's Budget squibs the real issues of micro-economic reform in the waterfront, coastal shipping and transport industries. The Treasurer's idea of structural reform is changing the name of the Industries Assistance Commission. The Opposition offers a real alternative, and I offer the Government the opportunity of salvaging something of its tattered reputation in this area by supporting this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;According to Senator Chaney's second reading speech, he has introduced the Industrial Relations (Directions to Stop Industrial Actions) Amendment Bill in the context of proposed industrial action by the Federation of Air Pilots of Australia. No doubt he, like the rest of us, is most concerned to do something about it because he has the perception that a section of the community-a very powerful section industrially-which compared to most people in the community is very highly paid, should be taking industrial action at a time when it is proper that a course which has been plotted by this Government and by the Australian Council of Trade Unions should be adhered to. It is certainly a most worrying attack on the accord. Although he has condemned the accord, if one has listened to any of his speeches one will realise that he has a great deal of sympathy with the thrust of what the accord is all about. He has sought, no doubt along with everyone else who is concerned about the matter, to ensure that the airline pilots-a privileged group in the community-do not cause damage to the industrial relations system or to the economy of this country. In that matter, his aspirations are correct. The real issue is whether in trying to achieve a good end he is adopting the proper means. In the second paragraph of his tabling speech he states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No amount of jawboning by the Minister for Industrial Relations can hide the fact that the Government has deliberately and knowingly left itself virtually powerless in the face of such a campaign. </PARA>
<PARA>From a general reading of the honourable senator's tabling speech, he is saying that in the end the only way we can conduct industrial relations is with a big stick. No doubt he holds the theory that many adhere to that at the periphery of society there must be powerful sanctions to keep it in order. In this case he says that to meet the need, which no doubt must be met, of the airline pilots who are conducting industrial action, we must introduce very severe sanctions. The question is whether he is pursuing the right path. Criminal sanctions-and that is what it amounts to in the end because a failure to obey an injunction is a contempt of court, and a contempt of court is a crime-are met with imprisonment. The last person to be imprisoned under such a procedure was Clarrie O'Shea. </PARA>

<PARA>Experience has shown repeatedly that when organisations which are acting illegally are faced with the reality of such heavy fines for defying court orders they quickly come to their senses. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no provision in the Bill to confine the orders that the Federal Court can make to fines. In fact, as I understand it, it is left open in clause 187b for the court to impose a term of imprisonment because the ability of the court to punish contempt is not confined to a fine. So the honourable senator is contemplating-whether he intended to or not-gaoling pilots if they fail to obey an injunction from the Federal Court. If the honourable senator wants to introduce into industrial relations legislation even the possibility of imprisonment, he needs to look again at the Clarrie O'Shea case. He will see that that provision exacerbates the situation and that it makes things much worse than they are. The way through is the time-honoured way which leads invariably in the end to the settlement of disputes. Disputes must be settled one way or the other. In the end, the best way is the way the Government adopts, which is by using what provisions are available under the Industrial Relations Act. The figures show that the Government has had success in industrial relations matters since it has come into office. If we compare the number of industrial disputes under this Government with the number of disputes under the previous Government we get a figure which is quoted again and again in this chamber, but which never seems to get through to honourable senators opposite.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not got those figures. I am citing the figures I have on the number of industrial disputes, which are down 59 per cent, under Labor. Opposition senators may want to dispute those figures, but they are figures which have been quoted again and again in this chamber, and honourable senators either accept the basis for them-which, apparently, is ABS statistics-or they do not. There are two pieces of evidence on which I want to rely. One is what happened when the imprisonment provisions were used with Clarrie O'Shea, and the other is the drop in industrial disputes that occurred under this Government. While I am speaking on Senator Chaney's tabling speech I will go to some other points he made. He stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The introduction of effective compliance provisions has a major role to play in ensuring the effective implementation of an economically appropriate wages policy. At present the Commission knows that its decisions will be adhered to by employers. However compliance on the part of the unions is effectively voluntary. </PARA>
<PARA>What he is saying in effect is that the employers obey the orders, directions and awards of the Industrial Relations Commission but that the employees do not. That is wrong. The real problem is that when Senator Chaney proposes changes in the law they are more likely to be accepted or more likely to be rejected depending upon the credibility of his tabling speech. The paragraph I have just quoted is an indication of the fact that there is not as much reliance to be placed upon what he says as is hoped. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that employers and employees do not obey awards and they need to be taken to court. A famous case involved the Robe River Iron Ore Associates and Charles Copeman who took insufficient notice of the Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission. An interim award was brought down this year in the case of Thomas Borthwick and Son (Pacific) Ltd in Portland. It had a dispute with the Victorian branch of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union. The employer did not obey either clause 6 in respect of preferences or clause 35 in respect of seniority. Senator Chaney, for some reason, has failed to mention the Australian Bank Employees Union v. the National Australia Bank which was decided by Mr Justice Gray in March last year. He found against National Australia Bank Ltd. He did not mention the case of the Australian Bank Employees Union v. Westpac Banking Corporation-again a breach of the old section 119, which I think is section 178 in the new Act. With those precedents behind them the banks have still failed to pay proper award wages to 600 employees. Senator Chaney says that employers invariably obey the provisions of the Act and awards, but this is just not borne out in evidence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But the honourable senator does not say that. He says that there are effective sanctions but, in saying that, he is disagreeing with the Full Bench of the Federal Court of Australia. Let me quote from the case of Gregory v. Philip Morris Ltd. On 14 April last year Justices Jenkinson, Wilcox and Ryan brought down this decision:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Our finding that the dismissal of Mr Gregory was harsh, unjust and unreasonable necessarily leads to the conclusion that it constituted a breach . . . of the Metal Industry Award. </PARA>
<PARA>In reference to the old Act, it continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Section 119 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act provides for the imposition of a penalty for breach of an award. We think that a penalty ought to be imposed. In assessing the amount of that penalty regard must be had to the circumstance that the maximum penalty that may be imposed by the court for a breach of an award is only $1,000-a figure which has remained unchanged since 1970 and which is so low as to have little deterrent effect. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Full Bench of the Federal Court had to say, which is in stark contrast with Senator Chaney's statement that the present penalties that can be brought against employers are sufficient. Either the Full Bench is right or Senator Chaney is right. I simply leave it at that. True enough, a serious situation is facing Australia in the form of the industrial action threatened by the pilots. True enough, something ought to be done about it. Honourable senators on this side of the Senate have different views from honourable senators opposite as to the mechanism that should be used. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney introduced a matter for debate in his tabling speech for this Bill. In my view it is a proper matter to raise for debate here. Honourable senators opposite accept that sanctions ought to be imposed, but the experience of honourable senators on this side of the chamber shows otherwise. Nevertheless, it is a proper matter for debate. But in debating this matter we really have to come down to matters of reality and fact which can be accepted by both sides. I simply say, in respect of the statement that there are adequate sanctions to bring employers into line, that that is not correct. Senator Chaney said that, at present, the Industrial Relations Commission knows that its decisions will be adhered to by employers, but that is just not correct. We simply have to look at reported cases in recent times to understand that. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me go through the Bill because I think it has some difficulties in it which Opposition senators might like to look at. Clause 187a (2) (a) states:</PARA>
<PARA>A direction under subsection (1) may be given to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a party to the industrial dispute;</PARA>
<PARA>That would enable the Commission to stop primary boycotts and then to visit on breach of that order the same capacity as is presently given anybody suffering from the effects of a secondary boycott under sections 45d and 45e of the Trade Practices Act. In fact, this Bill would remove the protection given by section 45d (3). That would be taking a very big step. In spite of what honourable senators opposite might say about Mudginberri, sections 45d and 45e have proved to do more harm than good in industrial relations. Extending their operation to primary boycotts and taking away the protection that presently exists under section 45d (3)-admittedly, in limited circumstances, that is, where the Commission orders it-is a very unhappy trend. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 187b (1) states that anybody bound by an award can claim an injunction. This would enable people affected by a particular industrial dispute to claim an injunction. It would almost encourage Uncle Tomism, if that is the proper expression, where some tamecat employee could take action against a union or his fellow employees under section 187b (1) even though that person might not be affected. I think that is a bad trend and it will not encourage happy industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 187b (2), which deals with interim injunctions, gives scope for an interim injunction to be granted. That could be granted to stop an industrial dispute without giving the union any opportunity to put its side of the case. In those circumstances, I think interim injunctions are quite unfair as they will deny those taking one side of the argument any opportunity of putting their case. Senator Chaney has not said this in his Bill, but it follows from what he has put in it that there will be sanctions for breaches of injunctions and he has made it clear that he expects those sanctions to be fines. I accept that he really does not want people to go to gaol; nevertheless, the way the Bill presently reads that possibility is left well and truly open. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn quickly to clause 187c, which gives a person suffering damages the ability to claim damages. I suppose that that is really only enshrining a common law position for conspiracy, intimidation or inducing a breach of contract. I am not sure why Senator Chaney would want to do that since it is already in the legislation. Again I am at a loss to know why Senator Chaney wants to take away the powers of the State courts and transfer them to the Federal Court. In any event, I am not sure whether he will have the constitutional power to do that, unless he can bring it under the corporations power which certainly is not part of a settlement of a dispute as it will normally take place after the dispute is over. So I am at a loss as to why Senator Chaney has included clause 198c; there seems to be no basis or reason for it. Unfortunately, in my view, common law provisions already encompass that. In any event, as I understand it, there are some constitutional problems. Clause 187e of the Bill states:</PARA>
<PARA> For the purposes of sections 187b and 187c, action taken in breach of a direction under section 187a by an officer, employee, member or agent of an organisation shall be deemed to have been taken by the organisation, unless the organisation establishes that it took all reasonable steps to prevent the person from taking the action. </PARA>
<PARA>This would reverse the normal onus of proof and place it on the person who will be charged with contempt and that person would be in very real danger of imprisonment. In fact, if we think about it we realise that this has happened with people such as Norm Gallagher. Where an injunction is issued and somebody disobeys it that person ends up in gaol. To put people in gaol on a reverse onus of proof is to take a very big step indeed. It is the sort of thing that the Opposition may wish to think about. In my view, the philosophy behind the Bill is misdirected, for the reasons that have already been described not only by me but perhaps more eloquently by others. The experience and evidence of the industrial relations field is against the tenor of the Bill. If one looks at the actual structure and the technicalities of the Bill, one finds some real problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by quoting from the Australian Financial Review of 20 January 1989 which carried an article about Dr Edwards Deming, who thought out the philosophy out of which Japan's economic miracle has occurred since the Second World War. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Deming has been hammering this message since the closing days of World War II. Then, the US was the pre-eminent industrial power, exporting its products and management ideas to a grateful world. American management did not want to listen to someone saying their philosophy was flawed. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Deming went to Japan and showed companies such as Toyota how it could rebuild and one day eclipse companies in the United States. That has been established. This is what the article says about Dr Deming:</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Deming has no time for the confrontationist attitudes of the New Right. Confrontation brings a `lose-lose' result, with the company and the workforce both suffering. Common purpose brings the possibility of `win-win'. </PARA>
<PARA>Really, the philosophy has to be one of cooperation and one thought out in the long term. It should not be one that reacts to a specific incident, as the Opposition has reacted on this occasion. What has to be done-and this has already been pointed out-is the development of a new industrial and workplace philosophy. I simply say that of course everybody is concerned about the industrial action taken by the Federation of Air Pilots, and of course something must be done about it, but if one analyses what the Opposition has done on this occasion, one sees that it is very much the wrong approach. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening the Senate is debating the Industrial Relations (Directions to Stop Industrial Action) Amendment Bill 1989. I suppose the opening comments by Senator Chaney who introduced the Bill-and it is his Bill-will be given some weight in the community, to give it some form of colloquial charm, because it is directed at this point, even though it has been previously introduced, at a proposed stoppage of work or industrial action, by a small group of people who are members of the Federation of Air Pilots. I suppose it could be called a high flying amendment or some other silly thing such as that, but it is not a silly action that the pilots are engaged in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In his second reading speech, Senator Chaney referred to the innocent individuals caught in the tussle between the employer and the employees. We would all recognise the innocent individuals in this place, because from reports that I have had during my last duty period in the chamber I am given to understand that the pilots will be taking further action tomorrow and that those of us who were hoping to return to our families for the weekend and next week will probably be unable to do so. So we have a deep interest in the matter that is being debated here tonight. Despite the colloquial terms which may be used in regard to the Bill by our friends in the media or other pundits around the scene, as we all know, it is not a laughing matter. </PARA>
<PARA> It is probably unfortunate that this Bill is being debated at this particular time, homing in on a single dispute. Perhaps the dispute will lead honourable senators from all political parties to have a bias against what the Federation of Air Pilots is seeking to do tomorrow, if the rumours are true. We could be biased because we may be disadvantaged if they do go through with their threat of industrial action tomorrow in grounding all aircraft within Australia. But had the legislation been passed when it was previously introduced-as I recall, it has been on two separate occasions-would the Bill and the provisions contained in the amending Bill have halted the action taken by the Federation of Air Pilots?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1I4">Senator McKIERNAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cooney says it would not. I doubt very much that it would. The particular organisation we are talking about at the moment has set its sights on a course of action. Irrespective of the consequences to Australia, to our economy or, indeed, to its own members, it will follow it through. In my active participation in the industrial relations area, I have seen similar situations develop where the mind is set, a course of action is embarked upon and off they go. Irrespective of whether the Industrial Relations Act contained the provisions that are contained in this amendment Bill, I doubt very much whether it would make an iota of difference to their course of action tomorrow. Senator Chaney said that jawboning by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) will not solve it either. He said a little more than that, but I think my paraphrase is a fair treatment of what the Leader of the Opposition in this place said. I suggest that Senator Chaney is completely and utterly removed from the industrial relations scene pertaining in Australia today. He shows that ignorance by making statements such as he is making at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this country at the moment we have a controversial agreement. It is controversial because elements in the community do not agree with it because of its success; that is, the prices and incomes accord which exists between the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Government. Although the accord has been on shaky ground ever since it was established, it is still in existence and it is still working; it is delivering the goods. It is not doing so by threatening a big stick, heavy fines or tossing people in gaol. It is working as a result of discussion and deliberation and an acceptance that each of the parties involved in negotiations have legitimate claims. </PARA>
<PARA> In his contribution earlier in the debate, Senator Aulich described what it is like to be a worker on the shop floor and the provisions and rights of workers. A very important right in the workers' armament is the right to strike. In this chamber and in other places in the past, I have agreed that the right to strike has been abused by a number of individuals and organisations in our community. I am on record in Hansard as having said that, in abusing that right to strike, they diminish the value of that right to strike because it is seen to be the first course of action. In certain sections of the community that was seen to be the only course of action. Many of the problems and difficulties that we have in the industrial relations arena can be resolved by merely talking or, as Senator Chaney put it, by jawboning. They can be resolved by that method. If they are not resolved by that method, the workers involved still have that very precious instrument-the right to strike. It is something that should not be abused. </PARA>
<PARA> If we had excessive punitive powers contained in the Act, it would not guarantee, as I have argued before, that both major airline companies of Australia would fly tomorrow. It would not guarantee it at all. In actual fact it might make the situation even more difficult. We have seen situations in the past in the industrial relations arena of Australia where a dispute arose and a strike occurred over, for example, the hours of work, the amount of overtime available or not available, or a wages question. By the use of the threat of punitive powers it got turned into a much larger dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> I will go back a few years to 1979. There are a few Western Australian senators in the chamber at the moment. I will look at a dispute that occurred in Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd in the Pilbara region. At a very simple public community meeting to explain the strike situation, that infamous section of the Western Australian Police Act, section 54b, was implemented. Union officials were arrested merely because they had not obtained police permission to address the meeting. The thing got out of hand and it cost Australia millions of dollars before it was finally resolved. It was eventually resolved, but at a very great cost to Australia. There are ways and means around industrial conflict. Unions and employers in Australia have explored them and are coming up with solutions. But because we are dealing with human beings, such as ourselves, there will be fallouts on the way through. One of the nice features about being a human being, despite what we think of ourselves, is that we are not perfect by any stretch of the imagination. </PARA>
<PARA> The full intent of this amendment Bill is reflected in the sanctions that it brings with it. If carried, it will provide the Commission with virtually the same powers as the Federal Court to fine any union or body or person in breach of an injunction if such an injunction is deemed to have been breached. If those fines are not paid, the court can order that the goods that the individuals or organisations possess can be taken away from them. That is a clever ploy. It is a smart ploy. I commend Senator Chaney and those members of the Opposition who thought up this piece of legislation. They realised from bitter experiences that sanctions do not work. </PARA>
<PARA> It will not be the first time that the name Clarrie O'Shea has been mentioned in this chamber. He was secretary of the Tramways Union in Melbourne. I believe it was in 1969 that his organisation was engaged in some action for which, after a trial, it was convicted. As the principal officer he was the person responsible. He was fined by the court. The fines were not paid. The officers did not go out and seize the goods; they went out and seized Clarrie. They shoved him in gaol. Of course, Australia stopped at a cost to the economy and the community of many millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> Penal sanctions do not work. The harder they are, the less effective they will probably be. The trade union movement is a powerful force in Australia. As I have said, there have been times when that power has been used irresponsibly. We have the classic case of the responsible use of the power of trade unions through the workings of the economy of Australia today through the processes of the prices and incomes accord. No amount of heavy brutal sanctions will even the balance and ensure that industrial action does not happen. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney went on to say that the arbitration process that we have in Australia today is heavily laden towards the employers. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>At present the Commission knows that its decisions will be adhered to by employers. </PARA>
<PARA>In a speech earlier this week I gave minute details and particular examples of an employer in my home State which has thumbed its nose at the Western Australian Industrial Commission-not the Federal Commission in this case. There were provisions within the legislation in Western Australia for a form of sanctions. Senator Chaney will know the employer I speak about-Robe River. It thumbed its nose at this. The amount of money concerned did not mean a thing to that multi-million dollar organisation. It was out to break the trade union movement, and the cost did not matter-not only what it cost in actual dollar terms but also what it cost in human terms. </PARA>
<PARA> In a recent speech on industrial relations I mentioned the case of a clerk in an office situation who was ordered by the employer, Robe River, to drive a truck in an iron ore mine in the north-west of Western Australia. A female clerk was ordered to do this. She refused. She not only lost her job because she disobeyed an order; in a mining town such as that she lost her home and her community-because there is no other employment in Pannowonica, where that incident happened. </PARA>
<PARA> Other arguments could be put forward as to whether the Commission favours one section of the industrial relations scene or favours another section. I have heard cries from time to time from people within the trade union movement about various decisions of the Commission. One union in Western Australia was in touch with me last week following the national wage case decision, which the majority of unions accepted. This particular union did not accept it. It felt that it was very biased. I suppose that, in its own mind, the decision was biased. Any decisions at any time can be deemed to be biased one way or the other. There are employers who claim that decisions of the Commission are biased. I know of some that were not particularly happy with the decision on the national wage case of last week. I also recognise the disunity of the employer organisations in putting forward a case to the Commission, and I recognise the choices for the Commission. I do not think that anybody, not even Senator Chaney, could claim that the Commission's decision was actually the submission of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. In view of the complexity of the decision and the amount of time needed to decipher the Commission's intent, not even Senator Chaney or any employer organisation could justify such a claim. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When a proposal such as that contained in the Industrial Relations (Directions to Stop Industrial Action) Amendment Bill 1989 put forward by Senator Chaney comes before the Senate, normally I respond in a very angry way because, having worked for the trade union movement for many years and having seen the sorts of things that employers perpetrate against employees, I have a very keen interest in the future of employees. I suffer with them, as I have for over 20 years as a union official. But tonight I do not feel that way. I feel rather sad instead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I recall historical events, I think about the shearers' strike and the way the strikers were charged and put into chains. They were ordinary working men who were concerned about the inability of keeping up a reasonable standard of living and putting clothes on the backs of their wives and families. In 1969 we saw the imprisonment of Clarrie O'Shea. In those times heavy handed legislation was used to fine unions, until the stage when the workers said, `No longer'. There was a massive demonstration about that type of action and for many years penalties were not imposed. </PARA>
<PARA> One would think that a person who is as intelligent as Senator Chaney-it is the way he uses his intelligence that I question-would read that history, understand it and begin to learn from it. Because we now have a dispute which relates to domestic airline pilots, apparently Senator Chaney feels that something has to be done to make the current industrial relations legislation even more draconian. </PARA>
<PARA> A trade unionist, like me, might think-even though I am part of the Government-that if I were given the responsibility to legislate about these matters I would be even kinder to workers on the job than this Government has been. However, I believe the Government has done a good job and the current legislation provides plenty of opportunities to employers to use the facilities of the courts and the Industrial Relations Commission to solve disputes and in many cases, because of the information which is available to them, to prevent disputes from developing. </PARA>
<PARA> The pilots, to my knowledge and in my experience, have never been part of the trade union movement. Why the Opposition wants to attack them I fail to understand. The pilots have always been partly outside the system. I would not want to do them an injustice, but I cannot recall them ever being involved in a dispute where they helped other people in the trade union movement. If they have, I would like to know about it. They have really been special people. The pilots compare themselves with judges and doctors. They are not concerned about the policy of the trade union movement which is aimed at-and has accepted-dampening of wages and accepting responsibility in contributing to the way in which the economy has to be revived. The trade union movement is concerned about the future of this country. The Australian Council of Trade Unions and affiliated unions are. </PARA>
<PARA> I think of Senator Chaney as a little boy with a box of matches being out in the bush and deciding to light a fire to warm himself. All of a sudden the whole bush is set on fire and everything is destroyed. I would like to see someone take that box of matches off Senator Chaney. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the current industrial relations position, the way in which the unions are behaving and the response of some employers-and to a great extent even the collective employer organisations-it is obvious that employers do get the best they can out of the system, as do the trade unions. The difference is that the trade unions want to get the best out of the system for ordinary people who want a decent standard of living but who are quite prepared to contribute to the development and the creation of wealth so that they can have that standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA> The prices and incomes accord set the basis for that situation. Prior to the accord, during the last 18 months of the Fraser Government when there was a freezing of wages and prices continued to climb, there was a loss to workers of 9 per cent. In part the accord says that we should be given the opportunity to regain that 9 per cent. That has not happened to this stage. We have only attempted to keep up with inflation. That is something that could not have been achieved under a coalition government. </PARA>
<PARA> But what do we have in these circumstances? We have the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Chaney) coming in here with a proposition for even more draconian measures that will not work. We need to continue down the path that the current Government has set itself upon; that is, we need to be able to continue to negotiate with the unions about a wages system which has produced a situation in which wages have barely caught up with inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> We had a second tier wage set-up recently which involved a 4 per cent increase in wages. One of the things that went with the 4 per cent increase in wages was an increase in productivity. It might not have been about how many units went out at the end of the factory production line, but as a result of it agreements between the unions and the employers were changed so that the wage increase was neutral. People had to show that there had been a 4 per cent saving in costs to the employer in order to get the 4 per cent increase. That not only went towards labour costs; it went to other things that might have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that the 4 per cent exercise did-and the legislation Senator Chaney proposes will destroy that-was to develop to some extent trust and cooperation amongst employers. If someone amongst the employer organisations had suggested 10 years ago a similar proposition to that in which the 4 per cent increase was negotiated, he would have been committed to an institution. It would never have been considered possible. But here it is. Who suggested the method of productivity bargaining? The trade union movement did. It suggested that there should be an increase of 4 per cent but because of its agreement with the Labor Government and its desire to contribute to the economic benefit of this country-and that clearly shows its concern about the community-it suggested that proposition. In other circumstances it would have absolutely opposed such a thing and has done so down through the years. </PARA>
<PARA> So we had this different situation being developed, but being developed because of the initiative of the trade union movement-not because of the employers. Many employers grasped hold of it and sought a fair return. They paid the 4 per cent but they got a 4 per cent reduction in other areas which made the increase neutral. Other employers who were either greedy or stupid, or both, wanted a 10 per cent increase for a 4 per cent payment. Those employers disregarded what should have been a clear understanding: it was not just the 4 per cent; it was not just a negotiation; it was a question of developing trust that could be built upon to the benefit of both sides of any argument in the industrial relations field. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now entering upon the restructuring of awards. Again, that is something that people once would not have believed possible. I am a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. That Committee recently completed a report in relation to trying to reactivate the manufacturing industry, looking at import replacements and at getting into the export market. One of the things we found-and it is clear in the report-is that attitudes were tremendously important. We found that many of the attitudes that needed change were in management, not in areas of the workers or in areas of the unions. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now embarked on an inquiry into new management techniques. While I know I cannot say too much until the report has been handed down, certain matters have been raised and certain attitudes have been expressed in public hearings. That information is now the property of everybody in this country. It is very clear that the companies which are concerned about giving information to their employees, concerned about communications, concerned to listen to people and not just to say, `You are not paid to think; you are paid to do what you are told' are really achieving great benefits. I will not mention any names, but I recall one company that reduced costs by something like 25 per cent. In other areas, it increased productivity by 50 per cent. If we talk about productivity, the workers in that company would say that they wanted their share, namely, a wage increase of 50 per cent. That was not the result because in that company there had been very good consultation between management and labour. They agreed on a closed shop and they knew with whom they were dealing. In that way, good faith has been built up. As a result of increased productivity and reduced labour costs, the company could offer a lower tender price and get more work. That resulted in more exports and more opportunities for employment. That is what happened in that enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney may say that he wants to talk about the enterprise aspect. There is no problem with that, but when he tries to isolate those workers in those enterprises from their trade union, which broadly provides them with support and the sort of information they need to negotiate and to understand matters correctly and when he tries to cut off their right to pass on their experiences to others in the working and business community as to the way to go about these things, he has a problem because he does not at the same time suggest that the enterprise has no such right. Senator Chaney says that the metal trades employers and the Confederation of Australian Industry have that right, but he wants to cut off the rights of employees. That is just crazy. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said enough to inform people that what Senator Chaney is suggesting will not work. It is crazy to suggest that people can be bludgeoned and dragooned into not taking some action, because the difference between someone who can withdraw his labour, which after all is all he has to offer, and someone who cannot is the difference between freedom and slavery. We need to look at mutual benefit; we need to be able to talk together and to get away from the crazy `us and them' concept. The avoidance of that in some areas has meant that some people in other countries have been able to achieve the sort of prosperity that we have been unable to achieve. I agree with those things, but when we are developing better cooperation why would we use these methods? I suggest that we should not. Senator Chaney should reconsider his position and withdraw the legislation because it is ill-advised and it will not work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply -The Senate is debating the Industrial Relations (Directions to Stop Industrial Action) Amendment Bill, which I introduced earlier this week. It proposes amendments to the industrial relations legislation, and those amendments go to providing a system for enforcing the directions of the Industrial Relations Commission. I start by thanking those honourable senators who have contributed to the debate, perhaps also acknowledging the numerous senators from the Opposition who would have liked to have contributed but who joined with me in wanting to bring the matter to a vote tonight and so abstained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I acknowledge the contributions, in particular, of Senator Cooney, Senator McKiernan and Senator Burns, all of whom spoke with a great depth of trade union experience. I wish to respond to some of the things that they had to say. I want also to respond to what was said by Senator Aulich, who contributed to the debate in a quite different spirit. I will touch on that separately. I thank the other three Government senators to whom I referred for their very serious contributions to the debate and I want to give them a serious response. I also thank Senator Chapman and acknowledge his contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> It is always easier to commence with the contribution of the honourable senator who has just resumed his seat, because it is freshest in one's memory. Senator Burns spoke of his concern about the abuse of workers and so on. I simply wish to assure Senator Burns that in referring to the role of the Federal Government the industrial relations policy which I helped to refine and reissued last year makes the point that there is an obligation to ensure that neither employers nor unions are able to abuse their power. I assure Senator Burns that as far as I am concerned protecting employees against abuse of power is just as vital and a matter of just as much seriousness as protecting the right of any employer. I point out to Senator Burns that the measures we propose are available to employees as well as employers. </PARA>
<PARA> In the particular case raised by Senator Cooney, where he pointed out some defect in the existing capacity of arbitral tribunals to protect the interests of employees in what he thought was an adequate way in the sorts of circumstances he mentioned, the procedures that we are suggesting should go into the Act would be available to the workers who could obtain an injunction which would put the employer at the risk of a contempt of court proceeding if the employer did not obey. So this is a two-way arrangement, not one that is put there solely for the purpose of employers. </PARA>
<PARA> What is it that we are seeking to do? We seek to make the longstanding industrial arrangements in Australia accountable. We seek to reach a situation where the obligations which arise from being a participant in the system are obligations that bind both the employer and the employee. For the benefit of those Labor senators who have spoken in the debate, I remind them that the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Willis-a child of the trade union movement, a man who worked for the Australian Council of Trade Unions, who worked with the present Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), who came into government as the Minister for Industrial Relations and who was the proponent of the industrial relations legislation which went through the Parliament last year-had this to say when introducing his original Bill in 1987:</PARA>
<PARA> An essential element of any industrial relations system which provides benefits and protections to registered organisations and their members is that there should be an effective means of ensuring adherence to the principles on which the system is founded and compliance with the decisions of its institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that was a very sensible and unchallengeable statement: if we are going to have a system of arbitration, it should bind both sides of the employment equation. Mr Willis went on to say that the existing bans clause provisions-which are precisely the provisions which exist in the new legislation-are provisions which have fallen into disrepute. Again, to use the Minister's words, they are now `substantially moribund'. That was the judgment not of the Liberal Party or the National Party, but of Mr Willis in 1987. Indeed, in the election campaign of 1987 Mr Willis made it quite clear in a debate with me on station 3LO in Melbourne that the Government would reintroduce its industrial relations legislation and it would contain compliance procedures. I quoted what he said in my second reading speech in this place on 18 November 1987, but for the benefit of Senator Burns and others I will quote him again. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the original proposals to prevent the use of common law and to require conciliation before trade practices action could be taken in respect of sections 45d and e against trade unions, that those provisions will not be gone ahead with--</PARA>
<PARA>in other words, Mr Willis agreed that the proposals should not be proceeded with-</PARA>
<PARA>nor will the increase in monetary penalties. That will leave us with a compliance system which is more similar to the one which currently exists but with some very substantial differences, a direction system which I believe will be more effective than the current bans clause system which has virtually been moribund for 20 years and also with an array of non-monetary penalties where unions or the employers refuse to accept Commission decisions or orders.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Willis made those statements during the election campaign of 1987. For the benefit of Senator McLean, who has come back into the chamber, I say that it was an election undertaking of the Hawke Government given through its Minister, Mr Willis, that the Government would enact the legislation with directions and compliance procedures as well as remove the restrictions on the common law injunction and the fetters in the way of the use of section 45d and section 45e. </PARA>
<PARA> The basis on which this Government went to the people in 1987 was that there would be maintenance of sections 45d and 45e, maintenance of the common law injunction, and a directions and compliance provision along the lines indicated by Mr Willis earlier in that year. That was the election commitment, made clearly and in my presence, and subsequently dishonoured because Mr Crean, in August 1987, said `no'. That is the history of this matter. It is quite simple. There was a clear definition of the need from Mr Willis, a clear pre-election undertaking that the need would be met, and a clear dishonouring of that commitment. I say to those senators who have tried to present this as being a terrible union bashing that that is nonsense. This is modelled on a streamlined version of what was proposed by a Labor Minister for Industrial Relations, a man with lifelong experience in the trade union movement. Therefore, I say that the concerns that have been expressed, in my view, are quite exaggerated. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge that some serious points were raised. Matters that I would certainly wish to consider in the committee stage of the Bill were raised by Senator Cooney in relation to possible breadth of penalties that would be imposed for breach of a court order, for contempt of court. I think that is a matter which we could consider in the committee stage of the Bill. Senator Cooney, for example, might like to bring forward an amendment which, like the original proposal of Mr Willis, puts some limit on the degree of punishment which could be imposed with respect to an action for contempt of court. One might wish, for example, totally to exclude any question of possible imprisonment. Certainly it has never been the intention of the Opposition that there should be other than monetary penalties in this area. That would be the sort of amendment that the Senate could very sensibly consider. Again I acknowledge the sensible contribution that was made by Senator Cooney in drawing that matter out. I indicated to him privately that that was a matter which I thought should be given serious consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to some of the other matters which have been raised. Senator Burns and Senator McKiernan are people who have worked in the trade union movement. Senator Burns is absolutely right about the value of what can be done within an enterprise. Of course it is possible to get considerable increases in productivity, which is precisely what the Treasurer (Mr Keating), the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) and many other people have identified as the key requirement to solve Australia's economic problems. If one looks at what the system has delivered since the accord was put in place, one will see that the Australian work force is entitled to feel cheated. It has delivered flat productivity and declining real wages. I do not think that is what Senator Burns thinks the system should be producing. </PARA>
<PARA> If Government senators look at the Budget Papers they will see that the Government estimates that wages will rise by 7 per cent this year but inflation will be 7 1/2 per cent. Productivity will be stagnant or declining. With productivity stagnant or declining-and these are the Government's figures-it is inevitable that real wages will not rise. Therefore there should be serious questions in the minds of the Government senators as to the effectiveness of six years of the accord when it has rewarded the Australian work force so badly. Australian workers have had wage rises twice as quickly as have our trading competitors, but they have been rewarded with diminished wages because our inflation rate is much higher. That is the real problem. The Australian work force is fed up and angry. There is a risk of a wages break-out because the system is not delivering. </PARA>

<PARA> We are offering an approach to industrial relations which has a number of essential particulars. In a debate earlier this week on industrial relations matters in a much broader sense, we discussed a series of propositions which we believe need to be addressed if we are to break out of Australia's impasse. What are those propositions? Firstly, we say that we need to move the industrial relations system towards the enterprise, that it is by working together within enterprises that one achieves results. Some of the most senior trade unionists in the country have agreed with me on that proposition. The action has to happen within enterprises. That is the way the industrial relations system has to be re-shaped. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, we need a trade union structure which is a contributor to the direct dealing between employers and employees within enterprises instead of a source of demarcation disputes and problems. Again there is a good deal of common ground in that. The present Government, in its defence industries, for example, is working very hard to reduce the number of unions in any particular workplace. With respect to the submarine contract, it has insisted that the multiplicity of unions be reduced. Senior trade unionists admit that the most desirable position would be a single trade union per workplace. The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) pattern of union amalgamations is not designed to produce that outcome. It is essentially a system which is based on political considerations and will not produce the desired outcome of single enterprise bargaining units. If that is a significant difference between us, so be it. The Opposition is right in that regard and will pursue that policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The third area that we discussed in a much broader debate last Tuesday was the issue of compliance. I have already quoted Mr Willis's very sensible view expressed in 1987 about the need to have that sort of compliance. Those senators who believe that some sorts of legal controls act against the interests of the work force and against good outcomes are flying in the face of the facts. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development 1987 report on adjustment and economic performance saw the absence of legal controls over collective bargaining as one of the distinguishing features of those European countries with the worst records in industrial relations. It pointed out that those countries with the worst industrial relations records over the last two decades have been those with the weakest framework of labour law-the United Kingdom, France and Italy. The report noted that the situation in those countries has improved in recent years. It went on:</PARA>
<PARA>It can be argued that the continued exemption in each of these countries of a broad range of industrial disputes from liability for civil damages not only increases strike frequency but also reduces the value of collective agreements to both workers and employers. </PARA>
<PARA>An essential element of any orderly and progressive system of industrial relations would be the precise quality that was described by Mr Willis in his second reading speech in 1987 as an essential element, namely, that the system should have an `effective means of ensuring adherence to the principles on which the system is founded'. </PARA>
<PARA> The current debate takes place at the time of a serious dispute relating to air pilots. That makes the debate somewhat relevant because the air pilots have been taken before the Industrial Relations Commission. The arbitration commissioner has given them directions which they have flatly ignored. Tonight they have escalated the dispute still further by saying that they will fly between nine and five. Obviously that will cause enormous losses to their employers as well as enormous inconvenience to thousands of the travelling public. One of the Government's senior Ministers told me this morning that the Government will come down hard on this issue. What will it do? It will push for the deregistration of the Federation. Then what? Where does that leave us? Absolutely nowhere. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a classic situation. One does not have collective bargaining in any acceptable sense, one has coercive bargaining. It has always been part of the policy of the Opposition that collective bargaining-an approach whereby industrial relations are regulated by agreement-is only satisfactory where there is an absence of coercive power. That is why we have a series of interlocking reforms which prevent the sort of industrial blackmail that we are seeing in Australia today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is proposed in this Bill is a simple, but very powerful, support for the Arbitration Commission in its decisions, instead of having the situation that we have debated so often here where the former Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, in trying to deal with disputes in the building industry and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, reported on a state of industrial anarchy. During the plumbers and gasfitters dispute their unions spent six months thumbing their noses at the Arbitration Commission. Now the pilots are thumbing their noses at the Commission. The Opposition says that there has been enough of that, and it is time to give the Commission some genuine authority. </PARA>
<PARA> When we introduced this Bill on a previous occasion, as an amendment to the earlier legislation, we received strong support from a series of employer bodies-bodies which, I must say, have been very ready to criticise different aspects of our industrial relations approach from time to time. The person I would most like to quote, although there was support from the Associated Chambers of Commerce, the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Business Council of Australia, is Mr Bert Evans. He, again, has been very ready to criticise Opposition policy if he disagreed with it, and he has been one of the leaders in the push for award restructuring, which has the very strong support of the present Government. He said this:</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition's Bill has obviously been carefully drafted with the practicalities of day-to-day industrial relations in mind. It contains no provisions which any fairminded person prepared to abide by the rules of compulsory conciliation and arbitration could object to. On the other hand, it clearly would remove the imbalances which presently exist and which favour the recalcitrant unions at the expense of the employers who are trying to work within the system. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to some specific matters which were raised by senators. I touch, but lightly, upon Senator Aulich's contribution, which made me cross because of his misrepresentation of matters which had nothing to do with this debate. Quite apart from the fact that he took no trouble to check when, for example, I was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, which was not in the 1980s but in the 1970s, he made some comments about the then Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, which showed either an appalling ignorance of Mr Fraser or a willingness to mislead the Senate on a quite interesting and important aspect of his prime ministership. </PARA>

<PARA>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</PARA>
<PARA> This document revises and updates the policy released in May 1986-a policy which has proved a pacesetter in terms of the directions it advocated for change in industrial relations in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1986 some changes to industrial relations have been in the direction advocated. Indeed, the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission's adoption of the second tier wage structure in 1987 was consistent with the thrust of the existing policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The model we laid down two years ago emphasised greater prosperity through increased productivity based on workplace cooperation, the development of an alternative stream of industrial relations through voluntary agreements, a redressing of the balance of power which had shifted too far in favour of the unions and protection of individual rights through genuine voluntary unionism.</PARA>
<PARA> Its aim was to provide a far more flexible and fairer framework within which industrial relations issues could be resolved to the benefit of the whole community. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, despite some tentative steps along the paths we advocated, the Hawke Government has generally failed to meet the challenge of change. </PARA>
<PARA> This policy builds on the success of the 1986 document and maintains the Liberal-National Parties' position at the forefront of the campaign for genuine industrial relations reform leading to a far less regulated system-essential if Australia is to boost productivity and improve living standards. </PARA>
<PARA>Main Features:</PARA>
<PARA> A strong restatement of the need for a more flexible, less centralised system with the focus where it belongs-at the enterprise level</PARA>
<PARA> Legally enforceable voluntary agreements available to all enterprises regardless of size, removing the former initial restriction to firms with 50 or less employees</PARA>
<PARA> Specific provisions to guarantee genuine voluntary unionism</PARA>

<PARA> Greater emphasis in awards and voluntary agreements on the use of grievance procedures</PARA>
<PARA> Tough new enforcement provisions allowing speedy access to the Federal Court to deal with those who fail to comply with the decisions and orders of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, or who breach the ``no-strike'' provisions of voluntary agreements</PARA>
<PARA> reform of provisions relating to union structure to</PARA>
<PARA>promote direct employer-employee dealing at enterprise level</PARA>

<PARA>1 INTRODUCTION</PARA>
<PARA>1.1 There is a need for fundamental change in the way we organise and conduct industrial relations in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>1.2 Australia needs a less centralised, more flexible system which will provide greater freedom to employers and employees to choose how they regulate their own affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>1.3 A more flexible system is in the interests of all Australians:</PARA>
<PARA>it will bring about more harmonious relations between employers and employees, by stressing co-operation and common interest, not conflict;</PARA>
<PARA>it will enable people to work more productively and with greater satisfaction;</PARA>
<PARA>it offers the best prospect of higher living standards and improved job opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA>1.4 The success of a more flexible system requires an end to the abuse of power which has been such a feature of industrial relations in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> A system in which the rule of law applies:</PARA>
<PARA>will protect fundamental civil liberties, including the freedom to join or not to join a trade union;</PARA>
<PARA>will ensure that all members of the community are free to get on with their lives without being subjected to stand-over tactics;</PARA>
<PARA>will make those who abuse their power accountable for their actions;</PARA>
<PARA>will introduce greater certainty and predictability into industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA> 1.5 Under the existing system Australian living standards have declined-in absolute terms and relative to the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> 1.6 A more flexible system will increase productivity and thereby achieve faster real growth in wages and profits. </PARA>
<PARA> 1.7 The key to good industrial relations and higher productivity is the strength and quality of the relationship between employer and employee. We need a system where employers and employees work as a team. </PARA>
<PARA> 1.8 The current system places the emphasis of industrial relations away from the workplace, thereby encouraging destructive ``them and us'' attitudes. It creates the perception that industrial relations is about winners and losers. </PARA>
<PARA> 1.9 Our policy is about ensuring that the focus of industrial relations is where it belongs-at the level of the individual enterprise. At workplace level employers and employees can see most clearly that they have a common interest in the success of the enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> 1.10 We recognise that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, will for the foreseeable future, continue to play a role for many enterprises. However, employers and employees should be free to have their industrial relations regulated by means of voluntary agreements rather than by an award of the Commission. We expect an increasing proportion of the workforce to negotiate agreements as the benefits of this approach become clear. </PARA>
<PARA> 1.11 For those who choose to remain within the jurisdiction of the Commission the system will be made much more flexible. We will use the experience of the second tier and other techniques adopted by the Commission to achieve better results. In particular, we will encourage awards to be made as flexible as possible, and will seek to shift the focus of the system away from national cases to the enterprise and industry level. There will be a greater emphasis on negotiation and conciliation. </PARA>
<PARA> 1.12 This policy will give people more choice. We reject the attempt to impose uniform standards and approaches. In a world of increasing uncertainty and change a more decentralised and diverse approach will produce the best outcome for Australia and Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>The Role of Government, Employers and Unions</PARA>
<PARA> 1.13 The role of the Federal Government is primarily to set the framework within which employers and employees conduct their affairs. In particular, the Government has a responsibility to ensure there is a proper legal framework which encourages good industrial relations and protects the rights of the individual. This means ensuring that neither employers nor unions are able to abuse their power. </PARA>
<PARA> 1.14 The Government has a responsibility to ensure that its economic and industrial relations policies are properly integrated. This includes, for example, making sure there is adequate competition in product and other markets. Competition is the best incentive to employees and employers to improve their industrial relations and lift productivity. The Government has an important role in providing sufficient information about the economy, so that all those involved in industrial relations fully understand the consequences of their actions. </PARA>
<PARA> 1.15 Another important role for Government is as a direct employer. In the past, public sector employment has been particularly prone to inflexibility and inefficiency. We will adopt practices in the Commonwealth public sector that will set an example in the pursuit of flexible and harmonious workplace relations. </PARA>
<PARA> 1.16 Finally, the Government has a responsibility to ensure that the public interest is protected and that industrial disputes are not allowed to disrupt essential services. </PARA>
<PARA> 1.17 Management has a critical role in ensuring good industrial relations. Unfortunately, encouraged by the centralised nature of the industrial relations system, Australian management has often tended to place too little emphasis on employee relations. This approach is beginning to change. </PARA>
<PARA> 1.18 There is a growing realisation that efficient, productive and competitive enterprises require a vision shared by both the workforce and management. This means breaking down the barriers that have traditionally existed between management and employees and building up a relationship of mutual trust. Our policies will give management both greater incentive and a greater capacity to develop and improve its employee relations. There is no doubt however that to get the full benefit of these policies will require greater effort on the part of management. </PARA>
<PARA> 1.19 The Liberal and National Parties believe that unions have an important role to play in representing the legitimate interests of their members. We welcome responsible unionism and support the right of all employees to join a union. However, we totally reject compulsory unionism. Just as employees should be free to join a union so they should be free not to join. This is fundamentally a matter of civil liberties. Genuinely voluntary unions are also more likely to act in a responsible manner and to concentrate on properly providing for their members. </PARA>
<PARA> 1.20 A Liberal and National Government will consult with unions and employer organisations on matters of mutual interest-for example industrial legislation. However, we totally reject the tendency for unions to become an arm of Government as has happened since the 1983 election. This is not in the interests of parliamentary democracy, employers or employees. </PARA>
<PARA>The Legal Framework</PARA>
<PARA> 1.21 This policy proposes a number of important changes in the legal framework which governs industrial relations. As well as reducing rigidities these changes are designed to introduce greater stability, certainty and accountability into industrial relations at the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA> 1.22 In the past, people have been frightened to use their legal rights in the face of bullying tactics-particularly by some elements of the union movement. We are firmly committed to upholding the rule of law in industrial relations, and will support those who wish to exercise their legal rights. </PARA>
<PARA> 1.23 There will be new compliance provisions designed to improve the workings of the conciliation and arbitration system. Arbitration by its very nature involves a third party making binding decisions-yet under the system as it operates in Australia unions may defy Commission rulings with impunity. Effective compliance provisions will support those prepared to follow the rules of arbitration, while penalising irresponsible behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> 1.24 Our proposals on voluntary agreements enshrine the principle that once the parties have agreed to terms and conditions of employment these will be legally enforceable, and cannot be varied by industrial action for the duration of the agreement. Failure to follow this principle would weaken the value of agreements for employees and employers alike. </PARA>
<PARA> 1.25 The proposals on grievance procedures and secret ballots will support the proper and effective resolution of industrial disputes while minimising the use of industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA> 1.26 Finally, the policy makes clear that certain kinds of industrial action such as secondary boycotts and disruption of essential services are totally unacceptable and will not be tolerated. </PARA>
<PARA>Impact on Women and the Young</PARA>
<PARA> 1.27 The new flexible approach to industrial relations in this policy will provide additional opportunities for new entrants to the workforce and assist those who want more flexible working arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> 1.28 The Liberal and National Parties support equal employment opportunity principles. Procedures for employment and promotion which seek to ensure that the person most qualified for the position is the successful applicant are to the advantage of both employer and employee. </PARA>
<PARA> 1.29 We will ensure that equal employment opportunity legislation is implemented in a sensitive manner which will enhance rather than diminish the impact of the legislation. While we support equality of opportunity we do not support positive discrimination on the grounds of sex, race, religion or on any other grounds. </PARA>
<PARA>2 VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS</PARA>
<PARA> 2.1 A principal objective of this policy is to return the primary responsibility for industrial relations-including the determination of wages and conditions-to employers and employees at the workplace. Strong economic growth, sustainable increases in real wages, and improved living standards can only come from increased productivity. That is best achieved by a co-operative and flexible approach within individual enterprises. Our proposal to allow negotiation of voluntary agreements is an important step in this direction. </PARA>
<PARA> 2.2 As part of making the system of determining wages and conditions of employment more flexible, where employers and their employees agree, they will be free to have wages and conditions of employment determined by an agreement between them instead of by an award. Agreements may take into account such factors as regional economic conditions, the availability of labour and the recognition of skills. </PARA>
<PARA> 2.3 We will actively encourage the making of voluntary agreements. Such agreements will assist in developing a common purpose between employer and employees, for the benefit of all. </PARA>
<PARA> 2.4 To encourage their use, we will publish guidelines on their drafting and contents and will publish model forms of agreement that may be used by employers and employees. </PARA>
<PARA> 2.5 We will also advocate that agreements of this sort should be used as a means of increasing efficiency, introducing new technology and management methods, removing archaic work practices which limit the productivity and profitability of firms, improving employer-employee relations and introducing more flexible work practices. In particular, more flexible hours of work, permanent part-time work and flexible rewards for skill and ability will be able to be introduced by this means. </PARA>
<PARA> 2.6 Agreements may be negotiated individually by employees or groups of employees. </PARA>
<PARA> 2.7 Employees may appoint an agent, including a union, to negotiate on their behalf. Former officers or employees of an association whose registration was cancelled for misconduct will be prohibited from acting as agents. Other measures will be taken to prevent de-registered unions playing a role in the negotiation of voluntary agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> 2.8 An agreement must provide for at least the relevant minimum award rate of pay for ordinary weekly hours of work for the particular classification of the employee. For the purposes of the agreement, that award rate of pay shall be calculated as an hourly rate. </PARA>
<PARA> 2.9 Voluntary agreements may then determine other rewards and payments, conditions of employment and changes to work practices that are agreed upon. </PARA>
<PARA> 2.10 Agreements made under this proposal will be in writing, signed, dated and witnessed. </PARA>
<PARA> 2.11 Agreements made by minors will require approval by the minor's legal guardian or other appropriate adult. </PARA>
<PARA> 2.12 An agreement may contain its own dispute settling procedures for dealing with disputes arising while the agreement is current. </PARA>
<PARA> 2.13 To assist in this regard, we will make regulations under the Act setting out private dispute settling procedures which may be used by the parties. Parties may have access to the services of members of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission on a fee for service basis as part of their dispute settling procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> 2.14 Agreements must contain a clause acknowledging that both parties accept the terms and conditions set out in the agreement for the period of its duration and will not take any industrial action designed to vary those conditions over that period. </PARA>
<PARA> 2.15 An agreement will have a specified term of operation. An agreement may provide that it continues in operation after the expiration of the term and until one month's notice is given of the intention to bring the agreement to an end. </PARA>
<PARA> 2.16 Subject to the requirement for the payment of the hourly rate of pay calculated by reference to the relevant minimum award, an agreement may determine one, some, or all of the terms of employment between the employer and employees:</PARA>
<PARA>if the agreement covers one or some of the terms of employment, then to that extent the relevant award and any new award shall not apply to the employer and employees;</PARA>
<PARA>if the agreement covers all of the terms of employment, and is expressed to do so, then the award and any new award shall not apply at all to the employer and employees;</PARA>
<PARA>an award of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission will therefore only apply to the extent that the terms of employment are not provided for in the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> 2.17 Voluntary agreements will be available to enterprises of any size. </PARA>
<PARA> 2.18 The Act will be amended to give voluntary agreements the status of awards. </PARA>
<PARA> 2.19 The Act will also be amended to provide that the Commission will not have jurisdiction over those industrial matters that are covered by a voluntary agreement whilst the agreement is current. </PARA>
<PARA> 2.20 To prevent flow-on into awards of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, the Act will be amended to exclude the provisions of a voluntary agreement from the matters the Commission may have regard to when it is hearing and determining an industrial dispute. We will also legislate to the extent necessary to ensure that there is no flow-on from voluntary agreements into awards of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> 2.21 Should a trade union take industrial action calculated to have the provisions of a voluntary agreement granted or incorporated into an award of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to which the union is a party, the taking of that action shall be a ground for the Commission's suspending or cancelling the award so far as the award applies to, or is in favour of, the union or its members. </PARA>
<PARA> 2.22 The grounds for de-registration of an organisation will provide that any persistent conduct which, in the opinion of the Federal Court has been deliberately engaged in to frustrate the proper workings of the proposed system of determining wages and conditions by voluntary agreement, shall be a ground for de-registration or suspension from registration for a specified period. </PARA>
<PARA>3 EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION AND INCENTIVES</PARA>
<PARA> 3.1 It is fundamental to this policy to encourage a common purpose and mutual interest between employee and employer. </PARA>
<PARA> 3.2 The evidence is clear that enterprises which foster good relations with their employees consistently perform better than enterprises with a poor industrial relations record. More and more Australian businesses are realising that their workforces are potentially their greatest asset-to the benefit of the enterprise and employees alike. </PARA>
<PARA> 3.3 The Liberal and National Parties strongly support and will encourage all forms of employee participation-ranging from employee consultation through to financial incentives, profit-sharing and employee share ownership. It is essential however that any initiatives are developed on a voluntary basis. The Liberal and National Parties oppose enforcement of employee participation, or `industrial democracy', through legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> 3.4 The Liberal and National Parties are convinced that as increased competitive pressures compel employers to look for new ways to increase productivity, employee participation and incentive schemes will flourish. </PARA>
<PARA> 3.5 The task of the next Liberal and National Party Government will be to ensure that their introduction is facilitated. Our policy to return responsibility for industrial relations to the workplace, will provide a framework conducive to all forms of employee participation while more specific initiatives may be required to encourage particular schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> 3.6 For example, in March 1988, the Liberal and National Parties introduced legislation into the Senate to remove the tax penalty imposed by s.26AAC of the Income Tax Assessment Act on employees who purchase shares in their company at a discount price. This legislation encompassed proposals announced in the 1982-83 budget and affirmed in the 1987 policy speech. This initiative has since been adopted, in more limited form, by the Hawke Government. </PARA>
<PARA>4 THE ARBITRATION COMMISSION AND WAGES POLICY</PARA>
<PARA> 4.1 This policy will reduce the role of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. However, the Commission will, for the foreseeable future, continue to settle disputes and determine wages and conditions of employment for a significant proportion of the workforce. Therefore, it is essential the conciliation and arbitration system itself continues to develop a more flexible approach, one that encourages negotiations at the workplace and is responsive to the needs of individual enterprises and industries, while at the same time taking into account the impact of its decisions on the national economy. In short, decisions of the Commission must reflect economic realities at the national, industry and enterprise levels. </PARA>
<PARA>Establishing the Economic Framework</PARA>
<PARA>4.2 To achieve this, it will first be necessary to ensure that the Commission, unions, employers, and employees are well-informed about the state of the economy. A future Liberal and National Party Government will publish regular economic assessments which will provide a sound basis for sensible economic decision-making. </PARA>
<PARA> 4.3 As well as reviewing economic conditions, these assessments will provide a basis for establishing a desirable goal for aggregate unit labour cost outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA> 4.4 A crucial objective will be to keep unit labour cost movements, including on-costs, in Australia in line with or lower than labour cost movements in our trading competitors. This is essential if this nation is to be internationally competitive. Over recent years nominal unit labour costs have increased at two to three times the overseas average. The best way of reducing unit labour cost growth is by improving productivity, as this offers the opportunity for higher real wages and living standards. Moreover, such an objective is perfectly compatible with a range of wage outcomes across individual enterprises or industries, depending on their productivity and economic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> 4.5 The Commission will be required to assess the economic impact of its decisions, in particular the effect that they will have on productivity, employment, inflation and international competitiveness. We will amend the Act to ensure that these factors are taken into account in all relevant Commission proceedings, and the Commission will, further, be required to provide estimates of the effects of its decisions on these factors. </PARA>
<PARA>Approach to Wage Fixing</PARA>
<PARA> 4.6 Once these broad economic constraints have been specified, we will urge the Commission to adopt an approach to wage-fixing which, as far as possible, seeks to achieve outcomes appropriate to individual enterprises and industries. </PARA>
<PARA> 4.7 Since the release of the Liberal and National Parties' Industrial Relations Policy in May 1986, there have been some significant changes in the attitudes of the parties and the Commission's approach to wage-fixing, and some of these have been along the lines recommended in that document. For example, the 1987 National Wage Case which introduced the two tier approach moved away from the principle of wage indexation and reduced the role of comparative wage justice. </PARA>
<PARA> 4.8 The ``second-tier'', though far from perfect, acknowledged the importance of the workplace in determining wages, by encouraging negotiations at the enterprise level in pursuit of productivity improvements as a basis for wage increases. Such developments potentially provide a start in introducing much greater flexibility into the conciliation and arbitration system. </PARA>
<PARA> 4.9 The position of a Liberal and National Party Government before the Commission will be that the Commission should build on the advances made under the second-tier. In particular, against the background of the broad macro-economic requirements, it should allow changes in wages and conditions to vary between firms and industries. Such diverse outcomes are perfectly compatible with achievement of competitive aggregate unit labour costs so long as wage increases are based on the economic realities confronting the firm or industry. </PARA>
<PARA> 4.10 A major Commission role will be to assist the parties in removing impediments to increased productivity and higher real wages. Primary responsibility for negotiations should rest with the parties themselves-employers and employees-preferably at the individual enterprise level. This will help promote a sense of common purpose and, in turn, increased efficiency and productivity. We will urge the Commission to develop appropriate guidelines which will provide a basis for negotiations between the parties as well as for making its own decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> These would include:</PARA>
<PARA> Adopting higher productivity as a central objective. Eradication of restrictive work practices, the introduction of flexible working arrangements, and improved training and skill formation are important ways to improve productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> Introduction by the Commission of more flexibility into its awards so that it can accommodate the needs and wishes of individual enterprises and their employees. Legal impediments to variation of awards by the Commission in their application to individual enterprises and workplaces will be removed, for example, the requirement that there be uniformity of conditions throughout an industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Recognition that benefits from increased productivity flow in a number of ways including lower prices and therefore increased real wages and higher employment. Improvements in productivity should not, therefore, be taken necessarily to justify equivalent increases in nominal wages. Importantly, adequate returns must flow to investors to encourage further investment for the production of wealth in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> A much greater emphasis on conciliation and negotiation, with arbitration only being used as a last resort or where the conciliation process is being flouted by resort to industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA> Ensuring that proper regard is had to the specific conditions of the enterprise of industry concerned, including its capacity to pay any increase in labour costs. </PARA>
<PARA> 4.11 We will encourage and facilitate, by legislation if necessary, the restructuring of awards on an enterprise or industry basis. </PARA>
<PARA> 4.12 In addition, we will encourage the continued use of agreements between employers and unions, such as certified agreements, for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> 4.13 We will oppose the Commission extending its jurisdiction to areas which, traditionally, have been determined outside the award system. We will legislate to this effect if required. </PARA>
<PARA> 4.14 We will prevent the extension of superannuation via arbitrated awards, although we will continue to encourage individuals to participate in superannuation schemes to provide for their own retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> 4.15 We will encourage the conversion of paid rates to minimum rates awards, particularly where such awards have failed to maintain themselves as true paid rates awards, or where a large number of employers is covered. We will prevent the creation of new paid rates awards. Paid rates awards, which stipulate actual rates of pay and proscribe over-award payments, limit the capacity of employers to respond to labour market conditions or to introduce more flexible methods of remuneration such as productivity or performance bonuses. </PARA>
<PARA> 4.16 Where paid rates awards are retained they should contain properly assessed and identifiable minimum classification rates. We will oppose the insertion of new supplementary payments in minimum rates awards and will legislate to prevent the Commission making recommendations about over-award payments. </PARA>
<PARA>Youth Wages</PARA>
<PARA> 4.17 The Commonwealth will institute proceedings, in co-operation with the States, to have junior wage rates set in all applicable awards. </PARA>
<PARA> 4.18 We will also ensure, by our submissions to industrial tribunals and by advocating a training wage, that youth wages are set at levels that encourage the employment and training of young people and are not obstacles to their employment and training. </PARA>
<PARA>5 LIMITS ON INDUSTRIAL ACTION</PARA>
<PARA> 5.1 A principal objective of this policy is to make parties responsible and accountable for their actions. We believe that this will develop in an evolutionary fashion as individual workplaces increasingly become the focus for decisions on wages and industrial relations. To ensure the efficacy of any contractual system, legal remedies must be available when one party fails to meet its obligations. The disturbing imbalance of power within the conciliation and arbitration system where unions frequently defy Commission orders with impunity will be redressed. </PARA>
<PARA>The Rule of Law</PARA>
<PARA> 5.2 We will ensure that employees, employers, their representatives, and others involved in industrial relations are equal before the law, that the law applies to all, and that it is enforced. </PARA>
<PARA>Common Law</PARA>
<PARA> 5.3 We will encourage the use of the common law in the civil courts in appropriate cases as a means of obtaining redress for unjustified industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA> 5.4 In co-operation with the States, we will endeavour to streamline procedures for such court actions to ensure simpler and swifter hearings. </PARA>
<PARA>Compliance with Commission Decisions</PARA>
<PARA> 5.5 We will enact legislation already introduced in the Senate to ensure that there are effective sanctions for those who fail to comply with the decisions and orders of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> 5.6 This will enable the Commission to issue directions to stop or prevent industrial action. Such directions would be enforceable by injunctions issued by the Federal Court. Failure to comply with injunctions would constitute contempt of court. </PARA>
<PARA> 5.7 In addition, any person who suffers loss or damage as a result of industrial action in breach of a direction would be able to sue the responsible organisation for damages in the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA> 5.8 We also will review all penalties under the Act to ensure that they are appropriate and effective. </PARA>
<PARA>Compliance with Voluntary Agreements</PARA>
<PARA> 5.9 A voluntary agreement will be legally enforceable and the normal remedies provided under the law of contract will be available to all parties. </PARA>
<PARA> 5.10 In addition there will be statutory provisions to ensure that where industrial action in breach of an agreement takes place, the aggrieved party may apply to a civil court for an injunction against the industrial action. Failure to comply with an injunction would constitute contempt of court. There would also be provision for the aggrieved party to sue for damages resulting from action in breach of an agreement. Similar remedies would apply to those who induce either employers or employees to break agreements they have made. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Support for Oppressed Parties</PARA>
<PARA> 5.11 In general, industrial disputes are a matter for settlement between the parties. The Government's offer of financial assistance to firms complying with its code of conduct in defiance of the Builders Labourers' Federation is an example of how in extreme circumstances direct financial assistance may be warranted. We will give assistance in appropriate circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> 5.12 We will also grant legal aid in appropriate circumstances to employers or employees, in cases, for example, concerning secondary boycotts or breaches of voluntary agreements. </PARA>
<PARA>Grievance Procedures</PARA>
<PARA> 5.13 We support much wider use of grievance procedures as a valuable method of dealing with disputes at the workplace level without resort to industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA> 5.14 We will foster forms of voluntary agreements which contain appropriate grievance procedures to deal with disputes arising during the term of the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> 5.15 We support the widest possible use of grievance procedures in awards. Unfortunately, while many awards already contain grievance procedures they are often not adhered to. Failure to comply with a grievance procedure will constitute grounds for the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to issue a direction that industrial action cease. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondary Boycotts</PARA>
<PARA> 5.16 We will maintain the effectiveness of, and if necessary strengthen, the secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA> 5.17 We will use the powers of the Minister to bring proceedings under the Trade Practices Act in appropriate cases. </PARA>
<PARA>Essential Services</PARA>
<PARA> 5.18 Industrial action may sometimes pose a real threat to public order, or to the safety, health or life of individuals. The States have at their disposal a variety of essential services legislation, and where such threats arise in State jurisdictions, they will be best able to act accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> 5.19 The Commonwealth currently has no essential services legislation. We will enact comprehensive legislation to protect the public and the national interest in the Commonwealth area where unacceptable threat to health and safety arises, and where economically essential services or the defence of Australia are prejudiced. </PARA>
<PARA>Strike Pay</PARA>
<PARA> 5.20 We will make it an offence for any employer to pay, or any employee to accept, strike pay. </PARA>
<PARA> 5.21 The Act will be amended to prohibit a union from taking industrial action in pursuit of a demand for strike pay. </PARA>
<PARA> 5.22 An employer may seek an injunction terminating such action and any person or organisation inciting such action shall also be liable for damages for any loss suffered. In addition, conduct of this kind shall be a ground for deregistration of the trade union. </PARA>
<PARA>Stand-down Provisions</PARA>
<PARA> 5.23 The Conciliation and Arbitration Commission shall not have any power to require an employer to pay wages to any employee who cannot be productively employed because of the consequences of industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA> 5.24 We will ensure that employers have effective stand-down rights to deal with rolling bans and strikes. </PARA>
<PARA>Secret Ballots</PARA>
<PARA> 5.25 A Liberal and National Party Government will strengthen the provisions in the Act relating to secret ballots to make ballots compulsory before industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA> 5.26 Any person who either suffers harm or is threatened with harm from industrial action where a secret ballot has not been held will be able to seek an injunction in the Federal Court to prevent or terminate the action. There will also be provision for parties who have suffered from such industrial action to sue for damages. </PARA>
<PARA> 5.27 We will legislate to ensure that stringent standards are satisfied before a valid secret ballot will be regarded as having taken place. </PARA>
<PARA> 5.28 Industrial action taken after a secret ballot has been held will not in itself have general legal immunity. For example, secondary boycotts or industrial action in breach of a Commission direction would still give rise to injunctions whether a secret ballot had been held or not. </PARA>
<PARA>6 PUBLIC SECTOR INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS</PARA>
<PARA> 6.1 A Liberal and National Party Government will adopt a more flexible, market-oriented approach to industrial relations in the area of Commonwealth employment. </PARA>
<PARA> 6.2 Public sector pay and conditions will be such as to enable employers to recruit, retain and motivate the staff they require in order to achieve their objectives. In determining pay and conditions the following factors will be taken into account: economic conditions, cost, the need to be fair to employees, and the need to reflect differences in market conditions, individual performance, skills and experience. Public servants will as far as possible be provided with terms and conditions of employment that are broadly comparable to, but not more generous than, the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> 6.3 A Liberal and National Party Government will not tolerate the use of bans and limitations by Commonwealth employees. We will restore the ``no work as directed-no pay provisions'' of the Public Service Act, and will ensure that in addition to essential services legislation the Commonwealth has effective powers, including stand-down powers, for dealing with industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA>7 TRADE UNIONS</PARA>
<PARA>Freedom of Association and Union Structure</PARA>
<PARA> 7.1 The Liberal and National Parties' approach to trade unions is conditioned by the fundamental goal of promoting close, co-operative, flexible and productive relationships within enterprises for the mutual benefit of employers and employees. </PARA>
<PARA> 7.2 We believe that genuine voluntary unionism and greater scope for workers to choose their union combined with an increasingly enterprise-based industrial relations system, will help to bring about a union structure which is more accountable to the membership and more likely to contribute to good industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> 7.3 The existing union structure is a significant impediment to improved relations between employers and employees in many enterprises. Most employers are forced to deal with several unions, which tend to vie with one another and press narrow sectional interests within the labour force, thus creating demarcation disputes and disrupting employer-employee relations. </PARA>
<PARA> 7.4 The existence of unions largely based on occupation, rather than industry or enterprise, also encourages the rapid flow of wage adjustments from one part of the economy to other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> 7.5 The Liberal and National Parties will ensure that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) membership of trade unions is genuinely voluntary;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the closed shop is outlawed;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the structure of registered trade unions in enterprises which are operating under the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and its awards will be determined by the wishes of the members of those unions. Freedom of association will be preserved subject only to Commission supervision of matters relating to the formation of new unions and amalgamation or fragmentation of existing unions with a view to ensuring that, as far as possible, new union structures contribute to the objectives of:</PARA>
<PARA>ensuring that employers and employees within an enterprise deal directly with each other;</PARA>
<PARA>minimising interference by people or bodies with no direct interest in the enterprise;</PARA>
<PARA>facilitating the consolidation of single enterprise bargaining units. </PARA>
<PARA>A variety of union structures and sizes could meet these criteria including unions organised on an industry or enterprise basis. </PARA>
<PARA>Interested parties will be entitled to have their views heard by the Commission on these issues. There will be provision as appropriate for appeals to the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA> 7.6 In addition, where there are disputes between unions over union coverage such disputes will be determined where applicable by reference to the workforce. In such cases the role of the Commission will be to define the choices available to the workforce and it may indicate which choice, in the view of the Commission, is likely to facilitate the desired employer/employee co-operation. </PARA>
<PARA> 7.7 Where employees wish to form a new union to represent them or to vary existing union structures to represent them more effectively there will be secret ballot provisions to enable the wishes of the workforce to be determined. When those wishes are established by secret ballot the desired structure will be approved unless, in the opinion of the Commission, it will provide a less effective structure to promote the objectives set out in (c) above, or, in the absence of special circumstances, there has been a determination on union structure within the previous three years. </PARA>
<PARA> 7.8 Specifically the Liberal and National Parties will:</PARA>
<PARA>make it an offence for any person or body, including a trade union or employer, to require a person to join or remain a member of a trade union against his or her will. It will therefore no longer be necessary to obtain a certificate of conscientious objection before being entitled to protection against being coerced to join a union. It will also be an offence for a union to take or threaten industrial action with the purpose of seeking a ``closed shop''. Employers or employees facing such action may seek an injunction for its termination and damages will also be available. </PARA>
<PARA>legislate so that a member of an organisation who has not paid his or her subscriptions for a period of six months will be deemed to have resigned from that organisation;</PARA>
<PARA>prohibit collection of union dues by employers except where there has been a specific request by the individual employee and the employer consents;</PARA>
<PARA>legislate to enable any group of employees proposing to form a union or to amalgamate or fragment an existing union to approach the Commission to set in train the procedures outlined in (c) above;</PARA>
<PARA>ensure that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission shall not have the power to grant any form of compulsory unionism or clauses giving any preference to members of a trade union over employees who are not union members;</PARA>
<PARA>legislate, if necessary, to ensure full portability so as to preserve both voluntary unionism and legitimate superannuation rights where an employee's desire to resign from a union is compromised by his or her membership of a union superannuation fund. </PARA>
<PARA>De-registration</PARA>
<PARA> 7.9 When circumstances justify de-registration of an organisation we will ensure that it occurs swiftly and in a fully effective manner. </PARA>
<PARA> 7.10 In addition to using the present provisions on de-registration we will introduce specific legislation where appropriate, along the lines of the legislation used to de-register the Builders Labourers Federation. Such legislation would enable the Minister to apply to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission for an enquiry into an organisation's behaviour. Such enquiries would be conducted as expeditiously as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> 7.11 If the Commission certifies that the organisation has engaged in serious industrial misconduct, the Minister would then be able to effect the immediate cancellation or suspension of the organisation's registration. </PARA>
<PARA> 7.12 Where questions of liability for fines, penalties or damages may arise, the Commission shall have the power to sequester an organisation's funds and to place them in the hands of an administrator until such questions be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> 7.13 Office-bearers of de-registered organisations will not be permitted to hold office in the same or any other organisation for a period of five years. </PARA>
<PARA>Independent Contractors</PARA>
<PARA> 7.14 The Act will be amended to make it an offence to force, or attempt to force an independent contractor, partner or self employed person to join a union. It will also be made an offence to discriminate against such a person on the ground that he/she is not a member. </PARA>
<PARA> 7.15 We will at all times encourage and preserve the rights of independent contractors, partners and self-employed persons. In particular, the jurisdiction of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission shall be strictly confined to relations between employers and employees. </PARA>
<PARA>Accounts and Audits</PARA>
<PARA> 7.16 We will conduct a thorough examination of the operation of those sections of the Act which deal with the accounts and auditing practices of registered organisations, and will amend them where necessary to ensure that organisations keep proper and audited accounts which are readily available to members. </PARA>
<PARA> 7.17 We will also amend the Act to ensure that the accounting, auditing and other financial obligations of organisations are as nearly as practicable the same of those of companies. </PARA>
<PARA>8 STATE-COMMONWEALTH JURISDICTIONS</PARA>
<PARA> 8.1 Maximum provision will be made for the reciprocal and complementary exercise of State and Commonwealth jurisdictions by means such as joint sittings of tribunals, to achieve greater consistency and integration, reduce anomalies and injustices and prevent the leap-frogging of industrial claims. </PARA>
<PARA> 8.2 We will ensure that a proper balance is maintained between Federal and State jurisdictions. For example we will prevent the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission from making a Federal award covering an area of employment which is satisfactorily handled by a State jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA>9 CONSULTATION</PARA>
<PARA> 9.1 We will consult regularly with employee and employer representatives on all aspects of industrial relations policy. Consultative mechanisms should promote the co-operative ethos embodied in this policy. </PARA>
<PARA> 9.2 We will discuss with employer and employee representatives the development on a tripartite basis of a voluntary code of conduct to govern the behaviour of the parties in industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA>Policy issued 29 June 1988</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I go on to quote a couple of paragraphs which are vital to an understanding of that policy. Paragraph 1.13 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The role of the Federal Government is primarily to set the framework within which employers and employees conduct their affairs. In particular, the Government has a responsibility to ensure there is a proper legal framework which encourages good industrial relations and protects the rights of the individual. This means ensuring that neither employers nor unions are able to abuse their power. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat what I said earlier in the debate: It is just as vital to me to see the protection of employee interests as it is to see the protection of any other interests in industrial relations. The other two paragraphs I wish to refer to which are relevant to the accusations which were made in a very wild way, in my view, by Senator Aulich start at paragraph 1.18 and read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 1.18 There is a growing realisation that efficient, productive and competitive enterprises require a vision shared by both the workforce and management. This means breaking down the barriers that have traditionally existed between management and employees and building up a relationship of mutual trust. Our policies will give management both greater incentive and a greater capacity to develop and improve its employee relations. There is no doubt however that to get the full benefit of these policies will require greater effort on the part of management. </PARA>
<PARA> 1.19 The Liberal and National Parties believe that unions have an important role to play in representing the legitimate interests of their members. We welcome responsible unionism and support the right of all employees to joint a union. However, we totally reject compulsory unionism. Just as employees should be free to joint a union so they should be free not to join. This is fundamentally a matter of civil liberties. Genuinely voluntary unions are also more likely to act in a responsible manner and to concentrate on properly providing for their members. </PARA>
<PARA>I make no apology at all for reintroducing into this Parliament a Bill which would remedy one of the defects in the Government's industrial relations legislation. Again, I will respond to a point made by Senator Aulich, who waved the Bill around and said, `This is the industrial relations policy of the Opposition.' I will not, for reasons of frugality, seek to incorporate this document into Hansard, but I will table, again, the extensive amendments which were proposed by the Opposition to the Government's industrial relations legislation. I seek leave to table that document simply to illustrate the broad concerns over a range of areas of industrial relations which reflect the policy which I have had incorporated into Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I turn briefly to what was said by Senator McLean. I wish to point out to him that the decision by the Government to withdraw the directions and compliance procedure was, as I said earlier in this reply, made after an express undertaking to the contrary made just prior to the 1987 election in a debate between me and Mr Willis on station 3LO in Melbourne. The tradition of the Australian Democrats, as originally established by, then, Senator Chipp, was that their role in this Parliament was `to keep the bastards honest', if I may quote Senator Chipp. I would have thought that in this case it would be a serious matter for consideration by the Democrats that the relief we are seeking to put into the Bill is of the same nature as the relief which was promised by the Government at the time of the 1987 election. This is not the last time, I suspect, that we will be debating this matter. I certainly will engage in further dialogue, as Senator McLean has suggested. But I say that the passage of this legislation through the Senate would be one step towards keeping this particular Government honest on this particular issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Cooney raised two matters which I would wish to address. The first is the possibility of limiting the power of the court to punish for contempt by excluding the option of imprisonment, and that is a matter which needs serious consideration. As I said, it was always the intention of the Opposition to promote pecuniary penalties, not the court discretion to imprison. Of course, the court has unlimited discretion to punish for contempt of court as was shown in the plumbers and gasfitters case where it chose to fine the plumbers and gasfitters union $280,000 for its contempt of the court's order. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point of substance made by Senator Cooney was whether in all cases the remedies which the present Industrial Relations Act provides are adequate to protect the interests of employees whose rights are being flouted by employers. I am sorry that Senator Cooney is not here for me to answer directly. The point I make in response to Senator Cooney is that this Bill, if enacted, would give the employees about whom he expressed concern the capacity to obtain a court injunction and to put exactly the same sanction on the employer as I have just described. In other words, there would be unlimited power of the court to punish for any continuing contempt by the employers. I think that is a fair coverage of the issues raised in the debate on this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that this legislation is not raised simply to deal with the pilots' dispute, although that is a classic example of the capacity of an organisation to thumb its nose at the Commission, to accept its benefits on the one hand but refuse to accept decisions which it does not like on the other. This amendment was first put forward by us in 1987. It was again put forward by us in 1988. It has represented the long considered view of the Opposition, completely in accord with the views expressed by the former Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Willis, in 1987 that a change of this sort is essential if we are to have a more orderly system of conciliation and arbitration in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I close by repeating that the present system has let the workers of Australia down. If Senator Burns had been asked in 1983 whether he thought there would be any possibility that an outcome of 6 1/2 years of Labor Government would be a decline in real wages, I think he would have said no. Senator Burns and other honourable senators with a long history in the trade union movement should ponder the failures of the present system and its failure to produce a lift in productivity, which is essential if real wages are to be improved in this country. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill, version two. The first version could not even make it to this House. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) legislation is born out of chaos and will be destructive if it eventually goes through this Parliament. Since it was first introduced last August there has been nothing but disarray and an uproar in the Aboriginal affairs portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There have been five inquiries into Aboriginal affairs investigating the administration, financial management and personnel management of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA), the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) and the possible interference with witnesses appearing before the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. In addition, the original ADC commissioners were sacked in a shameful display of tyranny by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Gerry Hand, who sent them back home to their communities in disgrace. This was followed two weeks later by a leaked press release claiming that $670,000 of ADC funds was misappropriated or missing. Then there was the sacking of the head of the DAA, Mr Charles Perkins, who has since been exonerated by the Menzies report into Allegations as to the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> There was the dismissal of the chairperson of the ADC, Shirley McPherson-if she was not dismissed she was certainly forced out of office-a person of undoubted competence and integrity, for daring to offer an alternative structure to ATSIC. She knew, and she is an Aboriginal person, that ATSIC was inappropriate. Mick O'Brien, the general manager of the ADC, got the boot and there have been resignations by just about all senior officers of the ADC or the DAA as they see their life's work disintegrate, because they know that the ATSIC legislation is inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> Even now the hand picked ADC commissioners are rebelling against the Minister because he has just about gutted the ADC in the last week. Not only that, the Torres Strait Islanders wanted to secede from Australia because they did not want to be a minority in a minority. Under the ATSIC regime they would be one voice in a 20-voice Commission and because they were so frightened of the ATSIC legislation they wanted to walk out of Australia. When Mr Hand tried to bring this legislation in I said that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was sending a boy on a man's job. I said that 18 months ago before any of this disaster had happened and I have been proved absolutely right. He is a boy trying to do a man's job and he does not know what he is involving himself in.</PARA>
<PARA> This is the sorry record of Aboriginal affairs since the Minister was appointed after the last election. There is a record of destruction, division, instability and a lack of direction in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The Minister's booklet Foundations for the Future is turning into a sorry mess as he tries to get ATSIC up before this Parliament. This legislation has caused unprecedented destruction which will only become worse if it goes through with the support of the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me put it on the record at the outset that the Opposition does not support this legislation. The Opposition supports the view put down in the minority report presented by my colleague Senator Peter Baume and me, that the proposal for an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission is unjustified, unnecessary and culturally inappropriate. The detailed proposal that has emerged in this Bill is faulty and unsafe. If pursued, it will operate to the detriment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. That is the position of both the Liberal and National parties in this Parliament. We are faced either with walking away from the legislation and voting against it in its entirety thereby leaving the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the lurch, having nothing more to do with this atrocious legislation, or with trying to improve the legislation by amendment. We have chosen the second course in order to alleviate, where possible, the more draconian parts of this totally inappropriate legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I said in the Senate on 28 February this year that this legislation sets up a white man's bureaucracy, thrusts it on the black communities of Australia and calls it self-determination. This Bill establishes an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission that incorporates under its huge umbrella the DAA, the ADC, and Aboriginal Hostels Ltd. This will be done by establishing 60 regional councils electing 1,200 councillors. In turn, these councils will elect 17 zonal commissioners who in Canberra will make virtually every decision on Aboriginals. The Government's answer to solving the Aboriginals, many problems is by setting up a black parliament with 1,200 elected members; dividing Australia into black and white; setting up apartheid in Australia; and developing Australia along split racial lines. That is what this Government has to offer Australia and the black community. After 200 years of settlement in Australia this is the worst possible way to address the needs and concerns of the indigenous people of Australia. The previous Minister, Clyde Holding, has said that for Aboriginal legislation to be enduring and successful it must have the support of the majority of all Australians. The present Minister, Gerry Hand, made the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA>The effective implementation of this proposal ultimately must rest on receiving positive endorsement from the Aboriginal and Islander community. </PARA>
<PARA>Later, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginal people need to decide for themselves what should be done-not just take on whatever the Government says is best for them. </PARA>
<PARA>He never had that endorsement from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and he has never had it from the white communities of Australia. Both Ministers' statements have been totally ignored by the introduction of this ATSIC legislation. The majority of white Australians will not support legislation that divides Aboriginal Australia into 60 regional councillors to elect 1,200 representatives-two democratic systems in one democracy. The ATSIC proposal does not have the support of the black or white communities. </PARA>
<PARA> On Tuesday this week the Prime Minister acknowledged in glowing terms the contribution that Charles Perkins has made to Aboriginal affairs in Australia over the last 20 years. These sentiments were endorsed by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Chaney. The same Charles Perkins has said that inadequate consultation is being offered to Aboriginals and Islanders on the ATSIC legislation, a conclusion also reached by the majority report of the Senate Select Committee. Mr Perkins's exact words about Gerry Hand on the PM program were:</PARA>
<PARA>He made a promise to Aboriginal people and he's got to fulfil that promise, to go back to them with the legislation, and discuss it with them before he proceeds. Now if he doesn't do that, he has no mandate. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me assure the Senate that Mr Hand never went back and consulted the Aboriginals. Mr Perkins also said in an interview that the present arrangement between the DAA, the ADC and the Institute of Aboriginal Studies should remain. The task should be to make them more effective. The mechanics of setting up ATSIC would be disastrous. Mr Perkins must feel that a great weight has been lifted off his shoulders now that he is free to give his own advice and honest opinion about how ATSIC will affect the black people of Australia. He is virtually saying exactly what the Opposition has been saying for the last 12 months; that is that the DAA, the ADC, the Institute and the Housing Commission should be retained and improved and that the mechanics of setting up ATSIC are disastrous. We have been saying that for 18 months. Senator Peter Baume, Senator Stone and I have been telling the Senate and telling Australia. Now Mr Perkins is saying exactly the same thing. It is now time for the Prime Minister to stand up to Gerry Hand and his band of socialist left comrades and act like a Prime Minister and not a captive of the Left. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know. The Prime Minister cannot make statements lauding Charles Perkins as he did yesterday. Let me quote what the Prime Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Charles Perkins believed that one of the most important roles was to keep in close touch with as many individual Aboriginal people and as many Aboriginal communities as he possibly could. </PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly he travelled extensively and was able to bring to this and previous governments an invaluable insight into the concerns and abilities of his people. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Prime Minister believed in his own statement, his own rhetoric, that Mr Perkins kept in touch with the black communities and that he was able to bring invaluable insight into the needs of black communities, he should listen to Mr Perkins, because Mr Perkins is saying that ATSIC is not a goer. Members of the Hawke Government know that and they have told the Prime Minister so. The hardheads know that it is not a goer. The people on the other side of the chamber who know about Aboriginals know that it is not a goer. As soon as Mr Hawke realises that Mr Hand is totally incompetent and appoints someone like Senator Collins as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Aboriginals will be better off. </PARA>
<PARA> The indigenous people are being told that they will have self-determination and self-management through regional councils. That is blatantly untrue. Regional councils will have little or no power. All power will rest with the zonal commissioners, the 17 people who will go to Canberra to get their riding instructions from the Minister-appointed chairman of ATSIC and his two appointed lieutenants. We are told in this legislation that the function of the regional councils is to formulate a regional plan, to advise, to assist and to cooperate with the Commission and the other government authorities on its implementation, to make proposals for expenditure, and to pass on the local view to the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Regional councils are really only advisory bodies. They have no teeth or real power. They will be completely under the heel of the commissioners in Canberra. I do not want to criticise the advisers who are sitting in the advisers' area, but I would have thought that Mr Hand could have sent at least one black person to watch this legislation go through. The fact that there is not one black person observing these proceedings is another indictment and means that ATSIC will be under the thumb of white people. Regional councils cannot even hire or fire staff without the consent of their Canberra masters. This is not self-control or self-management. This will remove power from the local communities. This will take power out of the elected communities' councils and place it 3,000 to 5,000 miles away in Canberra. It will be the Commission, with its 20 commissioners-including the three ministerial appointed commissioners-that will control the 230,000 Aboriginals and 25,000 or 30,000 Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not forget Gerry Hand. He will have ultimate power and control over the Commission. One must ask: Can Mr Hand be trusted? After the disastrous consequences of sackings, leakings, dismissals, resignations and gutting of the ADC, the answer has to be: no, he cannot be trusted. The action proposed in a Cabinet minute dated 17 July, which was leaked the other day, to remove funding and associated functional rearrangements for the ADC, was designed to gut it. That is the only true decision-making board that the Aboriginal people have had, but it is now rendered a shell. That shows the power that the Minister can exert from Canberra. The legislation sets out that the Minister will appoint five commissioners in the first 12 months-five commissioners to represent 230,000 people. The Minister will control ATSIC for 12 or 18 months as well as controlling its first two budgets. That is not self-determination of self-management for Aboriginal and Islander people. It is a cruel hoax and a farce to talk about self-management when this legislation deprives Aboriginals and Islanders of self-management. </PARA>
<PARA> The peak body of Queensland Aboriginal councils, the Aboriginal Coordinating Council (ACC), issued a press release claiming that it had been led up the garden path by Mr Hand and that he has a double agenda for Aboriginal people. The press release states:</PARA>
<PARA> Minister Hand's actions have now made it clear that ATSIC's role will be to report and recommend to him through a Board chosen and controlled by him, not the people as he told us. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the same old Government Policy that was used during colonisation. Black people against black people . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the 20,000-odd Aboriginals who live in Queensland communities believe. I seek leave to incorporate the press release in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The press release read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Chairman of the Queensland Aboriginal Co-Ordinating Council, Mr. Merv Gibson expressed grave concerns for the future of Aboriginal Australians after learning of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Gerry Hand, statement to Parliament on 11th April, 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> ``We accepted ATSIC on the understanding that elections for Regional Councils and Commissioners would be the first things that happened once ATSIC was passed. One of Gerry's major selling points was that the current system does not provide for elected representation on the Board of the A.D.C., now he performs the old ``pea and thimble'' trick and informs Parliament that there won't be any elected Commissioners for the first twelve (12) months, ``He'' will appoint an interim Board of five (5)! You don't have to be very smart to work out who they will be,'' Mr. Gibson said. </PARA>
<PARA> ``We feel we have been led up the garden path by the Minister. He made no mention of his real intentions at our ATSIC Workshop in Cairns.''</PARA>
<PARA> ``His actions this week through the instructions issued to A.D.C. Commissioners under Section 11 of the A.D.C. Act, which takes away all their decision making power and gives it to the Minister and his clear statement that he will appoint an interim ATSIC Board for the first twelve (12) months, clearly indicated that he intends to ``rule'' his portfolio. We are disappointed that the A.D.C. Commissioners are going along with him.''</PARA>
<PARA> It is now clear that Mr. Hand had a double agenda all along. One story for us Aborigines and another for Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> We have examined what the Ministers decision to appoint the interim ATSIC Board will mean for us in regard to our supposed involvement in the decision making process, as touted by Mr. Hand and the realities are quite alarming for us all, if ATSIC is passed this month. </PARA>
<PARA> The points are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 11th April 1989: Minister issues Section 11 advice and gains Ministerial control over the A.D.C. </PARA>
<PARA> Assume ATSIC is passed this month (April). </PARA>
<PARA> 1st October, 1989: ATSIC is created, five (5) months after being passed in Parliament. (Why the delay? Surely an election can be organised in five (5) months?). </PARA>
<PARA> 1st October, 1989: 1989-90 Budgets are already in place as estimates are prepared April/May every year. No ATSIC elected Commissioners involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> 1st October, 1989: Minister Hand appoints the five (5) Commissioners to ATSIC Board for twelve (12) months. </PARA>
<PARA> April/May, 1990: 1990-91 Estimates are prepared under the Stewardship of the five Hand picked Commissioners-no electee's input. </PARA>
<PARA> 1st October, 1990: Elected Commissioners take up positions on ATSIC Board-current Budget is already in place-no input by electee's. </PARA>
<PARA> April/May, 1991: Elected ATSIC Commissioners formulate ATSIC's 1991-92 Budget, one and a half years after ATSIC's creation!</PARA>
<PARA> Bearing in mind that the Minister's platform to us has been that ATSIC will provide Aboriginal and Islander people a greater say in deciding our future, we feel that his actions this week confirm our initial fears that his real purpose all along has been to establish the `Governments Priorities' not ours. The fact that he made that point three (3) times in his Ministerial Statement of 11th April, 1989 that ATSIC will reflect the Government Priorities is evidence enough. </PARA>
<PARA> `Mr Hands Ministerial Statement could contain other traps for us that he has never disclosed. He speaks about the AEDC and the non transfer of the A.D.C.'s Housing function to it. He states, ``It would be inappropriate and would dilute the commercial nature of the AEDC to have it take on programs, especially programs which include quasi-commercial aspects such as grants and concessional loans.'</PARA>
<PARA> My concern is that this statement seems to indicate that concessional loans for housing and enterprise as are currently available through A.D.C. programs will no longer exist under ATSIC and Aboriginal and Islander people struggling to purchase a home or start a business will be charged the full commercial rate by the AEDC! Where is there any assistance to us in that system?</PARA>
<PARA> Minister Hands actions have now made it quite clear that ATSIC's role will be to report and recommend to him through a Board chosen and controlled by him, not the people as he told us. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the same old Government Policy that was used during the colonisation. Black people against black people to carry out the Governments wishes. </PARA>
<PARA> It's the same as the Old Native Police when Aborigines from N.S.W. were recruited to `disperse' Queensland Aborigines and vice versa. </PARA>
<PARA> It's the same process that the Queensland Police use now in Communities. </PARA>
<PARA> Get the Aboriginal Police to carry out the State Police duties and when things go wrong, blame the Aboriginal Police!</PARA>
<PARA> The sad part is that there are Aboriginal people in positions of influence who can't see this because they have been influenced by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> We support the statements made by Mr Neil Phillips of the Western Australian Advancement Council Inc., which condemns the Ministers actions as per the Section 11 advice to A.D.C. Commissioners. We feel that the only true decision making power that Aboriginal people have ever held has now been lost forever, and sadly Aboriginal people allowed it to happen!</PARA>
<PARA> It is painfully obvious that at the end of the day it is `Party Politics and Government Priorities' that are the real issues and not `Aboriginal Development'. </PARA>
<PARA> As they say, `The more things change, the more they stay the same'. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The press release was issued by Merv Gibson, the Chairman of the ACC, arguably the largest Aboriginal peak council in Australia, which represents Aboriginals who live in 14 deed-of-grant communities in Queensland. It is not only Merv Gibson who is disgusted with the Minister for hand picking his commissioners for the first 12 or 18 months. Senator Coulter was interviewed on AM on 12 April and, as he is in the Senate now, I will quote him. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are disgusted with the way in which the Minister has proceeded with this. He gave no inkling whatsoever of the establishment of an interim commission of 5 hand picked people. </PARA>
<PARA>The AM report continued with Senator Coulter saying that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission will remain on the drawing board until the Minister meets all the recommendations of the Senate Committee. I hope Senator Coulter is a man of his word. I hope the Australian Democrats will use their numbers in the Senate to protect the rights of black Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The ATSIC proposal places in jeopardy the future of Queensland communities-in fact all Aboriginal communities-that have been set up under local government authority legislation. These communities in Queensland have been given seven million acres of land and they are about to receive another two million acres under deeds of grant-in-trust. They are funded by block grants from both the Federal and State governments and are completely self-managed. Each council sets its own priorities for roads, sewerage, housing, parks, and so on. The community assesses its own needs. That is self-determination; that is self-management. Black people are making decisions for themselves in their own communities. They are not going to a regional council to argue their case and then having to get the okay from Canberra, or from a commissioner who comes from Tasmania or Western Australia who does not even understand the needs of Aboriginals in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal people are taking pride in their communities. They are developing their own businesses. Community businesses are providing employment for 250 Aboriginals and Islanders. Hairdressing salons, dress shops, bakeries, butchers, and food stores have been set up by Aboriginals. The government community stores are now being run privately by the communities. During 1990 it is estimated that the number of businesses will have tripled to approximately 150. In December 1983 there were only three businesses, now there are 52 business enterprises in communities. That figure excludes crocodile farms, cattle farms and many other small farms. </PARA>
<PARA> The crayfish industry in the Torres Strait has increased turnover from $300,000 to $7m in the last six years, providing an economy and jobs for the Torres Strait Islanders. The industry is owned by the Islanders. A small trochus shell industry is being developed and is providing jobs. It is also owned and controlled by the Islanders. Cattle turnover has increased by 500 per cent in the last six years. All this success will be put at risk if ATSIC comes into force. Those people are making their own decisions. They are providing jobs and an economy. All those decisions will now have to be made in Canberra. These great gains made by Aboriginals will disappear. Every community will have to go cap in hand to their regional council which will set a budget and send it down to Canberra for approval before any decision can be made. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is definitely true. The work of many people, many years of slogging, will be wiped out, all to satisfy Gerry Hand's socialist left philosophy that all power must be centralised in Canberra. His attitude is that the `bush murrays' have not got the ability to make a decision for themselves in their own communities. That is what ATSIC is all about. ATSIC denies Aboriginals their right to live in a secure community because it pushes various communities together in the same regional council which gets one voice at a zonal level. This may lead to the dominance of the more articulate urban Aboriginals whose priorities may be quite different from those of community Aboriginals. For example, urban Aboriginals may be more interested in legal and health services while Aboriginals in the communities may see water, sewerage, housing and roads as their priorities. The basic issue here is how to get adequate representation for all without denying Aboriginal people their ethos of relating to the people and needs of their own communities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation simply does not resolve that issue. It will be a nightmare for those living in the traditional communities and in the smaller communities in Queensland who have great difficulty with English. How will a councillor from these areas successfully argue his case on a regional council? How will he stand up for his community's share of the cake when he cannot even speak English? Many Aboriginals have difficulty with English. How would a councillor be received back home in his own small community when his council ignores his request or decides on different spending priorities for his community? Sometimes ATSIC even makes it impossible for the smaller communities to get representation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has decided to start ATSIC without holding elections which, from his point of view, was the whole basis of self-management. On top of this, he asks this Parliament to sanction a Bill that omits the most basic mechanisms used to set up the ATSIC structure. The Senate has not been told how the elections for over 1,200 people are to be conducted. This Parliament is being asked to abdicate its responsibility to ensure that the elections for a very powerful body are held in the most democratic way possible. Who decides the conduct of elections? Is it the self-managing Aboriginals? No, it is the Minister. The Minister may also make rules to reduce significantly the costs of these elections. Does that mean that an Aboriginal vote is dependent on its cost?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister is also asking the Senate to pass the Bill without having finalised the regional boundaries which are the grass roots structure of the whole ATSIC proposal. No-one ever knows what region he is in. This legislation lists only the names of zones and regions; it gives no clear picture of who and what are contained within each region. Last night the Minister's office informed my office that it cannot even provide a date on which these regional boundaries will be finalised. Senator Coulter went to Mr Hand and Mr Hand said, `Do not worry about it; we will fix it all up later'. Senator Coulter must believe in the tooth fairy! The Bill provides for the Minister to determine the regional boundaries. Obviously Parliament and the people of Australia do not need to know where those boundaries will be. What an uproar there would be if the Prime Minister decided to set divisional boundaries for Federal electorates. Mr Hand wants to do it. He also has the power. Is there no end to what power he will claim? The Minister can change these boundaries from time to time and make any provisions he thinks are necessary to transfer assets or liabilities between the affected regional councils. This is absolutely outrageous!</PARA>
<PARA> How can this Bill reflect consultation with Aboriginals when so much of the basic mechanics-the regional boundaries and the conduct of elections-are missing entirely? Either the Government has not worked it out yet-which shows it is completely incompetent-or it is too scared to put it in this legislation and leave it open to the parliamentary process. Obviously the Minister has given himself dictatorial power over a national black political structure. This is not black self-management; this is white supremacy. </PARA>
<PARA> This is possibly the most disastrous piece of legislation to come before this Parliament. It certainly will not meet the needs of the Aboriginal people. Their needs and immediate problems are: health, housing, water, education, sewerage, Aboriginal deaths in custody and a high proportion of Aboriginals in gaol. This legislation does not address those problems in the slightest and it will set the cause of Aboriginals back many years. As Senator Peter Baume has said, they may never recover from it. This legislation deserves to be thrown out because it is bad for the black community and it has no support from the white community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to support the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) legislation which we are debating tonight and which is a very important initiative. While I do not agree with Senator Peter Baume's view about it I share the comment he made at the beginning of his speech when he said that it is the most important piece of Aboriginal legislation that we will see this decade. I think that is right and I think its importance requires serious consideration. During the course of Senator Boswell's contribution I said to my colleague Senator Faulkner that if ATSIC were actually the organisation which Senator Boswell was describing I would not support it either. But, fortunately, it does not bear any relationship to the body that he has just outlined, so I think we can continue to discuss what is really proposed in the legislation and give it some serious and sober consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am pleased to support three elements in the legislation which together form the underlying concept of ATSIC. I referred to these elements in a previous contribution in the Parliament and I say again that the three aspects of the ATSIC concept are: firstly, the administrative consolidation envisaged within it; secondly, the establishment of a representative national structure; and, thirdly, a representative regional structure. I think those three concepts which form the core of ATSIC are worthy of support. They are aspirations for which Aboriginal people have expressed support in principle. It was acknowledged by all concerned that support in principle for those concepts was achieved by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) irrespective of divergent views about the merits of subsequent consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation, as originally envisaged, was right in principle. It talked about self-determination and self-management. It was not a unique idea; it was not something that emerged from nowhere; it was a logical next step from previous initiatives which have been taken-for example, the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) and the National Aboriginal Conference (NAC). The ADC had many of the good features of ATSIC in that Aboriginal people were involved in making decisions about the allocation of resources, setting priorities and making hard choices. But one fundamental shortcoming-and I will come back to discuss the ADC subsequently-was that it was an appointed rather than an elected body. We hear passionate concern about the fact that an interim body of ATSIC may be appointed by people who are defending the continuation of the ADC which is permanently appointed. Conversely the NAC, which was elected, had some of those advantages but it had no power to make decisions about priorities and it did not have those obligations thrust upon it; therefore, it did not succeed and its members were frustrated. We find that the best principles of those two bodies together with devolution are brought together in the original ATSIC concept. </PARA>
<PARA> I regard the regional councils as the key to the success of ATSIC. There is no doubt from the consultations of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs that the Aboriginal people were most attracted to the regional councils. I regard them as the key element of this development and I am not unhappy about the fact that we are proceeding slowly with the implementation of that key element because its success is vital to the success of the ATSIC project. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing I want to say-I will come back to it subsequently-is that ATSIC will force Aboriginal people to make hard choices. I have quoted previously in the Parliament the former French Prime Minister Pierre Mendes-France who once said:</PARA>
<PARA>To govern is to choose. </PARA>
<PARA>It is about making hard choices. As the ATSIC task force put it in a submission to the Senate Select Committee, this scheme presents a challenge to the leadership of the Aboriginal community. To the extent that it provides government with professional objective advice, it will obtain access to information not otherwise available and obtain the opportunity to influence from inside the public sector and the development of government policy as it affects Aboriginal people. So those are the principles that underline the original Bill. I believe that the implementation of these principles has been substantially enhanced by the report of the Senate Select Committee and the Government's response to it. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer briefly to three main areas before concentrating on one of them. Those three areas are: accountability, the Institute of Aboriginal Studies, and electoral boundaries and procedures. I do not think I will have time to speak at length about the electoral boundaries and procedures. I simply say that they are a substantial improvement on the original proposals and should be able to work effectively. I have faith in the capacity of the Australian Electoral Commission to implement them effectively. The Australian Electoral Commission seems to find these proposals acceptable. I support the preservation of the separate role of the Institute of Aboriginal Studies, which is a body operating here in my own constituency. I thought it made a sensible submission. The Committee supported it, and I am pleased that the Government adopted our recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to spend more time talking about the question of accountability. One of the myths that are being perpetrated about ATSIC is that in some way the money is going to disappear, that the elected Commission is going to have control of $800m of the taxpayers' money to do with as it wishes, to have some sort of bonanza or blow-out with the money. ATSIC expenditures will be subject to all the normal public sector accountability measures. ATSIC will be audited by the Auditor-General. Most importantly of all, an office of evaluation and audit will be established within ATSIC to undertake ongoing evaluation and internal audit work and to report to the Commission and the Minister on evaluation matters. ATSIC will get its money by parliamentary appropriation. The Minister will have to approve, by approving the estimates, that money going to ATSIC, and the Minister, of course, will remain accountable to this Parliament for that money. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important thing is the establishment of the office of evaluation and audit, which will be able to undertake regular evaluations and audits of all the Commission's programs and officers and report to the Minister and the Commission regularly and to the Parliament annually; and, as I have said, all expenditure by ATSIC will be audited by the Auditor-General. Over and above that, because of that question of accountability to Parliament, the expenditures will be reviewed by this Senate through its Estimates committees twice a year. We all know the capacity for effective scrutiny and/or mischief which can follow from Senate Estimates committees. I will refer to some of that in a moment, but I do not want to diverge from the important things I want to say about accountability. The accountability proposals as originally envisaged were fairly orthodox accountability provisions, but I am pleased that they have been enhanced. I think this Bill goes a long way towards providing a new standard of accountability for taxpayers' funds and is something that is worthy of consequent consideration in other areas. Those are the things that I want to outline initially in talking about the case for ATSIC-the principles, the concepts, the way in which it will be implemented, and the question of accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> In the limited time I have I want to respond to some of the Opposition's attacks. Firstly, there was the old argument, with which I have some sympathy, that `if it's not broke don't mend it'. It is not a bad aphorism, but entirely inappropriate. My colleague Senator McKiernan, and subsequently Senator Coulter, talked very effectively about why we should not be complacent about saying, `This system is working all right; it does not need to be changed in terms of outcomes'. The problems confronted by Aboriginal people in Australia are so profound that it is unbelievable to me that people can say `If it's not broke don't mend it' as a case against change within the administration of Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to duplicate that. There is little enough time to have a bit of fun in a speech reiterating what one's colleagues have already said, and I think Senator McKiernan said that well. What amuses me about that argument is that the very people who say `If it's not broke don't mend it' have for months in this Parliament been making impassioned speeches about how outrageous the Aboriginal affairs structures in this country are, making attacks upon the very bodies which currently constitute the structure of Aboriginal affairs and which they say are not broke. For example, the attacks that have been made on the Aboriginal Development Commission have been vehement. I want to come back in a moment to the personal way they have been handled. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to deal with Senator Tambling's double standards about that soon enough. He should just be patient. Those opposite have attacked this body. I should not be above criticism; I have criticised them. But having attacked the Commission because they do not like the people on it, they have now launched attacks on various decisions that were actually made by the Commission as previously constituted-by the body they supported, the people they lauded. I do not criticise those people. I acknowledge, and I have acknowledged it in this Parliament in the debate on the previous report when it was presented, that the previous commissioners were honest people trying to do a good job. I do not challenge that, and I accept that that is an appropriate point to make here again. I have said it before. I only wish that those who thought Gerry Hand should say that about the previous people-and he never said the opposite-had not been the same people making malicious and continual allegations under parliamentary privilege about the current commissioners. If they applied to the current commissioners half the standard they said should be applied to the previous ones, the standard of debate in this Parliament would be substantially enhanced and the capacity for reasonable discussion of Aboriginal affairs would be significantly furthered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have only been in this Senate now for about 18 months, but I have been involved very closely in the administration and the observation of politics for 15 years. I have to say that I have never heard a less justified, more outrageous public remark by an elected member of any Parliament than Senator Tambling's black mafia of corruption allegation. What is worse is that he knew it was not true. Not only did everybody else in Australia know it was not true, he knew but he did not care. I accept the integrity of very many people on the other side of this chamber about Aboriginal affairs. We disagree with integrity about the best means of achieving basically agreed outcomes. I do not have any difficulty with that. If that were not the case, we would not need the Parliament. There are legitimate disagreements, and Aboriginal affairs is one of those issues that bring them to the fore. But I think there has been in this Parliament-and the black mafia of corruption allegation was the nadir of the depths to which debate can sink-a level of debate about this issue which has done the Parliament no good and has certainly not enhanced the standing of the people who made those comments. I am happy to say that I believe that will be reflected when the electorate gets a chance to make its judgment. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to talk in another way about the Aboriginal Development Commission. One of the concerns that have been expressed is that ATSIC should not proceed because it leads to the abolition of the ADC, and the ADC has significant merits. There have been some merits in it, but I refer to two judgments made by the Auditor-General in reviewing it-not sordid personal criticisms about whether somebody made a mistake with a petty cash docket but substantial concerns about the nature of the organisation and whether in 1989 and for the rest of this century it is the appropriate structure for the conduct of economic enterprise on behalf of Aboriginal people. Firstly, the Auditor-General said:</PARA>
<PARA>One might also add that the ADC is hardly a commercial organisation. If there is a commercial organisation out there competing with it, that is giving grants and low interest loans, we have not found it. Indeed, if there were one in competition commercially with it, there would probably be no need for the ADC. </PARA>
<PARA>But I reiterate that the ADC is hardly a commercial organisation. I think that is true, even though it has done many good things. The Auditor-General showed up another fundamental flaw in the ambit of the ADC's responsibility. He was talking about one of the very good decisions that the ADC made when it provided capital for Yeperenye Pty Ltd for what it saw as the future benefit of Aboriginals, and I think correctly. The Auditor-General has expressed concern not that it was a bad investment but that it may have been outside the terms of reference of the ADC. No-one said that the investment was made other than with propriety and in this instance proper auditing. </PARA>
<PARA> The point that is made is that the Commission may not have been entitled to make that decision. If that interpretation is correct, and I think it is, it establishes a clear shortcoming in the ADC legislation which will be overcome by the Commercial Development Corporation set up under ATSIC. That limitation will no longer exist and the assistance to enterprises on behalf of Aboriginal people will be liberated from that constraint. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not to say that the ADC when it was first envisaged was necessarily a bad idea. It did quite a good job in its day. It is simply time to move on from an organisation which gets its management from appointed commissioners. The concept of self-management and self-determination is determined not only by the Aboriginality of the people making the decisions but also by the process by which they are selected. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Boswell in what I thought would have been a good speech in support of ATSIC-had he fully understood what he was saying-made some significant criticisms about the problems that arise when bodies are run by hand picked appointed commissioners. It was quite an effective contribution. It highlighted why I believe we should be moving on from a body run by hand picked commissioners to a body run by elected representatives. That is one of the reasons why the ADC was a good idea in its time and it is now time to move on. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like now to refer to one other important area of the Bill which has not had the consideration that is deserves and which, when it was considered in the public domain in representations before the Committee, was either misrepresented hysterically or misunderstood totally, or both. I refer to the preamble. The majority report of the Select Committee concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>A preamble is of no legal force by itself. It is generally treated by the courts as an aid to ascertaining the intent of the Parliament in making a particular piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not a particularly wonderful perception by those of us who are the majority of the Parliament. It is a very straightforward comment. Everybody knows, or should know, that it is true. The Acts Interpretation Act makes it crystal clear. Some people have probably been misled and actually believe that in some way this preamble will have profound legal ramifications but that is only because they have been seriously misled by some of the more extreme critics. I will not name those people who came before the Select Committee because they would only revel in the publicity. They do not mind being on the front page even if it is on the basis of inaccuracies. </PARA>
<PARA> But the preamble does not have any legal force. That is clearly so. There is nothing in the words of the preamble that the Parliament should have the slightest concern about passing. We have already passed a resolution affirming our commitment as a Parliament to Australia's indigenous people. I do not see why we find it so difficult to recognise in a symbolically significant way through this preamble the facts of history and the Australian people's commitment to the recognition and protection of the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the measures to overcome their disadvantage. That is what the preamble sets out to do. It is not a revolutionary Marxist doctrine. It is not a new manifesto. It is a reasonable statement that we think the Australian Parliament should be prepared to make on behalf of the Australian people in this Bill. I am happy to support it. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to draw my comments to a conclusion by saying that there are no simple solutions to the problems we have created for Aboriginal Australians over the past 201 years. There is no one initiative which will right all the wrongs-not ATSIC, not the ADC, nor any other. The best we can hope for as legislators and as Australians is that each step we take is a step in the right direction, and I believe ATSIC is such a step. It builds on the experience of the National Aboriginal Conference and the ADC and others. This Bill shows that we have learnt at least some of the lessons which that experience has taught us. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that ATSIC does not provide a hand-out to Aboriginal Australians. It provides them with a challenge to recognise the hard choices which have to be made, to set priorities, to accept responsibility for the decisions which are made. I believe they can and will meet that challenge. Therefore I support this package of legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are addressing this very important package of legislation-the Ab- original and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill 1989 and related Bills-that looks at the creation of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). This legislation has spent a long time in being developed and looked at. I would venture to say that every honourable senator has taken a keen interest in it. I think all of us are sympathetic to the plight and needs of Ab- original people and the natural progression and development that should be taking place so that Aborigines can play their proper role and take their proper part in the Australian community. I am disappointed that the contributions to this debate so far by Senators McKiernan and McMullan have not really spent much time justifying the legislation or going into the details of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to take time tonight to highlight many of the issues that I think still need to be very seriously addressed. The consultation about the ATSIC proposal has been incomplete and inadequate and I believe that Senator Peter Baume in his initial speech addressed this very keenly and very interestingly. We need to remember that in May 1988 and on a number of other occasions the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) dismissed commissioners of the Ab- original Development Commission (ADC) and a number of other Aboriginal leaders in various places from their particular positions. These commissioners were shamefully treated. It has been demonstrated through many of the inquiries that other Aboriginal leaders were harassed and intimidated. The events of the past year have demonstrated that the administration of Aboriginal affairs has been shown to be in serious disarray.</PARA>
<PARA> ATSIC would do nothing to improve matters because the ATSIC concept is unsound. The Bill is deficient structurally and in detailed drafting, and accountability will not be assured. It has already been quite widely indicated that there will be amendments to this legislation-considerable amendments that will take some time to deal with-both from the Opposition and from the Australian Democrats. Sadly it is the Aboriginal people and the general body of Australian taxpayers who will be worst served by ATSIC compared with the existing arrangements. We must question the motives of the Government and the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not backing away from the fact that during the last 12 months I have been aggressive in my questioning of the Minister and of the Government in relation to the Aboriginal affairs portfolio. I believe quite firmly that the Minister has been involved in a whole series of deceptions and lies, scandals and issues that will not go away and that he has very seriously failed to consider the real legal implications of ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA> ATSIC is not just the isolated instance of Mr Hand's neglect. We need to look at the Minister's relationship with the land councils, the way in which he is adjusting the funds of the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account, the dissatisfaction that has been shown by Aboriginals, particularly in the Northern Territory, where there are six land council movements breaking away from the traditional organisations. The way in which the Minister has handled the issue of stock routes and excisions for living areas in the Northern Territory and on pastoral leases has been highlighted time and again in the media. Let me quote the former Secretary of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, Charles Perkins, as reported in the Canberra Times of yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister had surrounded himself with advisers all of a similar character to himself. They knew what was going on. They were in constant contact and discussions with the Central and Northern Land Councils. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have now is a most unsatisfactory situation in terms of some of the people ripping off Aboriginal affairs . . . vagabonds and hooligans, self-elected and self-seeking, and pretending to represent Aborigines here and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>Charles Perkins was reported yesterday as having made those remarks about the Minister, Mr Hand. Mr Hand is the Deng Xiaoping of Australia and what he is developing is a totalitarian state in the heart of a democracy. If we draw the comparisons with China that we are all now familiar with we see, firstly, that there is a power struggle within the leadership of the Australian Labor Party. It has been obvious that there have been deep divisions between Minister Hand and the senior Ministers, the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, and the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, Mr Holding. That has been well demonstrated. Secondly, the power is concentrated in the hands of a few radical Aborigines and a privileged political elite has been set up. This will be compounded by the fact that this clique of land bosses includes people like Foley, Mansell, and Yunupingu. They are now advising the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs instead of the Department and the ADC. Interestingly, the clique has most to gain from ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, there is the comparison we need to draw of promoting the concept of a class struggle. Totalitarian states use the common good as a way of suppressing dissenting voices. The ATSIC structure is similar in that it promotes the homogeneity of Aborigines rather than recognising fundamental differences between the urban and tribal people. It also fails to take into account the aspirations and the needs of individual groups and potential conflicts of interest in regions and zones. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, there is the perceived and demonstrated maladministration in high places. The Estimates of 1988 and 1989 high- lighted maladministration in the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio. Now Aborigines and non- Aborigines are openly suspicious about ATSIC, a structure not fully accountable to Parliament. Minister Hand has created a civil war in the Aboriginal constituency. He has turned one Aborigine against the other. The argument is not about racism; it is about accountability. The Minister has also turned one sector of the community against the other. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us quickly retrace the ground. Since December 1987 when the Minister tabled in the Parliament the document Foundations for the Future he went out on the boardwalk with wide consultations. In March-April-May 1988 consultations were held around the community. He then presented mark 2 of the amendments to Foundations for the Future in the Parliament and to the Aboriginal community. The Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs was set up. In September and October 1988 we had the Estimates, resulting in a number of inquiries which came down with reports. We then had mark 3 of the ATSIC proposals, again with no consultation. In August, of course, we have ended up with the ATSIC Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of significant dates from the time of the election of the Hawke Government in July 1987 and the appointment of Mr Hand as Minister. I seek leave of the Senate to incorporate in Hansard a list of the significant dates between 1987 and 1989. </PARA>

Its officers have been seeking transfers and retirements at an unprecedented rate, as has been well demonstrated. Many of the people from the Department and the ADC who were involved have been put under undue pressure ever since. This is at a time when we have been defining the plight and the need of Aboriginal communities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After 20 years of centralised control of Aboriginal affairs in Australia the Federal Government has proposed another system of Aboriginal representation and administration. That system has the potential of furthering the self-seeking interests of small pressure groups, most of which are urban based, to entrench the paternalistic bureaucracy, to ignore the responsibilities of elected government and to be too remote from the very communities it is meant to benefit, rather than bringing about much needed improvements in health, housing, education, employment and welfare for Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> ATSIC complicates what is already a difficult problem. In the last 10 years billions of dollars have been spent with no result. I stress that money is not the answer. The answer is to be found in numeracy, literacy, health and dignity. The heart of this issue boils down to self-determination as distinct from self-management and the difference between them. Self-determination is a political concept. Self-management is an enterprise-based concept. There is no real disagreement that Aboriginal self-management is desirable and essential. The more that Aborigines assume responsibility for their own lives, jobs and enterprises, the better. We need to compare improved education and improved quality of life with the Minister's preoccupation with power and programs. </PARA>
<PARA> If we compare Aboriginal development with World Bank measurements of the economic development in the Third World, we find that although income standards are comparable between Aboriginal Australians and those countries which are considered to be middle developing by the World Bank, it must be understood that the majority of Aboriginals have not reached a basic standard of living, education, housing, and employment. Until this has been achieved, there is no way that ATSIC in its present form can work. We must remember that Aboriginal life expectancy is 20 years less than that for other Australians. Aboriginal infant mortality is still nearly three times higher than for other Australians. Aboriginal unemployment is four times the national average. Average Aboriginal income is two-thirds that of other Australians. The number of Aborigines with post-secondary qualifications is less than a quarter of the national average. Aboriginal imprisonment rates in some States are as much as 16 times higher than for other Australians. After six years of the Labor Government there is no measure of improvement. </PARA>
<PARA> What moves me and concerns me is that the composition of ATSIC is highly likely to facilitate a situation where the interests of traditional Aboriginal people will be subsumed by the radically different aspirations, pursuits and needs of urban Aboriginal people. I will quote from the Aboriginal Cultural Foundation which represents a broad range of traditional and tribal communities, which said that it feared that the power of the Northern Land Council would be tied to ATSIC. The Foundation said:</PARA>
<PARA> We want the Government to find a way to give a proper level of funding to the foundation every year, directly from the Government, without the interference of non-tribal Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA>It wants a two-year delay and asks the Senate not to pass the Bill. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> After one year of so-called consultation, we tribal people have almost no idea what this new commission is all about. </PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, there is the concern of so many Northern Territory constituents, both Aboriginal and those who are not of the Aboriginal community. Representations to the Senate Select Committee stood out as needing to be looked at very carefully. The Northern Territory Government submission to the Select Committee said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Commonwealth's answer to that question thus far is that `the redirection could be effected now, but trust us'. What the State and Territory jurisdictions need to know is what is the intention and what safeguards might there be against dramatic erosion of current State and Territory responsibilities and funding. Further, in the event of a dispute arising on interpretation of Commonwealth state financial relationship, which side would the Commonwealth favour, the State or ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a major issue in the Northern Territory. Mr Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard an extract from the Northern Territory Government's submission to the Senate Select Committee. </PARA>

<PARA> From the Northern Territory Government submission to the Senate Select Committee established to inquire into and report on the proposed ATSIC legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> `. . . in relation to the Territory Government's initiative of Community Government for remote communities and the establishment of the NT community Government Association which represents those bodies and gives them a voice with the NT Government, as well as at the Local and National levels. The Community Government system is an innovative form of local government specifically aimed at small remote communities, the majority of which are comprised of Aboriginal Territorians. Not only is the Community government system an alternative form of local government for those communities, but also it is accorded equal status to that of the more usual Municipal Government system. </PARA>
<PARA> This Community Government program is unique because of the way in which its degree of flexibility accommodates the Aboriginal relationship system and traditional practices; and more basically, the wishes of the Aboriginal constituency in the Community government. </PARA>
<PARA> Each Community Government Scheme is distinct and is specifically drafted to meet the needs and aspirations of the particular community. That flexibility allows each community to accommodate traditional leader selection processes, to use traditional leaders in both cultural and local administrative matters and to decide complex issues of boundaries and enfranchisement. In other words, Community Government in the Northern Territory allows for representative Government for Aboriginal Territories in a very real sense. It allows for a recognition of Aboriginal values and systems, while at the same time bringing into the mainstream political process of local government.'</PARA>

<PARA> It is likely to lead to a worse outcomes than those produced by the bodies it is to replace, to worse services for Aboriginal and Islander people, to less accountability of the commission and its servants to the Aboriginal and Islander people, and to less accountability to all Australians. Minority Report, 02/1989)</PARA>
<PARA> Not one thing has been done until recently to attempt to correct the grave deficiencies that have been patently obvious to everyone, including the Aboriginal communities themselves. For years the deficiencies have been patently obvious for everyone to see. The real tragedy of this is that the losers are the Aboriginal people of Australia themselves. They are the sufferers. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been squandered each year without accountability and in ways which have benefited the supposed recipients, namely the Aboriginal people of Australia, to only a minor degree. (Short, Senate, 09/03/1989)</PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of a new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission is something that will represent, or purport to represent, 200,000 people around Australia. It will have a budget well in excess of $600m . . . We need to balance this against all the problems that are associated with the Aboriginal Development Commission, which is an existing statutory authority with an existing budget of $30m. That is $600m compared with $30m. (Tambling, Senate, 11/04/1989)</PARA>
<PARA> The ATSIC Bill got Cabinet approval. Its defenders stress that all funds will fall under the scrutiny of the Auditor-General. Yet one suspects the Cabinet gave scant attention to the Bill's far-reaching political import nor to the risks of financial accountability, the facts, of course, are that some regional councils will fail. even the supporters know this; they admit it. So how many will fail? At what cost? At what community backlash? (Aust 17-18/12/1989)</PARA>
<PARA> Financial Management and Accountability Maintain accountability through ministerial responsibility to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>More directive role for the Minister in the preparation of budgets. </PARA>
<PARA>Retention of a Department of Office of Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the commission itself to prepare a draft budget. (it has the support of a secretariat upon which it can draw). The Commission divides the moneys to each regional council, makes grants to States and Territories, etc. On this basis each regional council then prepares its own draft budget deciding how funds will be spent at the grass roots. </PARA>
<PARA> This is ``Aboriginal democracy'' in operation. The commission lacks the power to overturn spending priorities decided by the councils, which can devote moneys to health, education, travel to toyotas how they like. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister can only alter the draft budget of a regional council again by tabling his reasons in both Houses within 15 sitting days of his action. So it is expected to be a rare event. The balance of the law favours the authority of the councils. (Australian, 17-18/12/1988)</PARA>
<PARA> More crucial question is that the concept of a client group having the power and authority to determine services to itself is not one which is reflected in other client service areas of Government. This is particularly so in human services areas of welfare, health and housing. (NT government)</PARA>
<PARA> In his second reading speech Gerry Hand called the regional councils ``the linchpin of the new commission''. He said that original boundaries were based upon the existing regional office structure of the department. But the final boundaries ``are clearly preferred by the Aboriginal communities''. </PARA>
<PARA> The fragmentary nature of this communities should be appreciated. The 1986 census recorded 227,645 people who identified themselves as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders. Only those aged 18 or over can vote. So on average there will be a regional councillor for every 95 Aboriginal voter. </PARA>
<PARA> The councils are to meet four times a year. That is, a total of 1200 regional councillors with travelling expenses and sitting fees at about $100 a day. It is no cheap exercise. Also, there seems no limit on the time allowed for meetings (Aust, 17-18/12/1989)</PARA>
<PARA> The potential for financial abuses implicit in the ``bottom up'' self-determination approach where Aboriginal politicians take the major decision on funding. This assumes the Cabinet and the minister are prepared to authorise the power-sharing spirit of the Bill-devolution to the Aboriginal grass roots. If they are not then the Bill is really a confidence trick. (Ausn, 17-18/12/1988)</PARA>
<PARA> We must at all times consider that the essential issue that must be addressed is to ensure that service delivery to Aboriginal people is the first priority. Nobody on this side of Parliament has ever denied that should be the first priority in the conduct of Aboriginal affairs-service delivery for people throughout Australia in special and often dire need.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the constitutional issues that are so terribly important I also seek leave to incorporate an article entitled Australia's Proposed Race Law by Professor Colin Howard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The article read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIA'S PROPOSED RACE LAW</PARA>
<PARA>Colin Howard</PARA>
<PARA> A Bill currently before the Federal Parliament would establish a separate system of political representation for blacks. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Constitution includes a power for the Australian Parliament to make laws on the subject of the people of any race for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws. This clause of the Constitution raises the question whether it is right and proper to make laws by reference to people's race at all. The widespread public assumption that such a legislative power is for the benefit of groups of people described by the imprecise term `race' has no legal foundation. The power can be just as well be used to oppress people identified by race as to assist them. But this is only the beginning of the problem. What is a race? It seems easy to distinguish between, for example, black Africans, Arabs, Polynesians and Chinese on a racial basis. But this line of thought will not get you very far. Difficulties arise when you consider groups of people who have some characteristics in common and others which are very different. Are Greeks a different race from Turks, Italians from Icelanders, Iranians from Iraqis, Zulus from Shona, English from Scots? Are the Jews a race? Only arbitrary answers can be given to such questions because each of them depends on what one means by race, and there is no agreement on that subject. </PARA>
<PARA> When one considers how vociferous the Hawke Government has been about racially-based laws in South Africa, it is worth remembering that no one has suggested that we repudiate the power to make laws with respect to race. It can be argued that we are different, we do not make laws directed against the people of any race and that any such policy would be politically unacceptable. As a justification this is a weak reed. The current danger is not that the power will be used to make laws which are crudely and overtly directed against one minority group in the community. The danger is that in the pursuit of a course of action believed to be good, damage will be done to our entire social structure by way of racially-based laws because nobody perceives what their underlying significance is. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, before the Australian Parliament at the moment, a Bill for an Act entitled the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commissioner Bill, or ATSIC Bill for short. According to the Government this is a good thing because it represents the first major attempts in our history to provide a formal framework through which Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders can influence government decisions which affect them and their interests. The Bill has for the time being been sidelined by the uproar about the Aboriginal Development Commissioner and the dismissal of Mr Charles Perkins. </PARA>
<PARA> If and when the Bill comes to life again, one thing above all should be squarely confronted. It is that the Bill aims to set up an organisation closely resembling a mini-parliament for the sole use and advantage of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. What this will mean is that a section of the Australian population will have been singled out by reference to race for separate representation based on a separate voting roll. If anyone suggests that this resembles apartheid, the answer will no doubt be made that in the first place the Bill does not deprive Aborigines or Torres Strait Islanders of any rights they may already enjoy, but on the contrary adds to those rights, and that the Government is trying to help them, not repress them. The fact remains that they are being singled out, and the process enshrined in law, on undisguisedly racial grounds. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of these consequences may not be welcome. Among other things, a body will have been brought into existence with which the Federal Government can negotiate a treaty analogous to the Treaty of Waitangi reached between whites and Maoris in New Zealand a century-and-a-half ago. Although there are supporters in this country of the idea of a treaty, there are others who legitimately have misgivings about it. It can be said, for example, that land rights have caused enough trouble already, without giving one side of the argument the status of a quasi-national independent community. It can be said also that in the long-run it is folly to enact a racial law which manifestly divides Australians instead of uniting them. The New Zealand experience has not been an entirely happy one, to put it mildly. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fundamental cause for unease that, contrary to our professional political ideology, the ATSIC Bill, if it becomes law, will have revealed us as being as racist as anyone else. We should not be in the business of deliberately creating a sub-nation with a sub-parliament with enormous powers to claim land and other property as its own. Whatever the motives, this is a recipe for racial disaster. </PARA>

<PARA> Working Party came to the conclusion that not only were they looking at the adequacy of proposed staffing numbers, but also how these staff resources gain the appropriate skills and expertise to ensure the Commission can do its job effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the radical bottom up approach cited in the Bill there exists serious concerns as the joint capacity of the portfolio staff to adequately respond to the demands of ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA> Lack of development within the portfolio of effective ongoing career development structure which ensures</PARA>

<PARA>lack of effective job training for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal staff and</PARA>
<PARA>lack of stability in staff structures. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to instil a new sense of enthusiasm and confidence amongst staff and its clients about ATSIC urgent attention needs to be given to the development and training needs of Commission personnel and which embody a set of objectives to be achieved within a discernible timeframe. </PARA>
<PARA> Working Party believes that in the first two years there will be a need for intensive work that will require resources to supplement those of management at regional level. </PARA>
<PARA> The Working Party recognises that under the arrangement we propose there are dangers in respect to the relationship between Regional Offices and State Offices over where training resources are utilized. </PARA>
<PARA> The numbers of Regional Councils being created in certain States/Territories will have important ramifications for workloads associated with training needs of Regional Councillors and Secretarial staff. Another issue which bears consideration is the significant workload imposed on Regional Councils in relation to budgetary matters consistent with their responsibilities set out under the Bill. In this regard the priority that needs to be afforded to the early development of procedures manuals cannot be overstated. </PARA>

<PARA> The Auditor-General, Special Audit Report, The Aboriginal Development Commission and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, March 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusions regarding enterprise projects</PARA>
<PARA> Audit has shown (with except of Imparja Television) there were serious defects in the enterprise projects queried by Senator Tambling and other members of the Senate Estimates Committee E. </PARA>
<PARA> The Defective projects are the outcome of defective approval procedures and management controls within ADC. </PARA>
<PARA> The Audit found that ADC, in its concern to assist Aboriginals, has provided some of the funds under the enterprise programs in ways not authorised by the ADC Act. The ADC has occasionally been treated as a welfare program rather than a development program. </PARA>
<PARA> Audit's finding drew a hostile response from the ADC but this understand given the nature of the findings and the prospect of having significant administrative deficiencies exposed to wider scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> ADC enterprise program, is difficult to have successful outcomes; namely Aboriginals enabled to engage successfully in self-sustaining enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA>Accountability</PARA>
<PARA> ADC should be accountable for the way the money has been spent. The ADC's annual reports contain descriptive material but little information about the problems in the enterprise program. </PARA>
<PARA> The ADC's annual reports provide some detail of some grants provided for housing purposes but little information about people and organisations that have received enterprise grants or loans. </PARA>
<PARA> ADC's view overlooks the fact that its enterprise grants are in no sense commercial, that its enterprise loans are granted on concessionary terms and that both grants and loans are provided from public funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Disclosure of enterprise clients would avoid the speculation about the way in which funds are applied. Government bodies are likely to feel their responsibilities more keenly when their decisions are public. </PARA>
<PARA> ADC should also give more attention to the outcomes that the Parliament intended in the Act. It should identify the Aboriginals who have been able to engage in self-sustaining business enterprises, and the cost of ADC of achieving those successes. ADC should also be more forthcoming in its reports about the difficulties in achieving success and the reasons for failure. This information is necessary for the Minister and Parliament to make informed decisions about the program. </PARA>
<PARA> Audit recommends that the ADC should:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) disclose the names of people and organisations who receive enterprise loans and grants, together with details of the amount and purpose, and details of any significant increase or other change subsequently made, and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) disclose performance indicators of the success of the enterprise program in enabling Aboriginals to engage in self sustaining enterprises. </PARA>

<PARA> (2) The staff savings envisaged by Dr McIver are not obtainable. The Bill itself and subsequent Government commitments have meant a degree of accountability for ATSIC of which Dr McIver could have had no knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) It will be possible, however, to limit the proportion of ATSIC staff employed in Central Office, as a proportion of the total resources, to a similar level to that envisaged by Dr McIver (30%). Our figure (34%) is not excessive as Central Office does not just consist of policy officers and their support staff. Some key client services are centralised (amongst others the incorporation of Councils and Associations, and aspects of CDEP/AEDP) and personnel and recruitment functions are centralised. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Working Party was unable to identify any function in DAA and the ADC that would not carry over under ATSIC. It was possible, however, to identify a reduction in positions, due to the amalgamation of functions performed in both existing organisations and to general increase in efficiency. The number of permanent positions required in ATSIC is even below the depleted numbers currently employed in DAA and the ADC leading to some staff savings initially, and the possibility of further reductions after 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Working Party noted that ATSIC Central Office would involve a number of additional functions (e.g. the Housing Fund and Land Fund to be administered as separate funds, the greater emphasis on training as a consequence of the Prime Minister's 11 April 1989 statement, and the consequences of the reduced role of State Offices). It has been possible to accommodate the additional functional responsibilities, whilst recommending an overall staff reduction. </PARA>
<PARA> (6) A structure of 312 positions has been recommended to provide the absolute minimum effective workforce to ensure the successful establishment of ATSIC. This structure is detailed in charts accompanying this Report. A further 15 temporary positions will be required during the establishment period. </PARA>
<PARA> (7) The workload on ATSIC will be highest for ATSIC staff in the first years of its operation. Some temporary positions have been included in the structure but the establishment should be reviewed after the first year of the Commission's operation to identify further staff savings. </PARA>
<PARA> (8) The staffing figures recommended by the Working Party however, are believed to be the absolute minimum for ATSIC's initial operation. If staffing is to be reduced further to a pre-determined maximum number of positions for reasons not associated with the administration of Aboriginal Affairs, then functions must be shed. </PARA>
<PARA> (9) Although the Working Party based its proposed organisation on a top structure agreed by Finance, there are obvious disparities between Division and Branch responsibilities. In particular, the Policy Development Division is overloaded. </PARA>
<PARA> (10) The Working Party puts forward for consideration two alternative models using three Divisions and the same number of SES officers, which better balance the Divisions. </PARA>
<PARA> (11) There is justification for a four Divisional structure, and the Working Party puts this model forward as the preferred option. </PARA>
<PARA> (12) The recent announcements about the Office of Evaluation and Audit have not been comprehensively addressed in this Report, and will need to be the subject of further work. </PARA>

<PARA>INQUIRY BY MR A. C. MENZIES INTO ALLEGATIONS AS TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS</PARA>
<PARA>Final Report</PARA>
<PARA>June 1989</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The procedures of the D.A.A. should be examined to ensure that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) not only when a formal decision is made by the Secretary or his delegate as to grant of funds for drug abuse programs but also when a substantive decision is made to recommend to the Minister the making of such a grant, all relevant matters are noted and taken into account;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) while the Secretary may deal directly with a junior officer in a particular matter, more senior officers have a clear understanding as to their roles in regard to any matters to dealt with; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) incoming communications are promptly placed on relevant files;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Mr Woods should be counselled as to his failure to alert Mr Perkins on 11 March 1988 as to a report by the State Office being outstanding in respect of the Downs' application; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Disciplinary action as provided under section 57 of the Public Service Act in respect of Secretaries of Departments and certain unattached officers is not called for in the case of Mr Perkins, but the contents of this Chapter should be drawn to his attention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like the Senate to take time to review that list of recommendations and compare them with the comments that Senator McKiernan made here earlier today. He glossed over them as if they had no content and there were no important issues to be addressed. Those recommendations, as honourable senators will see when they peruse Hansard, require a lot of attention and a great deal of interest. Let me refer to the Menzies report, which was tabled in the Parliament several days ago by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). The Prime Minister himself conceded that Mr Menzies found `cases of questionable practice'. The Prime Minister went on to say that the final report `brings out some further shortcomings in administration in the area of Aboriginal affairs-in some cases shortcomings for which Mr Perkins, as the departmental Secretary over much of the period, has to bear the ultimate responsibility'. However, the Prime Minister also acknowledged that `there were deficiencies in systems and procedures going well beyond the realm of Mr Perkins' personal responsibility'. If that is not an attack by the Prime Minister on the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) I would like to know what is. Let me repeat his remark:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . there were deficiencies in systems and procedures going well beyond the realm of Mr Perkins' personal responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA>Beyond Mr Perkins's responsibility? It is on the desk of the Minister. That is who the Prime Minister was questioning at that time. Included in the recommendations that I have incorporated in Hansard today were the recommendations of an interim report of a working party on central office structure with regard to ATSIC. This report was commissioned by the Minister as part of the ATSIC task force. The document that I have is the interim report dated May 1989 entitled Working Party on Central Office Structure. I seek leave to table that report. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report is signed by five employees of either the Department of Aboriginal Affairs or the Aboriginal Development Commission: R. J. Beadman, S. Dalton, E. van Oosten, N. Baxendell and P. Golack. I believe that S. Dalton and N. Baxendell are union officials who were invited to participate in the preparation of the report. The report is most interesting. It was released in May 1989-only five months, I remind the Senate, before the date that we are told ATSIC is to be up and running. It was an interim report on ATSIC's central office structure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report makes interesting, even striking, reading. We see experienced officials struggling with the realities of public administration and the Minister's airy-fairy theories of self-determination. In a masterpiece of understated but scornful despair these officers, including the union officials, point out a number of home truths. For example, they say that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill `reveals the complexity of the ongoing central office rule'. Secondly, the report says:</PARA>
<PARA>The McIver philosophy of a greatly reduced central office has not been reflected in the Bill, which creates additional work. </PARA>
<PARA>Thirdly, it says:</PARA>
<PARA>We are not aware of any particular attention being given to remote area allowances packages so as to increase the attractiveness of such posts. </PARA>
<PARA>This was five months before the whole shambles is due to get started. Fourthly, the report says there is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a potential conflict between the broader objectives of ATSIC and the cost savings objectives under the machinery of Government changes of 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>Faced then with the administrative and organisational mess that will be ATSIC, the report speculates that the Minister and his advisers who dreamt up the scheme might hold the view that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a deliberative and decisive reduction in both staff numbers will in itself lead to a devolution of power to the grass roots. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, only by weakening the effectiveness of the central administration can decisions be taken in communities. </PARA>
<PARA>We see here clearly the absurd bottom-up theory of management by self-determination. One might have hoped that by now the Minister would have learned something about the political rorts of management weakness in Aboriginal affairs. Not a bit of it! As the report points out, this Bill `does not provide for the total devolution of all power to communities'. The reason is clear, says the report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>Decisions will be made underlined by the Minister in a manner not dissimilar to many decisions now made by him. </PARA>
<PARA>All that will change. The officials disparagingly conclude that things will get harder, more complex and more political. Here is the final masterpiece of understatement:</PARA>
<PARA>ATSIC is of itself unlikely to lead to a reduction in parliamentary interest in Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>The structures and processes in this Bill, the naive and simplistic reliance on white men's European dreams of what Aboriginal people are really like, the anarchic faith in grass-roots democracy, are no more than the plainest signs of a new paternalism. The Minister and his coterie of theorists know best what Aborigines should be like: forget about good management and accountability to the Parliament or to the Aboriginal community; forget about the machinery of government reforms so beloved by the Prime Minister; just in case something goes wrong, put in provisions to give the Minister control over everything and everybody; then make the chief executive officer, the Minister's pimp, tell on the very people he is supposed to work for. </PARA>
<PARA> The report that I have just tabled shows everyone just how muddled and confused the ATSIC concept is. As Charles Perkins said just this week, it is flawed fatally and fundamentally. Small wonder those who wrote the report warn:</PARA>
<PARA> ATSIC cannot be set up to fail. </PARA>
<PARA>Just as Charles Perkins is now free to speak his mind-and he has done so in the last few days-the officers who have signed the report would, I am sure, have expressed themselves much more frankly if they had not been bound by the Minister's demand for total obedience to his will, the style that I believe has been so indicative of the way in which Minister Hand has conducted his portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me draw to a conclusion the issues that I see becoming a problem. ATSIC will fail to meet its objectives because of a failure to achieve a consensus amongst the very people the proposal is designed to assist, Aboriginal Australians. Let us all ask the question: What will life be like under ATSIC? The administrative problems seen in the past will only get worse and Aborigines will cop the blame. Racism will be entrenched institutionally-by, if one can believe it, a Labor Government. The interests of traditional Aboriginal people will be subsumed. There will be a lack of accountability that will be totally confusing if these proposals are adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> The real needs for disadvantaged people in the community-health, education, welfare-will get bogged down in a shockingly socialist nightmare. Really that is what Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) is all about.</PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Warwick Smith, the Federal member for Bass, released a press statement the other day in which he examined very carefully the issues that had to be addressed with regard to ATSIC. Mr Smith came to the conclusion that the coalition must continue to oppose this Bill. The press release states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . Mr Smith said ATSIC:</PARA>
<PARA> would establish an untried, experimental and radical structure that ignored existing local and State organisations,</PARA>
<PARA> would restrict the influence of local aboriginal communities, and</PARA>
<PARA> would give untried regional groups responsibility for the massive allocation of monies to fund a confusing mishmash of welfare and commercial objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>ATSIC does not address the principles and the proposals that I am sure are entrenched in the Labor Party's platform. ATSIC is a factional win for the socialist left. It is pushing a particular type of administration that is totally against the wishes of Aboriginal people and does not recognise their cultural needs and special structures. As I have moved around my electorate in the Northern Territory I have continually struck questioning and bewilderment about the proposal. This is despite the early exhaustive consultative program that the Minister and many of the staff of the Department attempted to engage in. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems of Aboriginal communities throughout Australia are complex. They cannot be tied up in simple little bundles and put into simple systems like this. The degree of sophistication of urban Aboriginal people is changing dramatically. The degree of sophistication in the traditional communities is changing drastically. I believe the influence of television on many of those communities in recent years, as they have been able to receive satellite television communication, has changed their awareness. The Aboriginal communities, whilst very complex and very disadvantaged, are also reaching a very sophisticated understanding of the politics of this particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA> During the recess I visited a number of communities in my electorate and I had representations from a number of Aboriginal organisations and groups, and individual Aboriginal leaders. None of those that I went to see, or that came to me, would support with enthusiasm 100 per cent or even 50 per cent of the proposals that are being pushed by Mr Hand. I say `pushed' because that is what is really happening. For some committed, radical reason the Minister, Mr Hand, is trying to create structures and advances that are principally not acceptable to the Aboriginal constituency that we seek to represent. As I said in the main part of my speech, I believe this will be a racially oriented structure that we will live to regret if established in the form proposed by Mr Hand. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously the debate in the committee stage in the Senate over the next couple of weeks will be very complex. The fact that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, will be presenting about 158 amendments on behalf of the Opposition shows the seriousness of the issue to which we will have to address our attention. I know that you have paid particular attention to the way in which this can be facilitated for constructive debate by the Senate and that you have been able to package the amendments so that we will not speak on 158 individual amendments but, perhaps, on some 20 packages of amendments which we will be able to consider properly and efficiently. I challenge every honourable senator to consider most seriously every amendment that is put forward by the Australian Democrats and the Opposition. I believe that in the past two years the Australian Democrats and the Opposition senators who have taken a keen interest in this matter have spent their time fruitfully representing the Aboriginal constituency of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are discussing a further addition to the legislative packages which have come through this place over the years regarding the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I say at the outset that I think it is a pity, and probably symptomatic of what has happened in the past, that no Aboriginals are here in this chamber debating this Bill. When I first came into this chamber Senator Bonner, who was the only Aboriginal ever elected to this Federal Parliament, was here and I think his contributions were always listened to with great care and consideration because of his Aboriginality and also because of the fact that he had been able to reflect in depth upon his race and upbringing and was able to make very concrete and pertinent suggestions on where we might go in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In an endeavour to overcome the lack of Aboriginal representation in Parliament there has been a very strong and, I believe, a very important press to have adequate consultation with Aboriginal people about each move that is made in this area. While it is easy to say we should have adequate consultation, it is a far more difficult thing to achieve. I represented this portfolio for my Party for six years and I found it an incredibly difficult task to come to grips with even the simple questions as to what precisely was the Aboriginal view. If one is seeking a single view one will never find it. There are many views among Aboriginal people. They differ from place to place, from group to group, and even within single communities. I was able to discover a vigorous and well articulated debate on what one would have thought might be a single approach which would have been easily discovered. In other words, the Aboriginal people, in terms of their political response, are as diverse as is the white community and as interested in pushing the views they have so that those views will be the final views. </PARA>
<PARA> That difficulty is precisely the reason why government after government has sought to establish some mechanism by which the Aboriginal peoples could come to a final compromise view which they might present, and that view might be able to be taken by this Parliament as the consensus, or majority, view of the people of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island origin. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Bill is another attempt at that procedure. Whereas, when contemplating that, one might have thought that was a pretty easy thing to do, one only has to think about the history of the various groups that have been established, first by the Fraser Government and then by the Hawke Government, to see that that approach is not necessarily the simple way out either. Each of those groups had extraordinary difficulties. They often fell into disrepute amongst Aboriginal people-again, I think, often on the basis that they were not as responsive as they should have been. Often many Aboriginal people felt that they were not as representative as they should have been or that they did not represent in an Aboriginal way the views that should have been put. </PARA>
<PARA> If one believes that with the passage of this Bill a magic wand will be waved and the problems solved, one is naive in the extreme. This is a further attempt by white Australia to come to grips with its ancestry and what I prefer to call the white problem rather than the Aboriginal problem. An Aboriginal friend who tutored me in this said that Aboriginals do not have any difficulty being Aboriginals; it is the whites who have problems with Aboriginals being Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA> We in an all-white Parliament are trying to set down what is essentially again a white structure for Aboriginal people. I am unable to say whether this will have more or less success than previous attempts. I hope that it will be more successful. I fear that it might suffer the same fate as previous attempts. But I do not think that because of the possibilities of failure we can give up the attempt to seek a structure by which the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people are able to have a far larger, more effective and more influential say in the determination of their future than they have at present. We have to keep on with the attempts, inadequate though they may be. </PARA>
<PARA> I am quite sure that the establishment of this Commission, in the form in which this Bill is presented, will not see out twelve months, and certainly not 18 months. There will have to be immediate modifications. If there are not immediate modifications, one would realise that it had been a failure. We are attempting to let the Aboriginal people take control of their future. I am sure that the type of organisation they will eventually come up with will not look very much like the structure we are seeking to impose here. It will have to have some of the elements. Undoubtedly the element of accountability will be continuously maintained. I say by way of parenthesis that I feel very strongly that any approach we take on the funding of this should be based on the principle of compensation and not on the principle of hand-outs. I know that that is a minority view in this country, but unless it becomes the majority view I believe no progress will be made. True acceptance of the historical realities will be achieved only when there is acceptance that payments are by way of compensation. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to go into detail on a number of the contributions in the debate so far but I will pick up one point with regard to the view about where we are going and where our emphasis should be. Interwoven in a number of the speeches that have been made so far is the view that we ought really to be concentrating on the schools or the hospitals or some other particular item. I totally disagree with that view. Again, the fundamental flaw in that is that it is seeing the Aboriginal situation as though it were merely a variation of a white situation, and it is not. If one cares to sit down and listen long enough, one finds that the basic problem is with the historical land base. That is why I and my Party have never resiled from wholehearted support for Aboriginal land rights as being the central and fundamental issue that has to be faced. We can fudge our way around it and we can throw money at the problem. We can look at the Aboriginal infant mortality rate, appalling as it is, and say, `Now that's the problem we really ought to be concentrating on'. I am not suggesting we should leave it alone. We need to do work in all those areas, but if we ignore the fundamental underlying cause and that is the dispossession of the Aboriginal peoples of their land, then we will never come to grips with their history or with our history. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose I have a pessimistic approach to the Commission. I see it as another step, hopefully forward. But one would have to be a super-optimist, looking at 200 years of black-white relations in this country, to think that this is the be-all and end-all. One hopes that it will be a step forward and that some of the matters outlined in the preamble, of which more will be said in the committee stage by my colleague Senator Coulter, might actually be taken on board; not simply another motion passed by this Senate. This has happened before. For example, the historic motion moved by former Senator Bonner, unanimously supported by this chamber, for the first time accepted the historic dispos- session. Let us hope that it is not just a matter of another motion being passed but rather that in voting for and accepting those types of propositions they are actually believed. If they are believed, we will have to go a long way further than this Bill goes. It merely scrapes the surface. In a sense, I would prefer it not to be passed and just simply add to the history of the relationships between our peoples in this country another broken promise, another lot of rhetoric, another lot of `Aren't these fine feelings on our behalf? That salves our conscience and now let's get on with doing what we have done up to date.' I hope they will be believed, or let us not do it at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The objectives on page 3 of the Bill, in recognition of the past dispossession of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island peoples and their present disadvantaged position in Australian society, are seeking to do four things. The first objective is to ensure maximum participation of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders in the formulation and implementation of government policies that affect them. I have not heard any dissent from that in any of the speeches tonight by anyone in any political party. Let us hope that that at least is true. The second objective is to promote the development of self-management and self-sufficiency amongst Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. Again, I have not heard any contribution to the debate on this Bill which dissents from that objective. The third objective is to further the economic, social and cultural developments of Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders. Again, there has been no dissent from that objective by anybody in any party. The fourth is to ensure cooperation in the formulations and implementation of policies affecting the Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders by Commonwealth, State, Territory and local governments without detracting from the responsibilities of State, Territory and local governments to provide services. Again, there has been no dissent from anybody in any party. In other words, the four objectives of the Bills are shared by all. </PARA>
<PARA> What the dispute is about, and what the dispute will be about in the committee stages, is the means by which those objectives are to be implemented. From my perspective, that is a step forward. It is nice to be able to say that we have gone past the disputes over those objectives in this place. However, I do not think that we should lull ourselves into a false sense of security. Each of those four objectives is still disputed in the community, while it is not disputed within this chamber. It is partly our responsibility and, hopefully, through this Commission of the Aboriginal people, to try to settle a larger majority on those objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had some pretty heavy rhetoric and some sensible contributions so far on these disputes. Doubtless that will continue. I think that up to this point the progress of this legislation has been through a reason- able, sensible process, although it has not been without its traumas. I wish to thank all those senators who served on the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs for the work that they did. While I did not agree with everything-obviously, one cannot do so in terms of the various reports and dissenting reports-it was obvious that people had spent an enormous amount of time trying to come to grips with this difficult issue. Undoubtedly those people will be to the fore in the committee stages because of the quite extensive knowledge that they have developed over that time. Earlier this year we went through the same type of process in the debate on the corporations legislation. I hope that at the end of the day all the deliberations by this chamber will have contributed to a better Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> There are still a reasonably large number of matters in this Bill with which I am not happy. At the end of the exercise one will have to make a judgment as to whether the imperfect composition of the Commission is better than no commission at all. That is essentially the position that I am predicting, not knowing what amendments will be carried in the committee stages, will be the position in which I am likely to find myself. I do not think that the final outcome will be the best we could do, but presumably at the end of the day it might be the only thing that was able to be done at this stage. That is a pity. In politics one lives in hope that the improvements that have been missed this time round will be implemented the next time round. </PARA>
<PARA> In previous debates on this matter I have returned to what to me is always the linchpin of the exercise. It is pleasing to see that there is significant emphasis on the obligations of the Commission to deal with land. Without the return of the land where that is possible, without compensatory payments for that which is not possible to return, there will always be a continuing and probably growing dispute between our peoples. I think that at long last the community realises that the types of claims that the Aboriginal people are making are reasonable and genuine claims; that while they may be seen as threatening by some, they do not threaten one square metre of land owned by any white person in this country. But the progress under the legislation passed by the Fraser Government, which was first introduced by the Whitlam Government in the Northern Territory-unfortunately amended to write down some of the very strong positions Aborigines have, under the Hawke Government-should have formed the base from which we could go forward; but we did not. Progress has been so minuscule, so glacial and so slow that one realises the frustrations of the Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> The enactment of this Bill will not satisfy all Aboriginal people. Significant bodies are opposed to this legislation, for a variety of reasons. I think that it will be a significant and very difficult task for this Commission to get a wider consensus of view about where forward movement should be going. But I think that it will do so, given the goodwill of the white population and, hopefully, given a reasonable electoral base and a reasonable group of people in the initial Commission. I am talking not about those who have been appointed to get this rolling but about those who will be elected first up. At the end of the day, it will be on their shoulders whether this actually lives or dies. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to keep making these attempts. It is not an easy thing to do, but without making the attempt I do not think that we will ever be able to progress. Because of the disputes that have gone on to date amongst the people in this chamber, I hope that when the Commission is ultimately established everybody will wish it well. We hope that the objectives which everybody in this chamber has said should be supported will ultimately be achieved, because at long last in this country there is unanimity of views amongst all political parties that those are the types of goals that should be achieved in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -It is with a degree of regret that I raise a particular matter in relation to violence. I mention my regret because violence in any form should be deplored by all Australians. Indeed, it is a tragedy that violence continues to be a major concern to the well-being of Australian society. The prevalence of violence in our society has been extensively analysed and documented. Many behavioural scientists are working towards identifying the causes and effects of all forms of violence. Their efforts and the efforts of others who work towards the elimination of violence should be commended. I also give credit to the media in supporting government initiatives designed to educate the public on the symptoms and causes of violence in the homes and in the streets of our community. In this, as with other matters of genuine public concern, the Australian media have, in general, been responsible and supportive. Nevertheless, any exception to this role of media responsibility in reporting and commenting upon such important issues as violence should, at least, be noted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Newspaper readers often give a great deal of credibility to the authority of a newspaper editor or leader writer who seeks to offer opinions through editorial columns. When the editorial section of a newspaper addresses an important public issue such as violence there is an unspoken obligation to write fair, accurate and responsible commentary. Therefore, when editorial commentary is inflammatory and ill-conceived, that newspaper and its editorial staff deserve rebuke from its readers and the community in general. To illustrate this I refer to such an editorial recently published in a Queensland provincial city newspaper. The editorial refers to violence in the streets, concluding with this proposal:</PARA>
<PARA> A few more policemen on the beat with a few more well-chosen words and well-aimed cuffs behind the ear . . . that is the way to go. </PARA>
<PARA>In any other State of Australia, advice which sanctioned physical force by police and encouraged police brutality in any form would be sternly rebuked by readers. </PARA>
<PARA> In Queensland, where the community is still reeling from the scandals of the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct and resulting cynicism toward members of the police force, such an irresponsible editorial deserves the strongest condemnation. If one is to judge from the total lack of response to this editorial in the published letters to the editor in this particular newspaper, however, thousands of readers of this publication did not read the editorial or consent to the use of police violence, or have become complacent in relation to the use of physical abuse by a few bad apples in the Queensland Police Force. </PARA>
<PARA> Although readers of the newspaper to which I have referred may have remained silent, I must condemn an editorial which would promote further violence in the streets by encouraging police to take the law away from the judicial process and into their own hands. The action recommended by the editor, to allow police to give a few well-aimed cuffs behind the ear to the youth of the area, will invite confrontation and violence rather than deter it. It can only be hoped that the leadership of the Queensland police force chooses to solve the problem of violence on the streets without physical confrontation. They must, and I believe will, act in a manner which will rebuild trust and respect for police. </PARA>
<PARA> Newspaper editors carry a grave burden of responsibility in analysing and addressing issues of public importance for their readers. Any misuse of this responsibility, through frivolous or misleading commentary, serves to denigrate the respected role of journalism. By inciting police brutality against citizens, whether innocent or not, the editorial staff of the newspaper to which I have referred has abdicated its responsibility to the community. By publishing an editorial which encourages rather than condemns violence, the readers of this newspaper, the police and the youth of the area deserve an apology. So too do their more responsible colleagues in the media. </PARA>

I refer particularly to the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent) who last night gave the most ridiculous account of logging in the south-east forests of New South Wales that I have heard for some time. His colourful little piece was so far removed from the reality that even the most dedicated greenie would have difficulty agreeing with him. Mr Kent is one of a number of blow-ins who, from time to time, give politicians a bad name. Obviously, he wanted to give his token environment speech for the session. He spoke last night of the moonscape nature of clear-felling in the south-east forests of New South Wales. He talked of the devastation. He said that it was an eerie experience and that the decimation was unnatural. He claims to have been there. I have taken his word for that, but his comments last night indicate to me either that he had his eyes closed at the time or that he was suffering from a loss of vision. He certainly has not seen the forests that I have seen. Admittedly, I have done more than just travel through the region, as the member for Hotham says he has done. I am fortunate that I have visited the area several times. I have toured the area with both the Regional Forester and the Secretary of the South East Alliance Conservation Group at separate times. I have taken numerous people to the region to let them judge for themselves what is happening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is happening down there is dynamic. Rejuvenated forests cover the landscape, not moonscapes. For a start, clear-felling is not used at Eden as the member for Hotham claims. There is an alternate coupe system. Under this system an area is logged-not clear-felled-leaving seed trees and other trees. The area is not logged again for 40 or 50 years. If Mr Kent had been there he would have known that. </PARA>
<PARA> He forgot to mention, or did not bother to find out, that nearly 50 per cent of the area will never be logged because it comprises a national park, nature reserve, or other designated area. He did not mention the wildlife corridors left between every coupe; the areas of known wildlife habitat that are left; the filter strips beside gullies and streams; and the use of cross banks to control erosion. Mr Kent has fallen for the old trick-a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. He knows all the right words; he cited Tantawangalo catchment, Egan peaks, and Coolangubra. They are all the current `in' words for the region. If he wanted to sound like an expert he should have mentioned the long-footed potoroo and the powerful owl. But I digress cynically. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue is important. I am pleased that not all members of the Labor Party are Luddites on the issue. The Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, has played a most proper role. He has worked on the basis of managed resources. That is what the Forestry Commission of New South Wales is all about-managing a resource for the maximum benefit of all, for the industry, for the environment. In an ideal world we may well be able to afford the luxury of a locked away resource as important as timber. Unfortunately, until we reach that place, we have to use what materials we can in the best way we can. That is just what is happening in the south-east forests. </PARA>
<PARA> I most certainly support the concept of plantations, as do Jim Collins and others. There is just one problem with that: there is not sufficient land available in the Eden area. The best land has been taken for farming, for grape growing, for dairies. If farmers living in that area are opposed to the logging of forests, let them offer their land for sale for plantations. I also happen to know that approaches have been made to these farmers to sell their land and they are not prepared to do so. So in the meantime, the Forestry Commission in New South Wales operates and manages with what resource it can. The Commission would be the first to admit that not everything in the past was done properly. It also would acknowledge that many of the reforms made to logging practice have been brought about by the pressure of the conservation movement and for that we should all be grateful. </PARA>
<PARA> We all do things better as we develop and get more experienced, and the New South Wales Forestry Department is no different. But I suggest that it is now the most efficient, most conservation minded of any forestry management in Australia. The management of the south-east forest is an example for the rest of Australia to follow. The two opposing groups each have the best interests of the forest at heart. Many of those involved in the conservation group-and I have met many-have excellent ideas and are not as rabid as the media portrays them. I am confident that it will not be too long before the more rational in both camps get together to resolve their differences. Meantime the ravings of the ill-informed people such as the honourable member for Hotham are doing no good at all. I am pleased that at least one of his colleagues the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, Mr Graeme Campbell, thought little of the arguments given by the member for Hotham and corrected him on numerous issues. Perhaps there is some hope for people taking part in the debate after his contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> The south-east forests are an important resource. The forestry industry in Australia employs some 13,000 people directly and another 90,000 indirectly. Our imports of timber currently stand at over $1.3 billion. With a current account deficit running at $18 billion, we need every resource possible to reduce our dependence on imports and expand our exports. The timber industry is one such industry. Forests are a renewable resource and, with the proper management that they are currently receiving from the New South Wales Forestry Commission, they will be with us for hundreds of years. In case there is a misconception, our current account deficit of $18 billion is the correct figure; $1.3 billion is the deficit on our timber imports every year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the Australian Legal Convention Mr Mark Weinberg said some things that I want to remark on now and I hope to be able to remark on them in more depth at a later date. Mr Mark Weinberg, a very prominent member of the Victorian Bar, was previously the Dean of the Law School at Melbourne University. He is a silk in Melbourne and is presently the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. I obtained what he said from the wire service that is available to us here in Parliament House. I do not have his full speech available to me and I hope to get that before I speak upon this matter again. He told the twenty-sixth Australian Legal Convention that there had been an explosion of quasi-judicial bodies, including the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), the National Crime Authority and the National Companies and Securities Commission. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>We need fewer investigative agencies. </PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA>We must avoid randomly handing out coercive quasi-judicial powers to those agencies that are established unless there is a clear overwhelming case for them. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to make the point that the ICAC's powers vastly exceed those of the police or even quasi-judicial bodies such as royal commissions and boards of inquiry. I think it is time that we, as a nation and as a Parliament, began to think seriously of the sorts of powers we give bodies to investigate corruption. Nobody wants corruption or crime in our society. I consider the statement made by Vice-Chancellor Sir J. C. Knight Bruce a great statement. Last century, in the case of Pearse v. Pearse, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Truth, like all other good things, may be loved unwisely- may be pursued too keenly, may cost too much. </PARA>
<PARA>I give as an example what is happening with the operations of the Independent Commission against Corruption in New South Wales. To illustrate what I mean, in referring to that body, I will look at some of the headlines that have appeared in the Sydney newspapers. One such headline states, `Wal: I want to clear my name'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Wal Murray came out fighting yesterday after evidence given to the Independent Commission against Corruption on Tuesday linking him with a bag man from the North Coast developers. </PARA>

He should never have been put in a position where he had to say, `I want to clear my name'. Senator McGauran might think that is all right, but it is wrong for people to be put in a position where they have to defend their names without any real evidence against them. An allegation was made against Mr Murray. His name was slandered and he had no opportunity to properly defend it. Senator McGauran comes into this chamber and says that that system is all right. He should not say that, no matter what he thinks.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To be fair to Senator McGauran, I think he has misunderstood what I have said; so I will leave him be. But if he has not misunderstood what I said, I am afraid that that illustrates exactly what I have been saying here tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said, it is desirable and it is in the public interest that corruption and crime be eliminated. But when people's names are put in newspaper headlines from which allegations can be made it is difficult to rebut those allegations in everybody's eyes. When mud is thrown it sticks and it is outrageous that that should happen. I think it is time that we, as a Parliament, took the same strong stand that Mr Mark Weinberg has taken. Mr Mark Weinberg has pulled us up as we should be pulled up. He has asked us to look at what we are doing in giving powers to these bodies and giving them the opportunity to run amuck; I do not say that they have. Looking at the headlines about politicians in the New South Wales newspapers over the last few weeks-it does not matter what party these politicians are from; in this case it was the National Party of Australia-that should never have happened. </PARA>
<PARA> I met Mr Wal Murray on one occasion, together with Senator Brownhill. From my meeting with him I can only say that he was a man of the utmost integrity and, as I understand it, he still is. The sorts of things that are run out by bodies such as the ICAC bring him, if not into disrepute, into a shadow from which he has to clear himself. It is therefore disappointing that the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act has been amended by inserting section 17k after section 17j. There is a defence of absolute privilege for the publication of anything that comes out of the Independent Commission Against Corruption. That means that whatever is said before this body and whatever is published is absolutely privileged. So anything can be said-just as anything can be said in this Senate-and run out against people. In my view it is outrageous that powers that have been given to the police and that have been established as a balance over the years should now be usurped and given to bodies that can force people to give evidence under oath against themselves, issue warrants and follow all sorts of extraordinary procedures which are not even available to royal commissions and jeopardise people's careers. Even if they do not ruin these people, in my view it is enough that they have jeopardised their careers. </PARA>
<PARA> I have taken this occasion-as I said earlier I hope to develop this further-to praise, with great respect, what Mr Mark Weinberg has said. I urge all parliamentarians to take careful note of what he has said and I hope to return to this subject at a later date when I have more time to develop the theme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to make some remarks about the situation that exists in Myanmar which was formerly Burma. In February this year I went privately to Myanmar on a week's visit organised by the Australian Embassy and, in particular, our ambassador, Chris Lamb. I understand that I was the first politician from any Western democracy to visit Burma since the coup took place in September last year that put the army in control and formed the Government of Burma called the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). The visit to Myanmar was certainly a major experience for me. It gave me an insight into how lucky we are in Australia to have democracy as we know it and how we take things for granted compared with what the ordinary people of Myanmar have now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since I returned I have kept a close interest in the events of that country. I have spoken to members of the local Burmese community, as they are still called here, and at a number of public meetings in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth as well as a public rally recently outside the Myanmar Embassy. The members of the local community here, which I understand is made up of nearly 30,000 people who either were born in that country or are first born in this country but still consider themselves as having very close connections with Myanmar, are very concerned about events that are occurring in their homeland, although they get very little information in Australia as a result of the lack of press freedom in Myanmar. </PARA>
<PARA> When I was there I was very impressed by the itinerary that the Australian Embassy arranged for me. I met all the major leaders of the SLORC and all the major leaders of the various opposition forces. I also met a whole range of students and ordinary citizens who had been involved in the various demonstrations that took place last year when the people demonstrated in favour of democracy. I also had the opportunity to travel from Rangoon-I think it is now called Yangon-to Mandalay. I travelled the romantic road to Mandalay and along the way was able to stop at many towns and speak to ordinary citizens. I would like to place on record my appreciation of the Australian Ambassador Chris Lamb. He is without doubt the best ambassador operating in Myanmar today. He has the widest range of contacts. It is certainly known in Bangkok amongst the foreign press correspondents that if one wants to find out anything that is going on in Myanmar the best person to contact is Chris Lamb. He has contacts with both the government and the major opposition figures. He also has a good understanding of the culture, history and politics of the country and has put that to good use. I do not think there has been any diplomat in Burma over the last two or three years who has done more to encourage the restoration of democracy and the holding of free and fair elections than Chris Lamb. He has put the Australian Government's case consistently to the Burmese authorities and, particularly in recent times, to the SLORC. </PARA>
<PARA> A book has recently been published which gives details of what happened at the major demonstrations in Burma last year. It was written by a correspondent in Bangkok, Bertil Lintner. The book is called Outrage-Burma's Struggle for Democracy. Bertil Lintner has followed events in Burma over many years and has been a critic of the present government in that country. The eyewitness accounts of the demonstrations last year in that country contained in his book are quite moving. We were all greatly moved in this country when we saw almost live on our television sets the demonstrations in China and the terrible massacre that took place in Tiananmen Square and elsewhere in early June of this year. Many people from Myanmar point out that even more terrible events took place in their country during several months of last year. The estimates of the people killed in demonstrations by the army, by the former regime, now run at between 4,000 and 5,000. The accounts that Bertil Lintner gives of the courage of unarmed citizens facing up to the army and in many cases sacrificing their lives are quite moving. I quote from a couple of those accounts from Bertil Lintner's book to put them on the record. The main demonstration last year was on 8 August. They have just had the first anniversary of that big demonstration. It is estimated that several million people went on general strike or went into the streets to demonstrate for democracy. I quote from the book:</PARA>
<PARA> A festive mood prevailed all day-and the army remained in the background at the intersections, protected by rings of students. Spontaneously, some demonstrators struck up the national anthem, the army song and shouted: `The Pyithu tatmadaw (people's army) is our army!' The soldiers were addressed as akogyi, or elder brother; there was a widespread belief that the soldiers would join the uprising and help overthrow the government. To show the soldiers that they would have to kill their own people if they didn't, some young demonstrators even walked up to the lines of troops, which were positioned here and there, unbuttoned their shirts and shouted: Shoot me if you dare!</PARA>
<PARA>The demonstration went on for much of the day all over Myanmar. I again quote from Bertil Lintner's book:</PARA>
<PARA> At 11.00 pm there were still thousands of people outside the Sule Pagoda. At 11.30, trucks loaded with troops roared out from behind the City Hall. These were followed by more trucks as well as Bren-carriers, their machine-guns pointed in front of them. Spontaneously, the demonstrators began singing the national anthem. Two pistol shots rang out-and then the sound of machine-gunfire reverberated in the dark between the buildings surrounding Bandoola Square. People fell in droves as they were hit. The streets turned red with blood as people `scattered screaming into alleys and doorways, stumbling over open gutters, crouching by walls and then, in a new wave of panic, running again,' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is an eyewitness account. That went on until three or four o'clock in the morning. Throughout this book are many accounts of similar indiscriminate shootings by the army, not only in Rangoon but elsewhere in Burma, during July, August and September, when it is estimated, as I say, that at least 4,000 people died. </PARA>
<PARA> I had the opportunity to meet many people who participated in those demonstrations. I was particularly impressed when meeting young students as young as 14 or 15 years of age from high school and university who had participated in these demonstrations. They all gave eyewitness accounts of seeing their friends shot in the streets. They all said that, if they themselves had not been arrested, their friends had been arrested. Those who had been arrested had been tortured, beaten up and held in terrible conditions for several months. An account that was most harrowing was of a young woman student who told how when she had been arrested she had been detained by the army and had been sexually assaulted by the soldiers once she had been imprisoned. That was not an unusual event for young women students to suffer. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, the now famous and leading opposition leader in Burma or Myanmar, Aung San Suu Kyi, returned to the country. Aung San Suu Kyi is 44 years of age and is the daughter of Burma's founding hero Aung San, who was assassinated in 1947 when Aung San Suu Kyi was only three years of age. He is still a hero and a revered figure in the country. She left Burma in 1960 with her mother. She was educated in England and worked overseas. She returned to Burma last year, coincidentally with the demonstrations, because her mother was ill and dying from a serious illness. When she was there she realised that she would have to play a role. The people saw her as a major figure. On 26 August last year a major rally was organised for her to speak to the people in Rangoon. I think that the account that Bertil Lintner gives of this meeting gives some idea of how Aung San Suu Kyi is supported by the people of Myanmar. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . on the afternoon of the 25th, thousands of people began gathering on the open ground to the west of the Shwe Dagon Pagoda. Some had brought their own bed rolls and entire families squatted in circles around their evening meals. They were all there well in time to get a good viewpoint for the meeting that had been announced for the following day: Aung San Suu Kyi was going to make her first public appearance. By mid-morning of the 26th, the crowd had swollen to at least 500,000 people of all ages, and national and social groups in Burmese society. </PARA>
<PARA>It was estimated that by the time the meeting took place there may have been well over one million people in the streets and parks surrounding the Shwe Dagon Pagoda. The account continues:</PARA>
<PARA> A huge portrait of her father, Aung San, had been placed above the stage alongside a resistance flag from World War II. Loud-speakers were directed towards the enormous crowd. Eventually, she arrived. Her car had to stop outside the meeting ground since there were so many people and she walked the remaining stretch up to the stage amid deafening applause and cheers. </PARA>
<PARA>Aung San Suu Kyi was introduced to the crowd and she asked the crowd to sit down and to listen to her speech. After an `initial message of democracy through unity and discipline', she then spoke on a more personal note. She is quoted in the book as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> A number of people are saying that since I've spent most of my life abroad and am married to a foreigner, I could not be familiar with the ramifications of this country's politics. I wish to speak very frankly and openly. It's true that I've lived abroad. It's also true that I'm married to a foreigner. But these facts have never, and will never, interfere with or lessen my love and devotion for my country by any measure or degree. People have been saying that I know nothing of Burmese politics. The trouble is I know too much. My family knows better than any how devious Burmese politics can be and how much my father had to suffer on this account. </PARA>
<PARA>Bertil Lintner's account continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Hundreds of thousands of people cheered and applauded and the roar reached its crescendo when she concluded: ``The present crisis is the concern of the entire nation. I could not, as my father's daughter, remain indifferent to all that was going on. This national crisis could in fact, be called the second struggle for independence.'' Most of the people who had come to see and hear her outside the Shwe Dagon had probably done so out of curiosity. But during her speech, the 43-year-old daughter of Burma's foremost hero won the hearts of her audience. She emerged as the leading voice for the opposition that demanded the restoration of democracy in the country. </PARA>
<PARA>An observer noted:</PARA>
<PARA> ``We were all surprised,'' ``Not only did she look like her father, she spoke like him also: short, concise and right to the point.''</PARA>
<PARA>I had the opportunity, during my visit to Myanmar, to meet Aung San Suu Kyi. She is a quite remarkable figure. I have had the opportunity, like many other senators over the years because of our involvement in politics, to meet around the world senior leaders. Aung San Suu Kyi would hold her own with any leader in the world. She certainly has the recognition because she is her father's daughter. By any calculation, she is an outstanding leader. In her presence she has what some people would call-that dreaded word-charisma. She has a fearsome intellect. Some people say that she does not tolerate fools too well. That may be so. But it is quite clear that she has a complete grasp of the problems of her country and the need to restore democracy and the need to establish free and fair elections in a multi-party system to get Myanmar back on the road to prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA> While I was in that country I also met other leaders of the opposition, such as the former Prime Minister U Nu, the leader of another opposition party, Aung Gyi, and a co-leader of the National League for Democracy with Aung San Suu Kyi, U Tin U. I also met, as I said earlier, members of the SLORC, the present government, and in particular General Saw Maung, who is the leader of the present government. When I met him he declared openly and fully that he was committed to the restoration of democracy in Myanmar and to the holding of free and fair elections. Without prompting, he said that Myanmar had to change and that the Burmese Socialist Program Party was at an end, that the Burmese way to socialism had not worked and that Myanmar had to enter into the rest of the world. When I spoke to him about a timetable for an election program, he finally conceded that by late this year or early next year there would be free and fair elections. He said it over and over again. </PARA>
<PARA> On my return from Myanmar I publicly reported those remarks. I was criticised in a number of quarters for being too susceptible to the blandishments of General Saw Maung. As I said at the time, I took what he said at face value. I said that his statements should be taken as a commitment and be publicised to further encourage the present regime to hold to its commitment to hold free and fair elections. </PARA>
<PARA> Since I left Myanmar there has been some progress in preparations for a free and fair election. The electoral commission has prepared a reasonable electoral law which has been discussed with the opposition parties. The commission has outlined the program leading to free and fair elections by no later than the beginning of May next year. But one has to say that recent events in Myanmar create more than some pessimism that this will actually occur. In recent weeks Aung San Suu Kyi and other leaders of the opposition parties have been arrested and detained without trial for their political activities. In particular, Aung San Suu Kyi has been detained in her home. For a while she was on a hunger strike in protest, because she believed that she should be detained in prison with all of the other National League for Democracy Party members who had been arrested-by some accounts this could run into hundreds across Myanmar. In my view, it is impossible for the rest of the world to conceive that there will be free and fair elections in Myanmar while Aung San Suu Kyi is detained. </PARA>
<PARA> I make a personal appeal, and I certainly appreciate the support of the Government of Australia and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) in issuing statements appealing for Aung San Suu Kyi to be released and for the restoration of human rights in Myanmar. We have asked that the restrictions on press freedom be lifted to allow free organising of political parties and so forth. Until those things are achieved, I do not think we can accept that there could be, or will be, free and fair elections by May of next year. </PARA>
<PARA> It is incumbent upon the present regime in Myanmar to start lifting these restrictions on human rights and political activity in the coming weeks and months so that its own public commitment and promise to the people of Myanmar that they will be able to have a free and fair election and a multi-party system can be upheld. If that is not done, one can only be pessimistic for the years ahead for the people of Myanmar. I have no doubt that if free and fair elections are not held the people will again go into the streets despite the fact that they would obviously run grave risks and there would obviously be a lot of bloodshed, given the events of last year. I suspect that many people in Myanmar are willing to make that sacrifice. If they do have to make that sacrifice, as appalling as it is, I think that we in Australia would commend their courage as they demand democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I wish to say that Myanmar is a country with enormous potential. It could, with a decent democratic government and decent economic policies, be the most prosperous country in all of south-east and south Asia. It is not overpopulated. It has enormous raw resources. It has active people who, if given half a chance, could make Myanmar the most prosperous country in all of south-east and south Asia. It is a country which, if it did have a democratic government and was able to improve the standard of living of its people with decent economic policies, would be a country with which we in Australia, I am sure, would be pleased to have close relations. We would find that amongst the Myanmarese people there are many characteristics that are similar to those of the Australian people. I found it an honour to be in Burma, to meet so many people who have so courageously demanded democracy, have suffered for it, and will continue to demand it. I only hope that we in Australia will do everything we can to help the people in Myanmar achieve their goal of democracy and free and fair elections. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday evening, Senator Panizza delivered an adjournment speech in which he described certain of the remarks that I had previously made in regard to child migrants as completely untrue. Unfortunately, Senator Panizza is indulging in wishful thinking because what I said is all true. Senator Panizza chose not to show me the courtesy of advance warning; so yesterday I heard only the latter part of his speech. But today I have the advantage of having read the first part in Hansard. Mrs Sheila Pearce, the President of the Child Migrant Friendship Society of Western Australia, telephoned me today after reading about Senator Panizza's speech in today's West Australian. Her distress was on a number of counts. As I stated yesterday, a lot of work has been going on behind the scenes to assist the former child migrants to trace their records and to recover from the suffering that they underwent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mrs Pearce is particularly concerned that Senator Panizza has raised the matter at this delicate stage of negotiations. If Senator Panizza has been in contact with the Christian Brothers, as he stated, he must surely know that the Catholic authorities with which Mrs Pearce and other members of the Child Migrant Friendship Society are in contact and the Society are working together to trace the records. Members of the Society were particularly requested by the authorities not to involve the media further at this stage. Mrs Pearce feels that Senator Panizza's speech last night has probably set them back some months. However, she has appealed to me to speak tonight to set the record straight. This is the reason that the child migrants have not dared to speak up publicly before. They were afraid that the denials of the authorities in earlier years would be repeated. Mrs Pearce reiterated to me today that she and other members of the society had previously approached Labor and Liberal members of Parliament in Western Australia, but these members were not willing to give them support. Senator Panizza in his speech certainly confirmed that situation. I now address some of the specific remarks that Senator Panizza made. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Contrary to Senator Jenkins's statement, the scheme was well known. </PARA>
<PARA>It certainly would have been well known to Senator Panizza at the time, as boys from Bindoon have worked on the Panizza family property. He is not the only Western Australian senator on whose family property they worked, but I chose not to allude to that because I had no reason to address any personal remarks. But Senator Panizza has forced my hand in this case. I am surprised that he did not mention it himself yesterday. The scheme was not particularly well known to other Australians present in Australia at the time; nor was it well known to many of the hundreds of thousands of others who were later migrants. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Panizza said that I stated that they were `transported like convicts'. In fact, I said that the scheme had been labelled `the last of the transportations', but even that phrase was in inverted commas as it was not mine. I used the phrases which had been used by people who described the events to me. I will quote now the words of Mrs Pearce herself. She said:</PARA>
<PARA> We were treated like convicts-taken from our mums and dads and shipped like cargo to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>John McGillion spent ten years at Bindoon from 1947. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> We, the young kids, built the place with our own hands-it was slave labor, doing things that men should have been doing. </PARA>
<PARA> We suffered plenty. We were treated cruelly. I saw boys being raped. </PARA>
<PARA>Lionel Welsh said:</PARA>
<PARA> We were flogged, nearly to death, by a strip of leather, or a fan belt or an axe handle. </PARA>
<PARA> Flogged! And we were only eight or nine or 10 or 11. </PARA>
<PARA> In every sense, we became twisted. Most of us have spent our entire lives trying to untwist. Our families have suffered terribly. </PARA>
<PARA>Joe Norman was also at Bindoon from 1947 to 1953. A newspaper report quotes him as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> `We were always underfed,' he said. `We used to go into the bush to find and eat goannas or blackboy bushes'. </PARA>
<PARA>The same article in the West Australian reports that Mrs Pearce's two brothers were sent to Bindoon. One brother was raped when he was only seven. He committed suicide 10 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Panizza objected to my phrase `interned in various institutions'. The Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act of 1946 reads:</PARA>
<PARA> An Act to make provision for and in connexion with the Guardianship of certain Children from outside Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 4 of that Act includes the following definition of `immigrant child':</PARA>
<PARA> . . . a person under the age of twenty-one years who comes to Australia as an immigrant otherwise than in the charge of, or for the purpose of living in Australia under the care of, any parent or relative of that person. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 6 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister shall be the guardian of the person of-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> . . . every immigrant child who arrives in Australia after the commencement of this Act, to the exclusion of the father and mother and every other guardian of the child, and shall have, as guardian, the same rights, powers, duties, obligations and liabilities as a natural guardian of the child would have, until the child reaches the age of twenty-one years or leaves Australia permanently, or until the provisions of this Act cease to apply to and in relation to the child, whichever first happens. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Regulations to that Act, it states:</PARA>
<PARA> If an immigrant child who-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) has absconded;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) has been unlawfully removed from the custody of his custodian; or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) has been, without the consent of the authority concerned, removed by his custodian outside the State in which the custodian is registered,</PARA>
<PARA>is found anywhere in Australia, any member of the Police Force of any State or Territory of the Commonwealth may apprehend the child, hold him in custody and return him to the authority of the State from which he absconded or was removed. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Panizza also said that it was untrue that the children were fingerprinted. I have it on authority from a number of the migrants that this was the case. That is on record also. Senator Panizza said that I was having a crack at various Catholic institutions. Nothing could be further from the truth. I worked for two years with nuns of the Ursuline Order and I have the greatest respect for them and other Catholic orders. I have not had and am not now having a crack at anybody. I am seeking to address a situation which is worrying a great number of former child migrants now that they are in their middle age. What the migrants want is stated in two main objectives: first, to trace their papers and their families; secondly, to have public acknowledgment that they were wronged. Senator Panizza has stated that he is willing to assist with the first objective, but has signalled that he will not assist with the second. Senator Panizza also stated that I had said that the records were burnt. I have read through my speech a few times and I cannot find a record of that in my speech, so he must have heard that elsewhere. Senator Panizza stated that I claimed that the children were used as slave labour, ill-treated and sexually abused. I believe that I have addressed that already. In my own speech I quoted from a Catholic newspaper, the Universe, which stated on 14 May 1989 in the United Kingdom in relation to the migrant children:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . they were treated as slaves in Canada and Australia where they were made to work for a pittance, enduring beatings, privation and sexual abuse. </PARA>
<PARA>Sexual assaults and cruel beatings are detailed and are on record. I also described how details of sexual assault were described in a separate article in the same paper, the Universe, but I deliberately chose not to describe details of a sensational nature. Senator Panizza can certainly have all of that information if he requires it. Senator Panizza stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the children were visited by officers on a very regular basis. It is unbelievable that 40 years have passed without any complaints about cruelty being lodged. </PARA>
<PARA>It is also on record that the realities of the situation of some of the institutions were not revealed to officers representing the Government. Descriptions of that are on record and Senator Panizza certainly can have those when he and I are back in Western Australia. They are in my office in Western Australia. I note that Senator Panizza was assured that all was well in a chance encounter that he had in a shoe shop in Perth. Senator Panizza chose to incorporate in Hansard an article which appeared in the Subiaco Post on 4 July this year with regard to St Joseph's Orphanage, Wembley. In that article a Mrs Dot Patterson is quoted as having stated:</PARA>
<PARA>I was brought up by the Sisters at the time the migrants were there and they were wonderful to me . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Mrs Pearce emphasised to me today that she wishes me to set the record straight. In a handwritten note that was faxed to me today she said:</PARA>
<PARA>Dot Patterson was not there in 1947, she left 10 years earlier so therefore is not able to speak on our behalf. And I was finger printed on my arrival in Australia . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In incorporating the Subiaco Post article of 4 July Senator Panizza neglected to mention that the newspaper allowed Mrs Pearce a right of reply the following week which rebuts much of the material in that article. I seek leave to incorporate the whole of the article of the Subiaco Post of 11 July in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The article read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>`No corpse kissing, but we worked like slaves'</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Children at St Joseph's Orphanage, Wembley, were worked like slaves, caned regularly and shown little kindness, according to two of those children. </PARA>
<PARA> They stole food to supplement their meagre diet and if they ran away there was a $40 price on their head for their return, to what they called the `black hole'. </PARA>
<PARA> Jennifer Eddy, of Woodlands, and Sheila Pearce, of Beckenham, spoke out last week after a report in last week's POST in which Wembley resident Dot Patterson said her days at the now closed orphanage were the best in her life.</PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Eddy, an Australian, and Mrs Pearce, who was shipped here as a nine-year-old child migrant from England in 1947, had very different memories.</PARA>
<PARA> `If I had to describe my time there in one word, it would be `hell',' Mrs Pearce said. </PARA>
<PARA>Nightshift</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> `We were slave labour, from being a brickie's labourer and carrying bricks away, to carrying those old four-gallon drums full of olives about half a kilometre to the crushing sheds. </PARA>
<PARA> `I was taken out of school at 13 and put on nightshift for two years, which was working from 6 p.m. to 7 a.m. looking after the babies in the nursery. </PARA>
<PARA> `After that, I had to work in the laundry until midday and then I was allowed to sleep until 5 p.m.'. </PARA>
<PARA> She also disagreed with Mrs Patterson's claims that the nuns took the children on picnics and went without so the children could have more. </PARA>
<PARA> `We had to steal food because we were all starving and couldn't eat the slops they gave us while they were eating hearty breakfasts of bacon, eggs and toast', she said. </PARA>
<PARA> `I don't remember any picnics except the orphans' Christmas picnic put on by the `Daily News', and even that was very degrading because we had to parade through the streets and everybody stared at us'. </PARA>
<PARA> But Mrs Pearce said it was only a small number of nuns who treated the children harshly. To the others she bears no malice. </PARA>
<PARA> ``You can never overcome what it was like, but you can learn to live with it,'' she said. </PARA>
<PARA> ``In later life I felt a bit sorry for those nuns, they were ill-equipped for the job, their way was set and suddenly all these kids were dumped on them. </PARA>
<PARA> ``I think life could've been a bit easier if they had shown some kindness, but there were some real sweeties who were kind. </PARA>
<PARA> ``Without them, I don't think we would have survived.''</PARA>
<PARA> Neither Mrs Pearce nor Mrs Eddy supported the earlier report in a daily paper that the nuns had locked a child in the room with a corpse because she wouldn't kiss it. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Pearce said a reporter had rung her to verify that and other claims made by other migrants about the nuns and she had said she couldn't verify that one. </PARA>
<PARA> She said the story had made it look as if she had. </PARA>
<PARA> ``I had never heard of that, all I know is we had to pay respect, which might only have been to file past the corpse, but even that as a child was terrifying,'' she said. </PARA>
<PARA> Research by the recently formed Child Migrant Friendship Society, of which Mrs Pearce is a founder, shows there were 12,335 migrant children sent to WA alone between 1928 and 1967. </PARA>
<PARA>Documents</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> All were housed in institutions and were under the care of the Department of Lands and Surveys until they were 16 and the Child Welfare took over, Mrs Pearce said. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of the task of that society is to help those children, now adults, trace their families, a task made difficult by the lack of documentation. </PARA>
<PARA> ``St Joseph's is the biggest offender there, there is not one document available from that place,'' she said. </PARA>
<PARA> ``If we could find them, we could try and find the families.''</PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Pearce said many of the migrants were now undergoing psychological treatment to come to terms with their transportation and institutionalisation.</PARA>
<PARA> ``When we came here, we were fingerprinted and we came with a 20-pound bounty on our heads,'' she said. </PARA>
<PARA> ``If we ran away, they gave 20 pounds to anyone who brought us back. </PARA>
<PARA> ``People say why bring this all up 40 years later, but no-one believed it at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> ``We are seeking government help to look after the survivors and we were asked to put a case of need, that is why it has come out now. </PARA>
<PARA> ``But now we have told our story, we just want to be left alone.''</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IH4">Senator JENKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Panizza is correct when he says that it was not the fault of the Australian institutions that children in the United Kingdom were orphaned and abandoned. I have certainly never suggested that. I have quoted liberally from material written by others which described how many unhappy and unfortunate children found no relief in the Australian orphanages in which they were placed. I quote from the West Australian of 29 June:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The British child migrant scheme was ``the most terrible child welfare practice'', according to the Department for Community Services. The department's assistant director, Mr Terry Simpson, said yesterday that all West Australians should be thankful the scheme no longer existed. </PARA>
<PARA> ``There is no doubt that some child migrants suffered terribly and are now encountering enormous problems,'' Mr Simpson said. </PARA>
<PARA> ``The department will do all it can to provide whatever assistance is required by the migrants and their families.'' The Child Migrant Friendship Society has received some money to help in the search for migrant birth and transport records. </PARA>
<PARA>The word used there is `transport'. I have only related information given to me directly and backed up by others, all from printed sources. Again I refute-as I did previously today-that I would use such an issue as a bandwagon for a Federal election. This unfortunately is a favourite gibe of the coalition senators and I suppose it fills a void if principles and policies are lacking. I do not challenge Senator Panizza's motivation. I have demonstrated that many of the statements made by him are not true. I presume he has acted in good faith, although it is a great shame that his words have now made a political plaything of the former child migrants. I hope that that situation can be rectified. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like very briefly to address another matter. Senator Crichton-Browne, on the pretext of making a personal explanation to the Senate this afternoon, took the opportunity to reflect adversely on the motives and the integrity of the Australian Democrats in Western Australia and the Party's parliamentarians. It is well known that I am the only Australian Democrat senator from Western Australia. He also reflected adversely on the public protest movement known as the Australian Mortgage Action Association. He stated correctly that he attended a meeting at South Perth where he addressed a public gathering. That was the inaugural meeting of the mortgage protest, held in April this year. The movement's founder, Mr Lachlan Irvine, is a member of the Australian Democrats and at the time was seeking party endorsement as a candidate for the mortgage belt seat of Stirling, where he resides. As it happens, Mr Irvine is also a senior member of the Vietnam Veterans Association. Both of these facts were clearly and unequivocally communicated to the news media before the Australian Mortgage Action Association was formed at the public meeting at which Senator Crichton-Browne spoke. It would be apparent that the honourable senator learned of Mr Irvine's application for endorsement from one of the newspapers or radio stations which announced that fact from information given to them by me. The proof of that fact is in my electorate newsletter, which is and was on that occasion circulated to all major Western Australian media. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne found it useful for his purpose to restate that fact from the public platform on Sunday, 9 April, when he was deputed to take the place of Senator Fred Chaney, the invited Liberal Party spokesperson. Senator Peter Walsh had also been invited to address the public meeting on behalf of the Government; however, he was unable either to attend or to appoint a deputy. </PARA>
<PARA> The nature of the relationship with the Australian Democrats was also fully and explicitly explained in my newsletter. The founders of the Australian Mortgage Action Association in particular will be greatly angered when they hear what Senator Crichton-Browne has said about them today-that they belong to a mere front movement for a political party. The Deputy President, Mr Philip Mayne, is not an Australian Democrat. If Senator Crichton-Browne cares to speak to his colleague in another place, the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), it can be confirmed that the chairperson for the meeting at Bunbury recently addressed by Mr Prosser, Senator Michael Beahan and me, amongst others, was at great pains to dissociate herself and the members of her group from any political party. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst always being willing to assist the mortgage action group, I have always made it clear that I thought mortgage action could only be weakened by having any party political affiliation. For that reason I have declined to become a member of that organisation. There are mortgage action groups all over Australia. Indeed, in Western Australia in rural areas a National Party member of parliament is a strong supporter. The Liberal State shadow Minister for housing spoke at a rally held recently in Perth. It is quite out of order for Senator Crichton-Browne to make these remarks. Certainly I can provide Senator Crichton-Browne with a list of the conveners of the mortgage action groups all over Australia. I can state quite categorically that these people belong to all the political parties represented in this Senate. Mr Lachlan Irvine, as an active member of the Vietnam Veterans Association, was a representative at a recent major remem- brance in the United States of America. Perhaps Senator Crichton-Browne will next impute that the Vietnam Veterans Association is also a front for the Democrats. I certainly have no intention of belittling Senator Crichton-Browne's knowledge of how front movements can be used in politics. When people came to South Perth to listen to the Liberal Party view, Senator Crichton-Browne told them that they must be living in fairyland if they believed, for a moment, that any government could take any action to bring down interest rates. Senator Crichton-Browne evoked an angry reaction from his audience, which he may remember, over that and several other utterances that afternoon, as he sought to justify the position taken by the Labor Government and the banks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been a courtesy traditionally extended to senators in the chamber by decent, responsible and polite senators, and that is that when they are about to attack other senators in the adjournment debate they ring them up and tell them so that they can hear it. I found out only because somebody else bothered to ring me up; so I have been denied, sadly, the full text of what Senator Jenkins said. But I will pick up the two points that I did hear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first is that I accepted the invitation to address the group in South Perth on behalf of Senator Chaney, who was unable to be there. There was no indication in the invitation, overtly or covertly, directly or indirectly, that it was extended on behalf of a front for the Australian Democrats. While I subsequently learnt that Lachlan Irvine was, as I understand it, an endorsed candidate for the Democrats, it certainly did not come from a Democrat newsletter. I have to say that I hope Senator Jenkins will not be too distressed to learn that I am not in the business of reading Democrats' newsletters. I learned that from a quite different source. I certainly did not hear Mr Lachlan Irvine stand up at the meeting he was chairing as a concerned citizen confessing that, in fact, he was a Democrat and a Democrat endorsed candidate. Of course, one would not expect that because he was seeking, as were the rest of the Democrats, to seduce the poor, unsuspecting public that he really did have a passion, a concern and compassion for those people who are struggling with high interest mortgage rates under this Government, which has been aided and abetted with most of its legislation by the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jenkins's party has, on a number of other occasions where there have been public meetings, claimed, as she did then, that I sought to defend the Government's high interest rates. Can anyone imagine anybody less likely, in Western Australia, to be defending the Labor Party than Noel Ashley Crichton-Browne? What I said was that the Democrats were living with the fairies if they imagined that the passing of legislation through the Senate, or through the House of Representatives, could reduce interest rates. Of course it cannot. The Democrats are no closer to God than am I. They have no mortgage on miracles. They know, if they have an ounce of commonsense or a fraction of decency, that they are cruelly casting a hoax upon the public of Australia when they purport to suggest that an Act of Parliament can, of itself, reduce the pain and suffering being inflicted upon these people by high interest rates. Of course it cannot, other than if that legislation were to appropriate billions of dollars of funds for the purpose of subsidising housing interest rates, it simply, at the end of the day, would reduce funds available for all other persons trying to get into their first home. It would reduce funds for those people seeking to obtain sufficient funds to put down a deposit. In other words, it has the effect of doing more damage to Australian people than if nothing were done. That is simple, basic arithmetic which my 11-year-old son understands. I am sure the Democrats understand it as well; but they think that by lying, cheating and deceiving the public they will get a few grubby votes. I have to say to the Democrats that the average voter out in the community is a bit smarter than that and, when the day of the election comes, it will be shown in the ballot boxes. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say to Senator Jenkins, through you, Mr President, that it does her no credit to mix with the liars in her party who continue to tell the stories she has told in this chamber this evening. She knows that I did not suggest that the Liberal Party was not capable of reducing interest rates. Quite the contrary. I said that the Democrats could not. All the Democrats do is make idle, irresponsible, irrational and quite improper promises that they never can and never will have to deliver because they will never be in government. In fact, Senator Jenkins will not be here after the election; nor will any of her colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no doubt that at the end of the day the discerning voters of Australia-not least, the informed voters of Western Australia-will understand the hoax the Democrats have tried to pull and will cast them ignominiously aside. The irresponsible, irrational economic policies the Democrats put up cause nothing but pain and suffering and raise false hopes in those people who are in desperate need of help. That help will come through macro-economic policies, not by some magic cure of the Democrats which can separate home loan interest repayments from the interest repayments of small business, large business, overdrafts, credit cards or any other form of credit. If Senator Jenkins does not understand that, I do not know why she bothers to stay here. I conclude by saying that every time I hear the Democrats telling lies I will get up and repeat what I am saying now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This has been somewhat of a schizophrenic debate tonight. I should, at the outset, acknowledge that there have been some sensitive contributions from both Senator Colston and Senator Jenkins, as well as Senator Schacht on Burma. I have been in this place for eight years and I never really thought that I would agree with Senator Crichton-Browne, but I think that most of what he has just said about magic cures for interest rates is something with which I can agree. I also agree with his point that one cannot distinguish home loan interest repayments from all the others. Maybe Senator Crichton-Browne will ask the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) to consider that when he looks at whatever policy he may be developing for the next election campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Brownhill made some points about Lewis Kent. I do not think anyone who knows Lewis Kent would ever doubt his long term commitment and sincerity on issues of the environment. I suppose that, if anything has made tonight's adjournment debate worth while-and after the last few contributions that is hard to accept-it is Senator Cooney's contribution. Every so often in this place one hears a speech which is committed to principle over politics. I think that tonight Senator Cooney upheld his long established reputation for being a person who is committed to principle over politics. It would have been very easy for him to join the attack on the practices of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC); it would have been very easy for him to attack Wal Murray; and it would have been very easy for him to ride with the punches. He demonstrated once more that he is a person who, for a long time, has held a very principled position in terms of people's rights-the rights of individuals-to the exclusion and disregard of immediate sordid political gestures. His contribution tonight was one in which he put civil rights first, and it was once again a demonstration of his persistent dedication to those issues. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Government there is not much of tonight's contribution that I have to pick up, except to make the point that if we are really concerned about expenditure then maybe some of the debate we heard tonight was probably not necessary. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator Tate</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes; Vinidex Tubemakers Pty Ltd acquired Humes Plastics' operation in Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia, while James Hardie Industries Ltd acquired Humes Plastics' operations in Queensland, New South Wales, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Vinidex and Hardie are unrelated companies that now have, in approximately equal shares, about 90% of the PVC pipe market.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I am not aware of any evidence suggesting that a price war in PVC pipes that would force efficient small producers out of business will develop as a result of the acquisition.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) In the absence of a breach of the Trade Practices Act 1974, competition between manufacturers of PVC pipe and between those manufacturers and manufacturers of substitute pipeline products made from copper, concrete, ferrous material and aluminium, is to the advantage of consumers.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Trade Practices Commission investigated the Vinidex/Hardie acquisitions and informed the parties on 19 June 1989 that it did not propose to intervene. Section 50 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 proscribes acquisitions resulting or likely to result in dominance in a substantial market for goods or services. The dominance test allows industry rationalisation without single company dominance of markets. The retention of that test was supported by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs in its report on the outcome of its inquiry into `Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies'. The Committee's report is currently under consideration by the Government.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="373" SPEAKER="Walsh Sen The Hon P.A." NAMEID="TJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) It is true that DSH loan repayments made to Westpac now attract Financial Institutions Duty (FID) and, where appropriate, Bank Accounts Debits (BAD) taxes. However, these charges need to be kept in perspective.</PARA>
<PARA> Currently, FID-which is levied by the State Governments, not the Commonwealth-is about 3 cents per $100. This adds about $16 to the total repayments on a DSH loan of $25,000 over 25 years.</PARA>
<PARA> BAD taxes are payable only on debits to excess credits held by Westpac and are about 15 cents for a cheque of up to $100.</PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, all DSH clients are now able to earn significantly higher interest on so called excess credits deposited with Westpac-up from 3.75 per cent p.a. to an average of 6.85 per cent p.a. The average holding of excess credits was $225 per client, implying an annual benefit of $7 (or $175 over 25 years, excluding interest on reinvested earnings).</PARA>
<PARA> For new DSH clients, the new arrangements also mean the elimination of the former waiting period for DSH loans, the ability freely to transfer a loan to another dwelling and improved access to additional financial assistance from Westpac on first mortgage terms.</PARA>
<PARA> Moreover basic monthly mortgage repayments, interest rates and access to ancillary benefits, such as widows' relief and insurance, have all been preserved under the new arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the Government has honoured its undertaking.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The agreement with Westpac does not allow Westpac to charge any fee or penalty interest for early discharge of a loan originally made by the Defence Service Homes Corporation. Westpac may, however, impose normal bank charges, on a non-discriminatory basis, for any specific services requested by DSH clients, such as arranging the registration of documents at the Titles Office.</PARA>
<PARA> The basic loan establishment fee charged by Westpac is higher than that previously charged by the Defence Service Homes Corporation. Nevertheless Westpac's fees are only about one-tenth of what were common total establishment costs under the old DSH arrangements, when proper account is taken of the cost of bridging finance during the waiting period and the need to arrange additional finance on second mortgage terms. The latter costs have been obviated under the new arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> Again, these arrangements more than fulfil the commitment given by the Government that the overall loan terms and conditions now applied by Westpac would be no less favourable than they were under the old DSH scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In general, I am confident that Ministers respond diligently and quickly to correspondence from electors. In situations where it has been brought to my, or my Department's attention, that an elector has not received a reply, officers of my Department would investigate the reason for delay and advise the elector. However, experience has shown that avoidable delays occur infrequently. Where long delays occur, it is usually because a number of matters are raised in the one letter and the reply needs to be considered in various sections of the Minister's Department.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I am advised that the matter to which you refer was a recommendation of the Efficiency Scrutiny on the Handling of Ministerial Correspondence. The Report from this scrutiny recommended that, as a measure that would reduce administrative costs without undue impact on correspondents, departments discontinue sending routine acknowledgements. The receipt of correspondence would then be acknowledged only where a timely reply cannot be provided.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) and (b) Correspondence addressed to the Prime Minister is recorded on a computerised tracking system which can identify the progress of an inquirer's correspondence and the preparation of a reply. Other Departments have tracking systems, either manual or computerised, to ensure that correspondence is handled quickly and efficiently.</PARA>
