<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth, that:</PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned about the increase in violent television programmes for children and particularly those programmes promoting violent toys that are available for sale in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray;</PARA>
<PARA> That you support the Broadcasting (Prohibition of Violent Programmes for Children) Act 1988 which has been presented by WA Independent Senator for Nuclear Disarmament, Jo Vallentine. This act aims to prohibit the broadcasting of children's TV programmes that are violent and that promote toys modelled on characters, weapons or other war accessories which are also available for sale in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA> 1. The decision to change to the UHF transmission in 1993 should not be made compulsory in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. That VHF airwaves in Tasmania are not overcrowded, unlike Mainland Australia.</PARA>

<PARA> That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I present to the Senate a petition from 201 petitioners, which is not in conformity with the Standing Orders as it is not in the correct form, requesting that the possibility of linking Kings Avenue and Northcott Drive in the Australian Capital Territory be considered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We, the undersigned, note with concern that the Department of Defence wants to seal off two public roads to make Russell Offices ``more secure''. Recent comments attributed to the NCPA's director of urban design, Mr Brian Binning, would suggest that he is in favour of this. In particular, Mr Binning claims that Kelliher Drive ``is mainly used to get to a 300-car gravel carpark . . . and as a shortcut to Northcott Drive''. In fact, Northcott Drive is a logical extension of Kings Avenue which presently ends abruptly at Russell Drive near the Australian American Memorial. Furthermore, Northcott Drive is the main approach road for those members of the community who live in the southern suburbs and are employed at the Campbell Offices or the Australian Defence Force Academy. We, the undersigned, ask that serious consideration be given to the possibility of linking King's Avenue and Northcott Drive via traffic lanes passing either side of the Australian American Memorial.</PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate my second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President,</PARA>
<PARA> It is with pleasure that I introduce the Smoking and Tobacco Products Advertisements (Prohibition) Bill 1989. The Bill represents a major opportunity for the Federal Parliament to contribute to the improved health of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> Each year in Australia more than 17,000 lives are lost through tobacco-related illnesses. An even larger number of people are severely incapacitated and the cost to the community in providing medical care is enormous. Cigarette smoking is clearly our number one health problem. Governments at both Federal and State levels are doing excellent work in encouraging present smokers to quit. It is estimated that 2.5 million Australians are ex-smokers. </PARA>
<PARA> However, at the same time as smokers are either quitting or dying, many younger Australians are replacing them. Smoking rates among young people, particularly teenage girls, are high and in some age groups still increasing. Approximately 90% of smokers begin before the age of 20. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation is very clearly a result of cigarette advertising which is aimed at young people and attempts to link smoking with social success, health, wealth and sporting prowess. </PARA>
<PARA> This is recognised by all leading health authorities in Australia and by the World Health Organisation. Bodies such as the National Heart Foundation, the Australian Cancer Society, the Australian Medical Association and the Alcohol and Drug Foundation, all have policies advocating a total ban on cigarette advertising. Governments have also recognised this. In 1976, the Federal Government introduced a ban on cigarette advertising on the electronic media-radio and television. In recent years, both the Victorian and South Australian State governments have restricted most other forms of cigarette advertising including billboards, cinema and shop front advertisements. At the end of the last session of the Federal Parliament, a report titled Drugs, Crime and Society, by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, recommended a total ban on all forms of cigarette advertising. This was a unanimous recommendation across all four political parties. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the Smoking and Tobacco Products Advertisements (Prohibition) Bill 1989 will be to end cigarette advertising in the print media. This can only be addressed at a Federal level. In other areas of advertising, this Bill brings all States in line with Victoria and South Australia. As was the case with the Victorian and South Australian legislation, time will be given for industry to comply. In the case of the outdoor advertising industry, existing long term contracts will be able to run their course up until 1 July 1991-the same date as the Victorian and South Australian legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> When the legislation passed the Victorian and South Australian parliaments, it received the support of both Labor and Liberal parties and I am confident that that support will exist for this Bill. Certainly the National Crime Authority Committee report illustrates a breadth of opinion in the Parliament in support of an advertising ban. The Minister for Community Services and Health is also on record as supporting such a move. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly the Australian Community overwhelmingly favours a ban on all forms of cigarette advertising. A Morgan poll of 2,251 Victorians in October/November 1988 showed 63.7% approval, 28.9% disapproval and 7.4% do not know, on the question of an advertising ban. A clear majority of smokers also favoured a ban. </PARA>
<PARA> This illustrates a willingness on the part of most Australians to give our young people an environment free from the deceptive images created by cigarette advertising. If this legislation passes the Parliament in the coming weeks, it will be looked on as a significant step in reducing the social cost of smoking. If this Bill fails, the medical community, parents' organisations, churches and individual voters, will condemn those who have voted to protect the interests of the tobacco companies, at the cost of our children's health. </PARA>
<PARA>I sincerely hope this does not occur. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate for the courtesy it showed me yesterday in enabling this debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill 1989 to be continued today so that I could make a very brief contribution to it. We have had a reasonably long second reading debate on the Government's proposals to establish an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). There will, of course, be a very long debate at the committee stage. We also face another second reading debate on some of the subsidiary legislation which relates to the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In thinking about this second reading debate, I was struck by the amount of heat and, I suppose, rancour that there has been in the debate on Aboriginal affairs over this last year. I do not wish to repeat the very many harsh things which I and other Opposition senators have had to say over that period. I do not in any sense step back from those things, because I think all of them were warranted. But in a brief contribution to the debate on this Bill, I want to focus on the task which we have in hand and the concerns which I think are broadly shared around the chamber in respect of the need to do a better job in Aboriginal affairs than we have managed over recent years and, perhaps, over the last 200 years. </PARA>
<PARA> I think a number of honourable senators have made very interesting and useful contributions to the debate. Whilst I do not agree with the support which Senator McKiernan, for example, gave to the legislation, I in general support the summary which was contained in his speech of the reasons why we should be concerned. Senator McKiernan quoted the statistics which I think are fairly well known to honourable senators and which certainly were mentioned by a number of them. </PARA>
<PARA> We have with respect to our Aboriginal Australians a pretty depressing situation in terms of the social statistics which would normally be taken to indicate the welfare or lack of welfare of the particular part of the community. As Senator McKiernan pointed out, Aboriginal people make up something under 2 per cent of the population; they have an average life expectancy of 15 to 20 years less than that for other Australians; they have a very high incidence of communicable diseases such as hepatitis B, diabetes, heart attacks and so on; their unemployment is six times the national average; their incomes in general are very low; and many families live in substandard housing or in temporary shelter. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the situation with respect to the law we find that imprisonment rates, which were referred to by Senator Peter Baume who led for the Opposition on this Bill, are 14 times higher than those of other Australians. In a sense, it is not necessary to quote those statistics again, Mr Acting Deputy President, but it is worth doing so as a reminder of why there is such widespread interest and concern in the Senate about the situation of Aboriginal Australians. It would also, I think, be unfair not to mention the fact that there are many Aboriginal Australians who are not in that predicament and who are very much in control of their own lives. They are independent, self-sustaining members of the Australian community who have achieved a level of welfare and personal well-being which would be our objective for the whole of the Australian community and the whole of the Aboriginal community. There is, of course, a danger in this focus on the negatives of the Aboriginal community that we could lose sight of the successes who, after all, are important because they remind us of what can be achieved by Aboriginal people within the Australian community now. It is a reminder that our goal is for all Australians, including Australian Aboriginals, to achieve the same levels of welfare and well-being. </PARA>
<PARA> The common concerns of the chamber about Aboriginal affairs are not new. The enormous upsurge in activity in this area actually started with the Gorton Government with education answers, the McMahon Government with the first purchase of land and the Whitlam Government with the establishment of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA). The first Minister for Aboriginal Affairs was appointed under the previous coalition Government. There was bipartisan support for the purchase of land, bipartisan support for Aboriginal land rights legislation in the Northern Territory and so on. One can point to a great deal of activity and, of necessity, a great deal of experimentation. The point I wanted to make in the debate on this Bill is that one of the most consistent common points of policy since that period in the 1970s has been the view that, under one name or another, governments should be encouraging Aboriginal people to take control of their own lives. This is sometimes called self-management, sometimes self-determination. I think the latter phrase is dangerous because it can have political connotations which have nothing to do with the social advancement that we are concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last 15 or more years successive governments have provided substantial funds to enable Aboriginal people to run communities and organisations, whether they are legal services, community stores, community councils, or town services operations. A huge range of activities has been funded by the Commonwealth and controlled by Aboriginals themselves on the basis that what successive governments have believed is that by allowing Aboriginal people to have control over their own lives they will assume responsibility more easily, make choices which suit them, and we will avoid the mistakes of the past through that process. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there is still a great deal of bipartisan support for that broad theoretical approach. But it has been my concern-and it is not a recent concern since the time of the Labor Government; it is a concern I had when I first became Minister for Aboriginal Affairs at the end of 1978-that in the pursuit of self-management and Aboriginal independence, and by Aboriginal independence I stress that I mean personal independence and community independence, not political independence, we have chosen to put the most extraordinary burdens on Aboriginal communities, often guaranteeing the failure of both community efforts and individual efforts. </PARA>
<PARA> When I read the contribution of Senator Coulter to the debate I was interested to note that he referred to this goal. He used the expression `self-determination'. On page 254 of the Senate Hansard Senator Coulter talked about the fact that the goals must not be merely material. They must not be merely better health, better housing and the sorts of things Senator McKiernan had referred to because they could be achieved in an autocratic way, a directed way. Let me quote him exactly. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> One could say to Aboriginal people: `You will be healthy whether you like it or not. We will control your water supply. We will control the nutrition that you get. We will control the houses that you live in'. This legislation is not just about outcomes in that sense. It is about processes and about those outcomes coming about through Aboriginal people taking control of their own destiny and determining such things as water supply, the sorts of health services, educational processes, housing and so on, that they want. </PARA>
<PARA>I totally understand what Senator Coulter is saying. But I want to put a view which is not contrary to the spirit of that comment of Senator Coulter's but which raises, I think, the practical implications of what Senator Coulter is saying and what we have done. By `we' I mean Liberal and National Party governments as well as the Labor Government. We have put many Aboriginal communities in the quite extraordinary situation where we say to them `If you want clean water you have to organise it. If you want electric power you have to organise it. If you want housing you have to organise it. If you want rubbish collection service you have to organise it'. And so it goes. One finds remote and ill-equipped Aboriginal communities carrying the complete responsibility for the provision of what the rest of Australia regards as basic provided services. It may well be that there is some value for an Aboriginal community to undertake that responsibility, to create employment in the community, to create that sense of responsibility, but I suggest to the Senate that we put an enormous burden on Aboriginals which we do not put on people who have much greater economic, educational and material advantages. </PARA>
<PARA> I live in the suburb of Claremont, a middle-class suburb of Perth. I do not have to worry about my water supply, my rubbish collection, the cleaning of the streets, the electricity supply. All of those things are handled by other people. I pay rates-very high rates from time to time-but it is all done for me. I, in common with suburban Australia generally and indeed Australia generally, exercise my self-management by having a much narrower range of responsibilities. I have to get myself out of bed in the morning. I have to make sure that I get to work on time. I have a very limited range of things for which I personally am responsible. Perhaps I vote for my local government council, which has responsibility for some of those things. I certainly have to vote in State and Federal elections, which ensure that great bureaucracies exist to provide these other services. My simple point is that in the name of advancing what is an acceptable social theory of giving people responsibility so they will exercise responsibility and take control of their lives, we forget the complexity of burdens that we put on those communities and those individuals. If an Aboriginal family has little background in education, in employment or in living in a Western-style community, an Australian-style community, and we say to them, `You must not only learn the habits of the orderly use of time, of getting to work, of getting your children to school, and of supervising your children at school'-the myriad tasks which make up the areas of self-control we have over our lives-`but you must also be responsible for making sure that your rubbish is collected, that the electricity system works, that the pump works and all of these other things', it is my view that in many cases a gross overburden is placed on these people. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that when I took over the portfolio in 1978 there were massive breakdowns of self-management. There were communities in chaos. As I dot around Australia now and visit communities I find the same thing. I went to Red Hill the other day, a place I saw in 1979 as a hopeful experiment of the new way. I was back there at the beginning of 1988 and I found a disgusting mess. One could go on multiplying examples. I have visited Yuendumu, Papunya and many other places and found indescribable tension and stress-and often, disorder. The truth is that we have grossly overloaded many Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Parliament of this Commonwealth has found something to be true, something Senator Coulter referred to, that is that we can impose these things. After all, the Schools Commission found that the best educational outcomes for Aboriginal people were in the State which was administered in a relatively authoritarian way-Queensland. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs found that the best environmental health conditions were in Queensland. I have never supported the directive, authoritarian approach of the Queensland department. I think that the recently resigned Minister, Mr Bob Katter, did a remarkable job in giving the Aboriginal people of Queensland a better deal under the present State Administration. I pay tribute to his efforts. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to be distracted from my core point, which is that in trying as a parliament to come to grips with the significant problems of Aboriginal people, it is our duty to ask: What have we learned from the last 15 to 20 years? What have we learned from the billions of dollars of expenditure and from the efforts which have been made by all of us to come to grips with the difficulties of Aboriginal Australians? Surely, we must learn from our mistakes as well as from the positives. </PARA>
<PARA> I would say that there are enough examples of the difficulties of putting self-management on such a broad basis, the sort of basis that was put to me when I met Mr Pat Dodson, for example-one of the favoured administrators of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand). When I talked to Mr Dodson about how he saw things working, he had this romantic ideal of Aboriginals doing everything for themselves. I do not think that is an unfair summary of what he was putting to me. I put the simple view that that is nonsense. It is grossly unfair to the Aboriginal people and will not work. In a sense, that is my own fundamental reservation about the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), because it fails to take into account what has been shown to work as against what has been shown to create often insuperable difficulties for Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said in this debate, and said very fairly, that Aboriginal people have been encouraged to use democratic processes by the previous Government and the present Government. That is true and I do not think there is any avoiding that. But let me focus on what it seems to me were some of the promising areas of progress over recent years. Let me focus on examples which are certainly bipartisan because one of the best examples of what I want to talk about is headed up by a Labor member of parliament from Bathurst Island, Mr Stan Tipiloura. He is the brother-in-law of Senator Bob Collins, so Senator Collins knows him well and I met him in the company of Senator Collins. </PARA>
<PARA> The gentleman concerned is the chairman of his local community council, a democratically elected body. It is typical of the bodies which have been established in the Northern Territory which give community control over what are essentially local government functions. What I think has been developed in the Northern Territory is a pattern that we should have been considering as the potentially new wave pattern for us to adopt: democratic control within a local government framework which provided for accountability. What has gone wrong with self-management very often is that the accountability processes do not work. </PARA>
<PARA> Essentially we have had two areas of accountability: a large amount of taxpayers' money is handed to a community and the people who administer the money are accountable to the community because they are elected and they are accountable to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs because it controls the purse strings. That has proved to be an effective system of accountability in some cases but not in others. In far too many cases it has not been effective.</PARA>
<PARA> What the local government model developed by the Northern Territory did was to provide an accountability upwards as well as an accountability downwards and it is a nice non-racist system. It is non-racist because it adopts procedures which are common to the whole of Australia. If, for example, a local government council which is administered by some of your colleagues, Mr Acting Deputy President, in the Labor Party of New South Wales proves to be dishonest or incompetent, then the Government steps in and appoints an administrator. There is a local government Act which puts a whole lot of duties and obligations upon the elected officers. The shire clerk has a series of statutory obligations. He is accountable up as well as to the democratic process. From my own examination of what has been happening in the Northern Territory I think that that has provided the real seed of a working system for many Aboriginal communities. You have the democratic control of the people who can elect a council but the officials are not at the whim of people who are subject to all sorts of family and other pressures. They not only have their duty to the elected councillors; they have their statutory duty to ensure that the administration is honest and orderly and according to established processes. </PARA>
<PARA> I would say to people like Senator Coulter, whose sincerity in these matters I have never I hope in any way impugned, or to Senator Collins, whose sincerity in these matters I would never impugn, that this seems to be the pattern which we should pursue because unless you have effective accountability, you get disorder. You do not get the sort of social progress for Aboriginal people that we are pursuing out of chaos. I have visited Wiluna often, and I have found a community in disorder. I have not had an opportunity to visit Balgo for some time, but I am assured by many people it is in total disorder and there is now a working party of officials from governments and agencies desperately trying to bring order into Balgo. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to Senator Coulter and I say to the Government that is promoting ATSIC: no good can come out of this chaos. The children will not go to school; they will not be educated. The community's health will suffer; they will die if the water is not properly supplied, the sewage is not dealt with and the rubbish is not collected. It is not fair to the next generation to have them brought up in disorder because they are then condemned. </PARA>
<PARA> A few visits ago to the Northern Territory, I was talking to two distinguished Aboriginal people. One was Senator Collins's brother-in-law, whom I have mentioned and whom I greatly respect, and the other was Mr Wesley Lanhupuy, who is well known, I am sure, to Senator Peter Baume and others who have taken an interest, and who is now a Labor member of the Legislative Assembly in the Northern Territory. In my discussions with Wesley Lanhupuy, I particularly recall asking: `Where is the next generation of leaders coming from? Where are the Yunupingus and the Lanhupuys and the other brilliant Aboriginal leaders coming from?'. I suspect that the disorder of recent years is condemning the Aboriginal people to having an unproductive generation. We really have a situation where we are refusing to learn from what has worked and we are chasing theories without regard to what has been demonstrated not to work. That is the core of my personal concern about what the Government is doing. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken very harshly in this chamber of the efforts of Minister Hand. I understand that in private he has more than repaid me in kind, and in public he has certainly repaid me in kind. I have spoken harshly of the ministry of his predecessor, Clyde Holding. I have used words against them that I have not used, for example, against Minister Howe, who has administered a portfolio I had when in government; and I would not speak harshly of him because I think he has conscientiously applied himself to the task. But in Aboriginal affairs, the Government has unfortunately applied itself to romance, to theory, to totems and to self-indulgence. We have not seen from the Government a focus on what is happening to Aboriginal people in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA> What is happening in too many cases is not good, not right, not fair, not proper and not just; it is grossly wrong. ATSIC represents an enormous risk that the grossest errors will be repeated over and over again. The strange proposal of 1,200 elected councillors, these regional organisations, and at the same time this very great authority left with the Minister but this extraordinary responsibility vested back to regional councils is a formula which will almost certainly produce a repeat of the disorder which has blighted the lives of so many Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> My concerns are essentially practical. They are no different from the concerns that I expressed to DAA officers on my first visit to Alice Springs during the first month of 1979. Is what we are doing working? How do we explain the Papunyas and the other places where there has been so much disorder? Amoonjama is a sharp example of the disorder that flowed from the social theorising of 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, the real problem with ATSIC is that it will produce change for the sake of change, change for the sake of theory, and will not produce the practical, on-the-ground results that the Aboriginal people are entitled to demand. I am very, very sorry that the Government has not been prepared to consult more fully with the Aboriginal people in the way that the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs demonstrated was required. I am even more sorry that the Government has refused to focus on the practical problems which face Aboriginal Australians and has refused to listen to people like its own Aboriginal members of parliament in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it has refused to listen to people like Bob Collins, whom I first saw working with the Aboriginal community on Elcho Island many years ago, and I have had a great respect for his capacity to communicate with the Aboriginal people, and his understanding of his Aboriginal constituents from that time. I do not believe that what is happening now represents the ordered and sensible views of those members of the Labor Party who know something about this subject. This is theory gone mad. This is why so often Ministers of the Left of the Labor Party are a disaster. This is a tragedy for the Aboriginal people. Let me say in closing that nothing will bring me greater pleasure, should this legislation be passed, if I am proved to be wrong, but, unfortunately, I do not expect that to happen. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, in closing the second reading debate in relation to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill 1989, I think it is essential that we focus our eyes very clearly on the real object of our concern and the reason for this legislation being brought before the Parliament, and that is the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people-the communities that live within our wider Australian community. I do not think there is any argument with the view that those descendants of the original inhabitants of this continent and the surrounding islands are a particularly depressed and deprived sector within our Australian community. All the indications, social indicators, health indicators and so on, which are put together in relation to Australians, indicate that it is the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who are particularly at risk and particularly vulnerable, and who have succumbed to that risk and that vulnerability in relation to their situation, both in a simple physical sense and in the social, cultural and economic sense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been said before, but I would like to put on the record the fact that for Aborigines the average life expectancy at birth is 15 to 20 years less than for other Australians; that Aboriginal infant mortality, while improving, is still nearly three times that for non-Aboriginal Australians; that Aboriginal people suffer from a higher incidence of both communicable diseases such as hepatitis B and lifestyle diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. Aboriginal unemployment is six times the national average. On average Aboriginals earn only half the income of other Australians. A large proportion of Aboriginal families live in substandard housing or temporary shelter. One could go on and on about the situation in which Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders find themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the current reality. When an Australian government or an Australian parliament is considering the programs which ought to be put in place and the way in which those programs ought to be devised and delivered quite clearly there is a very heavy obligation upon us in relation to this particularly disadvantaged group within our society. That is not because of some mistaken assumption of guilt for what might have been done in the distant, or even not so distant, past, as colonisation, as the movement of people, particularly from European societies, into this continent took place. I am not referring to any of the claims that one is trying to assuage some sort of inherited guilt in relation to those matters; I am talking about the consequences of the dispossession, the dispersal of Aboriginal people and the disruption of their culture which has led to the present realities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the current and present realities, as outlined, which I refer to and which, as I say, need to be kept in focus as the matters which at the end of the day need to be improved by whatever machinery is put into place. To an extent, therefore, of course one agrees with Senator Peter Baume and others who have said that one of the tests-I think they indicate that it is the primary test-in relation to the sort of machinery that is put in place will be the effect that it has over a period of time on the sorts of social and other indicators which I have outlined. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also very important to indicate that the process, as Senator Coulter put it, is as important in many ways as the outcomes. Of course, decent housing, proper supplies of fresh water, adequate systems for the disposal of sewage, education for youngsters and continuing health care, particularly for mothers with small infants, are absolute life imperatives as far as those communities are concerned. But as has been pointed out-I think Senator Chaney in his remarks made this point-an authoritarian, autocratic or paternalistic imposition of methods by which those better outcomes might be achieved is not a way in which Australian society can operate. </PARA>
<PARA> One needs to try to encourage the participation of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in devising programs and in indicating those areas where the rest of the Australian community might, by its expertise, assist them. Therefore, I found it a little difficult to follow some of Senator Chaney's remarks about the horrendous burdens that might be placed on Aboriginal communities in relation to the way in which the Bill will operate. I think he indicated, in some of his remarks, that they would be virtually solely responsible for their individual and community well-being. There is no indication under this arrangement that such an onerous burden will be placed on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. They are not to be solely responsible for their physical, individual, social, communal, economic well-being. They are and will remain part of the Australian community. Indeed, when one looks at the objectives set out in the Bill, one finds that object (d) of the `Objects' clause states:</PARA>
<PARA> to ensure co-ordination in the formulation and implementation of policies affecting Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders by the Commonwealth, State, Territory and local governments, without detracting from the responsibilities of State, Territory and local governments to provide services to their Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander residents. </PARA>
<PARA>That matter needs to be emphasised in relation to what apparently may have been put to Senator Chaney by some representatives of the Aboriginal people, including, according to Senator Chaney, Pat Dodson. Senator Chaney outlined the view to the Senate, and characterised it as somewhat romantic, that the Aboriginal people should take sole responsibility for the provision of the services and other matters which are required for their individual and community sustenance and life. Even if it is true that Pat Dodson expressed that view-and I do not know that it is-the Government is not putting that point of view. The Government is emphasising cooperation and continuing responsibility in respect of the Australian Government and Parliament, State governments and parliaments, and local governments, as well as community organisations within the Australian community. Those responsibilities cannot be shirked; they still remain. This is in the legislation and it is the intention of the Government that ATSIC arrangements should operate in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, outcomes are obviously going to be terribly important. During the second reading debate, Senator Coulter made this point:</PARA>
<PARA> Surely the process should involve more Aboriginal participation, determination and self-management. That is what this legislation is about. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is right. We do not want to get caught up in slogans or labels. But quite clearly, in all this, as has been constantly the case in Aboriginal affairs in Australia, there is a difficult tension between the self-management principle and the accountability principle. Senator Chaney in his term as Minister and in introducing the Aboriginal Development Commission legislation made a judgment as to what should be the balance between self-management and account- ability. Over the last year at least-perhaps the last year and a half-we have had constant, hour after hour, day after day, week after week debates and processes, particularly within the Senate Estimates committees and in this chamber, trying to get that balance correct between accountability and the important process of restoring to Aboriginal persons and communities self-esteem, dignity and so on, which comes from making decisions which can influence the shape of their own future. </PARA>
<PARA> That balance is about to be radically altered-I do not think that is an improper term in this debate-by the ATSIC proposal. It is not a proposal which, I think Senator Boswell said, would centralise power in Canberra. That is not the object and I do not think a fair reading of the proposal would lead to that conclusion. The fact is that at the moment we have a proposal before the chamber whereby the Commission itself will be constituted by 20 members, 17 of whom will be elected by representatives of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I believe that that in itself will provide a very good and effective safeguard against the sort of centralisation of power here in Canberra, which Senator Boswell was concerned about. It is certainly different from the situation, and I think the honourable senator would agree, where you have a Minister in charge of a department and then, in relation to the present ADC, being able to appoint, as we know through the traumas of 12 months ago, a majority of members to that ADC. </PARA>
<PARA> Here we have a situation where the Commission will in fact be put into place by the vote expressing the will of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in their various communities around Australia. These determinations as to the way in which funds should flow back to the various areas of Australia where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are found will be largely based, as we know, on the recommendations of the regional councils. Those regional councils themselves will quite clearly have a very important role in the operation of this legislation. </PARA>

He cannot do it by some sort of executive action which is not subject to scrutiny; it has to be brought into this Parliament. I think that that is an important protection for the regional councils' functions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In preparing its plans for the development of the communities within a regional council's particular region, the cooperative element still has to be emphasised because the council will be working with other programs which are provided by ATSIC and will be, of course, dealing with other bodies-both community bodies and local and State government bodies. This, of course, will have an enormous impact on the communities and their regions. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, I think it is also necessary to say something about the terminology `black parliament', although I do not think people in this debate have really fallen into the trap of speaking about a black parliament emerging in relation to this ATSIC proposal. That particular terminology is not justified whatsoever. The fact is that the persons who form the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission will, as they meet in that Commission, have no legislative powers. The Federal Parliament will retain its role in that ATSIC will be totally dependent on the will of this Parliament as to its very existence and as to its functions. It will be required to meet all those standards of accountability which are so important and which this Parliament, and this chamber in particular through its various committees, has indicated are absolutely essential. I could go through the various accountability procedures but we will come to those in more detail in the committee stage debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this legislation is an important stage in the historic resolution of the way in which the wider Australian community relates to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people here in Australia. The fact is that the objects clause indicates I believe very clearly what this Bill is about. I think I might read it into the record:</PARA>
<PARA> The objects of this Act are, in recognition of the past dispossession and dispersal of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their present disadvantaged position in Australian society:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to ensure maximum participation of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders in the formulation and implementation of government policies that affect them;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to promote the development of self-management and self-sufficiency among Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) to further the economic, social and cultural development of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders; and</PARA>
<PARA>I will not read paragraph (d). I have already dealt with that. It deals with the coordination of Commonwealth, State and local government organisations. It emphasises and does not detract from their responsibilities. I believe that in that objects clause one has the summary of the reasons which have led to the development of this particular proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> Naturally, the reorganisation over the whole of Australia to such an extent, as is proposed through regional councils and through the Commission, will bring problems of the sort that attend any such major reorganisation of the delivery of services and the provision of a means by which people can make their views known. But there is within the Bill and as sought by the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs a process by which the initial stages, the early operation of this particular proposal, can be monitored by the Commission itself taking real responsibility for indicating to the Parliament how this particular scheme in practical terms is working. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with those who say that one cannot describe this in prospect as being absolutely perfect, that nothing will have to be remedied and that no alteration will ever need to be made in relation to its operation. But we at least have to see how the delivery of programs, the process and the manner by which they are devised improves the lot of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the processes within the legislation recognise that this is a matter for continued review specifically by the Commission, by this Parliament and particularly by this chamber. In these ways the Bill, when passed into law, will provide a very sound foundation for the further advancement of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people within our democracy, within our society-always subject to the ultimate jurisdiction and responsibility of this Parliament. The Bill will allow great progress in those indicators which I outlined at the beginning of my remarks, enabling Aboriginal people to assume their rightful self-esteem, which has in many cases been stripped from them by the way in which we as a society have dealt with those people over many generations. I commend the Bill to the Senate and seek the support of honourable senators for the second reading. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill, the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Bill and the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill were introduced into the Senate it would have been possible for the Opposition to have sought to have three second reading debates. The Opposition has not taken that course. It has agreed readily to a cognate debate for the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Bill and the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill. I mention this as a manifestation of the goodwill which we bring into this debate and which we wish to see conducted in good order and in appropriate time. Secondly, it would have been possible for us to have asked for an unrestricted speaking list for this debate. We have not done so and we have agreed readily to the Government's request that this cognate second reading debate for two Bills be restricted in time to three hours. This is a further manifestation of our desire to see the Government proceed in good order with this legislative package.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not wish to attract any points of order but I would like to make one very brief comment about the summing up speech made by Senator Tate to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) Bill, the debate on which has just been completed. He made much, and these Bills make much, of Aboriginal participation in the process. The Opposition cannot but note that a Government which talks so much about Aboriginal participation has at no time had an Aboriginal person present in the chamber to advise it. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This point was raised by Senator Boswell when debate on the ATSIC Bill was begun. The Government still has not seen fit to add to its team of advisers any Aboriginal person and it makes the discussion about Aboriginal participation rather hollow. It seems to be one of those pronouncements of theory by this Government which do not appear to have any practical effect-certainly not here in the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will turn first to the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Bill 1989. Honourable senators will remember that we had several generations of legislation in this package. It is interesting to look at the earlier generations of Bills to see what they had. In the 1988 ATSIC Bill, the provisions for the Institute actually formed part V of that legislation. The Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, which looked at that package and which made recommendations, recommended that the Institute should retain its own Act, and I will come back to that. Before that Committee the Institute of Aboriginal Studies made a submission and I refer honourable senators to page 1402 of the transcript of evidence where the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies (AIAS) said the following:</PARA>
<PARA> The Institute, through its Council, has consistently maintained that it is essential that it remain an independent organisation with its own Act. Some of the arguments for adopting this position are: The Institute is a research and funding body which must retain its independence and integrity in order to pursue its activities without the sorts of pressures that might be brought to bear upon it if amalgamated with a larger body primarily concerned with matters relating to the welfare and advancement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA>I stop there to say that that objection is very germane to many of the amendments which we have proposed and which, if necessary, we will move at a later time. I go back to the quotation:</PARA>
<PARA> The Institute's unique collections of print and non-print materials place it in a position more akin to the National Library of Australia than to a large bureaucracy. It is quite inappropriate therefore that it become absorbed into a large Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no evidence that there will be any effective cost savings or efficiency increases by the proposed amalgamation. Because of the Institute's very special functions, it needs to retain its own building, its own administration and its own particular facilities. The specialist functions are not duplicated elsewhere in the portfolio and there is no suggestion that there are areas where savings could be made. </PARA>
<PARA> The activities of the Commission will concern the administration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs in Australia. The Institute is a research and resource facility and has little or nothing in common with the proposed Commission. It is not evident that amalgamation with the Commission will benefit either the activities of the Institute or the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>I now refer honourable senators to page 22 of the report of the Senate Select Committee. It is part of the unanimous report. At paragraph 2.42 we find the following:</PARA>
<PARA> The AIAS also expressed serious reservations about the implications of the McIver Report-</PARA>
<PARA>That was a report by Dr R. McIver entitled Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission: Proposed Organisation Structure. The report of the Senate Select Committee continues:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . for the Institute's independence from ATSIC. The Institute concluded that the report appears to clear the way for total absorption within the Commission. The report highlights the immense vulnerability of the Institute and all it represents, if it is allowed to be absorbed within the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>Because of all this, Madam Acting Deputy President, the Senate Select Committee recommended-and I refer honourable senators to paragraph 2.46-in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that AIAS should retain its own legislation and continue to deal with other Aboriginal Affairs portfolio agencies as it has in the past. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a bit more to the recommendation which I will not read. The point I will make now, and again and again, is that while this Bill represents the redemption of the first half of that recommendation, it does not meet the second half. The Australian Institute of Aboriginal Affairs did not pretend that its present Act is perfect. It considered that the 1964 statute needed some updating but it considered that this could be a self-contained operation. The Institute used the following words in its evidence:</PARA>
<PARA> Council perceives that the time is right for change. However, in adopting this view, Council remains of the opinion that the best way to protect the interests of Aboriginal Studies is to safeguard the Institute's position and guarantee its future existence by retaining an independent statutory base. </PARA>
<PARA>Having said all that, we now turn to the present legislation. I have referred honourable senators to the previous generation of Bills and we find that the present Bill we are considering is a carbon copy of what was part V of the 1988 Bill. The Government has changed nothing. It has merely taken part V of the previous Bill, put a cover around it, changed a few words and said: Here is a separate Bill for the Institute of Aboriginal Studies. There is nothing different--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And it is not good enough. I take the interjection from a councillor of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies. It is not good enough. Specifically, it retains the nexus between the Institute and the ATSIC and it is that nexus that is so dangerous. Let me make it clear to honourable senators when we talk about independence that the Senate Committee recommended that the AIAS should retain its own legislation and, `continue to deal with other Aboriginal Affairs portfolio agencies as it has in the past.' One needs to ask in what way it has dealt with other agencies in the past. I will tell the Senate: The AIAS has operated directly to the Parliament for its funds. It has reported to the Parliament. It has been a creature of the Parliament, carrying out a specialised function. But what is proposed in this legislation is that the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies should become a creature of ATSIC, that its funding should come through the new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and that it should be controlled and dominated by ATSIC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This redeems neither what the Institute called for, nor what the Senate Select Committee, by unanimous recommendation, called for. It is not good enough, as Senator Teague has said. I remind honourable senators of an article by Jack Waterford in the Age newspaper of 16 August 1989 in which Mr Charles Perkins, AO, had some things to say about his own career. Among other things, he talked about this legislation. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> `I would think that the present arrangement between the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the Aboriginal Development Commission and the Institute of Aboriginal Studies should remain', he said. `The task should be to make them more effective . . .'</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Perkins made it clear in a public statement that he does not support the creation of an institute subservient to and subsumed within an ATSIC. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Perkins's words are exactly what the Opposition is now arguing. I ask the Government, further, to tell us something about the way it has administered the present Act under which the Institute operates. The Act provides that a number of councillors shall be appointed by the Governor-General, acting on advice. But I am advised that six such appointments have remained unfilled since 1985. Why is it that the Government has not even been willing to exercise its obligations under the present Act, even though I am assured by friends that the AIAS has been pressing Mr Hand so to act for some time? We invite the Government to tell us why it is that it has refused for some years even to bring the Institute to its proper numbers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I intend to spend the rest of my time talking about the other piece of legislation which is part of this cognate debate-the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill. Before I do so, I want to indicate quite clearly that the Opposition will oppose the Bill before us relating to the Institute for the reasons I have outlined. Should we be unsuccessful, we will proceed during the committee stage to propose a number of amendments. I turn now to the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill. Some Bills which come before this Senate are neutral in their effect, some are foolish but this one is evil and malevolent. This Bill, which we are asked to approve, not only is a denial of Aboriginal self-management but also is totally unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Select Committee, in chapter 4 of its report, spent some time setting out the special role of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC), its special character and the special function it has performed in relation to Aboriginal self-management in Australia. Whatever we may wish to say against the Commission, it has been the flagship of Aboriginal self-management. It has been a fully Aboriginalised commission-all the commissioners have been Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. I remind honourable senators that clause 202 of the ATSIC legislation, which has just been given a second reading, seeks to abolish the Aboriginal Development Commission. Should that legislation go through the third reading stage and receive royal assent, the ADC will cease to exist. It is one thing to believe in capital punishment and to hang someone, but to draw and quarter that person first is a cruel and unnatural process. That is what this Bill does. Why, given that the Government intends to abolish the ADC some hours from now--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Boswell" NAMEID="YE4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We voted on the second reading motion and the indication, therefore, is that the Government may have support later on. Why, now, does the Government wish to emasculate-eviscerate-the ADC as it exists? That is why this is an evil and malevolent piece of legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Aboriginal Development Commission Act 1980 represented a carefully fashioned compromise between the needs of Aboriginal self-management and reasonable accountability. Senator Chaney, the then Minister, consulted Aboriginal people very carefully-something which Mr Hand cannot claim-and adjusted the legislation to meet their concerns. It is the only Act of Parliament ever introduced into the Parliament by an Aboriginal parliamentarian. From 1980 to 1988 four Ministers from both sides of politics found that they could work within the essential concept of the Bill. At times it was not easy. There were tensions and conflicts but the difficulties were worked through. The Fraser Government had the vision of progressively handing over to the ADC more functions as commissioners gained more experience. I recall that when I was the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs I passed the housing function to the ADC in 1981. I note that the capital fund was topped up during the period of the Fraser Government. This was done to extend independence and self-management, in the real sense of those words. The ADC was created and funded as an instrument of Aboriginal self-management. The capital fund was established and funded to allow independence and self-management to become a reality. </PARA>
<PARA> Great care was always taken in proposing appointments to the Board of Commissioners. A balance in respect of areas, sexes and experience was sought. But the important thing was that four Ministers then left the commissioners to get on with the job. Of course there were difficulties. Some reports of the Auditor-General and investigations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure criticised the Commission. I remind honourable senators that one of the Expenditure Committee reports was produced under the chairmanship of a Mr Gerry Hand. Those reports did not recommend the destruction of the Commission. The present Minister came on to the scene like a bull in a china shop with his impractical ATSIC proposal. Following his 11 May massacre he exacerbated the situation by appointing inexperienced and headstrong acting commissioners. He issued the first direction under section 11 that any Minister had found it necessary to issue. He sacked and humiliated eight commissioners who had done their best for their people. He has gone further to hint very broadly that he will seek further ministerial control. Of course, all this led to the need for further examination by the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told, in the ATSIC Bill, that the answer to the problems of Aboriginal Australia is to provide more self-management. The Government uses the term self-determination, which is probably a dangerous term. Yet the ATSIC Bill tries, in a most snide way, to put the commissioners' operations under the closest, the most paternalistic, ministerial control. The same thing is attempted in this ADC Amendment Bill. No previous Minister for Aboriginal Affairs ever needed the close and stifling controls this Bill seeks to impose on Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course there have been difficulties. Of course there have been embarrassments. Of course there has been bad judgment and of course there have been wrong decisions. But how else do we expect things to progress as people take control over their own lives and make their own decisions? How else could self-management for Aboriginal people become a reality? This Bill sets out to bind the ADC hand and foot, to remove those elements of the ADC Act which made self-management a reality. Even as we debate this Bill we know that the Government has put in train plans to destroy the ADC completely by administrative means. The Government has worked out a plan to gut the ADC administratively. We know that funds for the ADC were reduced in the Budget. It appears that a function with the ADC has been transferred back to the Department-an amount of more than $20m. We know that a draft Cabinet decision was prepared in July 1989 which set out means by which the ADC could be gutted administratively. That draft Cabinet submission has been put into the public arena by my colleague Mr Warwick Smith. We have seen it. It suggests, inter alia, that one of the things the Government might be able to do is the following. I will read option (b) from the draft Cabinet submission:</PARA>
<PARA>the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to withdraw the section 8 (g) determinations in respect of housing grants and possibly other functions, these to be undertaken from 1 December 1989 by DAA, with appropriate adjustments to appropriations;</PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting to note that in the Budget money was removed from the ADC. Mr Warwick Smith has released publicly a photocopy of an Aboriginal Development Commission commission-in-confidence resolution without submissions from the meeting of 7 to 11 August 1989. The resolution reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission RESOLVED to recognise the depletion of their budget by $26.5m to service the Minister's commitment to Priority Community Development Strategy and RECORDED their displeasure about the way in which this happened. </PARA>
<PARA>It indicates that it was signed by Terry O'Shane, Chairman, and that it was approved. So the Government has been trying to gut the ADC administratively. It now plans to dismember it with this Bill and then to execute it in the ATSIC legislation. We are asked to agree to all these amendments to put the Minister in the driver's seat, to end self-management in the ADC as we have known it since 1980. Neither the Prime Minister nor the Minister has given the ADC a fair go. It worked under four Ministers. Why could it not work under the fifth Minister? There has been absolutely no consultation with anyone about this Bill, about these provisions. What do the hand-picked commissioners think of the controls which are now to be put on them? We know that they expressed their displeasure at some of the administrative consequences. I have just read out their commission-in-confidence resolution. </PARA>

The Minister is always telling us how much he was willing to consult about ATSIC. How much is he consulting about his moves to destroy the ADC?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is absolutely no justification for this Bill. Somebody in the Department of Finance was sent over to the ADC to see what controls could be put on it, and he did his job. This Bill is the outcome. The sad thing is that his terms of reference did not take into account the Minister's rhetoric about people's power and self-management. The Prime Minister has never explained what lies behind his grand plans for administrative arrangements in Aboriginal affairs. He has not established a case. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill sets out single-mindedly to control every aspect of the ADC's activities. Any voice of opposition will be suppressed. Any challenge to the Minister's determination to have his way will be crushed. What began with Ministers from this side of the Parliament as a far-sighted and even courageous exercise in Aboriginal self-management now lies in ruins. We are going to see Labor senators and Australian Democrat senators vote for this to occur. It is unbelievable that they should take this course. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the chamber find it hard to understand how the Australian Democrats have failed, and continue to fail, to see what the Minister's agenda really is. How can they even hope-still less how can they be sure-that the fine sentiments on ATSIC about self-management will not end up crushed in the same ministerial determination to impose his will as we see now operating in relation to the Aboriginal Development Commission? We will go through the clauses later. But, of course, once the statute is in place it will be all too late. Sadly, it is probably too late now for the Aboriginal Development Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition will oppose this Bill. We will oppose it as vigorously as we can. Either it is unnecessary, because the Government will be abolishing the Aboriginal Development Commission should it succeed in having clause 202 of the ATSIC legislation passed and proclaimed, or it has already finished off the ADC by underhanded administrative means. If the Government really wants this Bill, if it really wants it to apply, the Government must explain how this Bill, whose principles fly in the face of so much the Government has said about Aboriginal self-management, can proceed. How can the Government proceed with such a Bill? The Government stands condemned in its own terms with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> To sum up, there are two pieces of legislation in this package. The Opposition has cooperated in having them debated together and in limiting the length of time allowed for their discussion at the second reading. We will oppose each of the Bills: the ADC Bill, because it is an evil, malevolent and destructive Bill; and the Bill for the establishment of an Institute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies because it does not adequately redeem the letter or the spirit of what the Senate Select Committee recommended on this matter. Should the second reading succeed, we will move appropriate amendments at the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just heard a most lucid and excellent speech from an honourable senator who adorns the Opposition benches. I do not say that facetiously. Senator Peter Baume is certainly in his proper place where he sits now. I do not necessarily say he should be there as Leader of the Opposition but certainly he should be on the front bench. He has done the most honourable of work in the area of Aboriginal affairs. He pointed out that development took place under the Aboriginal Development Commission, which was set up by the Fraser Government, and that as time went by funding was increased and more tasks were given to it. That illustrates the fact that the position where Aboriginals are entitled to take their proper place in society, not only by law but by fact, has to be reached. In fact, this journey has been attempted by various governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What came out of Senator Peter Baume's address to us was the fact that there is need for development. The argument, as I understand it, between the Government and the Opposition is not whether there should be development-I understand both sides agree on that-but how it should be done. The Opposition has said that the mechanisms the Government has adopted are wrong and that the sort of people we have advising us are wrong. Senator Baume says that history will show that to be so. That may be so. It will show whether the Opposition was right or whether the Government, led in this instance by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand), was right. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hand has come in for a lot of criticism. It is often difficult to see what the gravamen of that criticism is. On one occasion it was that he was not taking sufficient care of his Department, that he did not have sufficient control over those institutions we have in society to service Aboriginals. Certainly, towards the end of last year and at the start of this year that was the charge laid against him. Now the charge seems to be not that he has done too little but that he has done too much, that the controls he has instituted are too strong, too powerful, and that he did not have the right balance. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tambling, more than anyone else, has led the charge. Senator Peter Baume has a constructive approach to what ought to be done and what ought not to be done. What Senator Baume says needs to be taken on board. It is a course that the Minister has not pursued; he has pursued another course. At least Senator Baume has put forward something creative. With great respect to Senator Tambling, his contribution to this debate over the months has been destructive. I say that not in an unkindly sense but in a descriptive sense. If we go through the many well-researched words he has used in the debate on Aboriginal affairs-and he is acknowledged by this side to be a person with a great deal of experience in this area-and put on one side the constructive criticisms Senator Tambling has made, the sorts of things he says ought to be instituted on behalf of Aboriginal affairs, and put on the other side his criticisms in terms of denigration and condemnation of policies, of people and of institutions, we will realise that the side with the negative criticism is overwhelmingly the stronger side. Senator Peter Baume, on the other hand, makes criticisms but is creative in doing so. That is what we need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a legitimate place for criticising or condemning people, but that criticism must be balanced. Senator Tambling has never, in my experience, made any concessions in this chamber as to the Minister's goodwill in attempting to do something creative, whether it is right or wrong, whereas many other honourable senators on the other side, including Senator Peter Baume, have done so. That is the difficulty we have when we take on board interjections such as the one Senator Tambling made. We have to look at his interjection in the context of the sorts of contributions he has made in the chamber. Senator Coulter has been very critical of the Minister and of the policies of the Government from time to time, but in doing so he has put forward creative alternatives. As I understand the Minister's approach, he has taken on board many of the proposals that Senator Coulter has put forward. So it is a matter of how one goes about debating things in this chamber. One can throw a one-liner across the chamber from material one has-it is a legitimate tactic, and happens again and again-criticising particular people who try to create things, and thus score points. On the other hand, one can make a positive contribution to the debate. In my view, it is a more useful procedure to take the second course. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Peter Baume criticised the fact that there is no Aboriginal person in the chamber instructing the Minister. I am not sure what that means or what the significance of it is, beyond perhaps a symbolic gesture. Perhaps Senator Baume is saying, `It would look good, it would look nice, it would look lovely, if we had an Aboriginal person in the chamber as we debate this matter'. I am sure that is right, but whether it would further the debate, I do not know. The debate has to go ahead on its merits or otherwise. If the honourable senator would like some sort of symbolic figure in the chamber, I can take the matter up with the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Peter Baume mentioned Mr Perkins, OA, and what he has to say about the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Bill. I am sure that what Mr Perkins has to say should be taken on board. I have never understood Minister Hand to be other than ready to take on board what Mr Perkins says. He is not the sort of person to hold any ill-will against Mr Perkins. On the other hand, Mr Perkins is one person whose views must be valued. There are many others. The Minister, after his very long research into these areas, has chosen to go down the particular path we have on this occasion. Much criticism has been made about the Minister's lack of consultation. Much criticism could be made about anybody for lack of consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> If change is going to take place, it has to take place in a sensible context. As I said before, there is no argument in this chamber but that change has to take place. Any change will bring problems. Mr Gorbachev in Russia is not making his changes with roses all the way; nor is that happening in Poland. Mrs Thatcher is not universally popular in England. Even the changes in a country as close as New Guinea have not been received with joy all over the place. This is so when there is any change in administration, just as when Mr Reagan came to power. We would only have to ask the air traffic controllers what they think about change. The fact that pain comes with change is hardly an argument against change because there is very little change that comes without pain. It just seems to me that some of Senator Baume's argument-certainly not all of it, because there was great merit in it-was saying, `Look, because there is trouble, because there is pain, because there is difficulty that comes with change, that change should not take place'. I am sure that is not what he meant, but that is certainly how his argument came across. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Death by any means, I suppose, is hard to bear. If we look at the Bill itself, which I will now do, we see that it talks about the functions, corporate plans, grants and loans to be repayable or conditions breached; loan, grant, acquisition and guarantee documents to show legislative authority; appointing a general manager; and putting in really what are audit functions. In fact, when we look at proposed new section 40b, we see that it does just that. What the Bill does, if looked at on its own, is quite unexceptional. It puts into place proper financial management procedures, and that is all it does. Looked at on its own, the Bill really is very optimistic as to the future of the ADC because what it seeks to do is to improve its functioning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The real problem, it is said, is that it is ultimately going to come under the control of ATSIC. And that is true. ATSIC is obviously going to have much greater control over the sorts of things that the Aboriginal Development Commission is now doing and will have greater control over the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. Of course it is. That is the whole thesis and the whole thrust of ATSIC: what it seeks to do is to give people who are Aboriginals or Torres Strait Islanders a greater say over their own affairs, just as we have a greater say over our own affairs by electing governments, city councils, shire councils, and even boroughs-I love the name `borough'-such as the Borough of Port Fairy. That concept of electing people to do things is hardly foreign, and let us hope it never becomes foreign to people in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> So I want to say this: a lot of what Senator Baume says is correct. He has put an interpretation on what will happen. He has spoken in terms of gutting and executing. Those words flow very colourfully and attractively from his mouth, but what they do is to throw a particular interpretation on what is being done by this Minister. I could use other phrases, such as, `Here is a Minister who seeks to give Aboriginals a say in their own affairs, who seeks to give to people control over their own destinies, who seeks to redress past wrongs by enabling people to exercise some degree of choice'. The argument then is not so much what the reality is as between particular interpretations. I am confident that my interpretation will prove to be correct. </PARA>
<PARA> Can I just go back to something that Senator Chaney said in the speech that he gave before Senator Tate replied. It just seemed to me to-and I will finish on this, Senator McKiernan; I said I would go for only five minutes and I see I have gone over my time. </PARA>

Senator Chaney was saying, `Look, we are really thrusting too much in the way of responsibility onto Aboriginals. We are making them organise their own clean water, organise their own rubbish collection, organise their own clean streets, and we do not put this burden on the rest of the community'. I am not sure that we are going out and asking every Aboriginal to organise his or her own clean water or to organise her or his own power. What we are saying is that we are setting up bodies and institutions which will make arrangements to have those things done and that those bodies and those institutions will be elected democratically. That seems to me to mirror very much what happens in the community generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point that Senator Chaney made was in reference to places like Red Hill, where he carried out experiments, or experiments were carried out while he was Minister, and where he returned years later to find that they had not worked as well as they might.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, I am very glad to see that you are in the chair because I know that you are particularly interested in the subject of Aboriginal and Islander affairs. We have spent a lot of happy time together going around the communities and the islands. I can remember well when the Islanders made you grandmother or mother.

Let me put it on record: under your husband's stewardship, there are no better treated Aboriginals in Australia than those Aboriginals in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate today is debating the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Bill. The Institute Bill has been introduced as a result of the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, which recommended that the Aboriginal Institute should retain its own legislation and continue to deal with other Aboriginal affairs portfolio agencies, as it did in the past. That is a recommendation that the Committee made that was agreed to in principle but, in fact, not in reality. As my colleague Senator Peter Baume has said, the present Bill is almost identical to the Bill which proposed the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ACTSIC). However, the Government retains its domination of the Institute, because its board has to have three ATSIC commissioners. So there is really little independence gained from this sleight of hand transfer. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government paid lip-service to this piece of legislation, and it was only lip-service. However, the Government has rejected outright the Committee's recommendation on the future role of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) within ATSIC. The recommendation was that a greater proportion of the current activities of the ADC should be the responsibility of the proposed Aboriginal Economic Development Corporation (AEDC) than is envisaged in the Bill. In its response, the Government said that a broader role raised the prospect that the AEDC would operate through a more decentralised structure. This rejection is not surprising as the history of Aboriginal legislation over the past two years under the present Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Gerry Hand, has been one of centralisation, control and domination by the Minister, the greatest cost being to Aboriginal and Islander self-management. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate faces a difficult and strange task today. It is being asked to amend legislation that we were asked to vote for an hour ago, and that in turn is going to gut this particular ADC Act. The second reading motion for the adoption of that legislation was carried. So we are now asked to amend legislation that is really not in force. I believe that the Minister, Mr Hand, is suffering such paranoia about the independent actions of the ADC that we have seen a series of events aimed at reducing the ADC's responsibilities and resources, culminating with this piece of legislation before us today. This is nothing short of a ministerial vendetta against the ADC, which began after the 1987 election when Mr Hand was appointed as the new Minister. He surrounded himself with like-minded advisers. He came up with a prime ministerially endorsed plan to amalgamate the various arms of Aboriginal affairs administration. He refused even to acknowledge formal advice from the Government appointed ADC Board on the ramifications of its ATSIC proposal for the ADC and Aboriginal affairs in general. He has crudely ignored the fact that such advice is part of the ADC's statutory functions and that the ADC was the most experienced and professional body to offer such advice. The Minister would not discuss any details of his ATSIC proposal before he got Cabinet endorsement and approval. </PARA>
<PARA> Following this refusal to accept advice which was not in line with his own views, the Minister then set out to bring the ADC to its knees through a series of Machiavellian events that saw the ADC commissioners dumped unceremoniously and their names and reputations savaged through false information leaked to the press. The chairperson, Shirley McPherson, was hounded out of office on the whim of the Minister. He reduced her responsibilities and then encouraged a vote of no confidence in her. When the Minister found that he could not control the unrest he had fostered in senior officers within his portfolio, heads rolled; many resigned in anger and frustration as they saw their lives' work disintegrate before them. When the Minister found that he could not hide the discrepancies in the administration of his portfolio, he found a scapegoat in Charles Perkins and gave his head on a silver platter. When the Minister found that his own Government dominated Select Committee recommended transferring the ADC to ATSIC, he turned the other cheek and amended the ADC Bill. What we are discussing at the moment is a proposal to gut the ADC Bill in order to reduce its powers and bring it under ministerial control. The Minister has tried all sorts of ways to rid himself of this nemesis-the ADC-the only remaining body run by Aboriginals and committed to the economic development and financial self-sufficiency of Aboriginal and Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA> A draft Cabinet submission dated July this year proposed various ways and means of gutting ADC functions without offending the Australian Democrats. I am sure that Senator Coulter has seen that draft Cabinet submission. It is hypocritical in its purpose, which was to take funds away from the ADC without offending the Democrats, because the Government was afraid the Democrats may turn against it for its actions in gutting the ADC. If Senator Coulter, the spokesman for the Democrats, has not seen that submission, I will gladly make it available to him. </PARA>
<PARA> ATSIC repeals the ADC Act. So what are we talking about today? The Minister has also taken it upon himself to reverse completely the Government's formal response to an expenditure committee's inquiry into the ADC. The response in October 1985 was made only nine months before the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) announced his intention to create a single statutory body with responsibility for all aspects of Aboriginal affairs. At his press conference in July 1987, the Prime Minister said that the Minister and the Secretary of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA), Charles Perkins, would work together on the new legislation. We now know what happened and how that has turned out. Mr Perkins has been scrapped, thrown on the dust heap. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope he does come back. It shows that the Minister and the Prime Minister were committed to ATSIC long before any consultation with the Aboriginal and Islander people. The Minister has never listened to any feedback. I point out again-and I know that this has been picked up by Senator Peter Baume-that if Aboriginal people are to have self-determination, if there is to be an interchange between Canberra and the Aboriginal communities, surely there is an Aboriginal person in the DAA or ADC who can come and sit in the officials' box to communicate with and tell their people what is actually happening in Canberra. We have sat here through four or five hours of debate. There has not been one indigenous person in the advisers' box. That shows how hollow ATSIC is in terms of self-determination. On the role of the ADC, the Committee recommended:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Commission's role should be maintained and strengthened. Its emphasis should be increasingly on programs associated with Aboriginal development, including housing, enterprises and land acquisition, with welfare programs remaining with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs or elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's response then was to support the recommendation regarding the aims and objectives of the ADC. The Committee found:</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the Commission cannot be insensitive to the wishes of the Aboriginal population at large it does have a leadership role to exercise particularly in the area of Aboriginal enterprises, which is not being fully exercised at present. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government also supported another recommendation on housing responsibilities. The Committee said that the grant-in-aid housing program should remain the responsibility of the Commission. The Government supported that in addition to supporting a recommendation that the funding of housing and enterprise programs can be linked with training programs. That is particularly important in the case of enterprise programs where the basic skills are best learnt on the job rather than in institutionally provided courses. </PARA>
<PARA> It is overwhelmingly clear from this Bill before us that those Hawke Government commitments that made the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, like so many others on so many other issues, have been swept aside. None of these commitments have come to fruition. In fact, the opposite has occurred. The ADC has lost $26m in resources and its responsibilities have been lessened. Now, through this legislation, it is further to be restricted or almost abolished. The Prime Minister seems to be under the hold of Gerry Hand's Left-dominated faction. The Government has reversed its own policy, sacked key personnel who opposed its view, dismissed the advice of Government-appointed professionals in Aboriginal affairs and given the Minister totalitarian powers so that he can force through his pet project. This has become an obsession with the Minister. It is a case of win at all costs and the black people of Australia have no standing whatsoever. The Minister is going to get his own way irrespective of what damage it causes to the Aboriginal people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's appreciation of and praise for his former Secretary to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, Charles Perkins, means nothing if Mr Perkins's views on ATSIC and the ADC are completely ignored. And it is no good the Prime Minister coming into this Parliament and giving Mr Perkins great accolades as a man who can communicate with the black people of Australia and then completely ignoring what Mr Perkins has said about the arrangements between DAA, ADC and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. What he is recommending is entirely what the Aboriginal people want, entirely what the Opposition is saying and what the Government formerly agreed to-that is, that the arrangements between the DAA, the ADC and the Institute should remain and the task should be to make them more effective. There is no argument with us; there is no argument with the Aboriginal people; and there is no argument with Charles Perkins. There is some misunderstanding in the Left of the Australian Labor Party that seems to have been thrown ATSIC as a bone to shut it up on other issues. I suppose that is how the Labor Party works. There are four factions and the Left has to be fed a bone every now and again to shut it up. </PARA>

Now it is disorganised, there is a great deal of unhappiness and poor morale. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister could not even tell Mr Perkins to his face that he was to be dismissed. Gerry Hand left him sitting in his office. Gerry Hand never had the guts, the fortitude, to go up and say to Mr Perkins, `I'm sorry, Charles, we can't work together. It's time that we parted. In the interests of the Aboriginal community, in the interests of Aboriginals, you'll have to go'. Mr Hand left him in the office for an hour and a quarter having a cup of coffee. He disappeared out the door. He did not even have the guts to give him his marching orders. As Mr Perkins said, `I was treated like a dog, left like a dog and pushed out through the door'. What an indictment of people that are supposed to represent the Aboriginal communities.

<PARA> We feel that the only true decision-making power that Aboriginal people have ever held has now been lost forever, and sadly, Aboriginal people allowed it to happen. It is painfully obvious that at the end of the day it is `party politics and government priorities' that are the real issues and not `Aboriginal development'. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the message that is coming from Australian Aboriginal communities. It is a message of despair, disaster and loss. Mr Hand's commissioners are rapidly ascending the learning curve. They are realising that while it was great to have the Minister appoint them and to make trips to Canberra, some expensive sacrifices are also going to have to be made. The commissioners are already most disgruntled with the Minister for cutting their funding by $26m. They passed a motion on 10 August to record their displeasure and, as a matter of fact, they nearly all walked out. </PARA>
<PARA> The most serious question that all this ruthlessness raises is: How can any Aboriginal, Islander, Democrat, State government, Commonwealth body, local authority, or non-government agency be confident that the Minister will not do the same again and again? How can they be sure that they will not be stabbed in the back or dismissed for expressing a different opinion? If a Minister is prepared to dismiss eight commissioners for disagreeing with him, why will it not happen again? This Minister has an obsession with this legislation and nothing is going to stand in his way. He has already dismissed eight commissioners. He has driven Mrs Shirley McPherson out of office and she is going to be a great loss to the Aboriginal community. </PARA>
<PARA> The ADC Act is to be crippled by this legislation before the ATSIC Bill repeals it and replaces the ADC with a commercial development corporation within ATSIC which will also be tied to the Minister's apron strings. The ADC Act was set up by a former coalition Government as a vehicle for the promotion of Aboriginal self-management. I think it was set up by Senator Chaney. In 1981 it was agreed to transfer housing funds to the ADC to give it a base for economic development. The role of the ADC was then, and remains, distinctively different from that of a department of state. The current Minister, however, does not seem to appreciate the different requirements of welfare and economic self-management functions. The amending Bill that we are debating deprives the ADC of self-management status. I still cannot get an answer as to why this is being done. </PARA>
<PARA> The ATSIC legislation which the Senate discussed earlier today virtually writes out the ADC. On the same day, we are debating a Bill that will do the same thing. The existing Act provides for the Minister to direct the ADC as to the form of its estimates, but does not provide authority for ministerial approval. That power will be given to the Minister by clause 14 of the Amendment Bill. Clause 15 provides for the Minister to give written directions on the administration of the Commission's finances. The Commission has to comply, even if these directions are in conflict with the corporate plan. The Minister now also appoints the general manager who is responsible for the day to day management of the ADC-another loss of power. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs McPherson, the former Chairman of the ADC, advised the Minister that ATSIC and the weaker AEDC would not further the economic development and financial self-sufficiency of Aboriginals. She said:</PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the type of arrangements proposed will jeopardise these objectives and those of Aboriginal self-management and decisionmaking. </PARA>
<PARA>The Labor Party is practising the most horrific thing, something that Aboriginal people dislike, that is, patronisation. Aboriginal people hate it. Honourable senators opposite are patronising the Aboriginals. They claim that Shirley McPherson will come back, that she will not be lost, but they kicked her out. They tell me that Charles Perkins will not be lost, that he will be back, but they kicked him out. Honourable senators opposite are engaged in something that is most disagreeable to Aboriginal people who absolutely despise being patronised. They hate it. Government senators are saying to them, `Don't worry: we'll kick you out, but keep quiet about it because we will get you another job somewhere'. It is not on. The former Chairman of the ADC also stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Splitting enterprise and housing programs and splitting commercial lending activities between the proposed ATSIC, AEDC and the Housing Trust will mean a poorer service to Aboriginal people and a wasteful allocation of resources. </PARA>
<PARA>By reducing the power and autonomy of the ADC, the Minister has obstructed the only avenue of escape from welfare dependency that Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders have. By placing recruitment practices and administration under the Public Service Act, this Amendment Bill will inevitably lead to the dissipation of the ADC's economic and commercial development expertise. No previous Minister has needed this sort of tight control. Everyone has been able to work within the system, yet two of the Bills we are discussing today gut the ADC. The Amendment Bill is only another proof, if proof is needed, that a new system of Aboriginal patronage exists in Aboriginal affairs under the current Minister. Ministerial appointments, ministerial control and ministerial approval will mean that the favoured few will benefit greatly; the rest, the Aboriginals and Islanders in the communities, will be resigned to obedience to these favoured few. They will be cowed, not liberated; they will be controlled, not in control. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the Amendment Bill sets out to control every aspect of ADC activity. No contrary voice will be tolerated. I ask the Australian Democrats, especially Senator Coulter, how they can be sure that ATSIC will not be crushed by the same ministerial domination and obsession that we have seen with the Minister's crushing of the ADC. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon the Senate is debating cognately two Bills relating to matters concerning Aboriginal people in Australia: the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Bill and the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill, both of 1989. In opening my contribution to the debate, I recognise the time constraints that the Senate has agreed to in debating these two pieces of very important legislation. For that reason, I will limit my contribution this afternoon to the legislation. I recognise the limitations other speakers are putting on themselves in their contributions this afternoon and for the remainder of discussion on the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will deal very briefly with the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Bill. I make the point very strongly that the Government has adopted and accepted the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. The Committee was set up last year to investigate a number of matters concerning Aboriginal affairs and it made some recommendations concerning the Institute of Aboriginal Studies. When this Bill is passed, as it undoubtedly will be, the Institute will remain the premier research institution in the field of Aboriginal studies in Australia. It will continue to operate the Aboriginal Studies Press and will continue to publish a wide selection of work related to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues. In passing, I recognise the work of the Western Australian, Ken Colbung, who is the Chairman of the Institute. I trust that he will continue the good work that he has done for Aboriginal people not only in his home State and mine, Western Australia, but throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Bill we are debating cognately this afternoon is the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill 1989. Senator Peter Baume, in his opening comments on the Bill, called it `evil'. He called it a number of other things as well. I dismiss Senator Baume's contribution as mere rhetoric. It is the job of the Opposition in opposition to oppose, but the use of words such as `evil' adds very little to the debate. The Bill is a very important one and it is unbecoming of an honourable senator of the calibre of Senator Peter Baume to resort to low tactics such as putting such names on things. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator also said that there was very little debate on this legislation and that very little information about the administration of the Aboriginal Development Commission legislation had been given to the Aboriginal community or to the community as a whole. Notice on this was given very early in the piece by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, on 10 December, 1987, in the first major statement about the proposed changes in the administration of the Aboriginal affairs portfolio. Those statements were reaffirmed by the Minister and also by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on 11 April this year. If the Opposition parties and honourable senators opposite have not come across those statements, I would be more than happy to provide them with copies. </PARA>
<PARA> A new arrival in this country, listening to the debate, would think that the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) was a perfect organisation. I think that is what is being proposed. A stranger to the country or someone unfamiliar with Aboriginal affairs could be led to believe that no mistakes have ever been made in the administration of the Aboriginal Development Commission. That is not true; mistakes have been made. Indeed, those mistakes have been recognised by Opposition parties and Opposition spokespersons as well as by Government spokespersons and people with an intimate knowledge of the Aboriginal Development Commission. As an illustration, I will quote one such Opposition spokesperson, although there are many others. The quote comes from Mr James Porter who is at present the honourable member for Barker in South Australia, although he will not be for very much longer. I will quote a short paragraph of Mr Porter's speech in the other place on 5 October 1984. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Aboriginal Development Commission was established by the previous government. However, our initiative in its implementation does not bind us to recognising weaknesses and even disappointments in the operation of the ADC concept as a working instrument for Aboriginal advancement and self-management. </PARA>
<PARA> The report identifies a number of specific matters that warrant the serious and immediate attention of both the Commission and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>That is just one quotation to illustrate the point that I am seeking to elucidate here in the Senate this afternoon. If we need further elaboration to illustrate that the ADC is not a perfect organisation, we have to look no further than the special audit report by the Attorney-General which was brought down in March of this year. We could, if we wanted to develop the matter further, refer to the Hansard transcripts of proceedings of Estimates Committee E over the last 18 months to see where a number of miscalculations and errors of judgments had been made by the Commission, the commissioners and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA> Here is where we get to the nub of the question. Honourable senators will recall that while those debates were going on within the Parliament and outside it there were a number of calls for the head of Gerry Hand saying that the Minister should resign because of the administration of the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio and the administration of the ADC. That call for his resignation was echoed a number of times, including by a number of honourable senators who are in this place at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me quote, to put it into perspective, from the Auditor-General's special audit report of March 1989 into the ADC and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. Under the heading `Minister's powers', in paragraph 2.1.5 on page 7 it states:</PARA>
<PARA> Under the ADC Act, the Minister has power to give general directions to the ADC but he is not involved in the approval of particular grants or loans. The ADC must provide the Minister with annual estimates of expenditure in such form as he determines but the ADC is not required to obtain his approval of the estimates. In practice, however, the total amount of expenditure by the ADC in the broad categories of expenditure are influenced by the Government in the Commonwealth Budget context. The Minister may add to ADC's functions by notice under sub-section 8 (g) of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite the fact that Ministers have very little power under the Act which was introduced by the previous conservative Government, in 1980 I believe, Mr Hand's head was still called for because a number of errors had been made. What we are doing in the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill, whose second reading is being debated in the Senate this afternoon, is actually attacking the very problem of where the ministerial responsibility is, where the parliamentary responsibility is. We are addressing that. Clause 4 of the Bill which will amend section 8 of the Act is designed to enhance accountability. It will ensure that the Minister could require the Commission to provide information, including financial information. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 5 provides for greater ministerial involvement in the formulation of the Commission's corporate plan. Clause 6 again gives the Minister further powers. If the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission or the ADC does not work in the future, clearly the accountability will be on the Minister's head and Opposition senators, members of parliament and the community at large will rightfully, if things go wrong, be able to call for the head of the Minister, for his resignation to be delivered on a plate. This Bill will, for at least a short time, give the Minister the power to control things. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of individuals' names have been mentioned throughout the debate. I want to refer to only one, Charles Perkins. Charles Perkins's resignation, and the manner in which it occurred, has been misconstrued by a number of people for their own motives. Various allegations have been made about what happened on the day of and in the events leading up to Mr Perkins's resignation. Mr Perkins has himself put the details down on paper. He has asked people, if they want to continue to refer to his resignation from his position within the ADC and as Secretary of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, to refer to his notes and not put their own interpretations upon them. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned during Senator Boswell's contribution that Mr Perkins has not departed the scene of Aboriginal affairs in Australia. A person of Charles Perkins's calibre could not do that; he would not physically be able to do that, his conscience would not allow him and he will continue to be involved in Aboriginal affairs. We might find that involvement happens a little sooner than we might wish. Following the next election Senator Charles Perkins might be addressing the Senate, putting the record straight and even taking part in an Estimates Committee meeting when he would not be the subject of the interrogations that have taken place at some of the Estimates Committee meetings. In talking about Mr Perkins and the possibility of his coming into this place, I refer to a newspaper article in today's Melbourne Age which states that Mr Perkins might nominate for Parliament-either the House of Representatives or the Senate. One of my senatorial colleagues, Senator Puplick, would probably be more favoured if he went for the House of Representatives because it is Senator Puplick's seat that would be in jeopardy if Mr Perkins did determine to go for a seat in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I have exceeded slightly the time I have allocated for myself on these two Bills. Aboriginal affairs is a controversial issue in Australia today. The fact that it is controversial is not the making of the Government, it is not the making of the Minister, it is not the making of the Minister's colleagues in the parliamentary Caucus. It is not even down to the fact that the Minister happens to belong to the left wing faction of the Australian Labor Party. I am proud to say that I am a member of that faction as well. In the years to come when we can look back in hindsight and reflect on achievements, the name of Gerry Hand will be well remembered and well respected for the changes that he will be responsible for bringing into the administration of Aboriginal affairs in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addressing the second reading of the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill and the Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Bill, I would like to concentrate my remarks on the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill. This Bill is designed to tighten up the ADC but we need to ask some very fundamental questions as to why it is seen that that tightening up has to take place. Unlike the honourable senator who spoke just before me, Senator McKiernan, I am certainly not here as an apologist for Mr Hand. Mr Hand's record through this whole sorry, sad saga will certainly mean, as Senator McKiernan said, that he will be remembered but he certainly will not be remembered in the way in which Senator McKiernan was rather hopeful that Aboriginal people in the Australian community would want to remember him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of very significant events have taken place since July 1987 when Mr Hand became the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. I am totally confused and bewildered by the way in which the Cabinet, the Labor Government Cabinet, has succumbed to the pressures of the socialist Left on this issue rather than responding to the genuine, the real, pressures, requests and demands of Aboriginal people throughout Australia. The Labor Government has run to the socialist Left agenda, not to an agenda that is set out to benefit Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the Bill before us today is, in effect, complementary to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) Bill of course needs to be carefully considered. We need to look at the motivation for what has occurred. I would argue that much of what has happened in this Aboriginal political area has been vindictive. It has been vindictive against many Aboriginal people throughout Australia. I have read with interest the annual reports of the Aboriginal Development Commission for 1986-87 and for 1987-88-the last one available to us. They are very interesting. Every senator should take the time to put those two reports alongside each other and to draw some significant comparisons. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1986-87 annual report, which was a full report, properly documented, properly set out, with good content from the Chairman and from many other people, it is interesting to note what the then Chairman of the ADC, Mrs Shirley McPherson, had to say in her introductory remarks. She acknowledged:</PARA>
<PARA>The Aboriginal Development Commission Act 1980 which established the ADC in 1980 is a unique piece of legislation, visionary in outlook and clearly recognising Aboriginal needs. It was only enacted after extensive consultation with the Aboriginal people and with the bi-partisan support of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>My fellow Commissioners and I have worked hard and responsibly to ensure that the trust placed in us by both the Aboriginal people and the Parliament is fully justified. </PARA>
<PARA>Mrs McPherson talked about establishing in that year a corporate plan, a compilation of program procedures manuals and the ADC recognising clear goals, objectives and strategies. Sure, there were still many inherent problems in this whole portfolio area. But at least in 1986-87 Mrs McPherson and the ADC in their report had the good grace to recognise the contribution of other Aboriginal Australians who had participated at the Commission level. Mr Mick Miller, Mr Getano Lui Jr, Laurie Walna and Robert Tipungwuti had all retired during the year and were given proper acknowledgment in that report. The 1986-87 report was comprehensive. It acknowledged the problems, but it also highlighted all of the significant events that were taking place. </PARA>
<PARA> By comparison, the shocking annual report of 1987-88, which was tabled recently in this Parliament, is a disgrace. It was obviously compiled with obvious political interference and intervention in the recognition of it. As many honourable senators would know, it is currently under investigation by a committee of this Senate because of its inadequacies and because of the parts of it that are absolutely wrong. The introductory letter to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has the wrong date on it-1989 could not even be put in print, the year before was the date attached to the letter. </PARA>
<PARA> The former commissioners of the ADC were sacked by the Minister in the eleventh month of the financial year. They had given an 11-month contribution. But they were not even mentioned anywhere in the report, let alone recognised. I will come, in a moment, to why they were not recognised, to why they were completely overlooked and to the fact that the Minister replaced them. None of them is given any credit for the great contribution that he or she had sought to make. Certain other ADC Board members are inadequately described. The report fails to mention that Mr Charles Perkins was one of the Board members appointed on 13 May 1989. Therefore, he was there for six weeks at the end of the financial year; but he does not even get a credit, a photograph or a biography similar to the other potted biographies in the front section. Why? Because some six or eight months later he fell out of favour with the Minister too and he was obviously removed from any retrospective recognition of the role that he was to play. </PARA>
<PARA> There was also no chairman's comment. As we know, Mrs Shirley McPherson has been critical of much of the stance taken by the Minister in developing the ATSIC proposals. So, the chairman's comment was deleted, pulled out, not even acknowledged in the annual report. The photograph of Mrs Shirley McPherson that is printed can only be described as probably the worst one available on the ADC's files. She was put in the report with a snarl on her face and looking downwards. The psychology of the presentation is ridiculous. There is no foreword from the ADC Chairman at all in that year's annual report. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer also to the concern about the general manager's overview. This matter has been referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration for investigation. I have been told by people who have spoken to Mr Mick O'Brien that he has indicated that the overview as published is not what he recalls writing in draft form. It was never submitted in its final form to him for signature. Therefore, the signature appearing for Mr Mick O'Brien is a forgery. </PARA>
<PARA> All of this leads me to the fact that it only highlights what Senator Teague so correctly pointed out to us the other day: the Minister, Mr Hand, in May 1988 set out on a vindictive and deliberate plan to undermine the Aboriginal Development Commission. It was a political matter of getting numbers for ATSIC without weighing up the decent arguments that were put forward. Minister Hand was using Aboriginal people, Aboriginal leaders and Aboriginal communities; he was seeking to convey a message for political purposes. Senator Teague pointed out in his comments in the ATSIC debate on 30 August 1989:</PARA>
<PARA>My criticism is reserved for the Minister, Mr Hand, who deliberately subverted the ADC to his own political line. The tactics of the Minister's men in the civil war were conspiratorial, secretive and dissembling, using every delegated power to the hilt for their own advantage and using the violence of numbers to bully a conclusion through. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> There is no evidence that the Minister has encouraged discussion built on trust, openness, free debate, the tendering of clear evidence or soundly established material. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Teague tabled a transcript of a discussion in July 1988 between eight of the new Hand-picked and Hand-appointed commissioners of the ADC at a meeting, in which there are some very interesting comments. The comments from those Hand-picked commissioners include:</PARA>
<PARA> Stand Mick-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Mr O'Brien-</PARA>
<PARA>aside and say that the Chief Officer of the ADC is now Mike Stewart and all staff answerable to him. That's it. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . we have to override them. Now, that's utilising your authority. Right. Override them. And change their position. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We should knock this into a resolution. Mike Stewart is now the position of the General Manager. Put Mick O'Brien on special duties, and if he can't come at those, we can put him aside. Mike Stewart will hone in on them and Shirley is not to leave Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The other thing is we want to cover the political scandal. We don't want Mike Stewart getting involved with all the administrative matters. We've got to be careful about that. If we give him all O'Brien's delegations, he's going to be tied into knots. They'll make it hard for him. They'll just try and knock him off. What we want is a politician. </PARA>
<PARA>What disgraceful comments from the Hand-picked, Hand-appointed commissioners of the ADC! This situation comes about because the commissioners were specially appointed to do the job on the ADC-not to look after the interests of the Aboriginal people throughout Australia that the ADC had been struggling with since 1980 but to undermine the efforts and all of the other things that have been talked about by other senators today. </PARA>
<PARA> The ADC has had to walk through a minefield. But it is very interesting to note that in March 1988 the former group of commissioners put forward an alternative strategy for Aboriginal self-management. This was in response to the Minister's invitation to comment on Foundations for the Future-the preamble, the pre-discussion, to the ATSIC proposals. That alternative strategy needs to be looked at carefully. Mr Acting Deputy President, given the time, I will pursue that issue when the debate resumes. </PARA>

It has been assembling quantities of the phones and is now preparing to manufacture substantial componentry in Australia. I am also informed that approximately 20 per cent of blue phones installed by Telecom have proven to be defective in operation. These problems have arisen as a result of a manufacturing fault in the coin handling mechanism. Testing of a modification to the coin handling mechanism to avoid such problems is almost complete. As the results have been extremely encouraging, production of the blue phones in the UK and Australia is expected to recommence shortly.

Are reports correct that Thai and Australian business leaders will meet during the visit of the Prime Minister of Thailand to Australia to discuss possible Australian involvement in power generation in Thailand?

Has he received progress reports on the proposal from the Australian consortium which is reported to be interested in it?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is opportune that Senator Devereux should ask this question today, as we have just attended a luncheon for the Prime Minister of Thailand, General Chatichai. It is true that the press reports-the report I saw was in the Melbourne Age today-an initiative by an Australian consortium in Thailand for a billion dollar value project for the design, building and operation of a black coal fired power station on the eastern seaboard of Thailand. At the present stage the consortium, comprising the Electricity Commission of New South Wales, Leighton Holdings Ltd, Port Waratah Coal Services, CRA Ltd, and the Joint Coal Board, has put an initial proposal in outline to the Thai authorities and will at the end of this year make a full presentation of all the technical details and data to the Prime Minister of Thailand in the expectation that shortly after that there will be a decision by the Thai Government whether to go ahead with the project.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At this stage I would have to say as an observer of these proceedings that the prospects that a project of some sort will proceed in Thailand are relatively good. As I have said, the total value of the project would be about $1 billion. But the expectation of the consortium is that, in terms of material supplied to the power station, about 30 per cent would be Australian content. The feedstock to fuel the power station is most likely to be Australian, high calorific content, low sulphur, low ash, low moisture black coal. It would constitute at a minimum about 60 per cent of the feedstock to fuel the power station.</PARA>
<PARA> The Thai authorities are concerned about environmental issues concerning the location of the power station. One of the reasons why I believe that this power project and initiative by the Australian consortium has real legs is that the actual level of atmospheric pollution is much lower than is the case with lignite fuel power stations on brown coal reserves in Thailand. Thus, while any power generation makes a contribution to CO2 emissions, given the very high energy content per unit of input, this is environmentally one of the best ways of power generation.</PARA>
<PARA> This project is a good example of Australian initiative in a growing market. The economy of Thailand is expanding by about 9 per cent per annum. The fact that Australia can compete internationally against the best projects proposed by other countries, the fact that Australia is a country recognised world-wide as the leader in coal-based power generation and the fact that Australia now has a real opportunity to demonstrate in situ in Thailand our ability to deliver highly technical, highly complex and very worthwhile industrial development indicates to other Australian industry that the markets that exist in South East Asia for Australian resource development, Australian power generation and Australian transport and communications are very real. If this project goes ahead it will demonstrate our capacity and open up market opportunities for other Australian entrepreneurs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. I ask: Is it a fact that the final environmental impact statement (EIS) for the Coronation Hill mine contains a proposal for a new access road to the mine site? Is it a fact that the road would involve major engineering works and that it passes through the breeding habitat of the extremely rare hooded parrot? Is it a fact that this breeding site contains only five breeding pairs, the highest number known to exist anywhere? Is it also a fact that any spillage of transported cyanide or other chemicals along this road not only would contaminate the local environment, but would inevitably flow into the South Alligator River? As the final EIS provides no environmental assessment whatsoever of this road, will the Minister call for the preparation of a preliminary environmental report, or EIS, on the road? Finally, does the Minister recognise that this situation is conclusive proof that the impact of the proposed mine extends far beyond the project area?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before answering the specifics of Senator Sanders's question, I think I should give some background information. I have until 12 September to provide advice to the Minister for Administrative Services, Stewart West, on the Coronation Hill mine environmental impact statement. I have not yet received from my Department its recommendations and its assessment of that EIS. I would expect to do so in the next few days. As soon as I have received them and before 12 September, I will make sure that I address some recommendations to Mr West. As to when a decision might be made on whatever I recommend, I will not attempt to predict a date. Obviously, broad issues are raised in the EIS on Coronation Hill which could have effects on areas quite some distance away. Given that, and the argument which is currently going on about the sickness country, it may be some time before Cabinet can actually make a decision. When I am aware of that taking place, I will let Senator Sanders know.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the specifics, I am aware that the final EIS contains a proposal for a new road to the site. This road obviously carries with it considerable potential for damage to the environment along the lines which the honourable senator has mentioned. There has been no separate environmental examination of that road. It would be up to me to recommend either a public environmental report or an EIS-or I could just say that I did not like the proposal at all, if I thought it was as bad as all that. But I am not going to pre-empt the judgments of either my Department or me. I will wait until I have had a proper assessment placed before me rather than just going on the cursory glance I have had at the final EIS. The decisions will be made very shortly and I will let the honourable senator know as soon as I can. Obviously, endangered species like the hooded parrot need to be looked at very carefully. I can give the honourable senator an assurance that they will be.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Has his attention been drawn to an article by Glenn Milne which appeared in this morning's Australian newspaper? Can the Minister confirm that to attempt to inflation adjust the income tax treatment of interest would have the types of consequences set out in the article?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="690" SPEAKER="Walsh Sen The Hon P.A." NAMEID="TJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the article in which the journalist Glenn Milne sets out a series of major problems that are inevitably associated with Mr Peacock's proposal. He also attributes the credit for bringing attention to those problems to Senator Stone and Mr Blunt. I do not know whether the credit for pointing out to Mr Peacock what a silly idea it is really resides with Senator Stone, but it would not surprise me if it does.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the substance of the issues raised by Mr Milne, he points out that there would be massive additional complexities in the Income Tax Assessment Act if Mr Peacock's proposal were to be implemented, adding probably many hundreds of pages to an Act which is generally agreed to be excessively long already or longer than is really desirable. More importantly, probably, it would also discriminate, in the very worst way, against a number of productive Australian enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA> The proposal is that the tax system be partially indexed-that is, that only interest paid and received be indexed. There would be no indexation for stocks and no indexation for depreciation of plant or for replacement cost to be used as the basis for tax deduction. Only on borrowings or lendings does he propose indexation. That is a serious distortion which would be compounded if his proposal is to exempt from the interest indexation provisions passive investors, speculators in real estate. It would be further compounded in the worst possible way because another part of the Opposition's taxation policy is to exempt, after a five-year period, capital gains from any taxation.</PARA>
<PARA> The final consequence of these four things piled upon each other would be to provide massive penalties for people who invested in mines or factories with the intention of generating income, and huge windfall gains to real estate speculators who invested in land or buildings. In other words, it is exactly what the country does not want. It would give a big free kick, of course, to negatively geared property investments in Bowral favoured by Ferrari-driving, yuppie shadow Treasurers. I do not believe, however, that Dr Hewson will support this proposal, even though he would be a beneficiary from it.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of the Treasury estimates that Mr Peacock's proposal would cost $3 billion to $4 billion on a net basis and that it would also have certain effects. I can confirm that the figures which Mr Milne has used in this article were those used by the Treasurer in a speech that he made on the subject on 9 August. Mr Milne said:</PARA>
<PARA>According to figures prepared for the Treasurer, Paul Keating, a comprehensive inflation adjustment scheme would cost the average farmer more than $40 a week, an interstate truck driver would pay as much as $75 a week. The tax bill of a typical service station owner would rise by 75 per cent, and for a motel operator it would double.</PARA>
<PARA>The Peacock proposal would provide windfall gains to real estate speculators and would penalise almost everybody who is actually involved in productive enterprise or who may invest in productive enterprise. The additional cost to revenue of the proposal would, of course, either require additional taxes to be raised elsewhere or a lower public sector savings effort. I think there are plenty of people in the Opposition, certainly Senator Stone and Dr Hewson, who understand the problems with this proposal. Their problem is how to bury it without simultaneously burying its author, although that may not be worrying them for very much longer.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Housing and Aged Care and it follows a statement that the Minister made yesterday in reply to a very user friendly question from Senator Childs. Is the Minister aware that the database on which the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal based its rather amazing recent decision in relation to payments to pharmacists represented a response from only 0.3 of one per cent of pharmacists in Australia? Is the Minister also aware that under the new guidelines pharmacists will actually be required to pay the Government for the privilege of dispensing prescribed items? Accordingly, can the Minister please advise the Senate of any other business or professional group which is expected to provide a service without any mark-up whatsoever or, in this case, provide a service at a loss? Given that the decision is likely to lead to the closure of over 1,000 pharmacies around Australia-a fact which the Government has not denied-can the Minister advise just which health care professionals the Government expects to appear and fill this massive void in primary health care for elderly and isolated Australians? Finally, can the Minister inform the Senate as to the cost to the Australian public of advertisements placed in metropolitan newspapers today in which the Minister has sought belatedly to justify the Government's decision?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am constantly amazed by Senator Calvert. On Tuesday night I was on duty during the adjournment debate and Senator Calvert made a speech in which he inferentially admitted that he had not read the report. It now seems that he may have read at least some parts of the report. At least that is some progress; I would hope that Senator Calvert would read the whole thing and I would hope he understands these points which are the points I made in answer to the question yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Tribunal which brought down this report was set up by legislation of the Fraser Government. The Tribunal stands independent of this Government and its decisions are binding on the Government and on the industry. It is not, therefore, as the honourable senator said in his question a case of when the Government will make a decision. He has said that the Government has a hands-on responsibility in this. It does not; so I think that many of the rhetorical points that the honourable senator has made about effect are points being promoted by particular interest groups to win an argument rather than points that are being promoted objectively on the issues being analysed. They are simply debating points. At this stage it has to be said that the Minister today-or is it tomorrow-is having talks with the Pharmaceutical Association of Australia about the application of this report and that the Minister also pursued, before the Tribunal brought down its decision, an attempt to forge a common approach to put to the Tribunal between the pharmacists and the Government. It was the unilateral action of the pharmacists in withdrawing from that that meant both the Government and the pharmacists put different views to the Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA> I return to these principal features. The Tribunal was set up under legislation enacted during the Fraser years. We have not tinkered with that; it is independent of government; it is binding. If there is a way of resolving these matters, they will be explored fully in the proper talks between the Association and the Minister. Senator Calvert's alarmist rhetoric is just simply an unwelcome addition to what is a serious and important debate in Australia.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Faulkner raises probably one of the perennial debates running in the Australian community. The request for uniform credit legislation in this country has been going on for 15 years. Some of the major implications of it are far-reaching. In essence, over the last six years at least we have had a major development in the credit industry and we now have operating a much more national or international industry. Therefore, there needs to be a much more uniform approach in the way that we regulate that particular industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other part of the problem is that, because of deregulation, there have been major movements in terms of who now has the major part of consumer credit business. Whereas, for instance, six or seven years ago finance corporations may have had three-quarters of it, it is very much the banking sector that now covers that same amount. Given the fact that the legislation as introduced in the 1960s and 1970s was geared towards regulating finance corporation lending, one will find that at least three-quarters of consumers these days are not covered by a very important piece of consumer protection. It not only affects industry and consumers in this way, but also makes it impossible to run national and effective educational campaigns. So it has been the Government's priority for at least the last 15 months or so to bring about agreement with the States in this vital area.</PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the law at the moment does have some inadequacies. It does not cover a major proportion of lending, and to that extent something like four-fifths of lending is not covered. The other problem with it is that, as well as being antiquated, it is also somewhat cumbersome and does not really take into account the needs of industry and consumers into the 1980s and thereafter. It has been a priority of government. At the Standing Committee of Consumer Affairs Ministers in 1988, this issue was given a pretty hefty kick along. When we met again this year, in 1989, having had the Victorian Law Reform Commission develop in substantial proportion a Bill in plain English to cover this area, Ministers agreed to the publication of that Bill. In fact, I was pleased to be able to release today a copy of the Bill for public comment. The Ministers have agreed to meet later in the year or early next year to further consider industry and consumer response to the draft Bill. As I have said, it has been released this morning. It is important, and the Government sees it as important, for two main reasons.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am not reading a press release. First of all, it brings the law into tune with the requirements of both industry and consumers in the 1980s and 1990s. Secondly, it extends consumer protection to those four-fifths of the community that at this stage do not have it. In doing so it covers all parts of a consumer transaction-pre-contract, during the time of contract and aspects of it at the closure of a contract. A most important aspect is that the Bill embodies a very clear and concise requirement as to detailing of interest and all charges levied in a consumer credit contract.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have been able to release the Bill for public comment this morning. Some aspects of it still need to be worked out with the States but I feel that those points really nibble at the ankles of major economic and consumer reform here and I anticipate that when we meet in about six months time after the two months consultation period that is to take place we will get further and final agreement and give this legislation the kick along that it really needs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Defence to my question on 23 May regarding the North Pacific military exercise, PACEX, scheduled to take place in September-October this year. In the answer it was stated that the Government is aware of the exercise but that the Australian Defence Force (ADF) has not been invited to participate in the exercise and nor will it. The same applied to observer status. Given this statement, I ask the Minister whether he is aware of the fact that the United States Pacific Command in Hawaii finally acknowledged the existence of the proposed exercise on 7 August and that sources in the Japanese Defence Agency stated that almost all United States forces in the Pacific will be involved in the manoeuvres, including those stationed in Japan, South Korea and the Philippines. A press report in the Japan Times dated 9 August also stated that Australia plans to join the event along with Thailand. I therefore ask the Minister whether this report about Australian involvement is true, and further ask whether the United States is trying to hide its embarrassment about PACEX by proposing separate joint exercises-whatever that means-with the Royal Australian Navy which is apparently what it is offering the Japanese? Finally, if the report is true, why is the ADF taking part in an offensive exercise which is based on a scenario of direct confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union which promises to be the largest military exercise in the Pacific since World War II?</PARA></TALK.START>

As has been indicated on a number of occasions, the airlines are willing to talk about the issues, but at present that does not seem to be happening. Commissioner Paine of the Industrial Relations Commission has offered to deal with the dispute or to try to conciliate it. That is a welcome initiative, but I do not think it is an offer which, as I said earlier, comes within the jurisdiction of the Industrial Relations Commission. The Industrial Relations Act requires a dispute to exist between an employer and an organisation of employees. These pilots are no longer employees; they have all resigned. They are not employees within the meaning of the Industrial Relations Act. Senator Chaney looks puzzled. He queried my view about this earlier, and I again repeat it. The jurisdiction of the Industrial Relations Commission in order that that Commission might, if Senator Chaney's Bill were passed, issued an injunction is just not there at the present time. In answer to Senator Durack's question, I would welcome Commissioner Paine pursuing his offer.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The JET scheme commenced operations in March of this year and up until mid-August some 2,500 sole parent pensioners have volunteered to participate. It is expected to become fully operational by November 1990. As for eligibility, all sole parent pensioners-and there are approximately 240,000 of them-are eligible to participate in the program, but it is the intention of the Government to target the program to sole parents who have school age children and who have been in receipt of the pension benefit for 12 months or more; to sole parents where the youngest child is within two years of 16, that being the point at which the entitlement itself terminates; and to teenage sole parents-the third target group. The reason for that, of course, is that these people are, by definition, very young and it would be undesirable if they were to establish at that very young age the habit of not participating in the work force. The JET scheme combines the resources of three Commonwealth departments-Employment, Education and Training, Social Security and Community Services-and is a recognition by the Government of the special difficulties faced by sole parents in attempting to re-enter the work force.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By way of preface to the answer to this question let me say that one of the times of great pride for me as a Minister in this place was when I was a conduit on behalf of Dr Blewett on Monday in putting down the statement on AIDS. It was a matter of great pride because of the positive and bipartisan support of Mr Shack, of Senator Puplick, who spoke in this place, and of the Australian Democrats. It was a fine example of bipartisanship in this Parliament. Indeed, it is bipartisanship of the order that restores my faith that, at times of national need, it is possible to find between all of the parties a degree of unity which perhaps eludes us at other times. I think this is an occasion when the Parliament as a whole can take a bow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is against that background that I turn to the direct answers of a factual nature to the two questions which Senator Peter Baume has asked. The answer to both questions is no. The detailed answer is as follows. A serum derived hepatitis B vaccine manufactured by Merck Sharp and Dohme was approved for marketing in Australia in 1983. The Department of Community Services and Health is satisfied that the procedures used to manufacture the vaccine would destroy any AIDS virus which might be present in the starting material. No case of AIDS has been attributed to use of this vaccine. This vaccine has effectively been superseded since 1987 by vaccines manufactured in yeast, using recombinant DNA technology. The use of this technology overcame the previously limited supplies of the vaccine. Small stocks of the serum derived vaccine have been maintained primarily for use in persons sensitive to yeast products. Total distribution this year has been 125 doses. I am informed that the manufacturer categorically denies that there has been any attempt to promote this product since the advent of the recombinant DNA vaccine. I think that answers the two questions on a factual basis.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my answer to the general question in the spirit in which I began-a spirit of bipartisanship-by quoting from a press release put out by Senator Grant Tambling of the Northern Territory. We in this chamber all know that Senator Tambling and I have had many disagreements on a number of matters, but let me quote approvingly his press release attacking a letter circulated by Peter Sawyer:</PARA>
<PARA>``The extreme right-wing network preys on people's frustration, fears and vulnerabilities to the point where they can be manipulated in support of hidden policies.</PARA>
<PARA> ``Basically, the philosophies of the League of Rights organisation are racist, anti-semetic and neo-Nazi.''</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recall that Senator Jenkins asked me some time ago a question about wetlands and their nomination under the Ramsar Convention. The Government of Western Australia has not yet submitted to the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service a list of wetlands it may seek to have nominated under the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance. However, I understand that a list of places is currently being considered by the Western Australian Cabinet and I am assured that an announcement will be made in the very near future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have received a number of representations from residents-I will have to hope my pronunciation is correct here-of the Vasse Wonnerup region which indicate their concern over some developments proposed for that area. Last year the Acting Minister for the environment at the time, Clyde Holding, wrote to the Western Australian Minister for Conservation and Land Management advising that the Commonwealth considers that the wetlands satisfy the criteria for designation under the Ramsar Convention. That letter did indicate Commonwealth support. Stage 1 of the Port Geographe development has been assessed by the Environmental Protection Agency in Western Australia and has been approved, as I understand it, subject to certain conditions. This stage of the development is being used as a vehicle to secure the protection of the estuarine system, most of which, as I understand it, is in private ownership. The Western Australian Government has given an assurance-and I am confident it will live up to it-that stages 2 and 3 of that development will be put through a rigorous environmental impact assessment procedure.</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware that an officer of the Royal Australian Ornithologists Union produced a report which referred, I think, to the 21 species to which Senator Jenkins referred. Under the Ramsar Convention, the protection of wetlands is implemented through legislation and administrative arrangements that are in force in the States and Territories with coordination of it effected through the Council of Conservation Ministers. Until such time, however, as the wetland is listed the Commonwealth has no power at all to intervene. So at this stage of the game there is no power in Western Australia to intervene, but in any event, I would not assume that stages 2 and 3 will go ahead. There has to be a rigorous environmental examination and we will see what the Western Australian Government determines as a result of that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Jones for his question which indicates his continuing interest in the law enforcement effort directed at trying to curtail the supply of drugs which are abused within the Australian community. I know that he is greatly concerned about the incidence of international drug trafficking, which is a problem that all governments are facing. As international traffickers do not recognise boundaries of nation states, so nations themselves must cooperate in order to ensure that as far as possible this very dangerous and deadly trade is curtailed and, in some instances, one would hope, completely wiped out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a fact that information coming to Australian law enforcement authorities and, indeed, to me personally on my recent overseas trip, indicates that the drug barons-the war lords in Colombia and other nations in South America-are targeting Australia as one of their next most lucrative markets. Having saturated the United States of America, having done great damage and causing devastation to the whole fabric of many of the inner cities, as I was able to observe recently, and having made inroads into Europe in recent years, the drug barons are now looking to Australia and Japan as countries with a lot of disposable income which can be used for the purchase of these drugs.</PARA>
<PARA> The Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority indicated in its recent report, entitled Drugs, Crime and Society, that its best information was that some 84,500 Australians used cocaine in the last 12 months. I hope that those persons who, because they think it is trendy or sophisticated, snort cocaine-or whatever the expression is-realise that they are contributing to the cash flow which leads to the violence, murders and social disintegration which they see on their television sets at night. That is precisely what is happening. There is a huge transfer of money from countries like the United States, the European nations and Australia to meet the greedy, rapacious demands of drug barons and war lords-in this instance of Colombia-for money to sustain their armed forces. This leads to the destruction of their justice systems and, indeed, the whole social fabric. That is what happens when a so-called Australian recreational user uses this drug.</PARA>
<PARA> In answer to the question from Senator Jones as to what steps are being taken to meet this challenge, we have found that the best way to inform ourselves and to take steps to interdict the supply of cocaine into Australia is to adopt the same method that we have recently adopted in relation to the importation of marijuana, heroin, ecstasy or whatever it might be-that is, to place Australian Federal Police liaison officers in our embassies abroad. We have them in Bangkok, Manila and Singapore. As I announced to this chamber, earlier this year I placed an Australian Federal Police officer in Argentina. A commercial passenger air link has recently been opened between Australia and Buenos Aires in Argentina. As this is the only service between Australia and South America, we posted this officer to that city. Putting an officer into Colombia would have exposed him to great peril and danger. As we know, many officers of the drug enforcement administration in the United States have been killed in Colombia. I believe that the sort of intelligence we can obtain from that posting will be extremely useful in our, in turn, targeting those who would try to traffic this drug into Australia. Indeed, we have made preparations to send a second officer to Argentina to back up the efforts of the first person appointed.</PARA>
<PARA> The question of the importing of drugs into Australia and the way in which we, as a nation, tackle that problem is a very complex one. Through the Australian Federal Police and other agencies we are trying to interdict the supply. But, in the end, unscrupulous profiteers will serve any market in order to make huge profits. They are not concerned about the degradation, destitution or even the deaths of many of our young Australians in particular that they cause. For that reason, the combined efforts of the health and police Ministers in having a program which tries to interdict supply but which also tries to shrink the market by encouraging Australians not to become part of the intoxicated and drug-ridden society which prevails is an important and, I believe, world leading example of the way in which nations should attempt to tackle the drug abuse problem.</PARA>

I told Senator Coulter on 29 August 1989 that such products had derived from an endangered species and are prohibited from importation into Australia under the provisions of the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982. The Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act is administered by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service.

Therefore, goods manufactured from the ivory of the Indian elephant were prohibited from importation for commercial purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The African elephant at that time, namely, 29 August this year, was listed in schedule 2 of the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act.

As a result, goods made from ivory of the African elephant imported for commercial purposes are now also prohibited.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the answer. </PARA>
<PARA>I find the Minister's answer very unsatisfactory. It is unsatisfactory for this reason: on 7 April 1989 we were debating the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) and Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3). To that latter Bill, the Australian Democrats moved an amendment which would have had the effect of altering the provisions of that legislation so as to impose, at that stage, a total prohibition on the importation of all worked ivory products. When the matter was raised, Senator Button gave a response which I presume was given on the basis of advice which he had taken from officers present in the chamber. In relation to elephants, Senator Button said in part:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter also raised two matters relating to the Customs Tariff Amendment (No. 3). He drew attention first to the provisions in the Bill regarding worked ivory. He drew attention to the fact that the endangered species which provide these goods-I think it is the elephant only. I think that that is right, is it not?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Coulter interjected and said, `Mainly'. Senator Button continued:</PARA>
<PARA>They are under increasing threat from poachers and illegal traders. As Senator Coulter is aware, Australia, as a signatory to the harmonised system convention, is obliged to specify these goods in its national tariff. However, I assure Senator Coulter that, as these products are derived from an endangered species, they are prohibited from importation to Australia under the provisions of the Wildlife Protection (Regulations of Imports and Exports) Act 1982. This Act gives effect to Australia's international commitments under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. </PARA>
<PARA>First, at that point Senator Button did not make the qualification of the difference between the Indian and African elephants in terms of the listing of schedules 1 and 2 of the CITES Convention, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Secondly, by referring to the increasing threat from poachers and illegal traders Senator Button clearly gave the impression that he was talking about the products derived from the ivory of the African elephant. To the best of my knowledge the question of poachers and illegal traders has not been raised in relation to the goods derived from the ivory of the Indian elephant which is a schedule 1 animal as distinct from the African elephant which is a schedule 2 animal. </PARA>
<PARA> It was on the basis of Senator Button's advice to the Senate that the Opposition parties at the time did not support the amendment moved by Senator Coulter. Had we been properly advised by the Minister and his departmental advisers that products derived from the African elephant were in fact schedule 2 products and, therefore, not in the same category as the ivory derived from the schedule 1 Indian elephant, we would have supported Senator Coulter's amendment to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3). We would have amended that Bill. We would have sent it back to the House of Representatives and we would have had the matter dealt with. The fact that we did not support the Australian Democrats' amendment was purely on the basis of the advice given to the Senate by Senator Button, which advice was erroneous. </PARA>
<PARA> I resent very strongly that we are given by a senior Minister advice which is incorrect, as a result of which we did not take certain action. The consequence of that was that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) grandstanded on the basis of making that change which the Parliament would have made in April-not in August when the Government got around to it. We would not have been put in the position of having to wait those extra months because of the completely erroneous advice given to us by Senator Button in an answer on 7 April. So a problem was identified. The Parliament was asked to deal with it. The Minister said, `Don't deal with it. It is already dealt with under the legislation'. We deliberately forwent the opportunity to deal with that matter. Almost six months later, the Prime Minister made a grandstanding statement about the matter saying what a great fellow he has been about the whole thing. Senator Coulter had to raise the matter in relation to the answers given by Senator Button, and Senator Button's answer today frankly was most unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> May I say that the Parliament is rightly concerned when a matter of technicality, of detail, of law, is raised with the Minister responsible for the Customs Act. The Minister consults his advisers. He gives an answer to the Senate which is not correct and as a result the Senate declines to take action on a matter which it could have acted upon at the time. Subsequently, this situation is brought about. If that is the best the Minister responsible for the Customs Act can do, after consultation with officers of the Australian Customs Services who are present in the chamber on a debate and a potential amendment, it is a most unsatisfactory situation. I can assure the Minister that, as far as the consideration of similar amendments to legislation are concerned, the Opposition does not intend to put itself in the position of accepting the Minister's assurance on similar matters with the same degree of confidence that we might have in the past. </PARA>

In so far as my answer of April led them into that position I apologise. It was the result of the advice I received in the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me, however, just recapitulate what the position was as at April. The position at April was that there was a total prohibition on the importation of ivory from the tusks of Indian elephants; there was a prohibition on the importation of ivory from the tusks of African elephants. But in the case of African elephants the prohibition applied unless a permit was issued. A permit was issued only if the country of origin had in place a management plan which had been approved by the Federal Minister responsible for the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act. Two countries, Zimbabwe and South Africa, had such approved plans. So in the total picture of importation of ivory there was only one circumstance, as I understand it, in which it could be imported. It was if a permit was issued and the permit was issued on the basis of an approved management plan in the country of origin. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, I concede that there is a minor discrepancy-I would so regard it-in the answer which was given by me in April. I concede that the action the Liberal Party might have taken in response to Senator Coulter's initiative might have been different. To that extent I apologise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was asked a question yesterday by Senator Newman and a further question today by Senator Reid on certain matters relating to the use of defence aircraft in the current pilots dispute. I will attempt to answer both questions now. Ticket proceeds from civilian passengers on Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) flights are to be retained by the airlines. The airlines have reached an agreement with the Department of Defence under which they will either provide or pay for fuel and other operational and maintenance costs on an hourly basis. In effect, therefore, they are chartering the aircraft from the Government. The precise costs of this sort of operation are not yet clear as the RAAF has not undertaken this sort of operation on a scale of this kind before. If the revenue received by Defence from the airlines does not in the end fully cover the RAAF's additional expenses for this operation, the Minister for Defence will seek supplementation for the shortfall through the Additional Estimates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> RAAF staff are clearly working very hard to sustain this operation. They deserve praise and gratitude for it. RAAF personnel are paid a service allowance in lieu of overtime of over $4,000 a year. This was increased by 123 per cent last year. Since the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal was established by this Government, all national wage increases have flowed on to the Defence Force quickly and in full. Additional rises have also been granted under productivity and anomaly provisions. Because of this, the Defence headquarters have decided that the two-year review allowed for in the Act has not been needed.</PARA>
<PARA> In answer to Senator Reid's question on Hamilton Island, the agreement between the Department of Transport and Communications, the RAAF and the airlines is that they will all work out flight details together. The understanding is that the RAAF will service routes that cannot be serviced by other measures. These will include isolated areas like Western Australia and Tasmania and, judging by the advertisement from which Senator Reid has quoted, it would appear that the airlines are seeking to include Hamilton Island in that as well. Given that they are chartering the aircraft, that would be a matter for them.</PARA>
<PARA> When it comes to Kangaroo 89, however, to which Senator Reid referred and about which Senator Newman put out a press release yesterday, they are in fact quite wrong in their assertions. Number one priority is being given, and will continue to be given, to defence personnel returning from Kangaroo 89. Qantas Airways Ltd will be taking up what the domestic airlines may have taken up had they been in full operation. There is no truth to the claim that defence personnel are being downgraded in any way in priority. They are priority No. 1 and will remain so.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) in response to Questions without Notice asked by Senator Newman on 30 August 1989 and Senator Reid this day, relating to the use of Defence aircraft during the airlines dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>There are undoubtedly some matters in Senator Richardson's response which Senator Newman will want to respond to when she has the opportunity to do so. In the first part of his answer, the Minister indicates that the arrangement between the Government and the airlines is a charter arrangement, but he clearly is not able to tell us what the basis of it is. Normally, if one hired a plane or a car, one would know exactly what was being paid. The Minister goes on to say that, if what is finally worked out to be the cost does not actually cover the costs, the Minister will be seeking funds from the Additional Estimates later in this financial year. It leaves me almost speechless to think how one could possibly have an arrangement for charter whereby--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not often that I am speechless, Senator Button. It is amazing to think that one can have an arrangement whereby an aircraft is chartered and then find out later that what one is prepared to pay does not cover the cost. I hope that, sooner rather than later, the Government will give us an explanation. How could any additional estimates even be contemplated in those circumstances? I believe that the explanation that it is a charter is something that the Government has thought up afterwards to try to explain what is going on and to get around this particular type of advertisement. Why is the Government not putting on special planes to fly to Ayers Rock? Tour operators out there are suffering mightily as a result of what is going on at the present time. I could spend the rest of the afternoon telling the Senate about the difficulties that the operators here in the national capital are having in filling their hotels as a result of conventions that have been cancelled at the National Convention Centre and other places.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is clear from this advertisement that there is some fairly neat arrangement between the Government, Ansett Airlines of Australia and Hamilton Island to get flights to that island. Would we not all like to go? It is on Saturday of this week. How is it that it is Hamilton Island that is being favoured over and above every other resort in this country? I do not believe that the Minister's explanation is adequate. I do not believe that the suggestion that it is a charter, where the Government cannot tell us the cost of chartering the aircraft, is adequate. I seek leave to continue my remarks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the Auditor-General's Reports Nos 2 to 9 of 1989-90 tabled on 30 and 31 August 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>I particularly want to draw attention to the Auditor-General's Report No. 5 presented yesterday relating to the Department of Employment, Education and Training-Jobstart. I want to draw attention to the fact that the Auditor-General clearly has pointed to some serious problems in this program. It is a program that quite frankly has not in fact achieved its objectives. This Government's management of it has been apparently incompetent and I think it is very important that the Senate be aware of the Auditor-General's comments in his review. For example, on page 7 the Auditor-General concludes:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . on the basis of the review that there was an urgent need for the Department to examine the operation of Jobstart to determine whether it was meeting the needs of the long-term unemployed as prescribed in its objectives.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Auditor-General is questioning whether the Government has made another muck-up with another of its highly publicised but largely incompetently run, misdirected and wasteful endeavours to be seen to be doing the right thing by a targeted political group, and that is in this case a segment of those people who are unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government's gestures and posturing in this area have been exposed by the Auditor-General. It is all very well for the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) to smirk and scratch his head over this; he obviously has not read the report. I think it would be very useful if he did because then he would see that the Auditor-General reveals that 58 per cent of participants failed to complete the full 26 weeks of subsidised employment work experience. This, by the way, is in the Queensland division. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General says that the Department should establish the reasons for the high drop-out rate to determine whether Jobstart was in fact meeting the needs of individual participants. Here we have the Auditor-General, fortunately, having the fortitude to question whether this Government program, which has more political than practical overtones, should in fact be examined to see whether it is doing what it is supposed to do. This is, as I said, simply another example of the Government trying either to paper over the cracks or to spend money trying to create an illusion that it is doing something meaningful for political purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, there are many other criticisms in the Auditor-General's report. Briefly, the response from the Department to some of those criticisms has been strong and well argued. The Auditor-General has conceded that there have been improvements since the audit took place, but he persists that some criticisms remain relevant and unsatisfied. In these circumstances, there is a clear need for the Government to do what the Auditor-General advised and see whether Jobstart does anything more than serve some political purpose and whether this enormous drop-out rate is justified. The Auditor-General also raised the question about whether the program was properly run in the first place because people in the over-45 age bracket are getting a raw deal as a result of Government policy. Quite properly, these matters should come to the attention of the Senate. I hope the Government will do something meaningful to respond to the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also make some comments on the same Auditor-General's report referred to by Senator Michael Baume. I do so because the Government is expending some hundreds of millions of dollars on a series of so-called training or work enabling programs. It seems to be something of a speciality of the Department of Employment, Education and Training to produce another set of initials with a flash program which is supposed to meet some perceived social need. When an Opposition gets up and says that it thinks something like Jobstart is a waste of taxpayers' money, it is very easy for a Government member to stand up and say that the Opposition is being hard-hearted again and ignoring the needs of the unemployed. I must say, however, that this report bears out the concern which I have felt about this Department since the beginning of this decade. It has a record of non-performance which is very serious.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have had very high youth unemployment for most of this decade. We have had significant unemployment for the whole of this decade and a very substantial amount of money is expended on programs such as Jobstart. There is a great deal of scepticism in the Opposition about the effectiveness of those programs. The important thing to note is that this is an assessment of just one of those programs by the Auditor-General's Office. The fact that it is the Auditor-General's Office, a non-political body with no political axe to grind, which makes the criticisms is important to note because the criticisms it makes of the program are so severe as to suggest that it ought not to continue. This program is not small potatoes. It is $85m worth of job subsidies which are handed out. As Senator Michael Baume pointed out, the Auditor-General has found that there is a frightening degree of failure. </PARA>
<PARA> The report points out that 21.5 per cent of participants leaving Jobstart ceased within six weeks of starting; that 39.5 per cent dropped out within 13 weeks; and that in total 58 per cent of participants failed to complete the full 26 weeks of subsidised employment or work experience. It is always a problem to know whether a subsidised place is an additional place. Everybody knows that employers can arrange their employment requirements to take advantage of subsidies, but everybody also knows that some employers genuinely use this to create positions that would not otherwise apply. One cannot therefore make a blanket condemnation. However, when we find that almost six out of 10 of the participants in a program do not stick with the job for the 26 weeks of the subsidy period, it is time to ring some alarm bells and to question whether the hundreds of millions of dollars which are being spent on this and like programs are being wasted. </PARA>

My reason for wanting to intervene in this debate is that I think this would be one of the 200 programs that Senator Peter Walsh identified a year and a half ago as being the sorts of programs which represent a significant waste of taxpayers' funds and which need attention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I raise the matter in the context of this program review because every Liberal and National Party senator knows that as soon as one of us raises an area of waste, we are accused of being heartless, not being concerned with the unemployed, not being concerned with the poor or whatever. The truth of the matter is that to throw hundreds of millions of dollars of the taxpayers' money into waste bins, and obviously a large proportion of this money is effectively thrown into the waste bin, is not doing anything for the people of Australia. </PARA>

The fact is that we have a hotchpotch of programs. The initials are quite extraordinary: We have got ITS, FAT, JET, Jobstart, Skillshare, and so it goes. This is in the finest tradition of the Department of Employment, Education and Training. Senator Peter Cook, who is at the table, has taken something of an interest in labour market matters. He would be as aware as any honourable senator in this place of the extent to which many of these programs represent a nice set of initials, a nice set of brochures and very little else. My purpose in intervening is to say that, in the Opposition's view, this is an area for Government attention. This is an area where Senator Walsh should stop being coy, should admit that this is one of the 200 programs which are in drastic need of cutting and the Government should take a constructive attitude to that instead of every time the Opposition raises one of these matters, accusing us as being Darwinians. We are not Darwinians. We simply say that, as the Auditor-General has exposed, there has been a gross amount of waste in these programs and it should not continue.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are discussing the various reports submitted today by the Auditor- General. Included in that package is Audit Report No. 4 on the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) which deals particularly with Aboriginal student assistance schemes. I would highlight for the benefit of the Senate that some $74.1m was spent on Aboriginal student assistance schemes around Australia last financial year and in the Budget Papers the Government has recently announced that this amount will be significantly increased in the current financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report that we are considering today shows that an investigation by the Auditor-General into the administration of these schemes in the Victorian branch of the Department of Employment, Education and Training found very fundamental administrative and financial weaknesses. Specifically, the report refers to the fact that the proof of aboriginality was not generally sought from applicants; secondly, that enrolment and attendance checks were not undertaken; thirdly, that administrative policies were not adequately developed in some areas and that computer facilities available through the Department's education student assistance system were inadequate and did not, inter alia, facilitate processing of benefits, the application of cheques to avoid duplicate payments, recovery of overpayments or the development of an appropriate management information system. </PARA>
<PARA> We can criticise the Department because of these administrative errors that have been highlighted, but more particularly we need to look at the impact that this has on students. I am familiar with the fact that the problems in Victoria are reminiscent of the problems in the Northern Territory and perhaps nationwide. For example, earlier this year I had representations from some 50 students attending the Northern Territory University who were forced to seek emergency loans as a result of the administrative bungling in the Darwin office of DEET. There were long delays in the processing and payment of Austudy and Abstudy entitlements which meant that some students were forced to wait for six weeks or even longer for their benefits. Not surprisingly, some of these students even considered dropping out of courses. That particular problem is not being appreciated in a debate of this nature. If students are being forced to drop out of courses because of departmental bungling we have a very horrific situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Other complaints that were lodged with me about the Northern Territory Office of DEET focused on high staff turnover, inadequate training, the lack of communication with applicants and an inability to address in-house departmental problems. I highlighted the matter in various press comments in the Northern Territory. It created quite a degree of debate and comment from other people. Perhaps the reaction was best highlighted by a letter to the editor in the Northern Territory News on 15 May this year by a constituent of mine, Mrs C. Shilling of Stuart Park in the Northern Territory, who said:</PARA>
<PARA> I can assure Senator Tambling that six weeks is a very speedy time for processing-the applicant with whom I have been involved has waited for four months. </PARA>
<PARA> During this time there has been incorrect information given, documents mislaid, refusal to answer the phone or return messages and meaningless platitudes to fob off inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA>The matter was addressed, I will accept, by a spokeswoman for the Minister for Employment and Education Services, Mr Peter Duncan, who admitted that the processing of the tertiary student allowances in the Northern Territory took longer than anywhere else in Australia. The reason, she said, was unclear. </PARA>
<PARA> On 26 April this year I wrote to the Auditor-General asking him to look at the administrative practices and the financial procedures within the Department's Northern Territory office, which I considered to be hopelessly inefficient and which had led to very serious errors in the provision of Abstudy and Austudy. I called on the Auditor-General to investigate the local office of the Department and to look at ways of preventing a repeat of the shambles next year. The Auditor-General has responded to me by saying that audits of the State offices of DEET had `detected weaknesses in administrative and financial procedures'. The Auditor-General added that the Australian Audit Office planned to investigate the Abstudy scheme in the Northern Territory in 1989-90. Given what I have read in this report today on the Victorian situation, I do not believe it will be good enough to wait for a subsequent Auditor-General's report for the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> This problem must be occurring right around Australia. The Auditor-General has said that he accepts that he must undertake surveys and studies of the other State offices of the Department, which shows that there must be considerable problems. I have a number of Aboriginal students in my electorate who attend colleges such as Kormilda, a significant secondary college in the Northern Territory. I am aware that students there who are entitled to Abstudy grants have had to wait considerably longer periods than the six weeks or four months that were relevant to the Northern Territory University. These students come from isolated Aboriginal communities such as Lajaimanu in the western regions of the Northern Territory. In trying to sort out the administrative nightmare, the Aboriginal students want to take their problems back to their families but the communication system does not make that a viable option. In fact, the issue has compounded so much that at a meeting of the Isolated Children's Parents Association recently held in Perth a motion was passed condemning the incompetence of the Department of Employment, Education and Training in Darwin and requesting that the head office in Canberra intervene. I certainly hope that that Department is looking seriously at the plight of these Aboriginal students that has now been highlighted by this report on Victoria. I hope it is looking at the magnitude of the problem right around Australia. The situation is intolerable. It cannot be allowed to continue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, this third report to the Australian Government entitled Australia and the Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference is an important document because it deals with a vital area for Australia's well-being, that is, the future trade between Australia and not only Japan, China and the other areas of east Asia but also the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)-indeed, the United States and the whole Pacific region. The great majority of Australia's trade lies in this area and it is understandable that from the early 1980s an initiative has been taken to have a national Pacific cooperation committee. The Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference, PECC, has been held some six times at 18-month intervals, and the last was held in May in Osaka, Japan. Sir Russel Madigan, as Chairman of the National Pacific Cooperation Committee of Australia, has brought this report to the attention of the Australian Government and, by its tabling, recently to the attention of the Parliament and the people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have a very close interest in the increasing success of Australia in trading in the entire region. There is no doubt in my mind that by early next century the Asia-Pacific region will be the centre of world trade. Over the last 400 years since the end of medieval times we have seen a shift in the focus of world trade from the Mediterranean to the North Atlantic and from the North Atlantic to the entire Atlantic Ocean, particularly the trade with Central, South and North America. I believe that the centre of world trade, which has been very much between Europe and the Americas, will be put into the shadow of the majority activity occurring in the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that a very experienced former Australian Ambassador to China, Dr Ross Garnant, has been commissioned by this Government to give a far-sighted analysis of trading prospects in the region. I also want to endorse directly the Australian Government's initiative, supported by the Opposition, to call together in early November the Foreign Ministers of the six and the five-that is, the ASEAN six and the United States, Japan, Canada, New Zealand and Australia-into an 11-nation conference to look at ways of increasing regional trade in the Asia-Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week I represented this Parliament as an observer at the ASEAN interparliamentary organisation and this concept, called the Australian initiative, was one of the principal items for discussion. It is warmly received by ASEAN countries and there is a great deal of expectation about the Foreign Ministers' meeting here in Australia in November. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to draw to the attention of the Senate an article in the Far Eastern Economic Review of 17 August by Mr Jusuf Wanandi, a person whom I have met in Jakarta, where he is the Director of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. He is a far-sighted and excellently qualified person in economic matters. I will seek leave to incorporate that part of his article which refers to principles of cooperation and six introductory points that should govern the cooperation that is being looked to in this Asia-Pacific trade. I would have loved to expand upon those six matters. I happen to agree with Jusuf Wanandi, and I think they fit very well as a contribution to the context of the coming trade. I will therefore seek leave at the end of my speech to incorporate that paragraph in Hansard. I just conclude by commending the work of the National Pacific Cooperation Committee of Australia and the way in which a whole new environment has been achieved in the later 1980s that is of benefit to Australia and the entire region. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The first condition concerns the principles of cooperation. The following six points have been put on the table:</PARA>
<PARA> Pacific economic cooperation should be based on independence, mutual respect and equality. </PARA>
<PARA> This regional cooperation should complement Asean's regional activities and role in the Pacific, and should strengthen multilateral mechanisms for cooperation, particularly Gatt. </PARA>
<PARA> This cooperation should not lead to the creation of an economic bloc or an exclusive trading arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be developed in a gradual fashion and be properly planned. </PARA>
<PARA> The objective of cooperation should be to increase the welfare of the people in the Pacific region and to reduce the gaps between the developed countries and the developing countries in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> This cooperation should contribute to the creation and maintenance of a stable and open trading system, regionally and globally, and a regional environment which is conducive to the promotion of mutual interests, including the ability to resolve regional conflicts peacefully. </PARA>

The Commission was gutted by the Minister and there is no mention of it in this official report, a report not only to this Parliament but to the people of Australia. The Chairman, whom the Minister could not sack but wished to sack because she was appointed under a different clause, a different power, under the ADC Act, that is, by the Governor-General, was then isolated by the Minister's cronies and was not only forbidden to have any impact outside of Canberra in any public place by making any submission but also denied, by some administrative technique, from being able to put any comment of her own in this annual report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, the biographical descriptions that relate to the commissioners happen to be the briefest, the most rudimentary, with regard to the Chairman and are expansive with regard to each of the eight commissioners that were appointed by the Minister on 13 May.

He ceased to hold any of his offices. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that just in those three instances alone there are serious questions to be answered not only by the ADC but also by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs as he is responsible for this statutory authority. I also need to ask in this context, given these sorts of omissions, whether the General Manager's two-page overview at the beginning of the report was, in fact, written by him and whether the signature is his. I want to know whether or not this report, therefore, is bona fide and, if it is not, is it in contempt of this Parliament and the public of Australia? The Minister and the ADC need to answer a lot of questions with regard to these arrangements. It is an inadequate report and I look forward to the report of the Senate inquiry into this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take this opportunity to outline the role of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in relation to the guidelines for the preparation of departmental annual reports. Section 25 (6) of the Public Service Act 1922 requires the Secretary of a department to prepare and furnish to the Minister administering the department an annual report on the department for the year ended 30 June. Further, section 25 (7) provides that the reports prepared under section 25 (6) shall be in accordance with the guidelines from time to time presented to the Parliament by the Prime Minister after approval by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Public Accounts Committee is continuing to review past guidelines. In fact, it is not the only committee that is concerned about this issue. I would certainly like to acknowledge the important contribution that has come from the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, in particular its contribution on the reporting of statutory authorities. That Senate Committee report recommended that urgent action be taken by the Department of Finance and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to develop new draft guidelines and that these draft guidelines should be referred to the appropriate parliamentary committee for consideration. It recommended the Joint Committee of Public Accounts as the appropriate committee. In fact, that Committee has the matter of reporting of statutory authorities under consideration at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to give a number of examples of certain deficiencies. At page 129 of the Defence report for 1987-88 the Secretary of the Department of Defence refers to safety principles for explosives and talks about Australian Audit Office findings, observations and notations. It is significant that there is no mention of any action by the Department in relation to those Audit recommendations. This is a major oversight. These are matters which the Public Accounts Committee is looking at. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, we are concerned that a number of departmental Secretaries are not taking the full responsibility that they should. There is certain evidence that some departmental Secretaries are delegating these responsibilities to subordinates on the basis that they have faith in their colleagues' capabilities. This is a complete abrogation of a Secretary's role in relation to his responsibilities towards meeting the requirements of the Parliament. In fact, the Public Accounts Committee, through its Chairman Mr Robert Tickner, has warned that it will take very stern and tough action against departmental secretaries to ensure that they respond to parliamentary papers in their annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that we took issue with, and took to task, Dr David Charles of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce because he took 18 months to respond to an important report on the offsets program. We were concerned about the superficial and fragmentary nature of the formal Government response to that report. The Public Accounts Committee has certainly put all departmental Secretaries on notice that it expects a higher standard from them and an appropriate response to the existing guidelines. In addition, the Committee and the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration are looking to ensure that guidelines are toughened up in certain areas, particularly in relation to statutory authorities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the report to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) entitled Pulp Mills: Modern Technology and Environmental Protection. The Senate first considered this report on 17 August this year. I heartily endorse the contributions of my colleagues Senators Watson, Puplick, Archer and Stone on that date. I urge people interested in this paper to look at the Senate Hansard of 17 August to see what they had to say in relation to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This report on pulp mills really arises out of the Wesley Vale disaster-I do not think there is any other way to describe it. A proposal was put forward to build at Wesley Vale a pulp mill of major importance to this nation. When I say that it is of major importance to this nation, let me also quote what the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, said in a press release on 18 August 1988:</PARA>
<PARA>This project is very important for the forest industries in Australia. It will mean adding value to the product. It will mean up to $300m net addition to the balance of payments and create an average of 800 jobs in the construction phase each year for three years and then 400 jobs in the operating phase. </PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday, the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh), in an address to the National Press Club, repeated the points which the Opposition spokesmen have been making for 18 months. At last the Government has got the message. Of course, Senator Walsh, while he represents the Government as Minister for Finance, in many cases does not represent the views of his colleagues. But he took up the point that we are all concerned about the environment. We are concerned about many things. We want to do many things. Especially on our side of the chamber we want to do what we can for the aged and the young. We are concerned about education and health. But there is very little we can do unless we get the economy right. This economy is not right. We had an opportunity to do something to alleviate our current account deficit, which has been running at over $17 billion for this year. It will probably be around $20 billion for this year. But Senator Richardson stuck his nose in and told the joint venturers that their proposed plans were not good enough, that there were not sufficient levels of environmental protection. He imposed certain obligations upon the joint venturers, as a result of which they walked away from the project. </PARA>
<PARA> This report, prepared by eminent scientists, discloses the untruth of Senator Richardson's criticism, because the proposal involved a targeted level of effluent toxicity of level 4. That is the highest level aimed at by the rest of the world. For example, the Canadians, who currently have a level of 1 and 2, are hoping to achieve level 3 by 1994. This proposal was at a toxicity level of level 4 right from the outset, yet this Government, through Senator Richardson, destroyed this project, one of the economic projects that may have helped get this country out of its current hole. The environmental level would have been as good as any in the world-better than most countries. The Canadians were aiming for it in the mid-1990s. The proposal was rejected because Senator Richardson stuck his nose in and interfered. So the joint venturers walked away. I say they walked away because that is the truth, notwithstanding the Government's attempt to rewrite history by pretending that they did not walk away. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my pleasure this afternoon, in supporting Senator Chaney's Bill, the Industrial Relations (Directions to Stop Industrial Action) Amendment Bill 1989, to detail to the Senate why we have brought this Bill back on. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) of Australia and his Labor Government are going to learn the hard truth of Abraham Lincoln's saying that you cannot fool all of the people all of the time. Governments will be judged on what they do, rather than on what they say. The core of this problem is that the Labor Government angrily denounces striking pilots while scorning the positive solution put forward by the coalition as recently as a fortnight ago today. It is an absurd proposition for the Government to claim, as it has done repeatedly, that the current dispute is an example of the Opposition's industrial relations policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We must remember that the Labor Government is in office at this time. This strike is happening under the control of a Labor government. It is its policies that are exacerbating this situation. It is the macho mouth of the Prime Minister of this country that inflamed the strike in the first place last week. This Government is at its wit's end to know what to do about it. It is not the Opposition that has changed tack on this issue. It is clearly the Government that has ducked and dived and weaved all over the place trying in vain to find a solution. The solution was quite clearly put by Senator Chaney and my colleagues a fortnight ago. Yet the Government, with the aid of the Australian Democrats, voted against a Bill that would have brought an end to the strike that we are seeing today. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall position held by the Liberal and National parties is clear and logical. It has always been so. Either employees and employers withdraw from the centralised wage fixing system and negotiate binding agreements that are productivity based, or they stay within an arbitration system that is made to work. </PARA>
<PARA> Our Bill was aimed at giving the arbitration commission some teeth. What happened? The Government, aided and abetted by the Democrats, voted against it. The Prime Minister simply cannot have it both ways. The pilots, who make a wonderful propaganda target as tall poppies on high salaries, whose union is not affiliated with the Labor Party and whose members are not generally thought to be Labor voters, are accused of being glorified bus drivers working eight hours a week. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition in no way condones what the pilots are doing. That, I wish to make very clear this afternoon because it is the Government that is trying to give the story that we are condoning the action of the pilots. We are not condoning the action of the pilots. We are putting forward legislation that should enable the pilots to talk with their employers and come to voluntary agreements, as I have said, that are productivity based. So be it if the pilots need to work more hours. So be it if their productivity has to be increased in other ways. At the same time, the Government rejects Opposition legislation that would introduce effective compliance provisions to the Industrial Relations Act. Rhetoric and limited bandaid measures against the pilots strike are easy. But positive and sensible reform is unacceptable to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The rejection of the Industrial Relations (Directions to Stop Industrial Action) Bill was not a mere procedural matter whereby governments follow the established, if not regrettable, practice of rejecting Opposition legislation, simply because it comes from the wrong side of the Parliament. One needs to go back and look at Senator Aulich's contribution but a fortnight ago, Senator Burns's contribution but a fortnight ago, to see how bad and how inflammatory their contributions were, and then have a look at the conduct of the Prime Minister last week. One will then see why this strike has got right out of hand. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting to hear an interjection from Senator Collins that that is rubbish. It would be very interesting to hear from Senator Collins later on in the debate, because he is further down the speakers list, why that is rubbish. Even though the pilots admit, and many Government members are prepared to admit-without wishing to name names-that the Prime Minister did inflame the pilots dispute, the Government voted against a Bill only a fortnight ago just because it was our Bill. It flew in the face of all the support that had been given to the Bill. The Government has just been conned again by Simon Crean from the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU)-the political masters of this Labor Government. It was Ralph Willis who agreed in 1987 with Senator Chaney. He promised to introduce a proper directions procedure that would give the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission some teeth, but he had to back off because Simon said. We are left with an arbitration commission that has no teeth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the employers and the pilots cannot agree to a solution, the matter should go to effective arbitration-and I emphasise the word effective. It has been made quite clear to the Senate that the Labor Party is fundamentally opposed to any commonsense solution such as strengthening compliance provisions to make centralised arbitration work. This Government, on the eve of a disastrous, ruinous dispute, has treated us to the same old pro-union rhetoric which might have been true in the 1890s or the 1930s but which rings very hollow in this day and age of 1989. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, this Bill will fix it. It is a pity for this country that the Government and people like Senator Collins are so narrow minded and so biased that they cannot accept that this legislation will provide a viable solution to what is happening to this country today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have been told by Senator Aulich, who was the leading spokesman for the Government a fortnight ago, that employers are always in the box seat in industrial disputes. We get the same self-interested bleat that `enforced compliance with the law' is not a solution to industrial disputes. What a joke! We have been told by this outwardly macho Government that bringing parties under the scope of common law is the worst possible way to handle industrial disputes. They are the Government's words; they are not mine. These words and the actions of this Labor Government show where its fundamental loyalties lie-with the big battalions of powerful ACTU unions which, in this Government's view, have a God given right to stand outside the law. That is just unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason this Hawke Labor Government has set its face against reform of compliance procedures is that the ACTU forbids it. We all know that a blue collar union that takes action outside wage fixing guidelines and causes massive economic damage will not be faced with legal sanctions and penalties if its good mates in Cabinet can help it. But pilots are different! Can anyone imagine macho Prime Minister Hawke getting stuck into the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia or into the Builders Labourers Federation in the same way as he got stuck into the pilots last week? It is not likely. He would not be giving them a smack in the chops. He would be kowtowing to them, he would be kowtowing to Simon Crean, and doing whatever they wished to try to get them inside the guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> We only need look back to 1987 to see how readily this Government withdrew even the cautious and flawed compliance provisions then put forward that were too much for the ACTU. Yet, the then Minister admitted that it was essential that `there should be an effective means of ensuring adherence to the principles on which the system is founded and compliance with the decisions of its institutions'. They were the Minister's words then. What a shame they were never brought to fruition. What the coalition has proposed is not some radical destruction of the arbitration system. All we are seeking to do is to introduce the sanctions without which it fundamentally cannot work. One has only to look at what bodies such as the Confederation of Australian Industry (CAI) have to say. In a media statement yesterday, Wednesday, 30 August, the Confederation of Australian Industry-the largest employer group in the land-commented that there was a need for sanctions in the industrial relations system. In commenting on the Industrial Relations (Directions to Stop Industrial Action) Amendment Bill the Director General of the CAI National Employers Industrial Council, Mr Bryan Noakes, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The absence of effective means by which the Australian Industrial Relations Commission can enforce its orders and awards is a fundamental flaw in our industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA>Probably the most telling part of this press release is the last paragraph. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> If the Commission had the powers proposed in Senator Chaney's Bill, the deplorable consequences of the action by airline pilots could have been avoided. </PARA>
<PARA>The silence is deafening from the Government now, is it not? The Metal Trades Industry Association Inc. (MTIA) commented:</PARA>
<PARA> In introducing in the Senate a private member's Bill on industrial relations, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Chaney, has done the community a service by focusing attention on the need for long-overdue compliance provisions in the compulsory conciliation and arbitration system. </PARA>
<PARA>Apart from many other things, the MTIA went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's Bill has obviously been carefully drafted with the practicalities of day-to-day industrial relations in mind. It contains no provisions which any fairminded person prepared to abide by the rules of compulsory conciliation and arbitration could object to. On the other hand, it clearly would remove the imbalances which presently exist and which favour recalcitrant unions at the expense of employers who are trying to work within the system. </PARA>
<PARA>But no, the Government still wants to walk away from such a proposal. What the coalition has proposed is something that can and will work. We, according to our policy from which we have not deviated one inch-and I wish I could say the same about the Government but, as I said before, the Government has weaved all over the place and tried to throw the accusations back to the Opposition-would introduce a new division into the Industrial Relations Act 1988 that would allow the Commission to issue directives against industrial action to be followed by provision for Federal Court injunctions against breaches of those directives. Failure to comply would be treated as contempt of court with penalties leading not to gaol, as the Labor Party predictably howls, but to heavy fines that are the real sanctions. The third party suffering loss would be able to sue before the Federal Court. This is the practical solution to a pressing national problem. If the Prime Minister had the fortitude to implement it, he would have the support of the great mass of Australians, unionists and non-unionists alike, who believed in the commonsense principle that umpires must have the means to enforce the rules, and that rules are there to be obeyed. It is a great tragedy for Australia that the business community is losing millions of dollars each day through this dispute, that the Western Australian tourist industry loses $580 for each interstate visitor who cancels a trip, and that we have a Labor Government that does not subscribe to the commonsense principles of justice when it comes to industrial disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> We have people like Pamela Williams who wrote the most dreadful article in the Australian Financial Review the other day saying that we had deviated from our policies. Senator Chaney's response quite clearly stated that it is central to our policy that the best way to conduct industrial relations in this country is with direct employer-employee negotiations at the enterprise level. It is consistent with our policy-not inconsistent as the Government would have people believe-that we believe it is sensible to have direct discussion on what could be done to improve productivity to form a basis for a proper wage rise for the pilots. Senator Chaney described that as a very constructive option. He also said that if that were not acceptable to the parties then and only then would we need to look to effective arbitration. That is where our proposal to give the Commission some real power and some teeth is really needed. All we are getting at the moment is some cheap provocative verbiage while the constructive alternative proposed by the coalition is continually rejected out of hand. It is rejected despite the support it has received from the business community, which has the deepest concern for practical industrial harmony, because it may diminish the power of powerful militant unions who, unlike the pilots, exercise the levers of power over this Labor Government. Madam Acting Deputy President, it will be interesting today to see where the Labor Party stands on this very important Bill that may see Australia get back to some viability. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak on the Industrial Relations (Directions to Stop Industrial Action) Amendment Bill I must admit from the outset that my initial reaction when I discovered that the Bill was to be re-introduced was that all we should do was simply vote against the Bill and not treat it with any regard at all. But in looking at the second reading speech and listening to many of the comments, particularly the comments just made by Senator Knowles, I think it is very important to place on the record quite publicly the fact that this Bill will do absolutely nothing with regard to the airline dispute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will go a little further with that question in a moment but, before I do that, I make one or two comments on some of the things that were said by Senator Knowles. One of her remarks at the outset was that the whole situation was inflamed and she was laying almost all of the blame at the feet of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I think her words were `the macho mouth of the Prime Minister has inflamed the dispute'. That is absolute nonsense. People on the other side continually say, whenever there is an industrial dispute, that the Government should take a hard line and we should not tolerate any sort of industrial disputes at all. Here we have, quite clearly, a situation where a group of people have deliberately set out on a course which will do irreparable damage to the economy of this country and, because the Prime Minister took, quite rightfully, a very hard line on this whole dispute, we are now told from the other side that his macho mouth is the cause of all the problems. It is absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> If we again look at what this Bill would do in terms of the current dispute, the truth is that it would do absolutely nothing. Senator Knowles said that of course it would fix the dispute. That is not true and there is no way that it will fix it. I will be very interested to hear other speakers explain to us how it will. Senator Chaney said in his second reading speech that the current pilots dispute provides a perfect illustration of the powerlessness of the Industrial Relations Commission to enforce its directions. The truth is that there are no employees. All of the pilots have resigned. They are no longer under the jurisdiction of the Commission and there are no awards, so for people to say here that we are putting through a Bill that will impose enormous penalties on people and fix this dispute is patently wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to look a little further and ask ourselves, `What is the real reason behind the introduction of this Bill?'. I have heard it suggested in places that Senator Chaney in fact differs a little from some of the hard liners in his Party in that he believes that all workers should be under the jurisdiction of the Industrial Relations Commission, while others believe that there should be awards and agreements outside the Commission. I quote from his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA>We do not seek to dismantle that system though we would expect that as the advantages of voluntary agreements come to be appreciated more and more, people will move in that direction, but it will not be an overnight change. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course it is not true that Senator Chaney differs at all from the hard line attitude of people on the other side. We have to ask ourselves what is the objective behind this Bill. I think the objective is simply that people are using a dispute in an emotional way to try to get up a Bill that partially gets their industrial relations policy on the agenda and maybe with a bit of luck-I am sorry, they will not have that sort of luck-they might get some base line established that they can add to in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I must admit that thinking about that tactic reminds me of some advice I got many years ago when I first came into the trade union movement as an organiser. I was advised by an official who had been around for many many years. He said to me-in those days we were operating in the real law of the jungle in industrial relations and that is the sort of policy that the Opposition now wants us to go back to-`when the opportunity arises you take what you can, when you can; you establish that, then you go on and you build on it'. I think that is the very tactic that is being employed here now by Senator Chaney and people on the other side. They are trying to take advantage of a situation to get something in place and then later on build on it. I would have to say to Senator Chaney that maybe his tactics are not too bad. The problem is that the objectives are a little bit cockeyed at the moment and it may be that he ought to get some advice from people on this side of the chamber who have, during their lives, actually worked in industry and operated in the industrial system. It may be that we could change some of the objectives and he might see some sense and change some of the aspects of his industrial relations policy. </PARA>
<PARA> If we wonder what this Bill is all about-as I said, it has nothing to do with this dispute-it has the ultimate objective of the Opposition in putting in place punitive legislation that would be used in the future to attack workers in a much weaker position than the airline pilots. It is quite easy for the airline pilots, given their high salaries and the position they are in, for them to get employment somewhere down the track. They can afford to resign. They can afford to dodge around the system. Even if this Bill were in place they could dodge around the system by resigning. But workers on very low rates of pay in a factory would not be in that position. They would not have the luxury of resigning if they found themselves in a very weak position under the Opposition's industrial relations policy. If we had these enterprise unions that it has talked about, there would be thousands of little unions all over this country and people in small groups, in very weak positions, would be trying to compete with employers who had access to all sorts of legal advice and plenty of money behind them to fight them. They would be in receipt of all the necessary market information to be able to cause a dispute whenever it suited them. </PARA>
<PARA> Workers in that situation would have no hope under this legislation and continually those unions and those workers would be financially destroyed or they would be pushed back to work under conditions that, clearly, would be to their great disadvantage. That is really what this Bill is all about. It seems to me that what ought to be happening here and what the Opposition ought to be doing is looking at what is going on in Australia, what the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and this Government are attempting to do, in many instances very successfully. I suggest that the Opposition ought to be giving some thought to how we can do something constructive about some of the problems we face. I would not stand up here and say that we are in a situation where it is not necessary for changes to be made. Of course it is necessary. To a very large degree, we have got a very outdated system. Under the accord and with the award restructuring process that is going on, moves are being made to do something about that, but attitudes that have been built up over many years will not be changed overnight. It is the `them and us' mentality. If we are to achieve the productivity that we keep hearing about from the other side of the chamber, we have to get over that `them and us' mentality. That can be achieved over a period of time by people sitting down and constructively talking about changes in the way industry operates. In the metal trades industry award we are going to have some seven or eight classifications instead of some hundreds. As a result of that, people will get the opportunity to enter training programs and to broaden their skills. That is what we can constructively do about increasing the productivity of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Opposition simply wants to continue down the track of saying that all the problems in industry in this country are created by workers and trade unions. I suggest to Opposition members that they ought to talk to some of the more progressive employers in this country. They are coming to realise that as much as it is the fault of workers-and I am not suggesting for one second that the problems we have had are not to a large degree the fault of workers-it is also as much, if not more, the fault of management which has imposed a middle management system that prevented any sort of interaction between top management and the workers. It kept workers in a position where they could not have any real input into the direction an enterprise was going. People were put in a position where they received no real training and where they were locked totally into a system where they could not really constructively contribute. </PARA>
<PARA> What is being done by the ACTU and the Government in cooperation is to try, in a constructive and cooperative way, to put in place a system where people can receive broad training, can move from one place to another, can be of real benefit, can feel that they are contributing to the productivity of the establishment they are working for and can have some real interest in the future of that enterprise. To simply go down the track of legislation such as that proposed here or to implement many of the proposals in the Opposition's industrial relations policy would be simply to turn the clock back about 50 years, and we would entrench the `them and us' mentality much more than has been the case in the past. All the work that has gone on until now would be thrown completely out of the window. So I say to the Opposition that what it ought to be doing is giving some credit where it is due for the work that is being done by this Government and by the ACTU to really do something about this system. </PARA>
<PARA> I finish on this point in relation to the airline dispute. It is very strange that, while we have these people opposite talking about penalties and all sorts of things, there is no capacity under the current Industrial Relations Act or the wage case decision to settle this dispute. The people who say that obviously have not read the decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. I also wonder whether the representatives of the pilots have. I think it is important to quote from the clause entitled `Special Cases' in that decision. Under this clause and that decision, there is quite clearly capacity for the pilots to argue their case and to get wage increases within the system and not put the whole economy of this country in jeopardy as would the Opposition's policy. I quote from that document:</PARA>
<PARA> Both the ACTU and the Commonwealth contended that increases beyond those generally available for structural efficiency may be approved in special cases, provided that the cases are processed through a special case mechanism and provided there is negligible cost or it can be demonstrated that it should be approved on public interest grounds. </PARA>
<PARA>It says further on in that clause:</PARA>
<PARA> We recognise that there might be some work places where the objectives of the structural efficiency principle have already been achieved and there is no scope for further efficiency improvements. We would expect such instances to be rare. However, any such instances may be processed as special cases. </PARA>
<PARA>In my view, if the airline pilots could not process their case under that provision, then there is something wrong with their leadership and they are not fair dinkum about settling this dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the pilots dispute is concerned, the Opposition has continually said that it is the fault of the Government that no negotiations are going on. I heard Captain McCarthy on AM a few days ago say exactly that, that all they wanted to do was negotiate. That is very good, but when he was asked by the interviewer whether that meant that the pilots were no longer saying they had to get 30 per cent, he said that it did not mean that. The interviewer said, `Well, what does it mean? What is the meaning then of negotiating your terms?'. Captain McCarthy said, `It means sitting down around the table talking'. It is hardly negotiating when one is sitting around the table talking if at the end of the day one is told, `You will give us 30 per cent or you will never get an airliner off the ground'. There is hardly any negotiation in that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am surprised that the Opposition is once again bringing on the Industrial Relations (Directions to Stop Industrial Action) Amendment Bill 1989 [No. 2] in precisely the same terms in which it was debated and defeated in this chamber just over a week ago. Frankly, the shadow Minister for industrial relations is somewhat sterile in what he can produce and suggest in relation to this dispute if he has not changed one word-and he has not-of a Bill, the logic of which was debated and torn to shreds in this chamber last week and which has subsequently been torn to shreds in the media and the press. The shadow Minister ignores realities and brings before this chamber a Bill which is irrelevant to the current dispute that is going on out there in the community. The shadow Minister for industrial relations is simply unable to address in any positive way the current air pilots dispute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I spoke to this same Bill exactly one week ago I said that the Australian Democrats agreed that the compliance provisions in the Industrial Relations Act 1988 were inadequate. Quite obviously, they are inadequate. This strike is testimony that the compliance provisions of the current Act are inadequate. I also said that the reason there are no compliance provisions in this Act is as a result of the position taken by the Opposition in relation to the Willis Bill in 1987 and as a result of the tactical strategy of the Government. The Government pulled the Bill off and removed the compliance provisions. It then brought a Bill which did not have compliance provisions before the Parliament, and it was passed. That outcome was fundamentally a product of the attitude of those in the Opposition, and then they walk back here with some magical solution, which is to shove into the Bill a set of compliance provisions which do not even address the question of penalties and which today in fact address an industrial situation that is totally divorced from the provisions of this Bill because all of those pilots in fact have resigned. So it is obvious-and we all know it-that what is being played out here is purely an empty exercise in politics. It is a waste of the time of this chamber, because this Bill can do nothing about the industrial dispute that is before the community. </PARA>

In fact, we said to it last week that we would welcome discussions with the Opposition and the Labor Party with a view to reintroducing industrial relations legislation in some form with a balanced range of compliance and penalty provisions, which were dropped from the 1987 Industrial Relations Bill because of the position that the Opposition took. We made that offer last week and we have not been approached; nor has one word been changed in this Bill since then-despite the escalation of the strike, despite the resignation of the pilots, and despite the fact that this Bill is utterly irrelevant to the present industrial situation.

Very few of them are Opposition senators, who must frankly be absolutely embarrassed by the fact that their shadow Minister for industrial relations has been unable to amend a single word of a Bill that was defeated in this House last week and is flippant, superficial and wasteful enough of our time to bring it forward after probably one of the most serious industrial disputes in recent decades has advanced by one week.

<PARA> I am sorry that this is going to be embarrassing to some members of the Opposition, but only two days ago the honourable member for Goldstein (Mr Macphee)-I know that they are embarrassed by some of the things that the honourable member for Goldstein says-addressed the Victorian Employers Federation at the Industrial Relations Conference in Melbourne and made a few salient points about the Opposition's industrial relations policy in relation to the present pilots dispute. He said in relation to the pilots dispute:</PARA>
<PARA>It is hard to see room for collective bargaining in Australia. The pilots' dispute shows the consequences of the right to strike and the right to lock out which inevitably go with a collective bargaining system. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a former Opposition industrial relations spokesperson. Mr Macphee also defended the Industrial Relations Commission, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I believe very strongly that the Commission has given employers their best chance for years to rearrange the package of minimum award measures in conjunction with their employees, and to determine any over-award arrangements on productivity considerations, rather than union muscle or regional market rates. </PARA>
<PARA>Once again, it was the honourable member for Goldstein, the former industrial relations spokesperson for the Opposition, who said that. The pilots have been engaging in free collective bargaining. They are doing what the Opposition theoretically wants every employee to do, that is, to reach agreement with his employer outside the guidelines of the centralised industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA> We are watching in operation the Opposition's alternative industrial relations model. The whole country is watching it play itself out, yet the Opposition brings it back time and time again to be embarrassed by the industrial scene playing out the alternative formula.

The 1987 Bill spelt out what penalties would apply for non-compliance with the directives of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.

We invited Opposition senators to sit at the table and come to grips with that, but they have not done so. Even the Australian Council of Trade Unions was reluctantly prepared to support the compliance provisions in the 1987 Bill in return for legislation to bring sections 45d and 45e of the Trade Practices Act into the Industrial Relations Act. The Democrats indicated to the government of the day that we were willing to support such provisions, but the New Right at that stage-purely and simply making political mileage of it then as now-carried on, threatened to spend $9m to blow the Bill out of the water, induced the Government to pull the Bill off, and induced the Government to bring on a Bill which is inadequate in terms of compliance provisions and penalties and which does not address the vexed question of sections 45d and 45e and secondary boycotts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In fact, it was the action of the Opposition which left us with flawed industrial relations legislation, thus giving the pilots the opportunity to bring us into this situation. Nonetheless, Senator Knowles had the gall to stand up and in a totally illogical, uninformed manner point across the chamber, in a typical gesture, saying that all the blame lay with the Government when the blame for the non-compliance provisions of the present Act lies on her side of the chamber. Last week, we simply pointed that out to the Opposition and told it to go away and do its homework and then bring back compliance provisions that make sense and are responsible. We would then consider them. The Opposition has asked what we would do.

<PARA> The fourth point she makes is that the Opposition's policy urges the use of common law, and we are not opposed to that. It is the process which is currently under way in relation to the pilots dispute and is not resolving it. The fifth observation she makes is that the Opposition's policy talks about wage gains being achieved for productivity. That really, to my way of thinking, is only marginally relevant to this situation. I believe that the observations that were made in that article are perfectly valid. They are in fact weaknesses of the alternative model. They do legitimately cite weaknesses of the present model. We are in our present difficult position because we do not have an adequate Industrial Relations Act in place. We do need to improve it, and we have offered to sit at the table and work towards that improvement. We have cited the fact that the present inadequacies reflect a political game between the Opposition and the government of the day which occurred in relation to the Willis Bill of 1987 and left us with a flawed, inadequate Industrial Relations Act. We acknowledge those limitations and we would be more than willing to cooperate in the remedying of them. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, Mr Acting Deputy President, I summarise the Democrats' position. It has not changed in the four discussions we have had on this issue. We have debated it four times in the last six days of sitting and we have not changed our position. We see the Opposition as simply making politics at this stage. When the Opposition stops doing that and starts seriously talking about making legislation, that is when we will cooperate. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I will make about the Opposition's proposal today is that we are simply citing the fact that the pilots' union is a powerful union. They will get what they want because in the model that they are playing out, which is essentially the Opposition's model, they have clout and they will win. Big will win, small will lose. The rich will get richer, the poor will get poorer under the alternative model that the Opposition is proposing and the one which is playing itself out. </PARA>
<PARA> The use of international flights and Air Force planes has been totally inadequate, as we are painfully aware, and we agree that nothing to resolve this dispute has been done. It is certainly not going to be resolved by the passage of a flawed, inadequate, politicking Bill such as the one that is before the chamber today. This has been one of the most destructive industrial disputes that we have seen in Australia in many years. Its long term effect, of course, will be very widespread and we all acknowledge that. The Government is not able to resolve the situation and nor will the proposition that is being proposed by the Opposition here today. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably one of the most significant things to be revealed in the four debates we have had, certainly to my mind and to the minds of the Australian Democrat members, is the inadequacies of the alternative model. They have been revealed to the same extent or more so than the inadequacies of the present Industrial Relations Act, inadequacies which we say essentially result from the political strategies of the Opposition two years ago. It is important that the Australian public realises what we are seeing. The Pamela Williams article, the Michelle Grattan article, and this debate-four times over-have revealed to us that even though we have a flawed Industrial Relations Act in place, certainly we do not have an Opposition that is able to propose an industrial relations model that is significantly better. </PARA>

Let us hope that in the light of the industrial relations disaster currently being acted out in this country for once Labor and Democrat senators might at least acknowledge that it is time to incorporate the provision of sanctions in our industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National parties are seeking to refocus the nation's attention on the long overdue requirement for compliance provisions in our compulsory conciliation and arbitration system. We are arguing strongly for sanction provisions to go into the Act so that in a last resort situation there will be some enforcement provision for wilful breaches of an undertaking or commitment, or to uphold the arbitrator's decision. We have the Industrial Relations Commission currently twiddling its thumbs. It is utterly powerless, while the situation which is knocking this country for six flies in its face. The only sanction which was available to the Industrial Relations Commission was to cancel the pilots' award. Some powerful Commission! The absence of any effective means by which the Australian Industrial Relations Commission can enforce its orders and awards is a fundamental flaw in our industrial relations system and it is a graphic illustration that less than six months after the passage of a new Industrial Relations Act, the inadequacies of the current arrangements have been ably demonstrated by the crippling airline pilots dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has made clear its willingness to support the Government in its bid to conclude this damaging domestic airline pilots dispute. The Opposition does not support the pilots' claim and we have strongly condemned their industrial action campaign. It is no secret that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), despite his harsh rhetoric in attempting to cope with this situation, is yet again treading on egg shells when it comes to taking decisive action to resolve what is proving to be one of the nation's most destructive and debilitating conflicts. All the Prime Minister's henchmen, all the Prime Minister's malignant language, all his cavalcading around the media studios of Australia with his silken-clad assistant, cannot disguise the abysmal failure of the Government's accord with the Australian Council of Trade Unions. It cannot disguise that the accord is producing a repeat year of stagnant productivity and declining real wages. Nor can it protect an inflexible wages system from close scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> Two years ago the then industrial relations Minister, Ralph Willis, promised to introduce compliance procedures that would provide molars for the Arbitration Commission but that Cabinet confidante, Simon Crean, brusquely put a stop to that. Two years later Australia is still waiting for those teeth, having experienced several severe industrial disputes during the intervening time, of which the pilots dispute is but the most recent. Each of these disputes has demonstrated the desperate need for specific and effective compliance provisions. </PARA>

<PARA> We heard earlier from Senator Devereux that one of the problems with our industrial relations system is the `them and us' mentality. I agree with Senator Devereux with regard to that. But the way to overcome the `them and us' mentality is to get industrial relations back to the workplace and to the enterprise level, with direct negotiations between employers and employees, and to get the practice of industrial relations out of the hands of the industrial relations club, out of the hands--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, out of the hands of lawyers, out of the hands of union bureaucrats and out of the hands of Industrial Relations Commission bureaucrats. This, combined with the opportunities for employee-share ownership and profit sharing-which our policy will encourage-will demonstrate both to employers and to employees their common interests and goals. Coalition policy seeks legally binding voluntary agreements. If the parties cannot agree, then effective arbitration is the key. The Opposition has a clear plan to answer the kind of industrial muscle currently being exercised by the pilots and that is encompassed in this Bill currently under debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is an absurd proposition to claim, as Senator Aulich and his Government colleagues have done and as Senator McLean did a few moments ago, that the current pilots dispute is an example of the Opposition's industrial relations policy in action. This dispute is happening under a Labor government, under the accord and under the rest of the present Labor Government's industrial relations policies. It is the Labor Government's policies that are making the dispute so difficult to resolve. As I said earlier, the Opposition does not support the pilots' claims. We have condemned their campaign of industrial action. We believe, however, that the pilots, like all Australian workers, should have the right to negotiate with their employers. But they do not have the right to hold both their employers and the nation to ransom. </PARA>
<PARA> Our proposal is for legally binding voluntary agreements. There is nothing voluntary about the current situation. That gives the lie to Senator McLean's gross misrepresentation of the Liberal-National Party Opposition's policy with regard to industrial relations. In the current dispute, only one side has opted out of the system and no voluntary agreement has been reached. That is where Senator McLean grossly misrepresented our policy, because our policy provides for voluntary agreements between both parties and for both parties to opt out on the basis of that voluntary agreement-not for one side to opt out unilaterally. Senator McLean went on to claim that industrial relations issues would simply be settled by the clout of the particular union involved. That is not the case because unless voluntary agreement is reached-voluntary agreement to which the employer and employee both are party-then the matter should go to effective arbitration. </PARA>
<PARA> In this case, if the employers and pilots cannot agree, the matter should go to effective arbitration. That is where industrial relations clout and union muscle would not be relevant. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that in a moment. That is the clear difference between the reality of our policy and the gross misrepresentation of it we heard a few moments ago from Senator McLean. In contrast, under this Government's legislation there is no way of bringing the industrial action to an end. The only course is a war of attrition, with the dispute dragging on endlessly for weeks and weeks. The Opposition has a clear answer to the sort of industrial blackmail being pursued by the pilots; that is, the Bill which we are currently debating. Regardless of other remedies which should continue to be available to employers, the Commission must have at its disposal a means of dealing with the refusal to accept the processes of conciliation and arbitration established in the community interest. If the Commission is not so empowered, then conciliation and arbitration become meaningless as a system for the resolution of conflict.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The current domestic airline dispute will not be resolved by Australian Labor Party rhetoric, nor will any other industrial disputes. The Federal Government's shameful record with other unions will attest to that. Look at the ongoing sickness on our waterfronts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Vanstone for her encouragement. The Prime Minister is on record as claiming that pilots are exceptionally greedy and that if they gained their pay claims it would wreck the whole wage fixing system, which he falsely claims has produced for the great bulk of Australians a much better say. The Prime Minister is right about one thing. Under the present Government's approach the whole wage fixing system will be wrecked because the Government refuses to admit the shortcomings of centralised wage fixing. If the pilots succeed everyone will jump on the band wagon and will want a flow-on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is what traditionally happens in this country under the present system: workers get an increase whether they have contributed to lifting the country's productivity or not. What kind of wage fixing system do we have when Uncle Tom Cobleigh and all get a pay hike based on union muscle with unions holding the nation by the throat and costing it billions of dollars in lost national income rather than contributing to increasing the productivity and profitability of employers and thereby the national wealth and international competitiveness of Australia?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been caught out. It will not go for the jugular and throw the Trade Practices Act at the pilots. It is to the eternal credit of the previous Fraser coalition Government that it provided this avenue. Jay Pendarvis took the initiative in applying sections 45d and 45e of the Trade Practices Act and winning in the Mudginberri case. The Dollar Sweets case in Victoria was another victory in the use of common law torts. That is another case where a union was totally and utterly out of line in its behaviour. The Government cannot make any headway because it has tied its hands behind its own back and it is fighting with no armour in the absence of effective compliance legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government could have invoked an array of strategies available under the Crimes Act to end this dispute. Instead we are subjected to venomous and cheap talk from the Prime Minister about how anyone can fly a plane and how bus drivers and airline pilots are nearly one and the same. This is how, in his fading years, the Prime Minister deals with an industrial relations conflict of the highest order. No wonder the waterfront unions are having the time of their lives. The only certainties are that this Hawke Government is big on talk, big on inaction and really big on its inability to give the Industrial Relations Commission effective sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government is directly responsible for the current failure in Australian industrial relations becoming one of the most serious in our history. The claims by the Prime Minister and by Senator Devereux-and Senator McLean, speaking for the Democrats in this debate-that this Bill that we are putting up is useless because the pilots have gone outside the system is utter nonsense. Because the Commission has cancelled the pilots' award it does not take the dispute out of the Commission's jurisdiction. Commissioner Paine pointed out only yesterday that the dispute could still be dealt with by the Commission `in accordance with the process afforded by the Act'. There is still an industrial dispute between the Australian Federation of Air Pilots and the airlines. Therefore the Commission still has jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> If this Bill is passed the Commission could reinstitute the pilots' award. If the Federation continued to tell its members not to work, it would be in breach of section 187a (3) (c) of the Act as amended by our Bill; that is:</PARA>
<PARA>it would be engaging in conduct that hinders, prevents or discourages: . . . (c) the acceptance of, or offering for, work in accordance with an award. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission could then make a direction aimed at the Federation. But, of course, the real point of the debate as to whether there is or is not jurisdiction in relation to our legislation is that if this legislation had already been in place before the dispute got under way this protracted dispute could have been avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> This strike in particular is a phoney war of inaction and ongoing dispute, despite the Prime Minister's support for airline management. The winners will be the ones who can hold their breath the longest. No matter what judgments are eventually obtained, I will bet that to ensure the planes fly again no punishments will be handed out at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Given the complete absence of effective compliance provisions, there is absolutely nothing else the Government can do except to grin and bear it. It is not only this Government which is grinning and taking it on the chin. Individuals in our community are being stood down, the tourism and hospitality industries are losing millions in income and productivity is on a speeding bullet down the drain once again. People across this country are being inconvenienced and international tourists may never come back, if in fact they have arrived here at all in the last couple of weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Together Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines turn over in excess of $2 billion annually. Their profits would be about $200m. When pilots worked office-type hours a couple of weeks ago, both airlines lost about $2m a day. It would cost both airlines about $100,000 a day to give in to the pilots' 30 per cent wage increase demand. So the airlines have a big incentive to settle, despite the size of this claim. The cost of keeping aircraft on the ground for both airlines in the event of almost total shutdowns is around $600,000 a day. On the one hand, the Government cannot allow such a settlement because of its ill-considered ideological commitment to centralised wage fixing and the consequences of a flow-on, but on the other hand, in the absence of effective sanctions legislation, the Government is powerless to end the pilots' action. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill offers a real alternative because its compliance provisions would ensure that the Industrial Relations Commission could stop industrial action. Under the new division to be inserted into the Industrial Relations Act 1988 the Commission would be empowered to issue directions to prevent such actions and have substantial penalties imposed for the breach of such directions, while the right for common law and section 45 actions would be retained. </PARA>
<PARA> To summarise the provisions of our Bill, first, they empower the Industrial Relations Commission to give directions to stop industrial action; secondly, they empower the Federal Court of Australia to grant an injunction where such direction is breached; thirdly, they allow people to sue for damages caused by such breaches; and fourthly, they retain access to common law and other external legal actions for those detrimentally affected by breaches. </PARA>

As I was saying before that interruption, speed is of the essence in settling industrial disputes. Businesses can be ruined by any delay in the settlement of such disputes. It is important to have sanctions provisions in industrial relations legislation because a speedier resolution of a dispute can be reached than would be the case under common law. So such sanctions will be a useful alternative to the use of common law even if they are rarely required to be used. These sanctions will provide the molars for the Commission which will give it the authority it has always lacked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our Bill has been carefully put together with the practicalities of daily industrial relations problems in mind. It contains no provisions to which any fair-minded person prepared to abide by the rules of compulsory conciliation and arbitration could object. It also removes the imbalances which presently exist and which favour recalcitrant trade unions at the expense of employer groups which are attempting to work from within the system. The practical nature of our proposal has previously been recognised by the expert day to day practitioners in the field of industrial relations. This has been further reinforced this week by the Confederation of Australian Industry which said:</PARA>
<PARA>If the Commission had the powers proposed in Senator Chaney's Bill, the deplorable consequences of the action by airline pilots could have been avoided. </PARA>
<PARA>So much for Senator McLean's remarks that this Bill is impractical. The expert practitioners of industrial relations have on a number of occasions said that this Bill goes to the heart of the problem of industrial relations and the requirement for sanctions. As I said, the Confederation of Australian Industry is yet another body expert in industrial relations which has reinforced that view this week. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has gained no ground with its confrontationist approach, however concerned it may have been about the consequences of the pilots gaining a favourable settlement of their claim. These feared consequences need to be addressed because they go to the heart of the weaknesses of the centralised wage fixing system. From the outset, Prime Minister Hawke took the lead in a confrontationist and high profile way in a dispute in which the Government was not directly involved. The Government supported the cancellation of the pilots' award by the Industrial Relations Commission. It supported the use of common law actions against the pilots and the use of military and foreign planes to provide replacement services. It has threatened to call in foreign pilots to fill vacancies created if Australian domestic pilots go overseas to work. </PARA>
<PARA> So we have 1,400 pilots controlling the economic stability of Australia's remaining seven million-plus wage and salary earners. But if it were not the pilots, it would be the wharfies or the metal trade unionists or the transport workers. Under our antiquated industrial relations system, any group can hold a gun at our heads and virtually get away scot-free with their scoop of prizes. One thing is for sure, the pilots dispute seems likely to hasten the transformation of our industrial relations system to one that permits greater flexibility. If there were no semi-automatic flow-ons to the entire work force from settlement of the pilots claim, it would seem likely that the dispute would be rapidly settled. So this legislation requires urgent passage to ensure that the dispute can be settled. Irrespective of that, it will remain for the next coalition government to undertake the complete overhaul of our industrial relations system which is so urgently needed. </PARA>

That is the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill does not even apply now in terms of issuing directions in this dispute because the airlines no longer have any employees-they have resigned. I quote Senator Austin-`five-per-cent' Lewis when he introduced this legislation and said:</PARA>
<PARA> The chief advantage of this approach is that it would provide a quick and effective remedy to unacceptable industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA>How? Under the legislation which the Opposition wants to introduce, in terms of amending the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, a dispute will still have to go to the Federal Court. We have this thing called the separation of powers in our Constitution which means that such disputes will still have to go to the Federal Court and Senator Chaney, at least, is accurate enough to say that. How can one provide a quick and speedy resolution if the matter still has to be argued in front of the Federal Court in exactly the same way as one has to argue the sanctions of the Trade Practices Act in front of the Federal Court? There is no quick and speedy resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chapman talked about the lack of sanctions to bring against unions. `No teeth' he said. I went through this yesterday. I ask Senator Chapman to listen to the sanctions that are currently available. He obviously did not listen yesterday, so I will go through them again. These are the sanctions that are currently available in this country against unions: sections 45d and 45e of the Trade Practices Act, which deal with secondary and primary boycotts; common law industrial torts that permit actions for damages; sections 30j and 30k of the Crimes Act 1914; the bans clause procedures under section 125 and sections 181 to 186 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988; cancellation or suspension of awards under section 187 and deregistration under section 294 of that Act. Under a new provision in the 1988 Act the Commission may also refuse to deal with a matter raised by an organisation in breach of an award or direction of the Commission, and there is the discretionary power of the Commission to withhold national wage case increases from parties. It is a pretty hefty range of sanctions. As I pointed out previously, it is a greater range of sanctions against trade unions in this country than anything that Margaret Thatcher has brought in during her 10 years of administration. Margaret Thatcher has brought in legislation which provides that where unions take industrial action by means of a secret ballot, a limited immunity from common law action is provided and, further, a statutory limitation is put on damages that can be paid. There are no limitations of that kind in this country. We have a pretty hefty range of sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA> All this has to be argued in front of the Federal Court, and that takes time. I am very familiar with the Mudginberri dispute. It took two years of court actions to resolve that and millions of dollars in legal costs. The sanctions which the Opposition wants to bring in through the amendments it introduced this afternoon will still have to be argued in front of the Federal Court, and I do not know anything that will be fixed quickly in front of the Federal Court. If the interests of both parties are to be fully protected by the systems we have in our courts, it is very hard to imagine how it could possibly be any other way. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been some mention here this afternoon of how some remarks made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) have allegedly exacerbated this debate. There are two remarks I would like to make about that. Firstly, I would like to quote the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Chaney) in an interview-I might add, I totally agree with him-that he gave on 18 August this year with reference to a criticism about this legislation exacerbating the debate. The words of Senator Chaney can also be applied to the statements made by the Prime Minister. Senator Chaney said:</PARA>
<PARA>How in the world could you exacerbate this dispute; Pvu? I mean, the thing has got to the point where the pilots are imposing the most massive penalties on the community and on their employers, and it's hard to see that they could do any worse. </PARA>
<PARA>I say amen to that. I will tell the Opposition what will exacerbate this dispute. What will exacerbate this dispute is the totally irresponsible and disgraceful actions of the Opposition's conservative colleagues in the Northern Territory Parliament who, at a quarter past four this afternoon, gave themselves a 30 per cent pay hike. That is unbelievable. I say that with some degree of anger. We, in the Northern Territory, are probably affected by this pilots dispute to a greater extent than most of Australia. We have no alternative means of travel available to us up there. Frankly, I am almost in a state of total disbelief that the idiots who run the Northern Territory Government-I have known for many years they are idiots-could be so idiotic that in the middle of this dispute, while complaining at the dreadful damage this dispute is doing to our tourist industry-and the damage is becoming more serious by the day, I might add-they could debate a pay rise for an entire day in the Northern Territory Parliament and, at 4.15 this afternoon, vote themselves a 15.4 per cent immediate increase in their salaries with a further 15 per cent flowing on 1 January next year. It is beyond me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are not subject to anything in the Northern Territory. It is beyond belief that they have done this. The Opposition talks about exacerbating the dispute. Opposition senators might have a word with Northern Territory parliamentarians to see whether they can make them change their minds. I literally cannot believe what they have done. We are talking about a group of politicians-I was a member of the Assembly for 10 years-that has a Parliament that sits for 21 days out of 365. It has virtually no committee system, in the sense of having committees which work during the recess. To give one example, the town of Alice Springs, a town of 22,000 people, is represented by four State-if the Northern Territory can be called a State and, for all intents and purposes, it can-members of Parliament with average electorates of 2,500 people. That is fewer than most people on city councils in this country have got. Those politicians sit 21 days a year in Parliament and, in the face of what is potentially the most crippling and damaging industrial dispute-certainly for the Northern Territory, but also for Australia-they have voted themselves a 30 per cent pay hike. It is beyond belief. In terms of exacerbating the dispute perhaps honourable senators opposite could have a yarn to their colleagues in the Northern Territory and tell them to think again. To return to this legislation-</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know that it is, Madam Acting Deputy President, because this is such a lousy Bill. Getting back to this lousy Bill, Senator Chaney has argued that we have to have this legislation because it will result in the Commission being able to issue directions, and it will fix everything. Let us have a look at that proposition. Had the directions procedures set out in this Bill been enacted and then acted upon prior to the pilots dispute-prior to their resigning en masse on Thursday, 24 August-they may have led to the Federal Court issuing injunctions within, at best, a day or two of the Commission's direction having been ignored. If the injunctions were then ignored, action could be commenced for contempt and-I say this on the basis of the experience I had with the Mudginberri dispute-the hearing would take some months. This Parliament has not and should not have any direct control over how the Federal Court conducts its business. Litigation at this level, where this amount of money is involved, tends to become very lengthy, as it did with Mudginberri, and as it would with this dispute under the coalition's legislation, under this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Actions for damages could also be brought against the pilots, as Senator Chapman has said quite correctly. Again, this procedure would be lengthy. But these procedures are always lengthy. This sounds reasonably impressive, but in reality it is not. In this dispute the same remedies were available to the airlines under the procedures set out in the Trade Practices Act, section 45d, and under common law. Prior to the pilots handing in their resignations, the employers could also have opted to use the bans clause procedures which have been streamlined under the new Act. This may have been a useful tactic if the airlines had wished to avoid inflaming the dispute or if they had wanted to avoid creating some sympathy for the pilots that could flow from the imposition of the draconian penalties under the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The existence of the directions procedures proposed by the Opposition, which are to solve everything, would probably only have prompted the pilots to bring forward their resignations to escape the extended operations of the Act under section 5. This may have had the somewhat perverse effect of further limiting the liability of the pilots to actions for civil damages by reducing the length of the period that they appear to have been in breach of their contracts of employment. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a lot of big holes in Senator Chaney's proposal. Given the apparent-and I am being kind-militancy of the union, it is doubtful whether any package of sanctions consistent with the existence of a free society would have produced a different outcome. In the circumstances, the most that can be said is that it may have persuaded the Pilots Federation to follow different industrial tactics. Not, I might add-having had a look at its history of industrial negotiations; and I canvassed it the day before yesterday-that it has ever done that. It might also be noted that the imposition of fines and penalties at any stage, but especially early on, may further complicate the matter and delay return to work and a final resolution of the actual dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> Having dealt with the pilots dispute, it is reasonable to consider whether this legislation would assist the resolution of disputes in other areas because, although everyone is concentrating on the pilots dispute, this legislation does not apply simply to that. It is extremely doubtful whether the Opposition's amendments to this Act would help in any other situations where employees have taken themselves outside the formal system of conciliation and arbitration. That is the big agenda that is being fought now and, if honourable senators doubt that, I recommend that they look at the history of industrial negotiations by this union since 1959. The big agenda is not just the 30 per cent pay hike, although, as I said the other day, the two constants in how this Federation operates are behaving like bloody-minded thugs and always going for double figures. That is its history. </PARA>
<PARA> The big argument is taking itself outside the system, not just our system but the Opposition's system as well. That point seems to have been lost on all Opposition members. That is the big agenda that the Pilots Federation is fighting at the moment, and has always fought. Other industries, with the exception of those mentioned in section 5, do not attract the extended jurisdiction of the Act, although it does cover waterfront employees and Commonwealth public servants. Where employees resign, unions cease to be registered or have their awards cancelled and they escape all of the procedures contemplated by this legislation. Nonetheless, they remain liable under the relevant provisions of the Trade Practices Act and the common law. At this point I think I could probably rest my case, but I will not. </PARA>
<PARA> It was also noted by my learned and erudite friend Senator Cooney that the Bill does not confine the orders that the Court may make to fines. It would be possible for the Federal Court to imprison those whom it found to be in contempt of its rulings. The honourable senator also drew attention to the fact that clause 187e of the Bill reverses the onus of proof with respect to persons and organisations who may have acted in breach of the proposed directions procedures. That is important to note. Neither of those deficiencies in the Opposition's Bill, I can assure honourable senators, commends itself to me. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter that has to be looked at in respect of this legislation is the Opposition's approach to secret ballots. The industrial relations policy of the coalition, such as it is, states:</PARA>
<PARA>A Liberal National Party Government will strengthen the provisions in the Act relating to secret ballots to make ballots compulsory before industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA>It should be noted by the Senate that the coalition does not propose to mirror the Thatcher Government's Trade Union Act of 1984, which I have just mentioned, and which continued some immunity from actions for damages where a secret ballot had been held. In the present dispute the pilots have taken part in at least one secret ballot. This does not appear to have headed off the dispute. Indeed, in some respects it has given a degree of legitimacy to the pilots' action and has made it more difficult for anyone to say that the pilots are simply being led on-this is always the cry from the Opposition-by irresponsible union leadership. This Government believes that such ballots are desirable only when they may assist in the resolution of disputes and not where they can be used to harden the attitude of the parties. Hence, under sections 135 and 136 of the current unamended Act, the Commission has discretion to order such a ballot, and a ballot can be ordered even when requested by a relatively small percentage of the workers involved in the dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's stated policy encourages the creation of voluntary agreements-we have heard so much about this this afternoon-between employers and employees at the enterprise level, with wage increases to be based on productivity improvements and trade-offs. At the same time, the policy states that the Opposition will enhance the current array of sanctions available under the Act and maintain other statutory sanctions and common law rights of actions, such as all the ones I have just mentioned-and they are horrific. What the policy does not state-and I look forward to hearing it stated by the speakers who are to contribute to the debate later-is how a coalition government would, firstly, manage the transition from the present system to a more market-driven approach, which is what it says it is and, secondly, measure productivity, both at the economy-wide level and at the level of the individual enterprise. I might ask: which measure of productivity would a coalition government use-a total factor productivity or labour productivity?</PARA>
<PARA> A very salient point was made in this respect by Senator Macklin in debate the other day: how does one measure productivity, in terms of laying down rules for commissions or courts to apply productivity in a whole range of occupations? That is a big question. How would one then judge whether productivity agreements were genuine, and how would one determine which parts of the work force were entitled to opt out of it and which parts had to be kept within it by sanctions to avoid a wages break-out? There are a lot of big questions there, that no-one in the Opposition has so far addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said before, the basis of a free collective bargaining system is that sanctions are virtually non-existent. The only sanction on the parties is market forces. Indeed, I had some conversations with some of the market force adherents in the honourable senators' Party this morning who agreed with that. If, for instance, the pilots were to gain increases of 30 per cent, the discipline on them is that they may price themselves out of a job-which they would. In the absence of market imperfections, such as the two-airline agreement-and the trouble with our society is that there are so many imperfections in these lovely theoretical models-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. The only sanction necessary or appropriate is that the parties honour the terms of their existing contracts. Now that the pilots have brought their contracts to an end, they owe no duties and have no rights. I cannot understand why the Opposition seems to be unwilling to accept this proposition in the case of pilots but does accept it in the case of executive remuneration. What it boils down to, of course, is that one person's blackmail is another person's collective bargaining.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition may well argue that the existence of trade unions creates market imperfections and an unevenness of bargaining power, but so does the existence of so-called limited liability companies-not that that means anything. The problem for all sides is that the pilots are neither fish nor fowl-although they are pretty foul. They see themselves as executives but they want to employ the bargaining tactics of organised labour and capital. They are not unique in this. Doctors, engineers, salaried lawyers and most independent contractors have operated inside and outside the arbitration system at different stages in the past. In setting the price for their labour, such groups will be motivated by the desire to advance their own interests. Unlike most workers, however, their participation in the system is not necessarily linked to the support of the system. That is absolutely the case with the Pilots Federation, and it always has been. Indeed, professional groups, and this most militant of white-collar worker unions in this country, are totally antipathetic to the system-not only to our system but also to Senator Chaney's system too. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not altogether surprising that the pilots and the supporters of a deregulated labour market should blame the accord and the arbitral system for their current discontents. One can treat the accord and the system of industrial tribunals as a kind of social compact between various groups and interests in our society. One object of these social compacts is to reach market solutions-decent wages, full employment, low inflation, and sustainable rates of return on investment through non-market means. Under a market approach, it is possible to argue that the pilots should be given a wage rise-in other words, they should be given a greater claim on the community's resources-in the knowledge that this will lead to increased pressure on companies to ration their resources more efficiently between capital and labour so that in time work practices will change and greater efficiency will be achieved. That is how it is supposed to work. One problem with this approach is what happens in the meantime. The cost of bargaining, which is not just confined to the actual number of working days lost or even to the inconvenience caused to third parties, is a major reason for resorting to non-market arbitrated solutions. That seems to have been totally lost, I might add, on the Northern Territory Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Another justification for forcing parties to adhere to the system is that the system itself is a product of community goals and aspirations expressed by government. The pilots, as much as they might like to, cannot pick and choose between one system and another. Sorry, pilots. Income shares will be influenced by the ability of differing and competing groups to press their claims at the expense of others. Accordingly, the community has an interest in ensuring that free riding on the system-whatever the system is: accord or market based-is kept to a minimum. That, of course, is where the Opposition's heavy sanctions, as it keeps on saying, come from. This is not to endorse the so-called doctrine of comparative wage justice; it is merely to recognise the fact that there is a community of interest between all persons with a claim on the community's wealth. Merely stating, as the Opposition does, that its policy would encourage greater cooperation between employers and employees does nothing to resolve disputes where the parties cannot agree or where the agreement of one group leads to a widening of the dispute to new parties which see themselves as disadvantaged by the settlement that is struck by the original disputants. That is totally lost on the Opposition. It says, in the simple-minded approach, this Isle of Eden approach, it has to industrial relations, `Under our system, if one section of the market force, even if it is represented by an organised union, gets 30 per cent, no-one else will get it. There won't be a flow-on because we say it won't happen'. That is not how it works in this far from perfect world. It is human nature to say, `If you get it, I want it'. That is how it works. Under this system it will not function, it will not operate; it will break down because of that situation. Other people will see themselves as disadvantaged by this amicable settlement reached by the two people in the Opposition's theoretical model. </PARA>
<PARA> The particular problems that some critics ascribe to the existence of the accord and the tribunal system have arisen previously under different wage fixing arrangements. Changed institutional arrangements alter the means of dealing with the problem. Any approach which is based on consent is likely to strike difficulties where consent is hard to find. Where the parties are intractable, some form of sanctions may have to be resorted to to protect wider interests. This does not mean that the sanctions should be used as a first resort, nor does it mean that the whole of the employer-employee relationship should be fashioned to suit just one particular situation in the community. As I said before, for the Opposition to raise the proposed directions procedures in its legislation in this way, for the second time within a week, when existing remedies have not been fully tested and where the proposed changes would affect the rights of all employer and employee organisations, might not be seen by some critics as being a genuine attempt to resolve the current dispute. And, of course, it is not. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that nothing contained in this legislation can affect this current dispute. I wish to God that it could. If it could, I might well vote for it. But the trouble is that time has overtaken this legislation. We are now looking down the barrel of probably one of the most disastrous industrial disputes that this country has seen for some considerable time. I must say that, having had a very careful look at the history of industrial negotiations conducted by this union, it does not give one any encouragement whatsoever that there will be an easy resolution of this dispute. The problem is that the constants I have mentioned before are there for everyone to see in respect of all of the action that has been taken by the Pilots Federation. The first constant is a total disregard for the wider community interest when it conflicts with its own self-interest. The second constant is that the pilots have always gone for very large hikes in their salaries and conditions. The third constant is that they have always won. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason that this elite group has always won is that when faced with the absolutely crippling cost to the community it has always been able to inflict in past disputes, either one or other of the parties involved has quickly capitulated, buckled under, and paid up. Usually it is Ansett Airlines of Australia, for obvious reasons. Quite often it is the trade union movement itself, and certainly it is the government on every occasion. The result is that we are now in the current situation where the productivity of Australian pilots in comparison with their salaries is the worst in the world. As the Federation said last year-and I am not begrudging this highly professional group of extremely skilled people this position one iota-it has landed them in a situation where they have `the best pay and working conditions of any group of pilots in the world'. That is the trouble with this dispute. What the pilots want is the best plus 30 per cent. I must say that I am glad that the one piece of common ground which does exist and which appears to solidly exist-at least in the Federal Parliament-between the Government and Opposition parties is that, considering the pilots' current pay and working conditions and the current circumstances, it is an outrageous demand that should not be met. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that this dispute will be resolved shortly. I commend once again the advice given to the pilots by Dr Blain in the policy section of his excellent work on the subject, that is, it is certainly not in the interests of this country-and it is not in the interests of the pilots either-to have any more prolonged disputes similar to the 28-day dispute of Qantas Airways Ltd in 1966 which resulted in disastrous consequences. I, like every member of this Parliament, am asking all of the parties in this dispute to bring it to some sort of resolution by one means or another and to do it quickly for the sake of the country and for the sake of themselves, not for the sake of any political party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have much pleasure in speaking in support of the Industrial Relations (Directions to Stop Industrial Action) Amendment Bill 1989, the Bill presented in this chamber by Senator Chaney some weeks ago, rejected by the Government and the Australian Democrats, and now come back like the ghost of Christmases past to haunt us. If ever there were a Bill whose time had come, it is this Bill. The events of the last few weeks and the current pilots dispute have provided a perfect illustration of the powerlessness of the Industrial Relations Commission to enforce its directions. What Senator Chaney's Bill sets out to do is to put some sanctions and some teeth into the Industrial Relations Bill. Those teeth are quite effective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the present time we have a strike that is going on and on. The Government has no interest or ability to control the events. The pilots are not talking to the employers and the airline employers are not talking to the pilots. That would all be fine and well except that this country is losing millions and millions of dollars per day as a consequence of an outdated industrial relations system that the Australian Labor Party is persisting to support. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only is Australian industry, particularly the tourist industry, losing millions of dollars per day. We will also lose more money because of the great damage that has been done to our reputation and the tourist industry for years to come. When we think about the $10 billion or $12 billion-it is very hard to put an exact figure on it-that Australians have invested in not only building three, four and five star hotels on the tourist sites of this country, but also building all the infrastructure to support them-modifying airports, providing Customs services, transport services, entertainment and the other things that we have done that build up this industry-it is absolutely criminal that a situation should exist where we have no control over what is happening because of the persistence of the Labor Party with an entirely archaic system.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney's Bill will provide a means of applying sanctions in the Industrial Relations Commission. There are those people around in the Labor Party who do not want to be sanctioned in any way at all. They do not want to be brought under the rule of law. They want to rule without respect for their fellow man. Society is far too complex these days to indulge these little idiosyncrasies of living for yourself and having no thought for the welfare of the community about you. When we talk about putting sanctions into industrial relations, the Labor Party goes back 20 years or more to the days of Clarrie O'Shea and the way it was impossible decades ago to put any teeth into industrial relations. But if the Labor Party got out of its ivory tower and dealt with the real Australian community, it would find that there is a very different social attitude out there today. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians are tired of the way the archaic industrial relations system we have is dragging our standard of living down. They want something different; they know something different is possible; they know that there is a better way of doing it. The Liberal Party and the National Party have said that they do not mind unions, industrial relations and the Industrial Relations Commission remaining, provided it has the ability to enforce its judgments. But we are also saying in parallel with that that it is time Australia matured into an industrial relations climate where we had voluntary agreements that would be binding on both parties because they enter into them voluntarily. That is the way industrial societies are going for the benefit not only of the employer and the employees but for the welfare of the whole community. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that the Labor Party has fastened on in relation to Senator Chaney's Bill is the rather specious claim that it is our policies in practice that have produced the present situation. Nothing could be further from the truth. We are not in government, sadly, although it is only a few months away. The Labor Government is in power and it is its principles and support for the industrial relations policy that have brought all this about. It believes in a centralised wage fixing system. It believes that what an employee in Melbourne gets is the rate that someone should get in Darwin, Port Hedland or Longreach, irrespective of the profitability of the industry that is involved. It is locked in as inflexibly as the dinosaurs were four or five ice ages ago to a system which is now no longer applicable. In no sense is the present circumstance a consequence of our actions. It is very much a consequence of the Labor Party's actions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party and the National Party do not support strike actions. We do not deny people the right to strike, but we do believe that there is a sense of responsibility that people must have in the Australian community. We are now far too complex a society and far too interdependent, one on another, to allow people to hold our society to ransom, and we certainly do not support the pilots strike. We certainly do not support any strikers who are holding the community to ransom and causing us a huge cost. </PARA>
<PARA> We would be right behind the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), if he would come out of his funk-hole, take the strikers on and do something effective. But in three weeks, apart from some intemperate and irrational abuse by the Prime Minister, we have not seen one constructive move by him to resolve this issue. The old superman from the trade union movement does not have the people on the ground that he used to have in the days when he was in the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). </PARA>
<PARA> We were plagued by strikes when Mr Hawke was President of the ACTU. The strike would get going, somebody would resolve it and Mr Hawke would come in and claim the credit. It seems these days that there is no-one around prepared to do the negotiating work for him, so nothing is coming out of Mr Hawke. The Liberal Party and the National Party would be right behind him if he took any constructive moves at all to resolve this issue. And we will be right behind him when when he takes on the waterside workers, the coal workers, the Transport Workers Union and all the people who put Senator McKiernan in here as their nominee. But we do not see the faintest sign of any balance or courage in what the Prime Minister and the Labor Party are doing. </PARA>
<PARA> Only last week when the practices of the waterside workers were under threat in the port of Brisbane on a grain loading exercise, the Prime Minister lent on the Queensland Grains Council to pull out its support for the move to get an efficient work force in loading that grain. Senator McKiernan is only one of the parliamentary spokesmen for Mr Hawke's vested interest, the trade unions. It is not a matter of the trade unions being a function of the Labor Party; it is a matter of the parliamentary Labor Party being the political wing of the trade union movement. It is when those interests are challenged that Mr Hawke does not do anything constructive about industrial relations in Australia. So we do not support the pilots and we certainly do not support any group that is holding the Australian community to ransom. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us reflect on some of the double dealings of this Hawke Labor Government. First of all I will refer to the use of strike breakers. Those of us who were in this chamber when we were in government know the enormous opprobrium and abuse that was hurled at us when we took constructive means to end a strike and get alternative sources of labour. </PARA>
<PARA> The greatest crime in the Labor Party trade union hagiography is strikebreaking. From day one, the Labor Party has been right up to its armpits in strikebreaking. First of all, it uses the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). The defence forces should not be used except in an emergency, and this is not an emergency. This is a matter that has arisen through the bungling of the Labor Party. But to get the Services to do what is essentially a political task in the way the Labor Party has done with the RAAF is absolutely an abuse of power. The Services will do it because they are loyal and disciplined. But the RAAF is not enjoying what it is doing one little bit. It is starved of resources. We heard today in answer to a question from Senator Reid that money is not going to the RAAF. There is a mickey mouse, fictional hourly charter rate on these services. When the RAAF finds that it is short of money, as I know it will, the Government will then try to shore it up by the use of supplementary estimates. The Air Force is getting nothing out of running these services around Australia. It is an abuse to be using the Services in a situation where no emergency exists. </PARA>
<PARA> Overseas airlines are interlining between the Australian States. Deeply in debt as we are to the tune of about $130 billion through the mismanagement of the Treasurer, Mr Keating, we are now losing millions of dollars a day by overseas airlines taking revenue out of the country. Charter groups are being licensed to fly in Australia although there is dubious surveillance of their safety standards. In fact, the normal procedures of the Civil Aviation Authority are not being followed because the Government is leaning on the Authority and putting the safety of the Australian travelling public at risk. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the adjournment of this debate at lunchtime today, I was drawing very important comparisons between the annual reports of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) for 1986-87 and 1987-88. I believe that I demonstrated to the Senate the very deliberate and nasty work of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) in July 1987 when he took over the portfolio and the very radical and different changes that have been made since that time. I spent some time in the debate earlier today pointing out various issues and quoting various facts that, while perhaps unpalatable to the Government, certainly give those of us who represent Aboriginal people in our electorates, and people like Senator Peter Baume and Senator Chaney who have had ministerial responsibility in this area, a great deal of concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the Senate to Senator Peter Baume's speech on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill on 17 August. I commend this speech to anybody doing research on this area. Senator Peter Baume has spent a great deal of time developing a very principled and detailed argument. In his speech Senator Peter Baume said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we shall oppose the emasculation of Aboriginal self-management and the nobbling of the Aboriginal Development Commission, and we vigorously oppose any attempt that might be made actually to dismember the Aboriginal Development Commission ahead of ATSIC arrangements being put in place. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on in the same speech Senator Peter Baume said:</PARA>
<PARA>My objective, and the objective of the Opposition, remains the achievement of better outcomes. Our objective remains the achievement of outcomes such as less illness, fewer Aboriginals in prison, more effective Aboriginal participation in education and the education system, greater Aboriginal longevity, more people housed, better housing, more people in employment, more Aboriginal people in senior administrative positions, fewer alcohol and drug problems, and so on. The question before the Senate now is whether or not ATSIC is the vehicle to achieve the outcomes. Sadly, it is not. This proposal is more likely to remove Aboriginal Australians from the mainstream of Australian life, to emphasise Aboriginal separateness, to require Aboriginal people to operate in a system different from other Australians and to make them into welfare recipients forever. If ATSIC proceeds, they will be the victims of a new paternalism. The damage which ATSIC will do to Aboriginal Australia may be irremediable; at the very least it will take a generation to fix. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not believe that any senator could make more profound or correct statements than those made by Senator Peter Baume when the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) debate was first brought on. As I said earlier today, in drawing out the differences between the operating years of 1986-87 and 1987-88, we are able to see that a very deliberate and political ploy was brought to bear by Mr Hand and the socialist Left which has a very different agenda in Australia. We need to recognise that there are many people working in the Aboriginal industries, if I can call them that-that is a correct term to use. Many fine Aboriginal leaders and many outstanding public servants in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the Aboriginal Development Commission and other statutory authorities serving Aborigines and people in State and Territory governments around Australia have a very strong commitment to this cause. </PARA>
<PARA> In my ATSIC speech I quoted Charles Perkins, the former Secretary of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, who drew attention to the change in advice that the Minister, Mr Hand, gave when he came to the portfolio in July 1987. I again quote what he said, because it is most important and well worth restating. Charles Perkins was quoted in the Canberra Times of 15 August as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister had surrounded himself with advisers all of a similar character to himself. They knew what was going on. They were in constant contact and discussions with the Central and Northern Land Councils. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have now is a most unsatisfactory situation in terms of some of the people ripping off Aboriginal affairs . . . vagabonds and hooligans, self-elected and self-seeking, and pretending to represent Aborigines here and overseas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It certainly has not reflected on anything that I have done. It is also important to remember that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), in commenting on the Menzies report, said that he was of the view that Mr Menzies had found `some cases of questionable practice' and that the final report `brings out some further shortcomings in administration in the area of Aboriginal affairs'. The Prime Minister further went on:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . there were deficiencies in systems and procedures going well beyond the realm of Mr Perkins' personal responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA>If they go beyond the realm of Mr Perkins's personal responsibility, they can only at that time have been sheeted home to the Minister, Mr Hand. The Prime Minister has caned Mr Hand in terms of the words that I have just read to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned in the debate this morning that the Minister, Mr Hand, chose to sack the Aboriginal commissioners of the Aboriginal Development Commission in May 1988 because they had had the audacity to prepare an alternative strategy for Aboriginal self-management. The document that they prepared in March 1988, presented to the Minister very openly and publicly as part of this debate, makes most interesting reading. Of course, it has been hidden by the Government ever since. It has never been referred to; there has never been a critique made of it; there has never been any discussion; and it has never been put on the table. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me just refer to some of the points made in that document. This, I remind the Senate, was the considered document of the commissioners at that time, March 1988-all Aboriginal people working for the Government-reflecting on both the successes and the weaknesses of the system. They, of course, were responding to the ATSIC proposal that had been floated by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand. Let me quote the limitations of the ATSIC proposal that were outlined in the executive summary of this report:</PARA>
<PARA>The proposal creates a clumsy bureaucracy that will overly complicate the decision making process. </PARA>
<PARA> It offers no improvement in economic development or Program development. </PARA>
<PARA> The relationship of ATSIC to the Minister will be like that between a Minister and a Department. The autonomy, presently existing in the ADC, to decide upon philosophy, policy, procedures and funding will be lost. The Minister has a far reaching role in ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA> Decision making powers of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders under the ADC Act, Aboriginal Hostels Limited and AIAS will be limited and replaced with advisory powers. </PARA>
<PARA> Although involvement for Aboriginal people at the local level is most desirable, the Regional and Zone Councils as proposes would be a recipe for destructive conflict. Their roles would be merely advisory. </PARA>
<PARA> Objectives of self-management, Aboriginal controls over program delivery and effective promotion of economic independence which are vitally important to Aboriginals and Islanders will not be achieved through ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA> Social Welfare and Economic Development Programs will be integrated and lumped together in the same organisation thus creating a situation where the dissimilar objectives of each are likely to become confused at all levels. </PARA>
<PARA> Economic Development Programs will only be partially separated between the AEDC and ATSIC. This will fragment resources. Also, it will not allow the responsible integration of the program to the long term goals of financial self-sufficiency and self-management. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal will create additional administrative expenditure which would be at the expense of Program funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal has been created without the benefit of an overall strategy for the long term advancement of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> The document `Foundations for the Future', which described ATSIC, is short on detail and long on generalities. It does not offer Aboriginal people a real choice in the creation of a structure that will affect their lives for years to come. </PARA>
<PARA>They were the criticisms that were so embarrassing to Minister Hand. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They were from the commissioners of the Aboriginal Development Commission, who were all Aboriginal people, in March 1988. Because they had the audacity to put that on paper and to distribute it as part of the ongoing debate that the Minister had invited, they were sacked. They were wiped out and replaced with a bunch of stooges, all of the Minister's own deliberate choosing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, this document did not concentrate just on the limitations of ATSIC. It also went to develop, very properly, an alternative strategy which, as I said earlier, the Minister has hidden. This came from the Aboriginal Development Commission. That strategy that it put down outlined and was calling for: a new Aboriginal Services Commission; an Aboriginal Ombudsman; regional councils which are popularly elected; a national congress to replace the National Aboriginal Conference; retention of the ADC and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies as specialised agencies; increased self-management and control; a larger Aboriginal and Islander affairs portfolio; greater administrative efficiency and economies of scale; and improved program delivery and rationalisation. They were the positives. </PARA>
<PARA> This particular document was used by Mr Hand as the knife to get rid of properly effective commissioners of the Aboriginal Development Commission because he did not like it and it did not suit the political agenda of the socialist Left. The socialist Left did not like the fact that Aboriginal people had the audacity to come out with such a constructive document as part of the open debate. It may well not have been the final result, but the Minister was not even prepared to read it. He merely wiped these people off the face of the earth without even saying thank you. Certainly, as we have seen several times today, both in the debate on the ADC report and in my contribution earlier this morning, the 1987-88 annual report is a disgraceful document because of its omissions, because of the way in which Mr Hand has chosen to get into bed with so many different people with a very different agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the Budget for this year we will see that once again the Minister has kept up this vendetta against the ADC. The budget for the Aboriginal Development Commission in the current financial year has been very heavily changed and constrained. Of course, even the new commissioners-the hand-picked commissioners-did not like this particular action and were proposing to put out a critical press statement on this. Word of it got through to the Minister's office, and the Minister's office called for the details. Maybe even his new group this year are under threat. He asked to see the draft press release that was to be put out and he summoned officers of the ADC to his office. He instructed them that they were not to go ahead in those particular terms-that the press statement could go out only if it was amended to acknowledge that the ADC was responsible for the error in the Budget paper, not the Minister's office nor the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, with whom the full and direct responsibility would then come back to the Minister's desk. It is interesting to note that the ADC did not put out a press release under such terms and conditions as this particular situation. </PARA>

I am concerned that in this particular debate we have not heard a contribution from the Democrats, and I am hoping that Senator Coulter later will show us where he believes that the proposals now before us are consistent with the stance and the views that he took in the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs last year and that the proposals with regard to the Aboriginal Development Commission are in line with the representations that Aborigines have been making to the Australian Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I find it very surprising that the Democrats have been seduced by the Minister with regard to this particular legislation at this time. I would never suppose to think for a Democrat or think as a Democrat. My politics are far too removed from that. But I am surprised, because if I were a Democrat and were looking at this issue tactically, let alone anything else, and wanted to achieve outcomes that were better for Aboriginal people, there is only one condition on which I would agree to any of this particular legislation going through. That condition would be that the Government change the Minister, because all of the problems in this particular regard since July 1987 have been compounded by Mr Hand. How can any Democrat sit there and not believe that the ATSIC legislation is going to produce a dreadful umbrella and is going to be open to such manipulation and control by Mr Hand, as he has shown across this portfolio for the past two years? In all of the evidence that has come out in the Estimates Committee, in the Senate Select Committee last year, and in all of the inquiries that the Prime Minister and the Government instituted-and read every one of the recommendations of those reports-the responsibility comes back to the deck of one person, that is, the Minister, Mr Hand. </PARA>

It is well known that the person for whom I have the most respect on the Opposition benches in the area of Aboriginal Affairs is Senator Peter Baume. However, with respect to Senator Baume, I have to say that I take considerable difference with him on the remarks that he made, as dramatic as they sounded, when he introduced his contributions to this debate and said that the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill that we are debating tonight was an evil and malevolent Bill. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not, actually. I refer Senator Baume and Senator Stone to the Hansard of the House of Representatives. They would see that we are debating the Bill because it was brought before the Parliament as the result of a commitment and a pledge which has been honoured. That commitment was given by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the House of Representatives in April this year as a result of the evil and malevolent campaign that was waged by members of the Opposition and Senator Tambling, in particular, against Aboriginal people in this country and against particular Aboriginals. Senator Tambling is now, as always, vociferously denying-I was hoping he would-that he made any unjustified or unreasonable personal attacks on individual people. With some astonishment, I have heard him say that before. I did not have time to do more than go for a wander through the Hansard debates in this chamber and pull out a selection. I left aside all the appalling personal accusations he has made against Charles Perkins in the media and in the committees of the Parliament. It even made me blink a bit when I put the accusations together, because they have all been disproved. There is probably no better investigated person in Australia at the moment than Charles Perkins and the reports of all those investigations have been tabled in the Parliament. Quite correctly, Senator Tambling said that the buck stops on the Minister's desk; it certainly does. But has Senator Tambling uttered one word of apology? He has the hide to talk about the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs not saying, `Thanks fellas'-as I personally think he should have-to the sacked Aboriginal Development Commission commissioners.</PARA></TALK.START>

Not one word of apology has Senator Tambling uttered about the absolutely appalling personal reflections he has made on Charles Perkins, despite the fact that we are up to our ears in reports saying that none of his claims was proven.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I add that in respect of the `black mafia' assertion, Senator Tambling himself admitted 10 minutes after he made it that it was false, but that he had to deliver it to attract the attention of the Press Gallery. Honourable senators should listen to some of the other things that Senator Tambling said in this chamber about Charles Perkins and think about whether they would like to have such things said about them. Earlier in this debate, a crocodile tears reference was made to the lack of an Aboriginal adviser in the advisers box in the chamber. Why would any Aboriginal person want to come into this chamber to listen to the personal vilification that has been put on Aboriginal people? If an Aboriginal person sat in here, he would probably find it very hard to resist the temptation to jump the bar and punch someone on the other side on the nose. </PARA>

I invite him, then, to listen to this and tell me, in light of the evidence that is presented, whether he thinks this is cricket. I refer to the accusations that Senator Tambling has made about Charles Perkins in this chamber and for which not one word of apology has been made. The references are in chronological order.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Tambling has accused this individual Australian of `nepotism and cronyism; associating with criminals; lousy and inefficient administration; suspicious behaviour; being in control of a black mafia; being responsible for scandals and rorts; being a confidant of unsavoury persons; running a network of mates and cronies; appointing his crony to be the manager of the ADC; setting up gangs of lefties around Australia and suspicious networks; disgraceful administration; poor administration; conducting a lot of funny business at the crossroads; suffering from amnesia; and running an unguided missile of an administration'. That is not a bad selection of personal reflections on an individual who was cleared in the numerous reports produced as a result of that evil and malevolent campaign. The Opposition has a hide to talk about evil and malevolence. Despite the fact that not one iota of evidence was found to substantiate the claims-the Opposition in its statements in the Parliament on those reports has accepted that-there has not been a single word of apology from Senator Tambling. What we have had in here has been the sight of Senator Tambling-today and in his speech on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill the other day-quoting Charles Perkins with approbation. </PARA>

I have been in Parliament for almost 13 years-it is as rough and tumble in the Northern Territory Parliament as it is here-but I have not seen such a collection of gross personal reflections on an individual, totally unproven reflections, as when I did this little exercise only an hour ago. It is a disgusting vendetta and an evil and malevolent personal attack on an individual when we consider the fact that the proof that every one of these charges is totally unjustified has been tabled in the Senate. Having put this collection together, I feel that my contribution to the debate this evening is overdue. I did not have the time to look at the Hansard transcripts of the committee proceedings, but I know that in them are a lot more accusations just as nasty, just as vicious, just as evil, just as malevolent and just as wrong as these.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME><ELECTORATE>(South Australia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(8.41)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are discussing this evening two Bills: a Bill to amend the Aboriginal Development Commission Act to restructure the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) temporarily because the ADC will disappear under the proposed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) legislation and a Bill to restructure the Institute of Aboriginal Studies. I wish to address my remarks entirely to the first of those two Bills, the Bill dealing with the restructuring of the ADC. I draw attention to the fact that the ADC, of course, was an instrument of the Opposition. When in government it set this body up; and one can only applaud the criteria which were used to create that body. It was created in recognition of prior Aboriginal occupation of Australia and dispossession and it was set up to do a number of things for Aboriginal people by Aboriginal people who were appointed to the board controlling ADC. Indeed, it is the only piece of legislation which actually contains specific reference to that prior Aboriginal occupation and dispossession. The then Government, now the Opposition, created a capital fund in recognition of that fact and that capital fund was to be augmented as time went on, essentially as a compensatory fund for that dispossession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I totally applaud the motivation and the ideas that went into the creation of the ADC. Indeed, when the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs was considering the ATSIC Bill, one of the recommendations that it made was that that particular clause in the ADC Bill which gave that recognition to Aboriginal people should be carried over into the new Bill because it was recognised that the ADC Bill would be revoked and that, if that were the case, there would be no legal recognition in any piece of legislation. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) has accepted that and that clause has been carried over into the amended ATSIC Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government has also sought to change one of the very significant impediments to the use of that capital fund. I would just like to pick this up for a moment, because clearly it affects the ADC Bill very much and the future operation of that part of the Commission's activity which will be picked up by ATSIC. The Government has sought to ask the new body, the ATSIC Development Corporation, to pay both a dividend on earnings from the capital fund and tax on the earnings from the capital fund. It seems to me that, given the recognition of the original purpose and intention of that capital fund, it is quite unconscionable that the Aboriginal people should be asked to pay either a dividend or a tax on that fund. It is not money to which, by way of a grant or anything else, the rest of the Australian population has some right. It is, indeed, a fund which was set up clearly in recognition of dispossession and was recognised as a compensatory fund. I would like to return to that later on. </PARA>
<PARA> The ADC, when it was first created, clearly had a mix of purposes which were not carefully thought out. The ADC had a social welfare function and an economic development function. Those roles, not properly and carefully defined, led to the funding of a number of proposals which were not successful as economic development attempts and that, in turn, led to the House of Representatives setting up an inquiry which reported in 1984, in an interim way, and in 1985 and which recommended that the ADC should take on a more specific economic development function and that its role in social welfare should be downplayed. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the way in which the ADC set about changing that role and redefining its task, particularly under the chairmanship of Mrs Shirley McPherson, was done in an extremely good and sound way. I would certainly like to record that, in my experience of Mrs McPherson, she is an exemplary person who did an excellent job in her position as Chair of the ADC. Indeed, under her chairmanship, the ADC went a great distance toward implementing that recommendation of swinging the ADC towards economic development-type work. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, as we all know, when the ATSIC proposal came along the ADC, recognising that there was merit in keeping the social welfare and economic development functions separate, made representations to the Minister that that separation should continue. It made an alternative proposal to the Minister that, whatever the new body was to be called, it should take on that economic development function, to be kept separate from the social welfare function. As we all know, the Minister did not accept that and that, in turn, led to the dismissal of the ADC commissioners. I have expressed before the view-I think shared by many in this chamber-that that was indeed a very sad and sorry time in the administration of Aboriginal affairs. I believe I have reflected before, as has the Opposition, on the ungraciousness of the Minister in not recording the good work which those previous commissioners had done. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now faced with the creation of two new bodies, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and a body which will be known as the Development Corporation. The role of the ATSIC Development Corporation, I believe, would be more appropriately broadened to take on more of the economic development-type functions, as has been suggested by the former ADC commissioners. The Minister, I believe, in this respect does have a hidden agenda. I believe that, having taken a strong stand against the ADC, he is unwilling to accept the merits of the case which they put. I think this is most unfortunate, but I believe that to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly, the Minister is attempting to give to the new body a very restricted role. It will behave very much like a bank, applying the same rigid criteria for assessment of proposals and for lending. In view of the particular nature of many of the Aboriginal proposals for economic development, a more liberal approach to those proposals would be appropriate. I have suggested that to the Minister on several occasions. The words which he used in his second reading speech with respect to the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill now before us were:</PARA>
<PARA>That the Commission-</PARA>
<PARA>he is referring here to the Aboriginal Development Commission in this interim period-</PARA>
<PARA>will be required to satisfy itself that the enterprise is likely to become or continue to be commercially successful. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that that is the more liberal criterion that the Minister should have carried that over into this new body. There may well be proposals which in the first instance would not be of such a robust nature that they would be financed by the bank; nonetheless there is a reasonable expectation that eventually they would become commercially viable. That was the intention at the initiation of this proposal. In discussions with the Minister, I have likened this situation very much to the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) where the Government set up a body deliberately to provide finance to those organisations having proposals which in their first attempt to get finance were not likely to do so from regular sources. Nonetheless, there was a reasonable expectation that over time those proposals would become economically viable. As we all know, the AIDC has been successful and recently the Government has hived 30 per cent of that body off to private interest. The Minister had not accepted that view. I think that is unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have preferred that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission would have a greater role along the lines that I have suggested. Unfortunately, this is not achievable, I believe, with the present Minister. I will, however, when we get to the debate on the clauses of the ATSIC legislation, in the committee stage, be moving an amendment to seek the removal of the requirement that the ATSIC pay dividends and tax on earnings from its capital fund. The Government in its answer to that proposal has said, `Well, of course, the Government can simply pay less money into the capital fund'. I cannot help but reflect that this Government has paid no money into the capital fund since 1983, so that would not be at all unusual. It is clearly more honest, recognising that this fund is a compensatory fund, for the Government not to charge dividends and tax against the earnings on that fund and to put less money in-at least that is open and clearly seen for what it is-rather than to put the money in and to claw money back by way of dividend and tax. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some amendments which the Opposition is proposing to this Bill which seem to me to go very much to the matter of self-management which the business is supposed to be about. I will listen with a great deal of interest to Senator Peter Baume when he puts those amendments. It seems to me that some of those amendments will be acceptable to the Australian Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must commence my remarks on the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Bill 1989 and the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill 1989, which we are debating cognately, by referring to what I can only call the intemperate outburst earlier this evening by Senator Collins from the Government side of the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I nevertheless regard it as an intemperate outburst. Senator Collins picked up the phrase which apparently was used-I did not actually hear it-by Senator Peter Baume in opening the second reading debate for the Opposition on these two Bills when he referred to the Bill relating to the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC), apparently, as a malevolent and evil Bill. I would have to say, without necessarily wanting to spend too long on particular choices of words, that, whether or not this particular Bill is a malevolent and evil one, there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that the whole construct which this chamber has now had before it for debate in the last few weeks-namely, the construct of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) Bill and the Aboriginal Development Commission Bill and the companion Bill which we are debating now-is undoubtedly a malevolent and evil construct. I think that, in choosing such words earlier today, Senator Peter Baume in that broader context spoke no more than the truth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As honourable senators on this side have already spelt out at some length in the earlier second reading debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill, we have before us in this package of Bills, including the main one, a set of proposals which is designed to create the greatest upheaval not only in the administration of Aboriginal affairs in this country but also in the relationships between Aboriginal people and non-Aboriginal people in this country. That is why such respected authorities as Professor Colin Howard to whom I have referred in my own earlier remarks in the second reading debate on the ATSIC Bill-a man not given to extremes in his language-should have chosen to refer to the likely divisiveness of that Bill and of this package of Bills as a whole in terms of their future effect upon race relations in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Irrespective of how one chooses to describe this particular Bill-I was not present in the chamber to hear Senator Peter Baume's elaboration of his thesis on that but I have no doubt that he has good reason for using those words about that particular Bill-and whatever the facts may be about this particular Bill, there is not the slightest doubt that the phrase is eminently and entirely justified so far as it concerns the whole package of Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> I also remark on the fact that, in his intemperate outburst, Senator Collins at no time referred to the Bill before the chamber. He may have referred to it by name or by title on one or two occasions-no doubt to retain your indulgence, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker. I am not in any way complaining about that indulgence. There is a lot of indulgence given by the Chair in this place and properly so. I think it is fair to say that Senator Collins usually contributes-I do not necessarily agree with him-to debate in this chamber when he rises to speak. What was noticeably absent from his remarks tonight was any such contribution. His remarks tonight consisted simply of a furious attack more notable for its passion and the loudness with which it was expressed than for any relevance that it actually had to the Bill before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to go further in relation to a particular remark that Senator Collins made when referring not so much to the sacking of Mr Charles Perkins but to the recent history of Mr Charles Perkins. I do not want in any way to reflect here upon Mr Perkins. Mr Perkins has been a public servant in this city for many years. I would have to say, and I hope it will not be taken away, Mr Acting Deputy President, that he has not been the most distinguished public servant in this city. I would equally have to say that he has not been the most undistinguished one either. I simply want to say of Mr Perkins that, at the end of the day, and after all these investigations have taken place, he has not been reinstated to his previous position by the Minister and, indeed, I understand that Mr Hand has said that he would not re-employ Mr Perkins. I think that leaves us-and, if I may say so, Senator Collins-with a small difficulty that either Mr Hand is right, in which case Mr Perkins can hardly be, or that Mr Perkins is right in which case Mr Hand can hardly be. I suspect that in fact Senator Collins's impassioned defence of Mr Perkins, admirable though it undoubtedly was from one point of view, amounted in effect to and, indeed, may very well have been motivated by an equally impassioned denunciation of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, because that is the only logical conclusion one can draw in all the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply want to leave all that there and rather regret that I have taken eight minutes of the Senate's time to respond to remarks that I suggest need not have been and ought not to have been made by Senator Collins earlier. Incidentally, I wish to correct now something I said a moment ago when I said that Senator Collins had made almost no reference to the Bill. I think that last is true. He did make almost no reference to the Bill. But at one point he did, I agree, refer-I now recollect that he referred-to Mr Hand's actions in sacking all of the commissioners of the Aboriginal Development Commission except the Chairman, Mrs Shirley McPherson, and the only reason he did not sack her was that it was not at that time in his power to do so. Senator Collins did, as I say, glancingly refer to that incident. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to spend a little more time, and not in a glancing fashion, in doing likewise. Why we have this Bill before us, of course, is because of the particular attitude, the malevolent attitude certainly-whether it be evil could be debated-which this Minister has brought to the Aboriginal Development Commission. That malevolence was thoroughly reflected in this Minister's decision to sack every commissioner of the Aboriginal Development Commission whom it was in his power to sack. And why was that? It was because those appointed persons, in attempting-not I think wholly efficiently, and that is a point I will return to-to discharge the duties laid upon them by the Act of Parliament under which they operated, were simply not willing to do the bidding of the Minister. That is why they were sacked. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, although I in no way condone the action of the Minister in dismissing the people concerned and putting in their place the bunch of stooges-I do not want to be unduly harsh but I think it is a fair word in this context-whom he has subsequently appointed, the fact is that the record of the Aboriginal Development Commission did indeed leave a lot to be desired. The various reports from the office of the Auditor-General in particular, which have been subsequently received by the Senate, have highlighted the many deficiencies. I am thinking particularly of the report into the operations of the Aboriginal Development Commission itself by the Auditor-General's Office. It highlighted the many deficiencies of the lending processes of the Commission. Time after time that report by the Auditor-General sets down in dry, but nonetheless compelling prose, the failure of the ADC even to observe the straightforward legal conditions under which it was required to lend. Nevertheless, grave though I think it is fair to say those deficiencies were, it is fair to add that there was at least some form of control, some form of public accountability with the ADC as presently constituted, as the very reports and inquiries which I have just been referring to demonstrate-the estimates processes of this Parliament, for example. </PARA>
<PARA> What will happen when these functions are handed over to this new monster, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, which the Parliament is in the process of allowing the Minister to create? Can honourable senators imagine the handing over of, let us say, for example, the role of the Commonwealth Development Bank to the politicians who make up the Parliament? Imagine what would be the result if the Parliament were given the responsibility of running the Commonwealth Development Bank with very considerable funds at its disposal and powers to lend. I do not want to impugn the integrity of any member or senator in this place, even in the general sense, but I have to say that it would be enormously surprising if, on the basis of all experience, not just of Australian parliaments but all legislatures, the most notable result of that process were not to be that a great many bad loans would be made, a great many cronies of parliamentarians would suddenly find themselves favoured and we would have the sort of pandemonium arising from that which that kind of process would be bound to lead to. However, when one actually looks into it, that is not very far different from what the Government is now seriously proposing under the terms of the legislation before us. The Government is proposing to abolish the present Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). However poorly or, let me use a kindly word, imperfectly, it may have been administered in the past, it has at least a proper framework of legislative control under which that administration is supposed to occur. Therefore, it provides a framework for public accountability when those controls are not observed. I am afraid that under what is now proposed we will not have that kind of situation at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently in Queensland we have had a lot of nonsense about the operations of the Queensland Industry Development Corporation. All sorts of wild allegations have been thrown around about loans having been made to members of the National Party, and nonsense, for the most part, of that kind. Imagine what it will be like when this new body is set up, clothed with full statutory power, given a budget-given cash from the public purse, from Australian taxpayers-and can, in effect, make decisions to acquire land and other property and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> At one point in his remarks Senator Coulter seemed to be arguing-I trust I have interpreted his remarks correctly, and he will correct me if I did not-that the role allocated to the development corporation within the new Commission had been unduly narrowed and it would have been better for it to have been expanded. Senator Coulter read into that what he called a hidden agenda on the part of the Minister. Far be it from me to suggest that Minister Hand does not have a hidden agenda, but I am inclined to wonder whether narrowing the role of the development corporation part of the Commission provides evidence for that. It is an interesting point put forward by Senator Coulter and I look forward with interest to his developing it, as I imagine he will do, in the committee stage of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In reality, I have to confess that nowadays one is cynical enough to wonder whether it really matters very much. The fact is, as history shows, that as long as we have the present Minister, and that is the key point, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission will do as it wants anyway. There will not be any great regard, as past experience shows, for legislative constraints because there is a view about that there is a different rule for the administration of these matters where they involve Aboriginal affairs. Whereas in non-Aboriginal areas we have principles of public accountability, and all those things which make up part of the Westminster system of government and which are at the heart of public propriety, somehow, when those rules are breached by actions occurring in the area of Aboriginal affairs, that can be waived away as something that must be expected. That is essentially a racist attitude-much more racist than the views of many people who, when discussing Aboriginal questions, are accused of being racist. What could be more racist than the kind of condescension which suggests that because a matter occurs in the area of Aboriginal affairs, therefore, the same standards of public accountability, care for public moneys-care for the public purse-should not operate or, at any rate, should not be enforced with the same degree of rigour as they would be in other areas?</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that whether this is an evil Bill or not which is, I understand, part of the description applied to it by Senator Peter Baume earlier, as reported by Senator Collins-and I have no doubt that if Senator Peter Baume did say that he had good reason for doing so and was fully justified in his comment-it is certainly a malevolent Bill. It is a malevolent Bill which, as I said earlier, undoubtedly forms part of a malevolent and evil package of Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is engaged in a second reading debate on two Bills, the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill 1989 and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Bill 1989. I do not intend to take a great deal of time in responding to the various second reading contributions made by senators for fear of traversing ground that has already been well-tilled by my colleagues from this side, and more than well-tilled by those on the other side of the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, in relation to the superseding of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) by the proposed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), there was some suggestion by Senator Peter Baume that one of his concerns was brought about by the fact that this seemed so unnecessary. I think he said that within a matter of hours of the passing of the ATSIC legislation the Aboriginal Development Commission will no longer exist and, therefore, the passage of this Bill might have some symbolic significance, but was really not justified, given that short time frame. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it will be the fact that even with the passage of the ATSIC legislation, should it be the wish of the Parliament that that should occur and its being given royal assent, the legislation does not commence until a date fixed by proclamation or six months after royal assent, whichever is the sooner. That is made clear in clause 2. Just a look at clause 2 indicates that the Aboriginal Development Commission will have a significant role to play over the next few months, although not as significant in terms of the length of the contribution it might make as would have been the case had it been passed in the autumn session of the Parliament this year. Nevertheless, there is a role for it to play for several months and the Government believes it is important that that role be readjusted in the light of various undertakings given by the Government. It is quite clear, for example, from the statement made by the Prime Minister on the administration of Aboriginal affairs, a statement made to the Parliament on 11 April 1989, where his commitment lies in relation to the various reports on the administration of Aboriginal affairs, which was revealed to be deficient in many ways. The Prime Minister had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> We have, moreover, considered to what extent the thrust of those recommendations should apply to the ADC while it continues to function in the lead-up to ATSIC, as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will indicate in his statement. </PARA>
<PARA>As I say, to fill in the time before the coming into operation of ATSIC a need was felt to carry through the various recommendations of the reports into, some would say, the maladministration that had characterised some parts of the various organisations which delivered services to the Aboriginal people. For example, in the statement made by the Aboriginal Affairs Minister, Gerry Hand, on that very same day, 11 April 1989, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> ATSIC will not be operational for some months but there is clearly a need identified in the reports of the Department of Finance and the Auditor-General to act now to remedy deficiencies within the present structure. </PARA>
<PARA>The report of the Department of Finance on the financial management of the Aboriginal Development Commission of March 1989 recommends on page 17 of the report, recommendation No. 11.1:</PARA>
<PARA> It is recommended that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs exercise greater ministerial authority over the Commission. In respect of the approval of the Commission's estimates, this would have an immediate effect on the operations of the Commission and would ensure that the Commission's programs at least reflect the priorities of the Government's policies. It is therefore recommended that the Minister for Finance write to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs suggesting that he consider:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the means by which the Commission may be required to provide him with estimates for approval, including for the remainder of this financial year;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) advice of the financial policies to be followed in the administration and control of the Commission's programs and;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) a corporate plan for endorsement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister should also request that the Commission provide him with quarterly reports on program activity or performance. </PARA>
<PARA>There one has an indication from the Department of Finance, following its examination of the financial management of the Aboriginal Development Commission, of certain matters which ought to be taken up by a government wishing, as the Prime Minister and the Minister indicated is the case, to implement the changes which are required, even if it be only for a matter of some months. Once again, the Auditor-General's special report on the Aboriginal Development Commission and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs had this to say at page 60, paragraph 2:10:12-</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister's powers to obtain information are limited. The ADC is required to provide him with annual estimates of proposed expenditure in such form as he directs, but it is not required to obtain his approval of the estimates. The estimates that have been provided are in broad terms, but it would be open to the Minister to require the estimates to be in detail, even to the point of identifying particular projects and the amounts proposed to be spent on each during the year. </PARA>
<PARA>I think there is reason to try to ensure that, if the Aboriginal Development Commission is to operate in this interim period over the next several months, it ought to do so in a way which carries through those types of recommendations. That is, indeed, the simple aim of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Bill 1989, the Government is concerned that the Institute operates very much as the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies (AIAS) currently operates and, of course, to carry out its very important function in undertaking for itself, and promoting, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander studies and to encourage and train research workers, particularly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander researchers, and to undertake research in its own right. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to recognise that the Government wishes the Institute to operate in a way which reflects the high professional standards and the integrity of its operations which, of course, is a concern for those who believe that it has a real role to play in relation to the understanding of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their culture and history, by themselves, by the rest of Australia and, indeed, by the world community. For that, a level of integrity and scholarship is required and certainly the Government wishes to see that continue. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the various amendments proposed by Senator Peter Baume, I indicate that the Government is going to be fairly responsive to many of them but I would like to await the commencement of the committee stage because I understand from private conversation that he intends to delete one or two of his proposed amendments. Once those amendments are clear on the record, I will then be able to indicate what the Government intends to do in relation to other amendments which he has proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the Institute, it is true, as Senator Peter Baume has pointed out, that the Government has not proceeded with appointments to fill the existing six Governor-General appointed positions on the Institute of Aboriginal Studies Council. Now that there has been a reorganisation of the Institute in the offing, should the Parliament so desire, with different arrangements for the membership of the Council, it is not considered appropriate to proceed with recommending appointments to the Governor-General for the six vacant positions at this time. I have indicated privately to Senator Peter Baume that the Minister was prepared to make appointments earlier this year but, for a particular reason, had not proceeded with a particular matter. Now that we are at the stage of altering the way in which the Institute of Aboriginal Studies is organised, the Minister believes that it would not be appropriate to proceed with those intended appointments. I commend both Bills to the Senate and I seek the support of honourable senators for their second reading. </PARA>

<PARA> (3) Page 19, after clause 60 insert the following new clause:</PARA>
<PARA>Operation of Superannuation Benefit (Interim Arrangement) Act</PARA>
<PARA> ``60a. (1) The Superannuation Act and any related law apply in relation to any person who:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) before the commencement was employed by the old Institute; and</PARA>

<PARA>These amendments are required to streamline the arrangements which will apply in the transition from the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies to the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies established by this Bill. The ramifications of the changes to the staffing arrangements for superannuation entitlements are also dealt with in the proposed new clause. The explanatory memorandum, I think, indicates the very technical nature of the amendments proposed. Rather than bore the Committee by repeating the content of the explanatory memorandum, I commend the amendment to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will not oppose the three amendments which have been moved together by Senator Tate. However, we make one observation. The first piece of legislation in this package appeared before us in late 1987. I am not sure exactly when, but it is some considerable time ago. The Bill has appeared in at least three or four different forms since then. It was amended by the Government in the House of Representatives, under guillotine, some months ago. Yet here we are tonight-the first time we have considered the Bills in committee-considering Government amendments to each of the pieces of legislation. This bears out what many of our Aboriginal constituents have told us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not intend to go back and re-open the second reading debate because we have agreed to the principles of the legislation. The Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders who talked to us said that they agreed to an idea in principle, but that they did not see or have a chance to agree to or consider in their communities the clauses of the legislation. The fact that amendments continue to appear from the Government at this late hour would seem to support their concern on this matter. They are just not certain whether this legislation in all its detail is what they want. Having said all that-and, I may make the same point again when we come to the Government amendments on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission legislation-the Opposition will not oppose these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA>I thank the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) very much for the response, which I think is appropriate. The Government, I think, is acknowledging that the Opposition, having been defeated in its attempt to have the Bills defeated on the principles, has now proceeded to move some helpful amendments to the legislation. We have been genuinely concerned that only half the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, from which we have worked, were met in the Bill which we have before us. The amendments which we have moved now in fact will provide for some other necessary amendments to give to the Institute the separation and the independence which we believe it should have, in keeping with the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend, as I had wished originally, to argue each of the amendments in detail. The fact that the Government has determined to accept these amendments has given me great heart and it pleases the Opposition. I do want, however, to return to one matter. The Minister in his summing up was courteous enough to respond to my concerns about the failure to appoint certain commissioners to fill certain vacancies which have existed. I thought the Minister made a fair enough case as to why the Government did not intend to make those appointments now. I do not question that. What the Minister and the Government have not explained, is why the vacancies have been there for so long. I am informed that some of the Governor-General's vacancies in the Institute Council have existed since 1985. If that is the case, that would be almost four years that there have been vacancies in the Council which have awaited only action by a Minister putting a recommendation to the Executive Council for those appointments to be made. I do not question the explanation that was given to me by the Minister as to what the present problem is, but it does not explain why these vacancies have existed for so long. Would the Minister please let us know the reason for the length of time that there have been these vacancies?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats will also not be objecting in any way to these amendments proposed by the Opposition. I would ask the Minister a further question, in a way related to the one asked by Senator Peter Baume: I understand that there were two senators on the Institute Board. Could the Minister indicate who they were and what their attendance record was in relation to meetings of the Institute Board? The only other point I want to make is to draw attention to what I see as the philosophy lying behind many of the Opposition amendments, that is to give effect to self-determination and self-management in a way in which some of the clauses in the Bill which have been deleted clearly denied. I want to make that point, because we will shortly be going on to discuss amendments in relation to the other Bill before us.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to the membership of the Institute Board by senators, I believe Senator Collins and Senator Teague are the two senators who sit on that particular Board. I am unable, of course, to provide an attendance record. I could undertake to provide that from records held by the Institute, no doubt, but perhaps not before the conclusion of the consideration of this particular Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to Senator Peter Baume's question about seeking the reason for the failure of the Minister to fill certain vacancies on the Council of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, the fact is, as I indicated, I believe that the Minister was prepared to fill a number of vacancies which had occurred over a period-I think from 1987, but the honourable senator may be right in relation to pointing to one vacancy from 1985; I have no information on that. I know that four of the Governor-General appointees' appointments did expire on 30 June 1987 and that another member resigned from the Council on 19 October 1987. The remaining member, Mr Michael Williams, resigned on 20 May 1988 to become an elected member of council. That is the sequence that I have, but the honourable senator may be right. That is the information I have. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, as I say, was willing to make some new appointments earlier this year. He was concerned to ensure that all those appointments could be put to the Governor-General without any shadow or unmerited cloud hanging over any of the persons to be appointed by reason of any of the inquiries being undertaken into matters relating to the administration of Aboriginal affairs in this country, of which there were many going on at the time. I think, really, that is as much as I can properly say in relation to this matter, because quite clearly, without the names having been forwarded to the Governor-General, it would be wrong for me to name any particular person or persons in relation to the general point which I am making. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the Government's position in accepting the amendments proposed by the Opposition to this particular Bill, I think it is important that I indicate that they are accepted as a token, I believe, of the good faith of the Government-naturally to maintain its own policy, which has now been accepted by the Senate in relation to the passage of the second reading. In those matters where some accommodation, some flexibility, can be shown, the Minister has been prepared to consider the amendments put forward in good faith and he has certainly demonstrated that in relation to his acceptance of these amendments. That does not mean that some of the comments made, if I may say so, in the second reading debate in relation to this Bill are accepted at all by the Government, in particular the thought that there was an attempt by the Government to enshrine a dominance and control by ATSIC over the Institute and its affairs. That is not accepted by the Government as a valid characterisation of what it was attempting to do in seeking a greater coordination and role to play in relation to the membership of the board by persons who are also members of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we now have a situation where the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies will be able to operate in a way which ensures that its high reputation is maintained. The integrity of its research and its contribution to an understanding of the history and culture of the Aboriginal people will be furthered by those who supervise its work. I believe that the Senate can now look forward with confidence to giving a third reading to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> ``(3) The Superannuation Act and any related law apply in relation to any person who:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) before the commencement, was employed by the Commission; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) after the commencement, is employed under the Public Service Act 1922 in the Commission;</PARA>

<PARA> (d) the continuity of the person's employment had not been affected by the changes made by this Act to the staffing arrangements in respect of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> ``(4) In subsection (3):</PARA>
<PARA> `related law' means any law of the Commonwealth, to the extent that it relates to the superannuation benefits covered by the Superannuation Act;</PARA>
<PARA> `Superannuation Act' means the Superannuation Benefit (Interim Arrangement) Act 1988.''. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Page 7, clause 15, proposed subsection 39a (3), line 37, after ``Minister'', insert ``for Finance''. </PARA>
<PARA>The first amendment is required to ensure that relatively small amounts of money which have accrued to staff under the 3 per cent productivity related superannuation agreement between the Government and the unions do not become payable because of the change in staffing arrangements which apply to the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) as a result of the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill. The Superannuation Benefit (Interim Arrangement) Act 1988 provides that an interim benefit is payable to staff in civilian public sector employment when there is a change of employer. This will occur as a result of the ADC Bill as staff of the ADC will become public servants. Accordingly, the amendment deems there not to have been a change of employer for the purpose of the Superannuation Benefit (Interim Arrangement) Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 2 simply clarifies that the reference to the Minister in clause 15 is in fact to the Minister for Finance. They are rather technical matters, but clearly the Government seeks the support of the Committee in relation to the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) Page 2, paragraph 4 (a), lines 13 and 14, leave out ``on any matter specified by the Minister'', insert ``about the operations of the Commission or about this Act''. </PARA>
<PARA>The clause as it stands at lines 13 and 14 permits the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to seek information on any matters specified by the Minister. Let me draw a reduction ad absurdum. The Minister might want to seek information on what shopping someone did for their groceries the previous week. As the clause is drafted, the Minister would be permitted to seek that information. He could seek information on any matter. Our amendment does not seek to prevent the Minister from asking that information or from advice being provided. It merely seeks to say that that information should be information about the operations of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) or about this Act. In other words, if I were now an officer of the Commission, the Minister would not be permitted to ask me about the activities of my nephew but he could ask me about activities relating to the Aboriginal Development Commission or about the Aboriginal Development Commission Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Our amendment will take nothing away from what the Government has sought to achieve with the drafting, but it is not desirable that the Minister's powers to obtain information from the ADC be unlimited. It is desirable that the Minister's powers in this matter be limited to matters known to the commissioners or staff in the course of their official duties under the Act. It is a perfectly reasonable amendment which in no way detracts from the purposes which the Government is seeking to obtain, but makes quite clear that the advice or information which is sought must be reasonable and relevant. I commend the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was interesting that Senator Baume prefaced his remarks by using the words `reduction ad absurdum'. I find his example somewhat absurd and somewhat extreme. However, I accept the argument he has put that the amendment fully indicates the intention of the Government. I would have thought that the words which are already in the clause imply exactly what he was saying. In a sense, I am somewhat neutral on the Opposition's amendment. I find it extremely unlikely that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs should seek to find out what somebody did in a shopping expedition or something like that. But I have no objection to the words which he chooses to put in. I accept that they do mean what I think is meant, or intended to be meant, by the words which he seeks to delete.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that the Opposition's amendment has been moved in good faith out of an abundance of concern or some sort of caution that somehow a request could be made for information which is really outside the competence, legitimate capacity or ability of the Aboriginal Development Commission to provide to a Minister. However, I think it is perhaps going too far to try to read into this clause some hidden agenda on the part of a Minister to use the Commission to obtain information on matters which really fall outside its true jurisdiction and competence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government could probably accede to the amendment rather than have a division on it. However, it should be clearly understood that the powers and functions of the Commission, as set out in sections 8 and 9 of the Act, cover a tremendous range of matters. In that situation I would think that the ability of the Minister to request information relating only to the operation of the Commission or about the Act-the Act is, of course, much wider than even those clauses I have referred to relating to functions and powers-does give a very wide range of matters which the Minister could usefully seek information from the Commission on. Therefore, the Government will not oppose, if I can put it that way, this particular amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, first may I thank both the Government and the Australian Democrats. That amendment has been agreed to, but I say to Senator Coulter that we look at the words before us in the Bill and I am grateful to Senator Tate and to Senator Coulter for their support. I now move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (2) Page 2, clause 5, after proposed subsection 10a (3), add the following new subsection:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(4) The Commission is not required to comply with any direction given by the Minister about the contents of the corporate plan.''. </PARA>
<PARA>We have put this amendment under the heading of `Corporate Plan'. It is an amendment to clause 5 on page 2 and we seek to add a new subsection to proposed section 10a. If one reads the proposed section 10a without our amendment, it leaves open the possibility that the Minister might be able to direct the Commission about the contents of its own corporate plan. Whether or not Ministers should direct a statutory body about its corporate plan is not really relevant. This is a very special statutory body. This is a proposal by a government that has made a lot about its belief in self-management. It would make a mockery of self-management as the ideal if it were possible for the government of the day to direct the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) as to what should or should not be put into its own corporate plan. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not questioning the right of a government to issue ministerial directions. I am not questioning some of the other rights which a Minister has; but if we believe in self-management, then the writing of the corporate plan by the Commission should be something which is the Commission's duty, right and job, and no-one else's. So we have merely proposed to add certain words which would make that point quite clear. The corporate plan, when it is being drawn up, has to be drawn up consistent with the statutory base of the ADC. The commissioners have no right in drawing up the plan to go beyond that statutory base. They are limited by the statute; they always have been; they would be limited by the amended statute which emerges. </PARA>
<PARA> There have now been five Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs who have dealt with the Aboriginal Development Commission. No previous Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has found it necessary to put controls of this kind on the ADC. It is not proper that the corporate plan, whose limits are set by the statute anyhow, should be capable of being directed by the Minister. The Minister should adopt the corporate plan within those limits. The fact that things went wrong last year has nothing to do with this; it does not create the circumstance in which a Minister should now direct the ADC about the contents of its corporate plan. The reason things went wrong last year was because of a different set of problems. They are problems which we have discussed in extenso in this place. They have been the subject of a number of investigations and we believe that the addition of the new subclause (4) to proposed section 10a would make it quite clear that the Commission would do all the things which are proposed in the Act, as amended, after the passage of this Bill and after it receives royal assent. It would also make it quite clear that in drawing up the contents of the corporate plan provided for in section 10a, the Minister would not give a ministerial direction. I commend the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to support the amendment moved by my colleague, Senator Peter Baume. We have heard much over the past six or eight months about self-management and bringing the Aboriginals into a self-management plan. I feel that the Bill as it now stands, without our amendment, really deprives Aboriginal communities of that right to manage their own corporate plan, the right to lay down their particular needs as an Aboriginal community and the ability to make their business decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we are-to use a colloquialism-fair dinkum about self-management, we have to let these Aboriginal departments and commissions have their own way and make their own plans. Sure, there are going to be mistakes made. The only reasons mistakes will never be made will be if people are never allowed the opportunity to make decisions. We all have to accept that in bringing a minority group to self-management there are going to be mistakes made. I think we all have to be patient and say, `Yes, that is on the cards and we have to accept that'. But to take people's rights away and say, `You really have not got the ability. You really have not got the experience. You really need someone in the Minister's office to tell you what to do', is really not self-management at all, and I hope Senator Tate can accept this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the Opposition is really being overly nervous in this regard and reading far too much into the legislation to say that this particular clause somehow could counter the attempts to bring the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to that position of self-management which Senator Boswell certainly wishes to nurture and bring to fruition over a period of time. I think he is right in indicating that in coming to that situation-as with other members of the Australian community-mistakes will be made. But when honourable senators read the proposed clause 5-new section 10a-they will see that it is quite clear that the responsibility for the preparation of the corporate plan rests fairly and squarely on the Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commission is to prepare the corporate plan in consultation with the Minister. It is not envisaged that the Minister could give directions; it is a simple matter of consultation. The clear statutory intention is that the responsibility, indeed the obligation, shall be on the Commission. It is mandatory for the Commission to prepare a corporate plan. That is evident from the use of the word `shall'. The full responsibility for that-quite rightly, and in the context of what the Government's policy attempts to achieve-is borne by the Commission in the various ways that were outlined in proposed new section 10a (1) (a), (b), (c) and (d). A review mechanism is also required of the Commission. Within that framework, the idea that the Minister could give a specific direction as to the content of the plan has no legal base within proposed section 10a and, as I say, it indicates that in trying to question how fair dinkum the Government is, the Opposition is perhaps reading too much into the proposed section that is just not there. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Peter Baume would know, because no doubt he operated with section 11 of the principal Act, the directions that can be given are general directions. I cannot believe that they would be of the kind that would dictate the content of the corporate plan, so I do not think there is any fear from the structure of the Act or the amending Bill that would lay a real basis for the amendment moved by the Opposition. Therefore, the Government will not accept the amendment. I reiterate that the Government's reason for not accepting the amendment is not that it is its intention to give a direction as to the specific contents of a corporate plan, but simply that we believe that on a fair reading of the Bill that will not occur anyway. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again, we are guided by the words that are before us. It is not a question of intent. We have to get the words as right as we can. As I say again, we understand that the second reading has been agreed to. We do not contest that now; our job is different. Our job is to examine the clauses and try to get the best we can from them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have before me a copy of the Aboriginal Development Commission Act. Unless section 11 has been changed, a reading of section 11 suggests to me that the Minister could give such a general direction in relation to the contents of the corporate plan if a Minister so wished. Section 11 of the ADC Act has four subsections. Subsection (1) reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission shall perform its functions and exercise its powers in accordance with such general directions as are given to it by the Minister in writing. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate there that those general directions are unspecified; that is to say, we cannot say that in relation to an application for housing by Senator Boswell the Commission shall make this or that decision-that is not permitted-but a general direction is permitted. Sub-section (2) limits the Minister's power. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Subsection (1) does not empower the Minister to give directions relating to the content of any advice, information or recommendation that may be given by the Commission to a Minister, Department or authority of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>It does not say that the Minister is not empowered to give directions relating to a plan drawn up by the Commission. It outlines certain things the Minister cannot do. The Parliament has seen fit in times past to limit the power of a Minister. That has happened from 1980 onwards. It is not as if the proposed amendment is in any way unusual. As we read section 11, we find the capacity of the Minister to issue general directions which we believe could encompass the situation which we are looking at now and we find certain limitations which do not include a limitation on the matters we are considering now. The last two subsections of section 11 relate to certain obligations upon the Minister: an obligation to acquaint the Parliament of directions given by the Minister and an obligation on the Minister not to disclose any matters held to be sacred by Aboriginals. I indicate that we are grateful that in the previous Bill the Committee considered the Government accepted our amendment in relation to the revealing of sacred material. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to this amendment. The Minister's argument seems to have been that he thinks it is unnecessary. I ask the Minister a different question. I invite him to give to the Committee some reasons why we should not support the amendment. I think it is quite harmless. I cannot see any way in which it could cause difficulties or in which it could limit the proper actions by the Minister. If section 11 of the Act has the meaning which I think it has-unless there are subsequent amendments to section 11 of which I am not aware immediately-this is a proper amendment to seek to include in the Bill. I invite the Committee to read our amendment not only in association with proposed new section 10a, but also in relation to the existing section 11 which relates to ministerial directions under the ADC Act. I say to the Minister that I can see no harm in it. It is consistent with the limitations already placed on Ministers within section 11. I can see no downside whatsoever. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take a somewhat different position from that of both the Minister and Senator Peter Baume in that I think we need to recognise that the situation with this Bill is somewhat different from that which obtained throughout the life of the Aboriginal Development Commission. This legislation is to cover a transitional period. Therefore, I am not convinced by Senator Baume's argument that the previous Ministers had not found it necessary to issue such a direction. The period anticipated by this legislation is a period of transition in which the ADC as presently constituted will disappear and a new body will come into existence. I am rather surprised that proposed new section 10a (2) says that each corporate plan shall relate to a period of at least three years and not more than five years, because my understanding is that under this legislation the ADC will disappear long before three years have elapsed and certainly well before five years have done so. Therefore, I am surprised that Senator Baume has not sought to amend that section.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw Senator Baume's attention to an amendment which he intends to make to proposed section 39a (4). It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission shall comply with an approved Finance Direction even if it is inconsistent with the corporate plan. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that, contrary to what the Minister said, in the transitional period in which the ADC is being wound down in preparation for another body taking over, it may well be necessary for the Government, through the Minister, and the Commission, to work quite closely together. I am therefore a little concerned and I am minded not to support the Opposition's amendment because it would be unwise to constrain the process by which that winding down should occur and that may indeed involve some more specific cooperation between the Minister and the Commission. </PARA>

<PARA>Senator Coulter presents an argument to the Committee that this legislation will be defunct in a matter of time. That may be the case, but the facts are that we have no crystal ball and we do not know what is going to happen in the future. We are debating the legislation before us at the moment. I believe that the amendment that we are asking the Committee to carry takes away any contention that the Minister, whether in consultation, by direction or in any other way, can interfere with the corporate plan. The amendment gives to the ADC the right to manage its own corporate plan. I do not think there is anything wrong with our amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing about the debate that has raged over the past eight months is that both sides of the Parliament and the Democrats are in agreement that self-management, self-determination, is the right way to go for the Aboriginal and Islander people. There is no argument between us. There is an argument as to how we reach the goal. The amendment that we are now asking the Committee to carry is going to make that goal so much easier. It is going to take away any fear, if I can put it in those terms, that the Minister might be able to interfere with the corporate plan.

Because the Minister may have to impose, because of Government finance direction reasons, a specific finance direction, there is a very different point of policy and principle involved. Like Senator Boswell, I would invite Senator Coulter to consider the very deliberateness in the amendment, particularly as the corporate plan itself is to be prepared by the Aboriginal members of the Commission, whereas the finance direction is a parliamentary function.</PARA></TALK.START>

I do not know whether he dwelt enough on subsection (2), which indicates that the Minister is not to give directions relating to the content of any advice, recommendation or information that may be given by the Commission to a Minister, department or authority of the Commonwealth or of a State or a Territory. I do not want to make an argument, because I am not absolutely sure, that a corporate plan would fall within the definition, of `advice, information or recommendation given by the Commission to a Minister'.

Indeed, I might just read the Aboriginal Development Commission Act directions under section 11, already tabled in this Parliament, in relation to the corporate plan:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Commission shall provide to the Minister a copy of the corporate plan endorsed by the Commission and shall consider making any amendments to the corporate plan that are, within a reasonable period of time, provided to the Commission by the Minister. The Commission shall, before making any variations to the corporate plan endorsed by the Commission, in so far as the plan relates to the performance of the Commission's functions or the exercise of its powers, request the Minister's views on the proposed variations and take into account any views that are, within a reasonable period of time, provided to the Commission by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly, what is there set out is not a direction. What is provided for is the capacity of the Commission to take into account any views that are forwarded by the Minister. That would be the spirit, I am sure, which lies behind the drafting of new subsection 10a, which speaks of the Commission taking responsibility, being required to prepare the corporate plan, in consultation with the Minister-but merely in consultation-and not subject to the direction of the Minister. The fact is that the Government, as I say, resists this amendment because of the inference that lies behind much of the debate on it from the Opposition side. It is not the intention of the Government to direct the content of the corporate plan, but that would become evident, even if this amendment were carried. We could live with it. </PARA>

<PARA>Mr Campbell made some kind comments about him and continued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . It was most disappointing to hear him attacked by Senator Crichton-Browne during a Senate inquiry. I took up this matter with Senator Crichton-Browne who, I think, now concedes that he might have been a little intemperate. </PARA>
<PARA>While the language may have been persuasive, I resile from nothing which I said then and, so that there is some continuity, I place on the record what I said on 9 March:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . It is not without significance to note that in Western Australia, when we had this absolute imbroglio, confusion, chaos, incompetence and, in some cases, corruption, the department head was Cedric Wyatt, who for his sins was promoted by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Gerry Hand, to the position of General Manager of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). At a time of apparent crisis in the ADC, when new, competent and efficient management was needed, it got a personally hand-picked appointment who had reigned over the Department in Western Australia, which the Auditor-General referred to in the report in a most scathing way. I put it down as nothing higher than gross inefficiency and incompetence. It certainly reflects on the Minister's judgment in his choice of people. It indicates to me that he is concerned more about the politics of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs than he is about the Aboriginals involved and the assurance that they receive the funds which are allocated by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA>I stand by those words. They have since been vindicated by a number of internal inquiries in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. As I say, Mr Campbell was suggesting, as a result of a conversation with me, that he thought he had learned that I had changed my mind. Of course I have not and what I said on that occasion still stands. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw the Senate's attention to the decision by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal to slash dispensing fees for pharmacists by 23 per cent. This action is to be deplored. In fact, the entire viability of the pharmaceutical industry is now at stake. We have a Tribunal which has shown that it is clearly out of touch with reality. I believe that the current Tribunal should be recalled and be told by the Labor Government that its decision is detrimental to the community and also to the industry. This Government has the power to recall the Tribunal and to advise it on this matter. The Government should go one step further and should replace the present members with people who have a greater understanding and a greater depth of knowledge of the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Members of this present Tribunal have no special expertise in the area of health care. That is absolutely disgraceful. Not one member is a pharmacist or has any dealings with the pharmacy industry. Appointees to the Tribunal should be people who have expertise in the pharmacy or related professions. It is not as if such people are not available. According to Mr Peter Ware, President of the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia, there are a number of combined pharmacists and barristers or pharmacists and accountants who are available. A senior member of the Small Business Development Corporation is a combined pharmacist and accountant. Yet not one member of the present Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal has in the past had any pharmaceutical background or even connection with the pharmaceutical industry. We have to look at that in light of the Tribunal's judgments which will have drastic effects upon the income of many pharmacists. It is no good for the Government to say that it is an independent Tribunal. It is no use having an independent Tribunal if that Tribunal is made up of incompetent people who lack knowledge and background of the industry. It is no wonder that the Tribunal is coming up with such stupid decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) prescription fee will no longer be related to or made up based on the cost of goods sold. It will only be a fixed fee related, firstly, to labour costs, and secondly, to non-labour costs. A fixed fee of $3.50 will now apply. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that the comparison on which the Tribunal based its salary cost for pharmacists was right out of line with the amount the Government pays pharmacists in public hospitals. Meanwhile, the pharmacists who are in business have had to fund salary increases-usually on a percentage-and a 3 per cent superannuation award. This mark-up is especially worrying as pharmacists will no longer be able to afford to have a holding stock. </PARA>
<PARA> What could eventuate is that a prescription will be given to the pharmacists on one day and it will be sent to the wholesaler who will supply it and, in all probability, it will be dispensed the next day, at the earliest. So we will have a delayed problem so far as the patient is concerned. What about the aged who will have to come in the next day-another bus trip, another taxi fare, just to pick up the prescription? This may be the situation for the common, every day prescription and it will almost definitely be the case for the rarer prescription. The health care of the individual, particularly the elderly, therefore is very much at stake. </PARA>
<PARA> The Pharmaceutical Society of Tasmania noted an anomaly that exists: the proposed Tribunal charges will add to the hardship. The majority of wholesalers are already charging 3 per cent higher wholesale prices than recommended by the Federal Government, but the Government does not take into account the wholesaler's price; it takes into account the recommended price in payments to pharmacies, which is a difference. The pharmacist's margin is continually being whittled away. </PARA>
<PARA> The Pharmaceutical Society estimates that up to one-third of Australian pharmacists could go out of business. That is over 1,000 people, all small businessmen. This is part of the Government's attack on small business. The average pharmacy could lose $26,000 a year because of the cuts; that is, a small pharmacy would lose $500 income a week at a minimum. Larger businesses could lose $100,000 annually. At the same time, these same people have to fund heavy overdrafts with high interest rates to carry on their business because of the high overheads which they have to sustain. As I have mentioned on previous occasions, there are approximately 5,200 pharmacies in Australia. They are not only a major component of the small business sector but also a major employer of women. It is worth reminding the Government that 60 per cent of pharmacists and 99 per cent of pharmacy assistants are women. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. I think it is appropriate at this stage that I should comment that I have a vested interest in this matter because my wife is a salaried pharmacist on a part time basis. Certainly these pharmacists, including my wife, will remember the Government's action when they next vote. Many pharmacists are already struggling as a result of the previous Federal Government's move and this latest blow will send many to the wall. With this proposed loss of income many pharmacists will find it easier just to close their doors. Those pharmacies that do remain will have to substantially restructure and curtail their costs. This can only be done through reducing staffing levels and also reducing stock levels. It is feared that many pharmacies will no longer be able to keep stocks of rarely used medicines. Again, this will detrimentally affect the elderly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it should be pointed out that the Federal Government estimates it will save $20m by implementing its decision but I think every reasonable person who has looked at this so-called $20m saving must query its validity. So if over 1,000 pharmacies go out of business it means that in practical terms 1,000 businessmen who usually provide an income for possibly two or three people or more will have to find other jobs in a difficult market, adding, perhaps, to unemployment and other costs. People can no longer save or spend the same amount of money as previously. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect will be multiplied through the community. Studies are being conducted as to the multiplying effect of the loss of jobs in one industry in relation to the loss of jobs in other industries. For example, in the mining industry in the early part of this decade it was estimated that for every one job lost, four were lost in the related industries of transport, construction or manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA> The point that I am making is that if the Government is going to close 1,000 pharmacies it is going to have a downstream multiplier effect greater than that across the economy. The situation is such that in the pharmacy industry we will see a practical out-working of the economy of this country if the decisions of the Tribunal are carried out. There will be a substantial loss of jobs and it will be detrimental to health care. The unfortunate fact is that many of the pharmacies forced to close their doors will be the very ones offering the most needed service. I refer to the pharmacies in the small towns and in isolated areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal has not considered the cost to the community of the widespread pharmacy closures in these areas. The local pharmacist is often called upon to dispense free on-the-spot advice and because he or she is a health care expert the pharmacist can dispense that advice. Pharmacies continuing to operate will, of necessity, need to make staff cuts. There will no longer be room for on the spot advice in the larger urban areas. In those areas where the pharmacy has closed no such pharmaceutical advice will be available. In other words, the Tribunal's decision will set us on a path towards the lowest common denominator level of pharmacy practice in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> People will go to the doctors and there will be greater cost to Medicare and to the nation. They will seek advice through a more expensive medium-through the doctors and not through the pharmacists. This will cause greater costs through wasted drugs, diseases caused by incorrect self-diagnosis or unnecessary demands on other parts of the health system. The Government just has not thought through the consequences. We have heard of unintended consequences resulting from tax decisions. We are going to have a lot of unintended consequences if this Tribunal's decision is carried out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I mentioned, a visit to the doctor could now be necessary if there is no pharmacist in the local area-a much greater expense than to chat to your friendly pharmacist for no fee. Preventive medicine will not be practised to the same extent that it is practised at the present time. Expensive hospitalisation as well as lost productivity and unnecessary human suffering will be the result. The findings of the Tribunal talk about a special rate for pharmacies that may not be economically viable but are essential as contemplated under the Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The response to that is that Mr Peter Ware of the Australian Pharmaceutical Society feels that in country areas the supply of medicines outside normal business hours could well be jeopardised. The essential pharmacy allowance will not necessarily cover the costs involved. Many country hospitals throughout Australia do not have their own pharmacies. They rely on the local pharmacist to supply their medicines. The special rate here need not apply. Thus some country pharmacies may not even be able to obtain the special rate. Even so, the special payment of 35c an item on the first 1,000 prescriptions each month will do little to compensate for the much after hours activity that is often required by a country pharmacy practice. Quite often the pharmacist has to pay for the cost to put the particular prescription on a bus to go out to an isolated area. Overall the Tribunal's findings are a catastrophe for the community and for pharmacies. </PARA>

So the decision has been based on flawed information, on limited terms of reference and with little knowledge of the pharmaceutical industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Earlier I referred to the Tribunal's lack of expertise, lack of background knowledge and experience in the industry. Even honourable senators on the other side of this chamber are expressing concern about the decision but presently they have been muzzled. I believe that the Minister has to head off a back bench revolt. Indeed, he has to head off a community revolt on this issue. The Government is becoming oblivious to the concerns within the community. It is becoming blind. It is like the ostrich. The Opposition knows that because people are suffering, businesses are suffering. But the Government is becoming blind to the consequences of its actions over such a wide spectrum nowadays. </PARA>
<PARA> I still say that the Government should heed the warnings sounded by its own backbenchers. For example, neither this uncaring Labor Government nor the Tribunal has recognised the productivity improvements of pharmacists as a result of computerisation. The promises by government on issues such as quick payment are, for some pharmacists, honoured more in the breach than in the observance. The only recourse is to recall the Tribunal and to admit the Government's grave concern about the decision handed down. The Tribunal should then be advised to reconsider its findings in the light of the present reaction of the community and the pharmacy industry. Not only should that decision preferably be overruled but also the Tribunal should have placed on it competent employees. It will be too late to correct the effects of these findings if we wait too much longer. </PARA>

That seminar was held at the technical and further education college at Box Hill in the electorate of Chisholm, arranged in part by Dr Mike Wooldridge, the honourable member for Chisholm. It was a particularly successful undertaking. At that seminar a number of important papers were given and apart from a major speech by the Hon.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With the fiftieth anniversary of the commencement of World War II being remembered this weekend, I would like to draw the attention of the Senate to the work of a friend and constituent of mine who is at present representing Australia in Paris. The Reverend John Fincher, from Quirindi, who is still an active priest in the Anglican church in my local town and a local shire councillor, was an airman serving in the Royal Australian Air Force in England during World War II and he actually survived a crash in a Lancaster during that war. He has worked extraordinarily hard for a number of years to establish the World War Memorial Fund. This is a fund conceived as a living memorial to the victims of world war and to future victims of natural disaster, be it flood, famine, bushfire, storms, droughts or earthquakes. The fund was initiated by Group Captain Leonard Cheshire, another extraordinary man who was actually in this place on the night before the last Anzac Day celebrations in Australia. It was the belief of these two men that this year, the anniversary year of the outbreak of World War II, would be an appropriate time to establish such a fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I recall Reverend Fincher bringing this idea to me quite some time ago and I am pleased that he has achieved his goal in engaging interest in its establishment in Australia. Indeed, the Australian patrons of the fund are the leaders of the four major political parties, and I think that says a great deal for those people. Reverend Fincher is currently in Paris planning the appeal on a world basis. The countries being represented at these talks include the United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, West Germany, Japan, Canada, India and Italy. It is also intended that the group will meet with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, General Javier Perez de Cuellar. </PARA>
<PARA> The World Memorial Fund for Disaster Relief appeal will run from tomorrow, 1 September, for a period of six years-equal in length to the Second World War. It seeks to raise $10 for each life lost in war in this century. Over 80 million people have been lost this century, both civilians and military. The date of 1 September was chosen as it was the date on which the Germans invaded Poland, although Britain and France did not declare war until 3 September 1939. The capital collected for the fund will be invested in the country in which it is raised. Decisions on allocations for disasters from the accrued interest will be made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> The whistle used in the trenches in World War I to send men over the top will be the fund's symbol. They are now used to summon help and this emphasises the central objective of the appeal. It is hoped that on 1 September, which is tomorrow, people will blow whistles for this very good appeal. The central objective of the fund will be that for every life lost a life will be saved. Tonight I would like to urge all honourable senators and, indeed, every Australian to contribute to this most worthy appeal. I pay tribute to the fortitude and compassion of people like Reverend John Fincher, who have committed so much of their lives to establishing this fund, and getting a reconciliation of all the people who fought in the wars. I am confident the fund will be an international success and provide much needed emergency relief in years to come. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to bring to the attention of the Senate some aspects of the very fast train (VFT) project that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and Senator Richardson seem to have wilfully ignored in their recent advocacy. I say `wilfully ignored' because they rejected the advice of the large majority of the members of the study group they set up to advise them. I notice with some gratification that, according to the Sydney Morning Herald of 19 August 1989, this select group of public servants from a number of departments arrived at many of the same conclusions that I did after reading the VFT concept report. I presented my observations on the project to a group of concerned citizens at Bowral on 7 July this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Much has been claimed for the very fast train. It will be very fast, fuel efficient and weather resistant. It will go to exciting places like Canberra and the snowfields. Fares will be cheaper than those of the airlines, the system will be privately funded and will return a profit. Jobs will be created in construction, maintenance and operation of the system and it will interface well with existing systems. Unfortunately, this is not true. The very fast train is a silly and untimely project. It promises to be a practical and financial embarrassment if it is put into effect. If one still possesses the innocence to wonder whether four large companies, the New South Wales Government and now the Federal Government could propose and support a scheme that will fail to met the technical standards necessary to yield a profit, the answer is yes, they could, and would. Examples of such silliness abound. </PARA>
<PARA> Some time ago I saw a program called Beyond 2000 which dealt with a massive hydro-electric scheme on the border of Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Those countries are going to dam the Danube at enormous expense and with environmental effects that will seriously damage agriculture and degrade water supplies in the region. They borrowed money from Austria to finance the project and nearly all of the first 20 years of electricity production will go to Austria to pay off the loan.

In the case of the VFT I believe that the companies involved know what they are doing and the Federal and State governments are the bunnies, or rather, as always, we are the bunnies, who will have to pay the real costs of this extravagant project.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is an article titled `Why the VFT Project Won't Work' by John Nestor. John Nestor is a former passenger business manager with the New South Wales State Rail Authority (SRA). He provides an excellent summary of many of the problems with the project and demonstrates that it cannot possibly pay its way. However, at the end he suggests that the consortium should have the freedom to go ahead with the project on the clear understanding that there should be no government bail-out if there are difficulties. I believe that this would be a serious mistake. </PARA>
<PARA> Imagine this situation three years into the project: land has been resumed, mountains levelled, a great swathe has been cut through the landscape from Sydney to Melbourne and perhaps one rail and some fences have been installed. Most of the $4.8 billion has already been spent. The companies in the consortium are crying poor because of unexpected cost overruns, union problems, the state of the economy and so on. Meanwhile, the public will have been bombarded with skillfully made television advertisements along the lines of `The quiet, big over achiever'; `Into the 21st century', `Australians working for a better Australia'. Stirring stuff! The 25,000 workers employed on the project are about to be thrown out of work. Interest rates have risen to 21 per cent. It seems that the rest of us will never have the pleasure of riding on the new toy. National pride will be involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Which government could afford to let the project die? Some formula would be found and the Government would accept an invitation to invest in the project, or some complicated loan formula would be found to hide the direct cost to the community. When the system goes into operation there will be teething problems, requiring more public money. After the novelty has worn off it will be found that the system is not attracting enough custom, it is too slow, with high fares, and more government-sourced money will be needed to try to build up patronage. If we have not achieved full banana republic status by this stage, the VFT should be enough to tip us over the edge. The time to stop the project is now. Governments are already being sucked into the project by their collusion in the land resumption program. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the problems of this project in more detail. The consortium obviously strongly favours the Snowy-Gippsland route, which would traverse the Murrumbidgee Valley and the East Gippsland region, where a swathe 250 metres wide would have to be cut out to allow for the safe passage of the train. This loss of trees will have to go into the debit side of the ledger when we count Mr Hawke's billion trees. The impact on flora and fauna cannot be assessed without a proper study, although the fences alone could have a major effect on some animal species. The fences and the masts for the high-tension power lines will certainly degrade the aesthetic quality of the wilderness areas. Farmers are also concerned about the effects of the herbicides that will have to be sprayed regularly along the track corridor. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us assume for a moment that the VFT goes ahead and captures the projected market share. I suspect that the noise will be really impressive. If the VFT goes through one's backyard 70 times a day, one will be able to visit suburbs under the Mascot flight path for a quiet holiday, except at the present moment. The Japanese have tried to silence their much slower trains without much success. This may limit the utility of farming land close to the lines and presents a strong argument for using as much of the existing rail corridor for faster train services rather than cutting across country. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, there will be relative silence along the SRA lines in New South Wales, with at least a massive reduction in existing passenger services. This will certainly lead to a loss of jobs in State rail services-more, it has been suggested, than will be offered by the VFT. I have no particular brief for the SRA, as it exists now. Generations of mismanagement and the intransigence of the unions have run the system down. This has been aided by the de facto subsidising of long-distance road freight, which ought to be uncompetitive with a properly run rail freight system. Taxes and other imposts on all of us repair the massive damage to the roads caused by heavily-laden trucks. </PARA>
<PARA> On tonight's news we saw yet another semi-trailer accident on the Hume Highway. It cost three lives. Fatal accidents involving the semi-trailers that run parallel to our rail systems have been much in the news and the response of the New South Wales Government was to institute a revenue-earning police program called `big brother'. I do not think it fully appreciated the irony of the title, which illustrates the tendency of all our governments to react to problems with repressive rather than constructive action. Not only would action to revive rail freight conserve fuel and help with our balance of payments problems; it would also make a small contribution to our global environmental problems by reducing our net carbon dioxide contribution to the atmosphere. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the first questions that come to mind with the VFT is: Will it work? I found this answered in the VFT concept report: `No, it won't'. The projected timetables are impressive, but the very high speeds cited are not the result of technical analysis of existing high-speed rail systems and informed projections. Instead, they are a product of the need to compete directly with aeroplanes travelling at over 900 kilometres per hour. Allowing market analysts to design a high-speed rail system is on a par with asking a barber to fix the brakes on one's car. </PARA>
<PARA> John Nestor described the timetable claims as akin to East-West Airlines telling us that its engineers were going to develop an aircraft 30 per cent faster than Concorde by 1995. Developing a train that could run routinely at 350 kilometres an hour would involve solving a number of problems that have been scarcely touched in the official report, including adhesion, wear and power pick-up problems. There would also be considerably larger stresses on the motors and power transmission than exist in the painfully developed overseas systems. </PARA>
<PARA> Adding to the air of unreality is the amazing versatility of the new train. It will simultaneously travel at express speed to match the airlines but also provide a regular service for regional centres and aid the decentralisation of Sydney and Melbourne by providing regular commuter services from places like Bowral. Apparently it can stop on a pin with its triple braking system and accelerate like a jet fighter. </PARA>
<PARA> There is talk of developing this technology here and of the value of the technological spin-offs to local industry. The dollar signs have gone up in the eyes of interested parties and they are saying what a terrific idea the VFT is. However, I doubt that there will be much local development. With a timescale of only five years, we are most likely to see the slower Japanese bullet trains on the tracks, although they may be painted green and gold. Even if there is some local development it is unlikely to generate significant export potential. If this project goes ahead it will almost certainly prove that the practical limit of wheel on rail systems is under 300 kilometres per hour. </PARA>
<PARA> Several authors of articles on the VFT have cast a cold eye over the financial claims made by the consortium. I mentioned John Nestor earlier. Nestor deals with some of the technical improbabilities and goes on to estimate expected returns on the considerable investment required for the VFT. Accepting the consortium's claims for market share and making generous assumptions about a very low interest rate, even a very cursory calculation reveals that the VFT could not possibly pay its way with the proposed fare structure. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly, the VFT concept report practically concedes that the project is not viable. In section 2.5.4 titled `VFT Finances' it concedes that `accounting losses would be incurred for several years of operation'. Note the use of `accounting' to minimise the fact that the losses would be real and require what the report calls `structuring', which, as far as I can tell from my position of financial naivety, just means that a lot more money would have to be fed into the system. The claims that the use of the route for pipelines and communications would earn significant revenue are unsubstantiated and it is hard to see the Gippsland route offering a useful and economic pipeline for any product. Natural gas pipelines from the Bass Strait fields already exist for much of the distance, and they are closer to the existing rail route. We should also take note of the recent catastrophic accident in the USSR, where a pipeline running beside a railway ruptured and caused great loss of life. </PARA>
<PARA> A more interesting reference under `VFT Finances' is the claim that `real estate value capture' could `contribute to the financing of the project'. What does this mean? Is the project as much concerned with property speculation as transport? Will the consortium seek special treatment from governments for its land acquisition program and development applications by arguing that the project will fail unless they can make profits in this area? It seems very likely. At the end of the very short and sketchy section on finance the report says that it `may be open to governments to invest in the VFT'. May be open? It will be an offer that they cannot refuse. </PARA>
<PARA> There are several other troubling features of the economics of the project. Are the companies involved going to use the `accounting losses' for tax loss purposes? What is the role of the financial engineering company Kumagai-Gumi? This company has a very interesting record of being able to entangle Australian governments in its construction programs. There is the Sydney Harbour tunnel. Notice that Kumagai prefers not to enter into open tenders. There is the Victorian central development project, where Kumagai has managed to get the terms of its contract changed in its favour, although critics argue that the project should be put out to tender again. There is the Adelaide station environs redevelopment, where special legislation was passed to bypass local planning and building controls. I suspect that we will see a lot more of this in the future if the VFT goes ahead. Mr President, I seek leave to incorporate my copious notes in Hansard, as there is restlessness in the chamber. I would be quite happy to do so with the consent of those present. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Kumagai Gumi obviously has ready access to the almost embarrassing surplus of cash in the Japanese financial system. They will be willing to forgo profits for the sake of entry to the local market. They can afford to take the long view and their ambitions may have little to do with providing an economically viable fast train service. The Australian companies also have an incentive to cuddle up to Kumagai because of possible cooperative ventures in the future with this wealthy international company. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the concept report is sketchy on details of finance it does dedicate some space to a philosophical explanation of the difference between ``bad'' foreign debt and ``good'' foreign debt. Apparently the finance for the VFT will be good foreign debt, despite the fact that this massive investment will produce no balance of payments benefits except perhaps a slight increase in tourism revenues and perhaps a reduction in outlays for imported fuels. </PARA>
<PARA> If Australia is to run up a 4.8 billion dollar debt it ought to be invested in projects that will enhance our export earnings, not in a flashy people mover that will grow at the expense of existing transport systems. But will it displace other transport systems? It seems naive to suppose that the airlines would lie down and let the VFT run all over them. And will Australians suddenly alter their car-driving habits just because the VFT is available? The report makes the somewhat ingenuous suggestion that the State rail systems could benefit from the VFT by taking the cars of VFT travellers interstate. With the current state of the SRA, for instance, travellers would be lucky to get their cars within a week and this program would surely be totally uneconomic. Australians drive their cars so much partly because of the woeful inadequacy of public transport systems and the lack of this infrastructure makes the VFT itself much less attractive. </PARA>
<PARA> I find the market survey presented by the consortium unconvincing even discounting the technical problems presented by the system's manifest inability to compete with the airlines on travel time. Initial data was provided by a survey conducted by Macquarie University, extra data was injected and the package was sent off for analysis by three bodies overseas. The vast difference between the proposed Australian setting and the densely populated areas where high speed trains run successfully makes me doubt the validity of the market study. </PARA>
<PARA>Social Dislocation and Land Resumption</PARA>
<PARA> If a large percentage of passenger travel through South-East Australia is shifted to the Canberra-Gippsland route there will be considerable social dislocation, both in the areas from which travellers have been diverted and in the new growth centres around the proposed line and its stations. I have already mentioned the apparent intention of the consortium to enter into real estate speculation and development-probably on a preferential basis. Others will no doubt want to get into the action. Like the shift away from existing transport systems, the speculation and development will offer little real net benefit. A few will benefit-as they have in the over-heated Sydney real estate market-but many will be disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> Land resumption will be closely associated with this. Not only will the land necessary for the track corridor need to be resumed, but there will be extra areas for stations, shunting yards, power transformers and no doubt whatever ancillary services that the consortium deems necessary for the proper operation of the service. We may well see government legislation allowing the consortium a liberal interpretation of what is necessary, allowing them to resume land at bargain basement prices and either develop it themselves or lease or sell it later at a considerable profit. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be considerable inequity associated with land resumption and development along the VFT route. A landowner whose property is bisected by the track will lose ready access to parts of his or her own land, will be assaulted 70 times a day by the horrendous noise of the lowflying VFT and will have to put up with a vista of unsightly fences and high-voltage power gantries-losses well in excess of any likely compensation. </PARA>
<PARA> A neighbour who lives over the hill may be able to make a killing by developing a tourist hotel or a high-density town-house development for displaced city dwellers. Rates and the general cost-of-living would be sure to rise. All of this could result in a degradation of community cohesion. </PARA>
<PARA> With so much at stake and the exact route uncertain there may well be a temptation for some people with a bit of loose change on hand to resort to a bit of brown paper bag and used banknote negotiation to have the track re-routed to a more convenient alignment. </PARA>
<PARA>The Canberra Connection</PARA>
<PARA> It does not surprise me that this idea had its genesis in Canberra and that Canberra has been suggested as a suitable location for the VFT headquarters. Absurd concepts emerge and prosper in this rarified atmosphere. One of the strong arguments for the VFT is the inconvenience and inefficiency of air-travel from Sydney to the under-equipped and often fog-bound Canberra airport. First let me assure you that the nation is not going to collapse in a heap if a few politicians and public servants fail to turn up on time. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, it is also argued that Canberra airport could be expanded to international standard, when it would serve also as Sydney's second airport. Travellers could take the VFT to Sydney which would be only an hour away-or so it is claimed. There are also vague claims about massive developments in Canberra based on access via the VFT, although looking at a map it's hard know quite where they will be put. The arguments about Canberra would seem to work both ways for the VFT. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an argument for an improved rail service to Canberra, but it does not support the VFT, which proposes totally unrealistic transit times through the suburban sprawl of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a good argument for the fast freight service which the concept report mentions approvingly because the VFT could not carry heavy freight. </PARA>
<PARA>A proposal for improved rail services</PARA>
<PARA> Reviving rail services is a good idea, but it must involve an enhancement of our existing system. If the money is available then it ought to be spent on a staged upgrading of this system. A paper by the society for social responsibility in engineering suggests an upgrading of the existing track to allow a technically feasible 250 km/h and extending the railway at 250 km/h standard from Goulburn to Canberra to Wagga with the long overdue electrification of the line. Some deviations from the existing line would be needed to permit the higher speeds but the total investment would be a fraction of that mooted for the VFT and such a program would allow a realistic period for developing the technology needed. </PARA>
<PARA> If the program proved itself then track modification and electrification could be extended to Melbourne and travel times could be reduced to 4 or 5 hours-which is realistically the best that the VFT would be likely to achieve. This program would also facilitate fast freight and overnight rail courier services. The best use would be made of the existing track, there would be a minimum of land resumption-by a government authority-and there would be public accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> I wouldn't pretend that this program is without its difficulties, the major one is shaking the SRA out of its long sleep but this has to be done anyway and the sooner the better. </PARA>
<PARA>Less Haste More Speed</PARA>
<PARA> There are some basic assumptions behind the VFT project that will soon be seen as anachronistic. We will soon be forced to realise, if we haven't caught on already, that we need to reassess philosophies of untrammeled growth and development, the high-speed go ahead at any cost thinking that has dominated Western culture. I don't suggest that we all ought to eat only lentils and go to bed at dusk. I am very appreciative of the benefits of our technology and we are going to need all our inventiveness to find solutions to the problems that we have largely made for ourselves through our ignorance. I earlier mentioned the Concorde supersonic passenger plane in passing. A few years ago predictions were that we would all soon be wizzing through the stratosphere in supersonic planes. This has turned out not to be technically or economically feasible. Larger sub-sonic passenger transports were the realistic limit. </PARA>
<PARA> We may find that there is a place for faster passenger rail services on the east coast of Australia, especially if fuel shortages raise the cost of other forms of transport and rail efficiencies and services are improved. There is no reason why the catering and communications services mooted for the VFT could not be provided on other rail systems. An emphasis could be placed more on quality of travel rather than merely speed. </PARA>
<PARA> We also may have to consider more often whether our journeys are really necessary. I am amazed at the way this project has assumed reality-to the point where many people assume it will go ahead-despite glaring contradictions on finance and technical feasibility and the extraordinary delegation of the land acquisition rights of governments to a private consortium for private profit. </PARA>

The very fast train will, in fact, operate with the same amount and sophistication of computer equipment as modern aircraft do, and all the driver will have to do to ensure the safety of the very fast train is to install in his cabin the same safety equipment that air crew now install in the cabins of modern aircraft, that is, a doberman pinscher. Not many people know that. One may well ask, `Why would one put a doberman pinscher in the cockpit of a modern aircraft to ensure safety?'. Why would one, indeed? And as no-one else asked, I had to. Well, the reason is this. The pilot has to feed the dog and the dog has to bite the pilot if he touches the controls.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had a bad record unfortunately in the Northern Territory in terms of pay claims for politicians. I remember only too well the headline that appeared in the Adelaide Advertiser the last time politicians in the Northern Territory got a pay claim. The heading was, `Australia's Golden Politicians'. At that stage of the game politicians in the Northern Territory were the highest paid in Australia and, arguably, particularly in terms of backbenchers, the most underworked. As I said before, the obvious example to use is the position of the Government backbenchers who service the town of Alice Springs where four State members of parliament represent 22,000 people. Each member has an average number of 2,200 electors. The Parliament sits on 21 days a year and has no active committee system operating in the recesses. It really is a great deal of money for the amount of work those members do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I place on record again the fact that the timing of this pay claim in the Northern Territory is appalling. Politicians should act as politicians. In other words, there should be a political consideration. We in the Northern Territory at the moment are hurting more than those in any other place in Australia because of the pilots strike. There is no question at all that the pilots who are failing to service the Northern Territory will use as a weapon for their identical pay claim the fact that the leaders of government who are busily condemning the strike at the moment have just voted themselves precisely the same pay rise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, upon notice, on 23 May 1989:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Did the Government's Phosphate Mining Corporation set aside $6.5 million in the event of mine closure, for the restoration and rehabilitation of large areas of Christmas Island scarred by mining, and did the Government decide to spend only $500,000 on selective rehabilitation.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Is it not a fact that last year's cyclone caused massive damage to the Island's rainforest canopy, that thousands of trees were blown over and many Abbott's Boobies', chicks, fledglings and nesting sites were lost, increasing concern over the long-term survival of the species.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Has the selective rehabilitation of mined areas near nesting concentrations begun.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Is the Department aware that the 1987/88 Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service Annual Report says ``previously in this Report the need to implement a rehabilitation program has been stressed. Not to do so makes almost inevitable the loss of this species of great national and international concern'', if so, what action is being taken.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Has the nursery on the Island been abandoned; if so, what effect will this have and what plans are in train to compensate for this.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Has the Island Administration, the Department or the Government ever received representations about the dangers of Newcastle Disease being imported in live poultry brought to Christmas Island from Singapore and Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Have any studies been done on whether Abbott's Booby or the Frigate Bird are susceptible to Newcastle Disease.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) What quarantine measures are in place to detect possible importation of Newcastle Disease to Christmas Island.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) On 15 March 1988 did the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) tell the Senate he would ``very shortly'' ``almost double'' the Christmas Island National Park, which then covered 17 per cent of the Island.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) What consultations has the Department at this stage undertaken with Christmas Islanders on this extension.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) Is it not a fact that the General-Secretary of the Union of Christmas Island Workers (Mr Bennett) wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) saying by all means extend the National Park, but do so in consultation with the community.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) Did any consultation occur with the community following this letter.</PARA>
<PARA> (13) Is it fair to say that this proposal to double the National Park was a fairly arbitrary one and that little consultation, other than with the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service, occurred on the boundaries.</PARA>
<PARA> (14) Is it fair to say that, under this proposal, areas of dubious significance were proposed to be included, while areas which should have been included were excluded.</PARA>
<PARA> (15) When referring to doubling the National Park, did Mr Arnaudon say in a minute of 22 March 1988 that ``all significant rainforest is included''; if so, why has the Department been working on quadrupling the size of the Christmas Island National Park to cover approximately 70 per cent of the Island.</PARA>
<PARA> (16) Why was it decided that the National Park should be quadrupled, when previously the Minister had been content that it be doubled.</PARA>
<PARA> (17) Who suggested and decided the National Park could be quadrupled and when did this happen.</PARA>
<PARA> (18) Is it not a fact that, following Senator Richardson's promise to double the Park, the previous Opposition Spokesman on External Territories (Mr Braithwaite) suggested that he personally believed the National Park could be tripled, without causing any problems to mining.</PARA>
<PARA> (19) Was the Department and the Minister made aware of this comment, which was reported in the ``Canberra Times''.</PARA>
<PARA> (20) On what date was the proposal to double the National Park, which in March 1988 was to be announced very shortly, put in doubt.</PARA>
<PARA> (21) What consultations has the Department had on the proposal to quadruple the National Park with Christmas Islanders and, in particular, the Christmas Island Community Council.</PARA>
<PARA> (22) Were there any consultations with mining companies on this extension.</PARA>
<PARA> (23) Do the new boundaries of the new National Park, as outlined in the Notice under subsection 7 (12) of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975, published in the Australian on 5 April 1989, contain areas of regrowth.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="769" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="QLD">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The earlier answer provided by the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories to this question, which was published in Hansard on 16 August 1989, pages 212-213, contained the statement, at section 13, that ``The proposed new park boundaries were established on the basis of known research and incorporate all areas identified by an independent consultant in 1985 as wildlife habitat of national or international significance and/or areas of high landscape value. Other areas of the Island subsequently identified in these categories have also been included.' The Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories has now advised me that the Department's records show that a narrow coastal strip from the general area of Grimes Cave to Smith Point was excluded from the proposed new park boundaries to allow future use of Daniel Roux Cave system if needed for water supply purposes and he has provided the following amended answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) At the time the Government decided to close the mining operation on Christmas Island it made $500,000 available for rehabilitation of areas which would afford the Abbott's Booby the greatest protection as the Phosphate Mining Corporation of Christmas Island had not set aside any rehabilitation funds.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Government's rehabilitation program has commenced with re-establishment of an Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service plant nursery on the Island. Plants are being propagated in the nursery and will be replanted in previously cleared areas of the Island focusing initially on areas affording the Abbott's Booby the greatest protection.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Yes. The Government's conservation strategy for the Island which focuses on the preservation of the Island's rare flora and fauna is being implemented. The strategy includes:</PARA>
<PARA> a Commonwealth funded $0.5 million programme for the selective rehabilitation of rainforest clearings to promote breeding success of the endangered Abbott's Booby;</PARA>
<PARA> a major extension to the Christmas Island National Park, (which will increase the size of the present Park to cover between 60-70% of the Island);</PARA>
<PARA> the development of an appropriate plan for Park management; and</PARA>
<PARA> land which will remain outside the new Park boundaries will be managed in sympathy with Park management objectives.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) See (3) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Since July this year, in accordance with Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service policy and under the provisions of the Territory's Prohibited Imports Ordinance 1988, no eggs, poultry or poultry products are permitted entry into Christmas Island unless they are sourced from the Australian mainland.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) The Senate Hansard of 15 March 1988 records ``I am considering a further extension of the national park, which will almost double its size. Hopefully, I can announce that and a plan of management for the enlarged area very shortly.'' At the time of formal notification the agreed park boundaries exceeded the initial estimate quoted by the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) No formal consultation had occurred.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) Mr Bennett wrote to the Prime Minister on 9 May 1988 outlining his concern that the possible extension to the National Park may impact adversely on the proposals to reopen the mining industry. In the same letter Mr Bennett also requested that the local community be given the opportunity to make submissions on the proposed new boundaries.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) The former Minister for the Arts and Territories, Mr Punch, replied to Mr Bennett on behalf of the Prime Minister on 2 September 1988. In his response Mr Punch informed Mr Bennett that representations on the proposed new boundaries would be called for from interested organisations and the public as required under Section 7 (12) of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975.</PARA>
<PARA> (13) The proposed new park boundaries were established on the basis of known research and incorporate areas identified by an independent consultant in 1985 as wildlife habitat of national or international significance and/or areas of high landscape value, except for a narrow coastal strip from the general area of Grimes Cave to Smith Point. The Department's records show that this area was excluded to allow future use of Daniel Roux Cave system if needed for water supply purposes. Other areas of the Island subsequently identified as having national or international significance or high landscape value have also been included. Areas of the Island of high local conservation value although not included in the park extension will be managed in sympathy with the park and are areas where some tourist development could proceed. These boundaries will be kept under review.</PARA>
<PARA> (14) It is considered that all areas included within the park boundaries were justified. Further areas which are currently excluded will be reconsidered for inclusion at some time in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> (15) See (13) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (16) See (13) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (17) In July 1988 the proposal to extend the National Park was agreed between the Minister for the Arts and Territories, (Hon Clyde Holding MP), and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, (Senator Richardson), on the basis of a joint submission from my Department and the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service.</PARA>
<PARA> (18) The Department has no record of any such comment by Mr Braithwaite. Mr Braithwaite was quoted in the ``Canberra Times'' on 22 March 1988 as saying that a coalition government would rehabilitate areas already mined and would be prepared to triple the area of rainforest currently included as national park. The article does not report Mr Braithwaite as saying that he would treble the size of the National Park. In fact the same article goes on to suggest that the Government should not limit private mining concerns to clearing stockpiles and that the Government should be prepared to allow the clearing of an additional 80 hectares of rainforest. In his media release of 21 March 1988 Mr Braithwaite does not rule out the need to clear additional areas of rainforest for a future mining operation.</PARA>
<PARA> (19) Officers of the Department were aware of the article, however, the Department does not have any record of the ``Canberra Times'' article specifically being brought to the Minister's attention.</PARA>
<PARA> (20) See (17) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (21) Prior to formal notification in April 1989, the proposed extension to the Park was informally raised by the Administrator with local community members and representatives both individually and in Community Consultative Group meetings. The formal consultation process has now commenced with the public being invited to provide comments as part of the formal notification process under the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service Act. Information on the proposed extension is available on the Island in English, Chinese and Malay. The Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service will fully consider any comments before final gazettal occurs.</PARA>
<PARA> (22) On 11 February 1988 the former Minister for Arts and Territories, the Hon. Gary Punch MP stated in a media release that the Government would not allow any further rainforest clearing as this was not consistent with the Government's long term strategy for the Island. Potential mine operators were advised that mining was to be conducted only in previously mined and cleared areas of the Island.</PARA>
<PARA> (23) Yes.</PARA>
