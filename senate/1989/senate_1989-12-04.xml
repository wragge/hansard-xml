<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed cuts in funding to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will have serious effects on the viability of many family chemists leading to increased charges and reduction in services and availability of medicines to the community.</PARA>

<TITLE>Company Tax Collection Systems</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's Budget decision to change the company tax collection system will be a crippling blow to many small businesses, already suffering as a direct result of the Hawke Government's high interest rate policy.</PARA>
<PARA> The earlier remittance of company tax payments to the Government will substantially reduce the cash-flow position of thousands of small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA> Many small businesses will be driven under as a result of the Government's decision-unable to find funds for both tax commitments and new stock, only able to borrow at record high interest rates and unable to claim any tax relief on such borrowings to meet their tax commitment.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's proposed changes to the company tax collection system has only been introduced as a greedy grab for more tax revenue.</PARA>
<PARA> The small business community would prefer the Government to completely abandon the proposal rather than make only minor alterations to the original Budget decision, which are not likely to alleviate the situation to any significant extent.</PARA>

<PARA> The petition of citizens of Australia points out:</PARA>
<PARA> that all State governments, States Attorneys-General, most women's groups and the majority of men in Australia, including significant numbers of Members of Parliament, are totally opposed to the importation and distribution of `X' and excessively violent `R'-rated video pornography in Australia;</PARA>

<PARA> Medicare cannot pretend to be a universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy.

Of course, Senator Chaney has been raising this question of productivity a lot recently. No doubt he will raise it again in the course of the matter of public importance to be debated later today. But in so far as any improvements in the productivity situation if an alternative government were to be elected are concerned, the answer is, `Who knows?'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I can understand the agitated state of the Leader of the Government, but he might have listened to the question that was asked and addressed himself to it. It simply asks him whether he could confirm the correctness of one of the statements that appears in the document to which he referred, with some excitement, and that statement was simply this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Productivity increases have not been forthcoming under the accord and therefore real wage growth is impossible under the current system.</PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Minister that in a Question Time last week I gave him some of the most recent figures published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics which relate to declining unit productivity over the last two measured quarters. I ask: Does he, as a matter of fact, agree that productivity improvement is essential to increasing real wages in Australia? Is it a fact that productivity has declined or been stagnant under the accord?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3746" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chaney and I have had this discussion on numerous occasions. Senator Chaney continues to use a measure of productivity which hardly anybody else in this country is prepared to use.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, not the Australian Bureau of Statistics. For example, the Business Council of Australia-which Senator Chaney might like to quote on this issue from time to time-put out a paper on the measurement of productivity a couple of years ago which stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . a clear understanding of the concept of productivity is essential if misinterpretations or misrepresentations are to be avoided.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, it said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . production of goods and services is unequivocally a joint co-operative process. It cannot be said that equipment, or labour, or managerial skill by itself has a distinct productive contribution.</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, any proper measure of productivity must show the relationship between output and all the inputs into the production process. This total factor productivity is the preferred measure of the BCA.</PARA>
<PARA>The paper goes on to elaborate on that. But Senator Chaney will hear a bit more about this during the matter of public importance debate. It is ridiculous for Senator Chaney to say that there has been no productivity increase in this country during the period of the accord. There are plenty of examples where firms have achieved enormous productivity increases-and Senator Chaney knows about them-and they did so in spite of the system which Senator Chaney continually criticises. It is true that real wage growth has not taken place. Only in one year in the history of the accord has there been a real growth in average adult male wages. But there has been an enormous increase in employment and, as I said in the Senate last week, household disposable income has increased steadily under this Government. The only year in which it has not increased was the last year of the Fraser Government, when it went down by 2.5 per cent.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator REYNOLDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has a great deal to do with the Federal Government. The absolutely stunning victory for Wayne Goss and his team is very important from the Federal Government's point of view because we will be able to work very closely with the new Queensland Government. It is a particularly historic occasion in terms of the numbers of women elected to the Queensland Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Knowles interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator REYNOLDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very important victory for women in Queensland. I think that even Senator Knowles would agree that it is quite unheard of for three Ministers to be forced out of government by three women candidates. This is the first time in Australian history that three Ministers have been forced out of office by women candidates. That indicates the strength of women candidates and the way in which they are moving into the political arena in this country today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Furthermore, I think it would be inappropriate of me not to mention that, in addition to those three Ministers forced out by women candidates, Martin Tenni was also forced to resign. He was not even game to face the election. We call Dr Lesley Clark the crocodile killer because she forced Martin Tenni out long before the election was actually held. Senator Giles asks me what difference a Labor government will make in Queensland. Of course it will make an enormous difference to Queenslanders across so many fronts but it will make a particular difference in relation to women and it will make a particular difference in relation to status of women policies.</PARA>
<PARA> For three decades Queensland women have been ignored by the National Party and, indeed, by the Liberal Party because it has been too gutless to stand up to the National Party. Of course, we now see the results of the failure of the Queensland Liberal Party to stand up to the National Party. In terms of status of women policies, we will see Wayne Goss implementing his policy and opening new doors for women. These new policies will bring Queensland women into line with other States in terms of a whole range of initiatives: education, employment and training, women's health and a whole range of other initiatives that will give women a genuine place on the political agenda in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Giles asks me in particular what implications this will have for the Queensland Women's Information Service. As I am sure honourable senators will know, in both Tasmania and Queensland for a number of years, there have been no commitments for implementing status of women policies. Therefore, it was up to the Federal Government to introduce a policy to set up both the Queensland Women's Information Service and the Tasmanian Women's Information Service. With the election of a Labor Government in Tasmania earlier this year I have, with the Prime Minister, been undertaking discussions with the Premier of Tasmania and the Minister Assisting the Premier on the Status of Women, Fran Bladel, in order to ensure a smooth transfer of that service to State responsibility which of course is the normal practice in other States. We look forward to negotiating in a similar way with the new Premier of Queensland, Wayne Goss, and Anne Warner, who is expected to be the Minister assisting the Premier on the status of women. I look forward to a smooth transition so that that service, which has provided some excellent opportunities for Queensland women to gain information and access to ideas about Federal initiatives, can be transferred to Queensland. I see it being a very focal point of implementing Wayne Goss's new women's policy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. It follows his reply to a question from me when he suggested that I was using the wrong measure of productivity. He referred to the preference of the Business Council of Australia for total factor productivity as being the most relevant measure. I ask the Minister: Is it a fact that in the Economic Outlook published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in December 1988 in a table showing productivity trends in selected OECD countries-the Minister should know this as I have quoted it often enough in this place-total factor productivity for Australia for the period 1987 to 1990 is shown as minus 0.2 per cent per annum? I ask the Minister: If the total factor productivity, which is the measure that he supported through the mouth of the Business Council of Australia a few minutes ago, is showing a negative figure for Australia, what are the implications of that for wage and salary earners in Australia? Does it not mean that real wages cannot increase under those circumstances?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I invite Senator Chaney to listen to this. He asked me whether in the June quarter there was a reduction of 1.5 per cent in the gross domestic product per hour worked index. That is what he relied upon on 29 November. That measure is not a particularly reliable one, as the ABS itself says in one of its publications. That measure, on its own, cannot be used to draw any implications for the likely movement in real wages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today, Senator Chaney put words in my mouth saying that I supported the Business Council view relating to total factor productivity. I did not. I said that Senator Chaney ought to take account of the Business Council view, which is a much broader view of productivity than the one he put here last week. Like his Leader, Senator Chaney cannot keep recycling things from one week to another to try to prove the argument which is not acceptable to 80 per cent of the business community in this country. His success rate in selling this policy to the business community has been about 21 per cent. That figure will go down after his Leader's answer last week to a question about the implications of the wages system which an alternative government would introduce. Twice he said, `Who knows?'. That is the position of the Opposition in relation to these matters.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney has tried it every way. During the pilots strike and every industrial dispute he has recycled a different figure and asked, `Doesn't this prove a particular point?'. I ask Senator Chaney what he will do about enterprise productivity if he is ever elected to government. How will he measure productivity in terms of an enterprise? That is one of the questions he has to ask. What will the Opposition do about productivity at the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, which has had a 35 per cent increase in a year? Will the Opposition allow a 35 per cent wage increase for BHP? These are the sorts of questions the honourable senator should address his mind to instead of recycling different sets of figures every week.</PARA>

Rather than have him asking me questions in his reply, I ask him: Since he conceded in his earlier answer that real wages have fallen under the accord in almost every year of this Government and are likely to fall again this year, does he believe that that has anything to do with the actual productivity of industry in Australia; or is he saying that productivity is irrelevant to the fact that Australian wage and salary earners are having less in their pay packets year by year under this Government?</PARA></TALK.START>

Week after week they come in here and suggest that living standards have fallen because real wages have fallen. That is not the appropriate measure because disposable household incomes in Australia have increased in every year since the year in which the Liberal and National parties went out of office when they went down by 2.5 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The attempted coup against President Aquino launched by the right wing RAM or Reform of the Armed Forces Movement, early on 1 December, has been suppressed although mopping up operations, so described, are likely to continue for some time. Loss of life among the military and civilian population and damage to property have been considerable. Rebel elements are dispersing or surrendering, but some units are still occupying key buildings in the Makati business district where, incidentally, the Australian Embassy is located. The motives of the coup attempt, the sixth since President Aquino came to power in 1986, do remain somewhat confused but clearly reflect tensions within the armed forces over political developments in the Philippines and the subordination, so claimed, of the military to civilian democratic rule.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Government was among the first to offer its strong support to President Aquino in resisting the illegal attempt by renegade military elements to seize power and to overthrow the democratically elected Government of the Philippines. We welcome the restoration of the authority of the properly constituted Government of the Philippines. We note that the Government of President Aquino does face difficult challenges in meeting popular expectations for economic progress and social reform in a society where poverty and inequality continue to be major problems. It will be vital for the international community to continue to work constructively with the Philippines Government to meet the challenges of poverty and economic development. The Australian Government will, for its part, extend its full support and encouragement to Mrs Aquino in her efforts to improve the welfare of her people, as Mr Hawke made very clear in his public statements on the issue over the weekend.</PARA>
<PARA> So far as the safety of Australians is concerned, as far as the Government is aware, all Australian nationals and Embassy personnel in the Philippines are reported safe. The Embassy staff and dependants spent the night of last Saturday, 2 December, in the Embassy as the best means, so evaluated, of ensuring their personal safety. They are now, I understand, dispersed in hotels around the Manila area. I should like very warmly to commend the Ambassador and his staff for their very professional conduct and personal courage during what has been obviously a difficult time for them.</PARA>
<PARA> So far as the United States involvement in this matter is concerned, the nature of that involvement has been widely reported. It has extended simply to air cover, air support, without which the position of the Government troops would have been made very much more difficult and the success of the coup attempt would have been very much more likely. That United States military support was offered in response to a direct request from President Aquino, the democratically elected leader of the Philippines. I think the language of the Prime Minister in his statement over the weekend speaks for itself when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I welcome and endorse the positive and speedy response by President Bush to the request for assistance from President Aquino.</PARA>
<PARA> United States action to help counter the illegal attempt to overthrow the freely-elected government of the Philippines is playing an important part in enabling it to reassert its authority.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I preface my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security by reminding him that some years ago, following intensive lobbying by the Australian Democrats, members of the Jewish community and others, the Government agreed to an amendment in this place to the social security legislation regarding the status of restitution payments made to Germans now living in Australia and who had been the victims of Nazi persecution during World War II. Is the Minister aware that Australian residents from other European countries, specifically those who came from the Austrian and Dutch populations, who were also subject to similar persecutions by the Nazis during World War II, are not covered by the amended legislation? What steps will the Government take to close off this anomaly in the Social Security Act in order to exclude restitution payments made to those people from the income test?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Haines is right in that a little while ago in this Parliament we did amend the legislation to ensure that payments made by the Federal Republic of Germany to persons who suffered from, and received compensation for, Nazi persecution during World War II would not be included as income for the purpose of testing Australian social security pensions and benefits. There have been discussions in this place and outside it on the question of whether payments made by the Austrian Government should also be treated in the same light and be excluded as income for the assessment of social security benefits of this category. The Government has been giving some attention to this particular question. In fact, last week there was a meeting of officials representing both Australia and Austria. That meeting was part of a general process of trying to achieve a social security agreement between this country and Austria to cover social security issues. As part of that agreement the Australian Government became satisfied that the payments paid by the Austrian Government, by way of its compensation for Nazi persecution during World War II, were conclusively enough verified as being payments very similar in character to those restitution payments made by the Federal Republic of Germany. As we noted, those payments are already disregarded for the purposes of assessing income. The Government has therefore decided that, as from today, payments made by the Austrian Government as compensation in this area will not affect entitlement to Australian income tested social security pensions and benefits. We see this as a logical extension of the move made a couple of years ago through this Parliament in terms of German restitution payments. We also see this as another step in the process of achieving a general social security agreement between Australia and Austria. Hopefully we will be able to achieve that by 1992. In the meantime, pensions paid to those receiving payments from the Austrian Government as compensation for Nazi persecution will not affect their entitlement to Australian pensions and benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>

Therefore, I do not regard it as having damaged the effectiveness of monetary policy or of anything worthwhile. Indeed, I would regard it as a plus. Some people were rather surprised when Senator Stone said that. But the people who were surprised by his statement do not realise that inside that cynical shell of a National Party politician always lurks a Treasury Secretary desperately trying to get out. On this occasion the Treasury Secretary got out. Whatever Senator Stone's intentions are, in saying what he did, I leave for others to judge.

I ask him whether he agrees with the view in the New South Wales Labour Council paper that a reduction in the average number of unions per enterprise from 4.7 to 4.5, which is the estimate of the Business Council of Australia of the result of the ACTU plan, will have very little impact on micro-economic efficiency and that, to quote the Labour Council paper:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Senator Puplick interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will give Senator Puplick the benefit of that knowledge in a minute or two. It is correct that Mr Hawker has compared the capital gains tax with death duties. In doing so he displayed either a culpable conceptual ignorance of the nature of the taxes or an intention wilfully to misrepresent the facts. I will leave it to others to judge of which offence he was guilty. Of course, the plain fact is-and overlooking complications such as the fact that assets acquired before 19 September 1985 are not subject to the capital gains tax, as that is not terribly important in this context-that a capital gains tax is levied only if there has been a gain; only if the purchase price of an asset was less than the selling price, and in real terms to boot, and this is very important in this context; whereas death duties are levies on the net value of an asset, irrespective of whether it has appreciated or depreciated in price since the time it was acquired.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point, which in this context is particularly important-this is where my direct knowledge of the Merredin district comes into operation-is that, over the long term, the price of agricultural land in Australia does not appreciate in real terms unless it has some market demand for non-agricultural purposes; that is, land obviously adjoining capital cities, prime beach locations or possibly other waterside locations. Anybody who knows anything about the background of agriculture in Australia knows that agricultural land which has only an agricultural market value does not appreciate over the long term; it fluctuates from time to time. I very clearly recall farms in the Merredin district being sold in 1968 for $50 an acre. If we index that figure by the consumer price index, it is over $250 an acre or thereabouts. I know of no land in the Merredin district that has been sold for that price. So Mr Hawker, as well as being either conceptually ignorant or guilty of wilful misrepresentation, had the bad luck to send a letter in to this newspaper in an area which I know very well.</PARA>
<PARA> In this letter, Mr Hawker also mentions the National Farmers Federation. It is a fact that the National Farmers Federation, under the tutelage of the present Liberal Party candidate for Barker, Mr McLachlan, ran a very high profile campaign against both the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax. In so doing, Mr McLachlan portrayed the real interests of the people he purported to represent, because neither the capital gains tax nor the fringe benefits tax has had any significant impact on agriculture, and nor will it in the future, except for those very small areas of agricultural land for which there is a market demand not related to agricultural purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hawker also put forward the usual Liberal Party drivel about incentives and the Liberal Party's desire to look after the little people. One person who is anything but a little person and who will gain a great deal from the Liberal Party's policy on capital gains taxation is the Liberal Party Federal President, who from his one cent share transactions or rorts alone stands to gain $18m-just from the one cent share rort if the Liberal policy is implemented. The Opposition's policy will provide incentives for people to set up more one cent share rorts for themselves and to `invest' in such things as the purchases of works of art. I remember a couple of weeks ago hearing Senator Button answer a question about this. It was a very good question and he gave a very good answer concerning a painting that Mr Alan Bond, another little person-a person about as small as Mr Elliott, or, I suppose, these days a bit smaller than Mr Elliott-had bought some years ago for $5m and sold for $19m. It just so happens that he bought it before September 1985 but, leaving that unimportant thing aside, Mr Bond picked up a capital gain of $14m. Anybody who wants to do that in the future, of course, will have an incentive to do the sort of thing that Mr Bond did. Where do these paintings come from? They come almost always from overseas. In other words, the Opposition policy provides a very clear incentive to rort one cent share schemes and to go on a spending splurge buying works of art from overseas, both of which will aggravate the country's fundamental economic problems.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are reports attributed to diplomats in Bangkok that the authorities in Myanmar are secretly trying political dissidents and sentencing them to long prison terms. Those reports accord broadly with information from other sources that the military regime has adopted severe repressive measures against its political opponents. In particular, as we all know, the leaders of the National League for Democracy, Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin U, have been held under house arrest since 20 July and thousands of other political activists have also been detained. According to figures released by the Myanmar authorities, no fewer than 100 people have been sentenced to death by military tribunals and civilian courts since July this year. I am not aware of any of those sentences having yet been carried out, but obviously that is a matter of profound concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I raised all these matters personally in New York on 4 October when I met the chairman of the Myanmar delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, Brigadier General Nyan Lynn, who is also a member of the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council. I sought a lifting of restrictions on political activity, the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners in preparation for free and fair elections, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms of the people of Myanmar.</PARA>
<PARA> For Australia to send observers to the elections on the assumption that they are held in May next year as scheduled, it would, of course, be necessary for the Myanmar authorities to issue an invitation, or at least indicate a willingness to do that, which they have so far not done. Moreover, under the present circumstances, with the main opposition leaders under house arrest, there is a very serious question as to the value of sending observers to determine the fairness of the election process itself. An election process, however fairly conducted on the day, is hardly worth the name if in the campaign period leading up to it there is a process of stifling political dissent and inhibiting the fair and open conduct of political campaigning in the way that is presently occurring.</PARA>
<PARA> All these matters will be kept under close review by us. I would not like to foreclose the question of observers at this stage but at the moment the situation in Myanmar is profoundly disappointing, to say the least, and it is very important indeed that the Myanmar authorities take some rapid steps to open up the campaign process if they want the elections, if they are held next year, to have any shred of credibility in the international arena.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the subject of the investment security issue, I have seen a number of press reports discussing the potential for Taiwan investment in Australia and the allegations that some potential investors are concerned that their investments may not be secure. The Australian Government obviously welcomes investment in Australia by Taiwan companies, which will be treated in the same way as investment from other sources. In recent weeks we have been considering this issue in detail and officials have proposed a number of options for consideration by the Government to lay to rest all fears on the part of investors from unrecognised entities such as Taiwan about the security of their investment in Australia. At this stage all I can say about that is that I expect that the Government will make a decision on this matter in the very near future. Whatever action is taken will be consistent with the position of successive governments that the People's Republic of China (PRC) is the sole legal government of China and that Taiwan is a province of that country. That is the framework that will continue to guide Government policy towards Taiwan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So far as direct air links are concerned, we acknowledge that direct aviation links with Taiwan, and the increased tourism that might well be associated with that, could have economic benefits for Australia. We would very much like to see the establishment of a direct Australia-Taiwan air link. However, any consideration of that has to take place against the background of Australia's acceptance, as I have just said, of the PRC Government as the sole legal government of China and our acknowledgment of its claim that Taiwan is a province of China. Notwithstanding the increase in diplomatic activity from Taiwan which has obviously made its mark on the Opposition, the events since 4 June have not changed this situation.</PARA>
<PARA> So far as specific negotiations are concerned, Australia-Asia Airlines, which is a fully owned subsidiary of Qantas Airways Ltd, has been negotiating with Taiwan interests with a view to reaching agreement on commercial arrangements. In the absence of an official air services agreement, such arrangements could permit the introduction of non-scheduled services between Australia and Taiwan. Those commercial negotiations are continuing and are fully supported by the Australian Government. I understand that the principal obstacle to the commencement of flights is the insistence by Taiwan on reciprocity for China Airlines, the Taiwan flag carrier-a flag carrier of a very overt kind-and refusal to contemplate, so far anyway, the attractive package proposed by Australia-Asia Airlines.</PARA>
<PARA> The analogies that are constantly drawn between the airlines of other countries flying directly into the Republic of China are, in the briefing that I have seen, all misconceived to the extent that for one reason or another, with the exception of the Dutch airline, those arrangements pre-date the recognition arrangements which are currently in force. So there is no doubt but that an enormous significance would be attached to any fundamental change of position by Australia on the question of reciprocity or any of the other matters presently in issue. All I can say about this is what I have said in Estimates committees and on other public occasions, and that is that we are very conscious of the need to take advantage of the economic environment which undoubtedly is continuing to boom along in Taiwan. We are by no means oblivious or indifferent to that. We are doing the best we possibly can in a difficult and sensitive environment to move the issue forward.</PARA>

It is also true that the Prime Minister, in his environment statement in July of this year, announced an allocation of $23.4m for 1989-90-a 140 per cent increase.

Of that amount, $1.8m has been allocated to community land care groups-66 in total nationally, including five dune care groups in New South Wales. I interpolate here to say that the direction of this funding is aimed at supporting land care groups. We are looking-this is the major theme of the national soil conservation project-to start to change the attitudes of land holders to the management of the land that they have in their care and to develop local and/or regional catchment plans through land care groups in order to improve the sustainability of the land within that region.

There has been an allocation of over $300,000 under the public awareness education and training subprogram of the national soil conservation program. In total, 568 projects were applied for and funding totalling $24.2m sought. That indicates a massive upsurge in public interest. I believe that there is a very heartening trend towards the formation of land care groups. There is a recognition in rural and metropolitan Australia that this is indeed Australia's No. 1 environmental problem and that there is a need for ordinary Australians to work together to resolve it.</PARA>

What has been the nature of such mail-outs? Is it not true that the machine is not just a folder but a folder, inserter and sealer? I am glad that members of the Press Gallery, who are laughing, find this hilarious because it just further demonstrates that they are not prepared to look at how the Government is giving itself an advantage. Is it not true that the machine will fold, insert and seal approximately 1,000 to 2,000 letters per hour and not 1,000 per day? How much did the Government pay for such a machine? Which other Ministers have similar folding machines installed in their ministerial or electorate offices?</PARA></TALK.START>

This is the mob which sat there for 31 years and did nothing for any back bench parliamentarian. They gave them no staff. The first staff member was appointed under the Chifley Government; the second one under the Whitlam Government; and the third one under the Hawke Government. They would not give them photocopiers. They would give people on the back bench absolutely nothing. They would not even look after their own members. So they should not come into this chamber and put their hands out for privileges which their back bench, in opposition, never had the guts to demand. This all relates to the sycophant method of picking a Ministry whereby, when the conservatives are in government, backbenchers grovel and crawl to the leader and will not stand up for their own rights.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Attorney-General.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a question without notice from Senator Crowley on a matter which is of great concern to the Australian community and, of course, to senators. There is no doubt that it makes better sense to provide funds for education in relation to the bond of marriage and to try to prepare those Australians looking to that as their mode of relationship rather than to try to counsel them when the bond proves to be somewhat less than firm and strong as the marriage is subjected to those strains, storms and tempests which inevitably assault it. Therefore, for Senator Crowley to raise the question of marriage education is very apt. It is in the interests of all Australians that the bonds and the households which revolve around that relationship are sustained and maintained not only to serve the interests of the couple concerned in their own human development but also, if they are blessed with children, to enable those children to be raised in a household which experiences the strength, warmth and nurturing that can occur within the bounds of that very special human relationship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All societies regard this relationship as extremely important. Whether it be by common law or by way of parliamentary intervention, our society is no exception to that general rule. In very recent times there has been some shift in portfolio funding of matters relating to marriage counselling to ensure that marriage education is given its proper due. Various organisations have been set up throughout Australia, sometimes under secular auspices and sometimes under the auspices of various religious organisations, to try to ensure that young Australians in particular are well prepared for entering into this relationship, sanctioned as it is by society, with all the responsibilities that accompany it. In relation to that, my area of responsibility includes responsibility for civil marriage celebrants. They have been concerned for some time that when Australians approach them about the arrangement of a ceremony they have not had the opportunity to give the couples material which would help them to prepare not only for the occasion but for the assumption of the status of a married couple in our society. I have been concerned to provide to marriage celebrants some material which they can then place in the hands of those couples who approach them.</PARA>
<PARA> Over the last several months the Attorney-General's Department has been working very hard to ensure that such a brochure is available to indicate to couples the sorts of education sessions which may be available in their community in order to help them prepare for this particular bond, which is so important. It is a fact that marriage within our society is under unusual strains and therefore we need to take every step to ensure that those bonds are maintained with a strength which will enable couples resiliently to face the various stages which occur during that marriage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On a number of occasions during this session the Opposition has debated the accord and its failures and the Opposition's alternative approach. On most occasions we have had the same sort of response, usually from Senator Button but sometimes from some of Senator Button's acolytes. The response has been dismissive. The concerns which I think are felt in the community have evidently not been shared by Senator Button or by his colleagues. Many ex-Labor voters who listened to Senator Button during Question Time today-if any bothered to listen-would have heard him quibbling over which productivity measurement is relevant to the reality that he did not quibble about. He did not quibble about the fact that real wages in Australia have gone down under Labor and under the accord. He again took refuge in the defence: `It does not really matter that wages have declined because a lot more people have jobs and household disposable incomes have gone up'. There are a lot of Australians who feel very dissatisfied with the situation that household incomes have had to be maintained, that the continuance of the purchase of a house has to be saved by somebody entering the work force who may not want to enter the work force. There are a great variety of approaches in the Australian community. Some families want to be two-income families; some families would prefer to be one-income families. But under the Labor Party, there is no doubt that single-income families have been under enormous pressure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That pressure has come about because of the decline in the value of average earnings in this country-not the average weekly earnings that the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) tried to palm us off with, the only relevant figure being for the sole breadwinner or male earner; that is not the situation at all. If one looks at the average earnings around Australia, excluding only the farm sector as the accounts do, one finds a process of decline during the period of this Government and the accord. That process of income decline is accompanied by additional burdens, whether they are burdens of taxation or high interest rates, which have put a great number of people under enormous pressure. Whatever the attitude of Senator Button might be, there is a lot of interest in the Australian community in seeing something done about this. People want to see a situation where they can look forward to increased real earnings rather than the reverse. </PARA>
<PARA> I dismiss the quibble of the Leader of the Government about precisely which measure of productivity the Senate should be debating. He took refuge in his question and referred me to the preference of the Business Council of Australia for total factor productivity. I pointed out in a subsequent question that total factor productivity is shown by the figures which are, no doubt, supplied by his Government to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to be in a continuing process of decline over the period 1987 through to the present time. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not everywhere. That is not true, and I am happy to incorporate the table from which I am quoting, from the Economic Outlook of December 1988, which shows that it is not true that there is a decline everywhere. The figures for 1987-1990 show that the only other countries with declining total factor productivity are Denmark and Canada. Finland, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and all of the other countries listed, show an increase. Therefore, the Minister's interjection is incorrect. I do not think the Minister, in his response, has denied the fact that the average earnings of Australians have declined. Let me again quote the figures from the Treasury Economic Round-up of October 1989 which show that in 1983-84 there was a decline of minus 2.5 per cent. There was a slight increase of 0.8 per cent the following year; a decline of 1.9 per cent the following year; a decline of 1.4 per cent in 1986-87. In 1987-88, there was another decline, and a 0.1 per cent increase in 1988-89. I make the point again that on the Budget figures it would appear very likely that there will be a further decline in the average weekly earnings of Australians during the current financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The truth is that that is inevitable unless the businesses, the factories and the enterprises of Australia produce more per person employed. I refer to the economic commentary by David Potts in the Australian today:</PARA>
<PARA>But the most depressing thing of all is that, despite all the ballyhoo about the greatness of the Government's accord with the unions, productivity is falling. In the year to the September quarter, GDP per hours worked fell 0.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on a little later to say:</PARA>
<PARA> It's all very well to say that the difference between the coming recession and previous ones is that there hasn't been a wages explosion-and even then you have to differentiate between the Australian norm and the standards of industrialised countries-but falling productivity is just as serious. </PARA>
<PARA> At this rate Australia will come out of the recession even less competitive than when it entered. </PARA>
<PARA>In the face of this continual criticism from the Opposition about the weakness of the economic fundamentals in this country and the devastating impact that is having in the cities, suburbs and towns of Australia, we get a dismissive approach from the Government, and an attitude that the criticism is partial, that it is solely political, and that the Opposition is not putting forward realistic alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in that context that the Opposition is delighted to have access to the report which officers of the New South Wales Labor Council wrote for the purposes of internal discussion within that Council-comments which have been dismissed today by Senator Button, who is at the table, as not being the views of the Labor Council. However, they represent the views of loyal servants of the Labor movement, prepared for the operations and consideration of that council. They are significant because they demonstrate the difference between the public lies which are told in this matter and the private truth which is admitted whenever one sits down and talks to these people sensibly. </PARA>
<PARA> Between now and the Federal election all people in the Labor movement-whether it is Senator Button, with his passing reputation for honesty, or his rougher colleagues, or the leaders of the trade union movement-will claim that the Opposition is confrontationist, that it is promoting a free-for-all in industrial relations, and that things are proceeding satisfactorily. Mr Kelty said the other day that Australia is a country which is on track when in fact the people of Australia and those making the claims know that that is not true. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the alleged confrontationist stance of the Opposition on industrial relations, I remind the Senate that when we issued our policy just a year ago-a rewrite of the policy that we had issued in 1986-a notable trade unionist, who no longer has a vested interest in trying to preach a public lie in the interests of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Charles Fitzgibbon, wrote as an independent columnist in the Australian Financial Review. Giving his judgment of the Opposition's approach to industrial relations, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is now generally accepted that productivity, especially in the manufacturing sector, is the key to balancing our society between its rural commodity, mining commodity and manufacturing roles, in making that sector internationally competitive; and that the best way of doing that is by forgetting the `them and us' concept and instead forging an overall unity at an enterprise level. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Whether everyone in the community likes it or not, we are moving towards a more market-oriented system of wage determination. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Fitzgibbon went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> So, many of the matters covered in the policy document-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Liberal-National Party policy document-</PARA>
<PARA>are already under development-thus it will certainly be possible for the authors to refer to events and say, `There you are . . . we were right'. </PARA>
<PARA>In the document which appeared on the scene last Thursday night there was an analysis, which of itself is probably not perfect-it cannot be put forward as some sort of infallible guide to industrial relations-but it represents the labours of a number of employees of the Labor movement; a number of employees of the New South Wales Labor Council. It is interesting to see what their private assessment is because at the same time as the private assessment is being produced the New South Wales Labor Council is advertising in New South Wales in the confrontationist terms which are being promoted by Mr Kelty and parliamentary Labor Party spokesmen. Referring to the post-1987 election period, this is what the New South Wales Labor Council stated, through its officials, in the document:</PARA>
<PARA> Now, nearly three years later, the `bacon' has clearly not been brought home, interest rates are sitting at 17 per cent and there is little likelihood of an imminent fall, real incomes have fallen further, the foreign debt and trade deficit have worsened with no signs of an early recovery, unemployment is set to rise on the back of the growth recession we are now moving into, our international credit rating has been further cut, the government is clearly looking strained and tired . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Council went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . most importantly, the Federal Opposition has finally got its act together . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Council went on to point out that the Opposition is extremely serious about industrial relations. Indeed, it went on to say that there are so many people in the wings waiting to take my job that it is unlikely that I will hold it. My response to that part of the report is that one of the best things Australia has going for it at the moment is the total determination of the people on the opposition benches, and the people who will be occupying the government benches after the next election, to see reform of Australia's industrial relations system. The people mentioned in the report-whether it is Senator Stone, Dr Hewson or Mr Howard, or people coming into Parliament; I refer to Peter Costello and Ian McLachlan-will simply add to the determination which already exists in the parliamentary Opposition parties to see basic reform of industrial relations in this country. I for one welcome the absolute determination on the part of the Opposition to make this a central focus of its policy and a central focus for change in the way Australia is run. As the people of Australia know, it is in changing the way that we work and ensuring that we work together productively that we will solve our problems of declining living standards and increasing public debt. There is one thing in the report which I quibble with. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> As Chaney sees it, under the conservatives the aim will be for much lower wage outcomes than in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA>Our policy is for at last getting real wage increases in the economy based on increased productivity. What the accord has produced-I have already given the specific figures; not from the Liberal and National parties but from the national accounts-is declining real incomes for the Australian work force. The only way to reverse that is to have a productivity break-out. Our policy is about achieving that. The report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> The trade union movement-must seriously and urgently reassess its strategy to face a new and potentially devastating environment. </PARA>
<PARA>It states that the whole approach has to be reconsidered. It talks about the dissatisfaction of workers with their unions because of declining living standards. The report states that workers are voting for change irrespective of the politics of the leadership team because they are concerned at the failures of the trade union movement. The report states, and this is relevant to the point that the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, keeps making in response to my pleas about lower wages being imposed on the Australian work force:</PARA>
<PARA> Many workers no doubt resent the fact that they or their spouses have to take second or part-time (often low paid) jobs to keep up with inflation and ballooning interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>All honourable senators would know that there is resentment in significant sectors of the community because a significant number of women who have young children have been forced back into the work force for no other reason than the need to maintain a roof over the family's heads. That is not seen as a great triumph of the accord in the way that it seems to be seen as a triumph by Senator Button. I point out the passage in the report which completely reflects what the Opposition has been saying over and over again:</PARA>
<PARA> Productivity increases have not been forthcoming under the Accord and therefore real wage growth is impossible under the current system. </PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely the point that we have made over and over again. That is precisely why we need to focus industrial relations much more tightly on the enterprise so that productivity can be lifted. It is no good the Minister at the table continually quoting the isolated examples where there has been productivity improvement-for example, in the steel industry. The number of people employed in the steel industry has been halved. Of course there has been a lift in productivity. It was essential if the Australian steel industry was to survive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. I accept Senator Baume's interjection. The whole point is that that high profile improvement, that episodic example which can be given and repeated, sits very oddly against the overall statistics of declining productivity and real wages. What the officers had to say about it is instructive. They said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The decline in real unit labour costs is regarded by many as a positive outcome of the Accord. In the short term, to the extent that it encourages new investment this is correct. However, the decline in real units labour costs has negative aspects . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The document talks about the reduction of pressure on employers to replace labour with capital. I say this to the Leader of the Government, the Senate and the business community: whilst we can point to a recovery of the profit share under the accord-and that is a positive thing-who believes that we will maintain an improved profit share on the basis of continuous declines in the wages of workers? Mr Acting Deputy President, you will take part in this debate later. I would be interested to hear whether you believe that an enhanced profit share, which is a proper objective of the Government and something to be welcomed, can be achieved permanently on the basis of permanent reductions in real wages. I think I know what your answer would be, Mr Acting Deputy President. Certainly I know what it would be in private. I am less sure what your answer would be in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole point about the report from the New South Wales Labour Council is that it analyses in great detail the basic failures of the accord; the basic failure of the trade union movement, and the Government itself, to come to grips with the fact that the trade union structure is inappropriate to Australia's needs; and the need to reverse some of the major elements of policy which have been pursued by both the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Government. In terms of trade union structure, this is stark. As is said on page 12 of this report:</PARA>
<PARA> The key point is that for the approach to be effective it requires smaller units, not larger ones. </PARA>
<PARA>This is following a discussion about the fact that Mr Kelty, supported by this Government, has advocated a series of very large unions. Yet those very large unions will not produce the workplace focus which is required if we are to get higher productivity in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> What is it in practical terms that the Opposition is saying? What we are saying is that, in an honest debate, the common ground which has developed about the need for a greater enterprise focus would lead the Government to embrace many of the propositions which are being put forward by the Opposition. We in no way wish to step in the way of, or to impede, changes such as the second tier wage negotiations or award restructuring, which may lead to a more flexible, centralised wage fixing system. But we do say that there are opportunities to accelerate the pace of change and to provide the genuine freedom which will enable employers and employees to achieve decent results. We say, for example, that as well as having a more flexible award system and a system of registered agreements, both of which the Government would agree with, the position should be made even more flexible by also opening up the possibility of having agreements which are outside the system entirely. </PARA>
<PARA> We say that that would prevent the sort of sabotage of positive measures which we have seen in cases like the Castle Bacon case and the Sanctuary Cove case, where attempts by employers and employees to work together within the system have been held up for years by the use of the centralised system to try to prevent agreements being put into effect. We believe that the availability of voluntary agreements, giving employers and employees an additional element of choice, will provide a greater flexibility and a greater capacity to lift Australian productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to trade union structure, we say that it is clearly proven that the approach that has been adopted by Mr Kelty is simply inadequate. It has been demonstrated that the sorts of amalgamations that he has been promoting will not lead to to a reduction in the multiplicity of unions within workplaces, which is one of the major causes of inefficiency and one of the major impediments to a greater enterprise focus. All that we are saying is that it is possible to speed up a process-which otherwise could be adopted by pursuing some sort of industry or enterprise award; things which can be done under the present system-if we provide employees with a capacity to choose their representation in a way which is relevant to achieving a single enterprise bargaining unit. </PARA>
<PARA> In a recent speech by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) we heard him embracing the idea of having single enterprise bargaining units. What we say is that the practical amendments being proposed by the Opposition, which would give employees choice in this matter, would facilitate a process of change which the Government acknowledges is required and which I think the trade union movement is coming to acknowledge is required. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an area of Australian life, of the Australian economy, which we know will be highly politicised over the coming months. That is a tragedy for Australia because there is a growing understanding of what is required on all sides of politics. It is a pity that the Government is going to engage in what I would call ratbag politics to prevent sensible proposals for reform from being properly considered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is easy to try to box in a government by accusing it of ratbag politics before one has even started. Anybody who disagrees with Senator Chaney immediately falls into the ratbag category. There are some things I do not disagree with him about. I do not disagree with him about people being offered additional choice. I do not disagree with him about the necessity of lifting productivity. I do not disagree with him that it would be desirable to have industry or enterprise based unions in some circumstances, rather than a mixed conglomerate of craft unions. I say to him, as he said to me in his speech, that it is no good trotting out these three cases-the Dollar Sweets case, the Castle Bacon case and so on-every time he makes his speech and saying that I cannot trot out three cases on the other side where there have been enormous improvements in productivity. He trots out the same three cases every time; I am entitled to the same four. One cannot really start a debate by trying to exclude some of the grounds of the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think I ought to make a point right at the beginning. In terms of this issue of productivity and so on in the workplace, it should be remembered that the trade union movement currently represents about 33 per cent of employees in the private sector in Australia. We always talk about this in terms of productivity and the gains which can be made in the productive sector of the economy and we tend to ignore the fact that trade unions are much more heavily involved in the government sector, both State and Federal, where productivity does not seem to be an issue which grips the popular imagination, or certainly that of the work force, quite as much as it does in the private sector. I think it is right that that should be so, but I think we should be absolutely sure about the facts in relation to the trade union movement's involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said numerous times in this place that the accord has to be a flexible instrument, an instrument which expands from the edges, as it were. We have talked about the importance of certified agreements, and Senator Chaney talks about agreements outside the system. An agreement outside the system at Dollar Sweets is all right from my perspective, but I am not sure what an agreement outside the system would mean at the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd or in the car plants of this country. If the test is to be productivity of an agreement outside the system, as I said earlier, the wage increase at BHP should be 35 per cent. </PARA>

I said that, if the test is to be productivity outside the system, one would expect a wage increase at BHP of some 35 per cent. That would not be a good thing for BHP, I would expect. So if things happen outside the system we come back to the argument, which we have had again and again and which I do not think one can really resolve by our debating it here, that governments have to be concerned about aggregate wage outcomes. Wages policy is a very important instrument for governments in the current economy. I do not disagree with Senator Chaney about all the sorts of desirable goals he sees. The question is: How are they to be attained? What Senator Chaney is saying today is that we ought to go a bit faster. `Can we walk a little faster?', said the tortoise to the snail. `There is something close behind me and it is treading on my tail'. I suppose that is Senator Chaney's role in a debate such as this. But that is a matter of judgment in terms of the importance one attaches to aggregate wage outcomes and the role which the centralised wage fixation system plays in all that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Liberals tend to have it a bit both ways. I do not wish to quote Mr Peacock every day, but when he was asked the other day whether there would be a centralised wage fixation system or direct enterprise negotiations if a Liberal government were elected-which would take predominance-he said, `Who is to know?'. In that, he reiterates Senator Chaney's view expressed last week-in a more sophisticated form, if I might say so. </PARA>
<PARA> The cause of this matter of public importance today is this document by two officers of the New South Wales Labor Council, which I understand to be a document designed to provoke thought in a discussion-`What do you do about this?', `What do you do about that?', `Yes, that is a fair enough document'. It certainly did provoke some thought, having been leaked. But if, every time we get a little support for Senator Chaney's industrial relations policy by junior clerks of the Labor Council or from somewhere else, we have a matter of public importance on the basis of that, we will be here until long after Christmas. There is support for Senator Chaney's view from about 20 per cent of the population and about 20 per cent of the business community. There will always be little documents coming out supporting that view. Senator Chaney's matter of public importance today reminds me of these people who write to luminaries around the world and say, `I have a very good idea, Professor Einstein', or `I have a very good idea, President Bush; what do you think of my idea?'. The people being nice people, write back, and say, `Thank you for your letter, Mr Smith; I think it is a very good idea'. Of course they write back and say that. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney is using this Mickey Mouse endorsement for his policies from the Labor Council of New South Wales as a means for burdening honourable senators with the same matter of public importance yet again. He then goes for the, I think, very good rhetorical point of psyching up his own side. He says, `We are absolutely determined. All of these people on the opposition benches are determined, and, just in case we are not, we will have Peter Costello and all of these people in here after the next election and that will make sure we are absolutely determined. That will give us the part of our anatomy which we have generally lacked for the last seven or eight years. That will help us with that part of our anatomy which we have not had for the past seven or eight years'. </PARA>
<PARA> So Peter Costello and all of those people are coming in here to give the coalition a bit more spine. Yet the one person whom Senator Chaney does not mention, for the purpose of his argument, who is coming in here to help him with all of that is of course Ian McLachlan from the National Farmers Federation. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think the honourable senator did, but maybe he did. Mr McLachlan has been quoted over the weekend as saying, `Well, if a conservative government were elected in this country it might have to implement a wages freeze'. He spends all his time talking about the importance of enterprise bargaining. How on earth could a wage freeze be implemented if there were enterprise bargaining throughout the country? What would be the mechanism for having a wages freeze in the country? The coalition would have to tell all of those weak employers around the place whose work force would be clamouring for more wages, `Fellows, you have to resist them. We are having a wages freeze under this new, you-beaut government that we have in Australia now'. How on earth would the coalition implement a wages freeze? That is how much Mr McLachlan understands about the relationship between a centralised wage fixation system and enterprise bargaining.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This issue is said to be the key piece, the linchpin, of the Liberal-National party economic strategy which was handed down-I do not know how long ago, it seems a long time, but it is probably a month or two ago. It is a bit messy, even when explained by its most articulate exponent, because it relies on comfortable cliches such as `We all need more productivity; we are in favour of people working harder; these are the things that will make Australia great; Australians know that they are not earning their keep in the big wide world'. That is the sort of philosophical base for this strategy. These are the sorts of comfortable cliches that the coalition is using. It then launches into a discussion about how to fix the economy up and it is not quite sure about that. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney has been citing a lot of figures today. If one looks at productivity growth in Australia compared with other countries from 1960 to 1973-these figures are taken from a paper, `Interim national comparisons of productivity growth', published in May 1988-one can see that in the 1960s Australia's total factor productivity was 2.1 per cent. In the years 1960 to 1973 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average was 2.8 per cent. In 1973 to 1979 the total factor productivity in Australia was 0.6 per cent; the OECD average was 0.7 per cent. In 1979 to 1986 total factor productivity in Australia was 0.5 per cent; the OECD average was 0.6 per cent. From that one can see that right throughout that period of history we have always been hanging in there at just a point below the OECD average. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney refers to forecasts for 1987 to 1990. I say to Senator Chaney that when one looks at the figures at the end of this period one will see that they will reflect exactly the same sort of pattern, in my view, as they have since 1960. That is to say, when award restructuring and the surge in capital investments which are now happening are taken into account, when one looks at these figures in another two or three years time, one will get exactly the same pattern as there has always been. The adverse characteristic of productivity growth in Australia in the last few years has been that it cannot really be measured in the service sector. There has been enormous growth in the work force in Australia over that period and that makes it very difficult to measure productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings us back to the debate about whether a proper measure of standard of living is real wages or whether it is household disposable income. We have a disagreement about that. All I can say is that in terms of real wages, as long as I have been a Minister, the Liberal Party has said that every wage case increase should not have been allowed and that it would have opposed it. </PARA>

I do not know whether or not that is true. I cannot say. I am sure that some of the men of steel who are coming in here, as Senator Chaney has mentioned, would tend to be confrontationist. They have a pretty good record in respect of that. But one only needs to look at the way in which Senator Stone has mellowed since he came into this chamber.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He said that about the Liberal alternative if that Party ever gets into power in Australia. I am not saying that necessarily. I am saying that other people say that. Other people are very concerned about the way the coalition's proposed wage fixing system would operate, and what it would do to the Australian economy, to the good work which has been done under this Government in building consultation and trust in the work force and to all of the good work which goes to make up what one can call, for the purpose of this debate, factor productivity. The important things which all go to making very big changes to productivity are things like changes in concerns about quality, production techniques, work force attitudes, industrial disputation and skills of the work force. I regard those things as important and believe they can be enhanced under the environment encouraged by the Government. I do not in any sense say that there is not room for improvement in increasing the capacity of people to enter into certified agreements and things of that kind; there is room for improvement in work practices in some areas and in making more efficient use of infrastructure and so on. All these things go to improving the productivity of Australian firms and industries as a whole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cannot avoid referring to some very good examples of management initiatives. They must take account of all the issues of skill training and reduction in industrial disputation, using infrastructure better, and using the work force better. Through management initiatives companies like BHP Steel, Tubemakers of Australia Ltd, BTR Nylex Ltd, and Southern Aluminium are making the way in terms of improved productivity in Australia, improving the outlook for all Australians. I do not resist the proposition that in the longer term the success of this country, the well-being of all its inhabitants, its businesses, its work force and so on will depend to a very large extent on improving the productive capacity of the country. There is no doubt about that. That is where we have lagged for the last 15 years.

The examples I gave of BTR Nylex, Tubemakers and the other firms I mentioned are very important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Chaney also referred, both at Question Time and thereafter, to the measure of productivity. I repeat the view that gross domestic product (GDP) per hour worked is not a reliable measure of productivity and it certainly does not lead to any implications for the likely movement in real wages. A number of authorities take that view. The Australian Bureau of Statistics, the ABS, stated in its bulletin on productivity measures that the measure it uses, GDP per hour worked, in the table that Senator Chaney referred me to does not make any adjustment for the quality of labour used, skills and things of that kind. The Government's wages policy does that, which is one of the reasons we will get a better productivity performance in the next few years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating as a matter of public importance the proposition proposed by Senator Chaney, which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Accord, as recognised by the leaked New South Wales Labour Council paper, and the urgent need need for the adoption of the Liberal and National Parties' Industrial Relations Policy to boost productivity as the only basis for higher real wages and a reduction in Australia's massive foreign debt burden. </PARA>
<PARA>The subject of this matter of public importance cannot help but produce a feeling of deja vu. As Senator Button has said, this must be the third or fourth time that the Opposition has raised virtually the same subject and there is very little left to say that has not already been said. Senator Stone has indicated that we will debate it yet again; so be it. </PARA>
<PARA> The so-called leaked paper, which originated in the New South Wales Labor Council and about which the Opposition is now making such a fuss, appears to all intents and purposes to be a sign of dissatisfaction from a couple of employees at the Labor Council, which was leaked to the press in a fit of destructiveness. It is another example, perhaps, of the way in which the Australian Labor Party (ALP) has internecine warfare down to a fine art. However, it has been able to pull its act together in recent times. Hopefully this will not be typical of what will be forthcoming in the next few months. Despite this, the paper has the ring of truth about several of its assertions. Both wages and living standards are dropping under the accord and foreign debt is still rising at an alarming rate. Until a government of any persuasion, Labor or coalition, is willing to infuriate its rich friends by changing the tax laws, that will continue to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's industrial relations policy, which is intimately linked to its wages policy, has come under the spotlight in recent times-times which have seen the likes of Mr Ian McLachlan and even Mr Peacock unsure of the likely direction of the economy under the control of the coalition. There is certainly a degree of uncertainty about what the impact and economic outcomes of the revised industrial relations policy and the wages policy would be. The coalition's unconstrained industrial relations policy would see Australia adopting the Sir Roderick Carnegie solution to our economic problems. In the opinion of the Australian Democrats, it would see unemployment in the blue-collar sector explode while allowing those in high technology communications-based sectors such as banking, broadcasting and computer development to receive unacceptably high pay increases. This would result in a huge gap emerging between major sectors of the Australian community, with those in highly paid and challenging employment being, as the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) calls them, the information rich, and the rest of the community employed in deskilled, poorly paid employment at best, or at worst depending completely upon the state for their well-being. </PARA>
<PARA> The less well off in our society also need an industrial relations system which will ensure them an adequate level of financial reward and satisfaction from their employment. There is no doubt in the minds of the Australian Democrats that the alternative model, the Opposition's industrial relations policy, would be one with a bias towards those who are well placed to exploit enterprise bargaining. Conversely, it is in the interests of the general community that we have an industrial relations system that ensures that those industries experiencing a shortage of skilled labour do not bid themselves out of their potential international competitiveness, since this is clearly linked to the element in the economy which is cited in the matter of public importance, namely, our exploding international debt. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Ian McLachlan, the guru of the Liberal Party's Drizabone policies, states that `the enterprise bargaining section would become self-regulatory'. This statement makes a mockery of the coalition's claim that enterprise-based contracts would not have significant flow-on effects. The reality is that, in a system that lacks any policy of containment, spillage is absolutely inevitable. Unfortunately, it is spillage that would enable the yuppies to continue spending extravagantly on overseas luxury goods and service high interest rates, while the general community would continue to suffer through the extraordinarily high interest rates which are not likely to come down within the foreseeable future, as has been admitted by even Senator Stone, although we are being tantalised--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stone can correct me later in his speech, by all means. Australian Labor Party and Liberal-National party policies on high interest rates are virtually the same. The substance of this matter of public importance is that a Liberal-National party industrial relations system would produce higher wages, higher living standards, and a significant reduction in our foreign debt; that is the proposition that has been advanced to us here today by Senator Chaney. The Opposition is saying that Australian workers and trade unions are entitled to have high expectations when dealing with a coalition government in an enterprise-based industrial relations system. It is this element of high expectations that we need to be alerted to. These expectations cannot possibly be fulfilled without many other changes in taxation, tariffs and economic policy generally. We do not believe that the coalition would be willing to make these changes-the ALP Government has certainly been unwilling to make them during its term of government. The level of expectation is a potentially dangerous element of the alternative model of industrial relations proposed by the coalition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The unease and confusion that have been expressed by some members of the New South Wales Labor Council towards the apparent lack of ALP guidance in industrial relations is understandable. The labour movement has been forsaken by the ALP, which has failed to deal effectively with the issues of labour market reform. It is on record that since 1981 the Australian Democrats have pursued an industrial relations policy of employee participation and direct negotiation-a policy which would allow for the development of enterprise-based bargaining to occur within the control of an industry-based award overseen by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Unfortunately, it has taken the ALP until 1989 to start to adopt the industrial relations system for which we have been calling for almost a decade. We are pleased to see that it is finally happening. </PARA>
<PARA> In another recent debate on industrial relations, I mentioned an article by Paul Kelly in the Australian newspaper. That article contained what Paul Kelly called the `shocking news' that enterprise wage deals were inevitable. In his article, Paul Kelly observed:</PARA>
<PARA> The irony this week-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, about two weeks ago now-</PARA>
<PARA>is that while Mr Hawke was slamming the coalition for its obsession with labour market deregulation, Mr Keating was actually promising to pinch this Liberal policy. </PARA>
<PARA>And to whom was the Treasurer (Mr Keating) making the promise? To the Japanese investors who have kindly lent us 18.9 per cent of our gross debt. Japan is our biggest single creditor country. If the Japanese decide not to roll-over-that is to re-lend our debt when it falls due-Australia will immediately become a banana republic. Our foreign debt will not be reduced drastically by any actions within the industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA> Outside forces exert a massive influence on the size and manageability of our foreign debt. It is very important that the Japanese financial institutions which have lent money to Australia should be willing to re-lend because 85 per cent of our $137 billion foreign debt needs to be repaid or refinanced within three months. If the Japanese are edgy about lending to Australia following the collapse of Qintex, and maybe some other companies, the Australia of the last 50 years will disappear overnight, to be replaced by an Argentine-type economy. These are the realities of the foreign debt fiasco which we have on our hands. </PARA>
<PARA> So here we have the three political parties-Liberal, Labor and National-which have happily handed over our economic sovereignty to the international marketplace through deregulation, bickering about which one of them would be the most efficient deregulator of our labour market. The Hawke Government and the Peacock conservatives have created a situation where we have to do everything demanded by our foreign creditors. The foreign creditors demand labour market deregulation and the Liberal-Labor-National grand coalition tells Australians that we must deregulate the labour market. They neglect to tell us that it is necessary only because they got us into this mess in the first place and they do not have the courage to get us out of it. They want us to believe that we must go on borrowing and living beyond our means and that our foreign creditors will never pull the plug on Australia because we are their friends and allies. We recently witnessed Mr Keating running off to Tokyo to tell the Japanese that they can have whatever they want provided they keep lending to us. This should make all Australians stop and think, especially Australian unionists. The odds are that the Hawke-Keating Labor Government will steal more Liberal-National Party policies, that our foreign debt will continue to mount and that our living standards will continue to drop. They will drop just as quickly under a Liberal-National Party government. </PARA>
<PARA> We have all heard that the conservatives intend to take people off the unemployment benefit after nine months. The Australian Democrats believe that the Labor Government, if returned after the next election, will do the same thing. Perhaps it will be more generous and choose 12 months before it removes the unemployment benefit. It could then say to its supporters, who are concerned about equity and income distribution, that it is more caring than the conservatives. On the other hand, perhaps the Treasurer feels the need to demonstrate a really macho attitude to placate the Japanese and will insist upon the unemployment benefit being cut after six months. Whichever of the two conservative alternatives is elected to government, the result will be a deregulated labour market with little, if any, minimum wage restrictions. </PARA>
<PARA> This could, at worst, produce a real banana republic-a country where 30 per cent of the population would become servants to the 20 or 30 per cent lucky enough to have a job and a decent wage. These people would be forced to work for whatever pay is available with no social security safety net and nowhere to live. This could create a class of cheap servants willing to work ridiculous hours for little more than food and shelter. Like any other banana republic worth its name, Australia would be a society where some of its citizens would be forced to live on the streets and starve or work as servants for the lucky. </PARA>
<PARA> Even the right to strike is no longer guaranteed to Australian workers, and neither the Opposition nor the so-called Labor Party wants to have anything to do with guaranteeing Australian workers that right. The Democrats will be very interested in the response of both the Government and the Opposition to my private member's Bill on the right to strike, which will be brought before the chamber in the very near future. </PARA>
<PARA> Ordinary Australian wage earners, pensioners, home buyers, rural producers and small businessmen have already experienced a decline in living standards through the expenditure cutting and high interest rate policies of this Government. We are told that Australians must suffer to reduce our foreign debt. But whose foreign debt is it? Private sector debt accounts for well over half our level of foreign indebtedness. The Bonds, Elliotts and Murdochs of our society borrow overseas and ordinary Australians are forced to tighten their belts because `we' are borrowing too much. We are not borrowing too much; they are borrowing too much. Those who borrow overseas should be asked to pay for it-not pensioners and home buyers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats acknowledge that the continued development of an effective and flexible labour market remains vital to the economic future of Australia. This development must, however, occur incrementally and not be imposed upon the economy in an ad hoc, irrational way. The continued development of industry-based unionism provides the economy with the opportunity to continue to restructure while avoiding any further inequalities emerging in the economy and will ensure our international competitiveness. It is obvious that workers in high technology industries, such as computer electronics and software, will be in an elite position and, under a completely deregulated enterprise-based labour market, would be able to bid up the cost of their services if there were not a central agreement around which their awards or pay increases were dependent. The wages explosion that would result in these industries would prove to be damaging to the Australian economy and would undermine our export potential. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a real need to retain government control over wages and industrial relations through an industry-based union structure so that minimum income levels are protected, small businesses are not held to ransom in times of labour shortages and our export competitiveness is protected. Greater labour flexibility provides benefits to the worker through reskilling and greater job satisfaction and choice; it provides benefits to the employer through the potential increase in profit levels and greater control over employment agreements; and it provides benefits to the community through greater economic potential. These benefits can occur only in an environment of equity and democracy. </PARA>

<PARA>for higher real wages and a reduction in Australia's massive foreign debt burden. </PARA>
<PARA>In the course of earlier speakers' remarks one or two comments were made to which I just want to pay some passing attention. I was interested, for example, to hear Senator Button making the point, which is totally correct, that today the trade union movement is much more public service oriented than it is private sector oriented. Senator Button confessed-I think he slightly exaggerated-that only 33 per cent of the private work force is now in trade unions. We all know that about 67 per cent of the public sector work force is in trade unions. There is a very large and increasing importance of what I might call the public service mentality operating upon trade union policies. Senator Button, inadvertently I think, was giving the game away in making that remark. </PARA>
<PARA> I was disappointed in Senator Button's attitude towards this extraordinarily interesting document-I do not say that in any provocative way, but in a quite detached, objective manner-which has emanated from the New South Wales Labour Council. It was leaked to the press and published in recent days. Senator Button sought to dismiss it in a contemptuous manner by referring to it as the product of two junior clerks. No doubt we will find out in due course who the two authors of this document are, but if the New South Wales Labor Council has in its employ two junior clerks capable of putting together a document of such high quality analysis and intellectual content as this, then it is an extraordinarily fortunate body. I only wish the same could be said for the Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button, in a characteristically scathing manner, dismissed the document as a Mickey Mouse endorsement of the Opposition's industrial relations policies. At least he did not attempt to quibble that it is certainly a ringing endorsement of the Opposition's industrial relations policies. He may choose to describe it as a Mickey Mouse endorsement, but this document will be read, before we are through in the next few months, all around the land. It will not be seen as a Mickey Mouse endorsement because it rings true. It comes from the heart and, importantly, from the mind of the people who wrote it. </PARA>

Upon that will largely turn the ability of the Australian people to gain and attain a rise in their own real standards of living and also will turn and depend the ability of this country to cease getting into this foreign debt trap into which this Government has been leading us at a headlong pace ever since it came into office. Senator McLean quite properly referred-I want to take this opportunity to agree with him on this-to Mr Keating running off to Tokyo a couple of weeks ago to tell the Japanese that they can have anything they want as long as they keep lending to us. I agree with Senator McLean; he is quite right. That is the situation we have in this country today. The Treasurer of this country is so beholden to foreign lenders that he has to go to Tokyo and say to them the kind of things that Senator McLean has just referred to. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion before us refers to the failure of the accord. I do not propose to devote very much time to those words. The accord has failed and I think it is clear to every independent observer. What are the objectives in an industrial relations policy? They are to attain a rise in real wages-not a rise in money wages. Anyone can get rises in money wages and have them eaten up again the day after by equivalent rises in inflation. People in this country, and other countries, are interested in a rise in the real purchasing power of their wages and salaries. That is the individual's point of view. From a national point of view, all Australians are, and should be, interested in improving the competitiveness of this country so that we can once again begin to pay our way in the world instead of having to pay our way by borrowing the difference. </PARA>
<PARA> What have been the outcomes of almost seven years of a Hawke-Keating Government? As Senator Chaney very properly remarked, we have had a fall in the real earnings of wage and salary earners in this country for every year but one during the life of the Hawke Labor Government. Senator Button, quite innocently and inadvertently, admitted that the reason for that has to do with the system of industrial relations which this Government, with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) as its partner, has imposed on us. Senator Button said, and I wrote it down as I was so astonished by the slip, `real wages have fallen'-in every year except one under the Government-`because of the operation of a centralised wage system'. He is quite right. That is why they have fallen. He appeared to be making a boast of that and claiming credit for it. What he apparently failed to understand is that that is the greatest single indictment of the Government during its term of office, and the centralised industrial relations and wage system, which is the central feature of the so-called accord between the Australian Labor Party and the ACTU. That is the result. Real wages have fallen because of the operation of a centralised wage system. It is the centralised wage system and all that goes with it in the accord that has led to the deplorable record on productivity. Senator Button tried to weave his way around that admission by saying that household disposable income has risen in most years under the present Government. We have not got time to go into that apparent conundrum today. I suggest if one is looking for the answer to that one might ask by how much our foreign debt has expanded during the time of the present Government. I can tell you the answer to that: it is about $87 billion in net terms. That might explain why the Government has been able to see household disposable incomes rising at the same time as real wages and productivity have been falling. We have been borrowing ourselves blind. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal goes on to refer to the urgent need for the adoption of the Liberal-National Party industrial relations policy to boost productivity as the only basis for higher real wages and the reduction in Australia's massive foreign debt burden. That is un- deniable. It is the only basis. There is no way the people of this country can pay themselves, or be paid in real terms, more than they are actually producing other than by continuing to borrow from foreigners. As I have said, the facts have been stated by Senator Chaney. No matter how much Senator Button wants to quibble about the basis of the measurement of productivity, whatever basis he chooses, the result is still the same. This remarkable document from the New South Wales Labor Council proves that again and again. The central passage on the first page of this paper states:</PARA>
<PARA> Now, nearly three years later,-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, three years since the last election-</PARA>
<PARA>the `bacon' has clearly not been brought home, interest rates are sitting at 17 per cent and there is little likelihood of an imminent fall, real incomes have fallen further, the foreign debt and trade deficit have worsened with no signs of an early recovery, unemployment is set to rise on the back of the growth recession we are now moving into,-</PARA>
<PARA>a new point but one which will attain a good deal more prominence in the months ahead of us-</PARA>
<PARA>our international credit rating has been further cut, the government is clearly looking strained and tired, the ALP state branches have reduced the degrees of policy freedom in terms of fiscal policy and privatisation, the Accord has reached the limits of its capacity to assist in flexible adjustment to continuing economic change and pressure. And, perhaps most importantly, the Federal Opposition has finally got its act together . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We will leave that aside. In half a paragraph what more crushing indictment could there be of the record and performance of the present Government? Turning to the specific question of productivity, we have this from the authors on page 6 of this document:</PARA>
<PARA> Supporters of the Accord point to job growth, a decline in disputes, and a decline in real unit labour costs as indicators of the economic success of the Accord. </PARA>
<PARA> However, job growth in and of itself is meaningless as an indication of the success of the Accord. The key issue is the type of job growth. </PARA>
<PARA>The authors then say:</PARA>
<PARA> The recent report of the Australian Manufacturing Council indicates that Australia has not been able to achieve the dramatic structural adjustment required to position the Australian economy at a point where current living standards can be maintained or expanded. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Button told us again today what a great job had been done in the Australian steel industry in raising productivity, but he failed to tell us how fast productivity in steel making has been growing in the countries of our competitors. It is perfectly true that we have raised productivity in steel making in this country; it is also perfectly true that the productivity increase has been even faster in the countries of our major competitors-Korea, Japan and other such countries. At page 8, the authors of this document say:</PARA>
<PARA> Productivity increases have not been forthcoming under the Accord and therefore real wage growth is impossible under the current system. </PARA>
<PARA>They go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The outlook for wages-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, real wages, of course-</PARA>
<PARA>is one of continuing decline. This will further exacerbate disaffection with the Accord and with the Trade Union Movement. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, do not forget that the authors of this document are themselves trade union officials and are concerned about the future of the trade union movement, including their section of it-the New South Wales branch of the trade union movement. I could quote from this document all day but I have only another minute or two. The authors of the document go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> There is a real danger that the current way we are approaching award restructuring . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy President, you have heard of that; that is the buzz phrase that Mr Kelty has imposed upon the Australian public for the last year or so-`award restructuring'. The authors of this document say:</PARA>
<PARA> There is a real danger that the current way we are approaching award restructuring will further reduce the pressures on employers to invest in new technologies. </PARA>
<PARA>A fascinating part of the document refers to the whole approach to the restructuring of the trade union movement itself-the reorganisation of the trade union movement itself-in which its authors point to the obvious fact that, when people find themselves involved in larger and larger organisations, which is the end to which Mr Kelty wants to lead them, they become less and less interested and less and less bonded, so to speak, to that organisation because it becomes remote and they become disaffected with it. The solution is to have people involved in enterprise unions-the Opposition's policy-and then people can relate to something. It is like having a community party, a street party in which people who are one's friends, neighbours and the people one knows can take part. If somebody says, `Come and have a party in the centre of Sydney', we might do that once every 100 years-we did that in January last year-but that is all that we will do. </PARA>
<PARA> As my time has almost expired I say that, far from this document being a matter for ridicule, it is a matter which the Government ought to regard with the utmost seriousness because it is an example of analysis applied to a real problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No offence was meant. Senator Chaney talked about his concern for workers and the reduction in their real wages. I could almost have been convinced that Senator Chaney was not part of the Fraser Government in the years when we had an 18-month wage freeze. I cannot think of a more clear or determined effort on the part of any government to reduce living standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Chaney talked about the need to make awards more flexible and the need for bargaining at the workface or enterprise level. He said that if we had good productivity we really should have wage increases. He steered a fair bit away from the idea of profits taking the place of wages but he did not talk about the necessary move to give the community products and services at reasonable prices. In my view, that is another element of community concern that we should all consider. Senator Chaney also said that, if we had industrial unionism, it would not reduce the number of unions. That is quite wrong, as can be easily shown. I think one example of a reduction in unions and a much better industrial relations climate is the Williamstown Dockyard where there have been very few industrial disputes and-a rather strange factor for shipbuilding in this country-fairly large ships have been coming out of that Dockyard on time. </PARA>
<PARA> The people who will really suffer as a result of the Opposition's policy are non-unionists who, for many years, have contributed nothing to the trade union movement which represents their interests in the Industrial Relations Commission and other bodies in this country that regulate wages and conditions. The non-unionists have contributed nothing but they have been able to gain all the wage increases in the various awards in this country. Those people neither had the resources nor sought them to negotiate their position properly, and that was made clear in the metal industry case some years ago in relation to additional payments in the award. People sought exemption because they could not afford it and later they backed off when they had to prove that they could not afford it. </PARA>
<PARA> In Queensland we have a special situation. Before the rout of the National Party and its cohorts from the Liberal Party on Saturday, there was talk there of voluntary employment agreements. These voluntary employment agreements, which related to enterprises, could be brought into being if, in one case, 60 per cent of people in an enterprise agreed and, in another, 65 per cent agreed, depending upon the period of the legislation. I would like to quote some conditions from a particular voluntary employment agreement (VEA). It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The first three months of employment will be classed as a probationary period.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a long time in which to find out whether an employee is any good. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Employees will be required to work 12 hour shifts either:-</PARA>
<PARA> Night Shift 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. or</PARA>
<PARA> Day Shift 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA> Shifts are scheduled as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 3 days on-2 days off; 2 days on-3 days off. All employees must clock on and off every shift. </PARA>
<PARA>There is nothing wrong with that last part, but all those hours are worked at ordinary time rates. There would obviously be a great reduction in take-home pay if people were required to work additional hours or hours outside the normal hours when other people pursue leisure activities or have time with their families, instead of working and making money for an employer; although I know that that is not illegal. The voluntary employment agreement continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Wages/Salary</PARA>
<PARA> Weekly wages have been calculated to include all allowances; penalty rates, loadings etc., the only exclusion being overtime which will be paid to permanent employees at their designated hourly rate. </PARA>
<PARA>The agreement does not say anything about what employers will do for casual employees; apparently they will get nothing at all. But we should bear in mind that permanent employees have to work more than 12 hours before they get those rates. The agreement continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Wages/salaries will be paid directly into an ANZ Bank Access Account. All wages/salary packages will be reviewed annually. </PARA>
<PARA>Sick leave</PARA>
<PARA>We should bear in mind that standard sick leave is eight days per year and in some cases 10. The agreement states:</PARA>
<PARA>After completion of the qualifying period employees will be eligible for 1 day sick leave with pay every 10 weeks . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So this agreement says 10 weeks, but all other awards say six weeks. There are other provisions in this employment agreement but I will not quote from it any further. But that clearly indicates the standard of conditions and wages provided for people who undertake voluntary employment agreements who relate to the idea of bargaining at the enterprise level. </PARA>
<PARA> When the recently routed Queensland Government talked about voluntary employment agreements it did not mean an agreement freely entered into between an employer and all employees, properly represented by their union. In an address given by Roslyn Atkinson on 2 June 1989, she said:</PARA>
<PARA> The word ``voluntary'' is used rhetorically. The mere fact that for many workers in Queensland it means compulsory or involuntary shows that the language has been employed to persuade the electorate that it is a good thing rather than describe what it actually is. </PARA>
<PARA>On 12 November 1987, the Queensland Legislative Assembly passed the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act and another amendment Act which, inter alia, introduced a new part VIA on voluntary employment agreements. Roslyn Atkinson went on to say this:</PARA>
<PARA> Prior to this amendment, Part VI of the Act provided that agreements could be made and registered between an industrial union of employees and an association of employers of a specified employer. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the normal system that operates in the Federal area. She continued:</PARA>
<PARA>This part has been used to good advantage in Queensland-</PARA>
<PARA>and I might say will be again when the new Government deals with legislation that has to be passed and other legislation that has to be revoked-</PARA>
<PARA>and apparently been productive of good industrial relations, the prime example being at the Expo site. </PARA>
<PARA>Expo was run by a past leader of the Liberal Party in Queensland, Sir Llew Edwards. I have personally spoken to him, and he has said very clearly to me that he was happy with that agreement which was entered into voluntarily between him and a group of Trades and Labour Council unions. They kept their word throughout the whole period and he also did his best to do so. Although he indicated that he had some difficulty with some middle management who did not seem to realise their responsibilities; but as the leader of that team he certainly did. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as the first type of agreement was concerned, there was no procedure laid down in the Act for the establishment of the 60 per cent support. In the ballot set up by the Metway Bank Ltd, for example, to gauge whether or not it had the support of 60 per cent of its employees, all employees were required to put their name on the face of the ballot paper. We talk about privacy legislation and the Liberal and National parties' attitude to the rights of workers, but this was a ballot where one put one's name on the ballot paper. Hence, one is cynical about the use of the world `voluntary'. Once that voluntary employment agreement was made, it was lodged with the Industrial Registrar, who was then required to refer each VEA to the Commission. Section 94d (3) provided that the Commission might of its own motion and without a hearing provide a voluntary employment agreement or after conferring with the parties might approve or refuse to approve the agreement. The only grounds on which the Commission was entitled to refuse to approve a VEA were if it was satisfied that the agreement either contravened the provisions of part VIA or was not in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> In her address, Roslyn Atkinson went on to talk about the way in which the Metway Bank argued before the Federal Court for natural justice but then sought to argue against its being provided in the State Commission. In her address, Roslyn Atkinson finally said this:</PARA>
<PARA> By setting a completely new framework of registering organisations, the new Part VIA of the Act contradicts the purposes of the rest of the Act and of the Hanger Commission of Inquiry. It feeds non-unionism at the expense of unionism and it takes away the traditional power to combine across different work places which has been a great source of strength to employees in Australia in the 20th century and has been the basis of the system of conciliation and arbitration in both the state and federally for the last eighty years. </PARA>
<PARA>So much for the benefit of voluntary employment agreements or enterprise bargaining. As I have said-and I make this very clear-I have never been opposed to enterprise bargaining. In fact, I have been involved personally in enterprise bargaining. I do not know how many senators on the other side of the chamber have. I invite them to declare their experience of enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA> The Business Council of Australia puts out a periodical for the benefit of people. In one edition, the Business Council talks about restructuring, a high degree of common purpose and shared interests in the workplace. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Council submitted that the Commission's already established framework was appropriate. Council believed that the structural efficiency principle should be implemented in a wage system in which</PARA>
<PARA> -the present principles are extended at least until the end of 1990, and preferably indefinitely-but subject to periodic reviews of progress;</PARA>
<PARA> -awards continue to be varied one by one, with wage increases being linked to performance improvement; and</PARA>
<PARA> -award variation continues to be dependent on a no extra claims commitment. </PARA>
<PARA>That no extra claims commitment has been given by the unions affiliated to the Australian Council of Trade Unions since at least 1983 and, to my knowledge, has been kept in almost all cases. So we have the Business Council of Australia indicating that it believes that the structural efficiency principle can succeed within the system. I repeat that my experience is that enterprise bargaining is not a problem. One result of enterprise bargain agreements almost universally and without exception has been that people have kept their word. I have even had occasion to be asked by employers to go to a workshop or workplace and point out to some members of my union that they were interpreting the agreement wrongly. I have done that without any compunction in order to ensure the integrity of that agreement and the integrity of our trade unionists. How do we say that employers should keep their word and be honest in dealings if we are not?</PARA>
<PARA> The proposition here is that the accord has failed. One would think that the accord was a little short document with three or four sentences concerning wages, productivity and conditions of work; but it is not. The accord talks about the economy in this country. The accord started from the position where the idea of unions going out and catching and killing their own, if I may be permitted to use that colloquialism, was no longer a proper situation. We were not motivated by a desire to be saints. We knew we had to change and go in a different direction, and we have done that. But we were not prepared to do that and face down the barrel the proposition of reduced real wages. We knew that was the position and that it may even go further. We are seeking to have a situation in which real wages go down no further than they have to and where a basis, through understanding and cooperation, in equity is established which then enables us to go upwards and restore jobs. We do not want to go back to the situation of some years ago when some people got wage awards, where some people under the metal industry award got 50 per cent more than the award, and others did not. We were faced with that position and changed our stance on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The accord talks about prices. It has been said here today by an Opposition senator that it is okay to give wage increases in dollars and cents, but surely it is important that those dollars and cents will buy those things that are needed by one's family and people in the community generally. I agree with that proposition. My mind goes back to the Whitlam days when there was a referendum about prices and incomes to give the Government the right to control both prices and incomes. But who was out there leading the charge in opposition to the referendum on prices and incomes? Of course, it was the opposition of the day-the Liberal and National parties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposition which the Opposition has put forward in this matter of public importance today is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Accord, as recognised by the leaked New South Wales Labour Council paper, and the urgent need for the adoption of the Liberal and National Parties' Industrial Relations Policy to boost productivity as the only basis for higher real wages and a reduction in Australia's massive foreign debt burden. </PARA>
<PARA>That proposition ought to be self-evident, even to Australian Labor Party senators opposite. Perhaps, with the speech we have just heard from Senator Burns, it is self-evident. I noticed that, in a speech of some 15 minutes, only in the last couple of minutes did he actually try to defend the accord, and he defended it quite inadequately. Of course, the failure of the accord is not only evident to us as the Opposition in the Senate but it is also most definitely evident now to the community at large. That is why there is ever-increasing support in the community for the coalition's approach to industrial relations. That has been most evident recently from Labor's own heartland: the New South Wales Labor Council, with the paper that was leaked just last week. The community is waiting for the opportunity to throw this Government out of office whenever a Federal election is held-to throw it out and the failed accord with it-and to entrust the reins of government to the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition, to establish its case in the debate today, simply has to establish the veracity of four points: firstly, that the accord has failed; secondly, that Australia has a massive foreign debt problem; thirdly, that a boost in productivity can be the only basis on which to reduce our foreign debt and on which Australians can obtain higher real wages; and, fourthly, that the industrial relations policy of the Liberal and National parties is the best way to achieve that boost in productivity. We have heard a lot of rhetoric from Government senators in the debate today about the efficacy of the centralised wage fixing system, but really that system is now nothing more than a dinosaur. Those who continue to support the accord claim that we will modernise our work force in Australia, notwithstanding the centralised system, through retraining and reskilling. Sadly, it is not that easy. The fact is that that approach ignores the very basic problem. Of course, that is the very nature of the centralised wage fixing system. It is absolutely necessary for us to recognise that the accord has failed to produce an employment situation and, more particularly, industries in Australia which can be competitive on export markets and, indeed, can compete in the domestic economy against imported goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA> As the New South Wales Labor Council paper identifies, as a result of the accord, despite the claim of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) a year or so ago, the bacon clearly has not been brought home. Interest rates at 17 per cent and higher, the fact that there is little likelihood of an imminent fall of those rates, the fall in real incomes, the massive increase in our foreign debt and trade deficit, and the fact that unemployment is now set to rise and our international credit rating has been further cut are all identified in the New South Wales Labor Council paper as indicators that this Government's accord has failed. It is a failed system. To quote more directly from that paper:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Accord has reached the limits of its capacity to assist in flexible adjustment to continuing economic change and pressure . . . </PARA>
<PARA>When the Hawke Labor Government made its pact with the trade union movement in 1983 and produced the prices and incomes accord, it was meant to herald a new era of industrial prosperity and stability. Instead, we have had seven years of declining productivity, declining real wages and declining living standards, as has been identified earlier in this debate by my colleagues Senator Chaney and Senator Stone. That is not to mention a rapidly deteriorating economy which has us fast approaching Third World status and which will leave Australians as the poor white trash of Asia, as it has been described. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1983-84 real wages have fallen in four of the six years and there is every indication that it will be the same in this current 1989-90 financial year. If honourable senators dispute that statistic of falling real wages, they should recall that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) said earlier this afternoon that there had been no growth in real wages under the accord. Certain Government senators claim that that is something for praise-that there has not been a growth in real wages-but it is something for which this Government ought to be damned. We ought to be looking for increases in real wages which are based on productivity growth-the only basis on which wages in real terms can rise. If we have wages that are based on anything other than productivity growth, then we simply have a fiction, a Clayton's wage rise, a wage rise which is very soon eaten up by rapidly escalating inflation. Of course, under this Government, with its rapacious desire for revenue, there are also the diminishing effects of higher marginal tax rates on take-home pay. Workers are hit on two fronts: by inflation and by a higher marginal tax rate under this Government's tax regime every time their wages go up. That is why real wages have fallen. </PARA>
<PARA> As further proof of the failure of the accord we have, as I have mentioned, high interest rates, a massive foreign debt now in excess of $100 billion and high inflation. Quite specific criticisms of the accord are made in the recent report of the Business Council of Australia and in a report by the Macquarie Bank and other financial institutions. The paper put out by the New South Wales Labor Council that came to light last week is simply one more document which spells out the failure of the accord over the period in which this Government has been in office. Productivity increases have not been forthcoming under the accord and, therefore, real wage growth is impossible under the current system. So says the paper of the New South Wales Labor Council. That point must be emphasised over and over again because it is the real crux of everything that is wrong with our economy and it is central to the problems in our industrial relations system and to our lack of competitiveness with other countries. The accord simply locks this country into ever-spiralling wages but even faster rising prices so that we have inflation running out of control. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government claims that under the Opposition's proposals, which I will refer to in a moment, we would see a wages break-out. Under our industrial relations system and the general approach which a coalition government will adopt to the product market, we will see greatly increased competition. That will act to ensure that there is not a wages spiral under a deregulated industrial relations system. What that criticism also fails to recognise is that under our system the voluntary agreements-the enterprise agreements-will apply only where there is joint agreement between employers and employees to opt out of the system and to reach an enterprise based agreement. That will be achieved only where the employer recognises that under an enterprise-based agreement he will get greater productivity from his employees and make his products or services more competitive and, therefore, capable of getting a greater market share, whether that be on the domestic market or on the export market. In that sense there is no danger of a wages spiral as a result of our policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Where agreement is not reached-where employers and employees do not agree as to the outcome of an enterprise-based negotiation-they will remain in the centralised system; they will remain subject to judgments by the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> More importantly, under our government compliance legislation will be introduced to ensure that recalcitrant trade unions cannot buck the system, that they cannot go outside the system unless they achieve agreement with their employers. They will have to remain within the system and accept the judgment of the Industrial Relations Commission unless that agreement is reached. So because of those two prongs of our policy-the greater competition within the economy and retention of the jurisdiction of the Industrial Relations Commission for those situations where voluntary agreement is not reached-there is no danger of a wages breakout. </PARA>
<PARA> All we hear from the Government these days are platitudes: platitudes telling us that high interest rates are not a problem, that, in fact they are good for us; that no child is living in poverty; that the pilots dispute is over; and that our escalating foreign debt is manageable. It is not prepared to address the real issues facing this country, in particular the breakdown of the accord and the desperate need for an alternative approach to industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is, as we say in our motion this afternoon, that our foreign debt is not manageable; it is disastrous for this country. It has increased from $33 billion in 1983 when this Government came to office to more than $100 billion today. Research now indicates that it is likely to increase to 44 per cent of our gross domestic product within five years and to nearly 60 per cent of gross domestic product by the year 2000. This is worse than banana republic stuff; it is the stuff of bankruptcies. Unless we can increase our productivity and reduce our labour unit costs, not simply in terms of our own domestic economy but in relation to the rest of the world, we will not get out of this spiralling road to bankruptcy. </PARA>
<PARA> Some research recently produced by the Department of Mathematics at the University of Adelaide further demonstrates the declining living standards that have been a direct result of the accord. It shows that over the last decade there has been an increase of some 139 per cent in average weekly earnings but that taxes, the Medicare levy, State taxes and charges and council rates-all charges directly attributable to government-have over the same period increased by 205 per cent. That is another example of the way in which governments have failed to deliver in terms of efficiency. The cost of an average house has risen by 196 per cent while repayments on the loan to purchase that house have risen by 333 per cent. In June 1979 a buyer would have needed $90 a week out of his after-tax average wage of $169 to meet the repayments on a normal house and car loan. By 1989 this has risen to $361 per week, which takes most of the after-tax average weekly earnings of $382. That is just another group of statistics which demonstrates the failure of the accord under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there have been all sorts of suggestions as to how we might improve our economic position and, in particular, reduce the foreign debt which has accumulated under this Government and which continues to grow at more than $2 billion per month. All the suggestions-whether they be the reimposition of quotas and higher tariffs or taxes on luxury goods-would be detrimental to the long term interests of our economy. The Government, of course, has relied on high interest rates in an effort to dampen down demand. It completely ignores the fact that, as well as dampening demand, high interest rates also dampen the productive capacity of the Australian economy and so do nothing to restore the balance of trade or to reduce our foreign debt. The only way to reduce our foreign debt is to increase our productivity so that our goods and services become more cost competitive and can therefore be sold in greater quantities overseas by exporters, earn greater export income and, in turn, be sold in greater quantities on our domestic market and be more competitive against imported goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore the only way to improve wages is to improve our productivity. As I said earlier, wage increases which are not backed by productivity simply fuel inflation. That is why the Opposition has put together a very practical and well-received industrial relations policy. Its central provision is to allow employers and employees who wish voluntarily-and I emphasise `voluntarily'-to reach agreement at the enterprise level in terms of wages and conditions to do so. Since that policy was first developed in 1986 and refined further last year a plethora of analy- ses by various groups has endorsed it as being down to earth, practical and the best way of achieving the improved productivity which this country requires. </PARA>
<PARA> Most recently, of course, the paper put out by the Labor Council of New South Wales concluded that single union enterprise agreements seem to be a more appropriate method of dealing with these issues. So that Council itself has endorsed our policy. A poll conducted recently by the Roy Morgan Research Centre found that only 23 per cent of respondents now want their wages and conditions of employment determined by the Industrial Relations Commission--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are discussing a matter of public importance introduced by Senator Chaney for the Opposition which compares the industrial relations programs of the Government and the Opposition. It is important to put the matter in perspective because last week there was a major discussion about economic policy, particularly the interest rate issue. At the end of last week in the Australian Financial Review Geoff Kitney wrote an article for the column `Canberra Observed' entitled `Stumbling Peacock plays Santa to Government'. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Santa Claus sat in the public gallery in Federal Parliament yesterday. It probably would have been more appropriate if he had sat in the Opposition Leader's place. </PARA>
<PARA> As federal politics prepares for the Christmas holiday calm before the election campaign storm in the first half of next year, Mr Peacock has delivered the Government gifts that have warmed the hearts of members of the Labor Caucus. </PARA>
<PARA>He then referred to Mr Peacock's press conference and said:</PARA>
<PARA>It was his first-</PARA>
<PARA>press conference, that is-</PARA>
<PARA>since the publication of his tax and spending policies two months ago, and was a classic demonstration of why Mr Peacock's minders quite sensibly seek to avoid exposing him to such intensive and detailed grillings. </PARA>
<PARA>The article went further and said:</PARA>
<PARA>But in important press conferences in which he is pressed for detailed analysis of the application and effect of his promised policies, Mr Peacock simply gets hopelessly lost. He looks uncomfortable and sounds incomprehensible. </PARA>
<PARA> Two months ago, Mr Peacock stumbled badly over the detail of the coalition's industrial relations and wages policy. Yesterday, he stumbled again. </PARA>
<PARA>That is how Geoff Kitney summed up the performance of the Opposition Leader last week. Today Senator Chaney, loyal Deputy Leader that he is, has decided to resurrect the first disaster of the Opposition. He searched the country and found a paper prepared by two junior officers in the Labor Council of New South Wales. The Secretary of that organisation has repudiated the document as not being one put out by officers of the Labor Council despite what has been said by Opposition senators. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Stone interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IF4">Senator CHILDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clearly it is something that has been grasped by Senator Stone, who has interjected, perhaps because the officers were prepared to refer favourably to the H. R. Nicholls Society. I welcome the opportunity to compare the Government's industrial relations policy with that of the Opposition. It is strange that in the motion the Opposition should have the audacity to refer to the urgent need for the adoption of the industrial relations policy of the Liberal and National parties to boost productivity, et cetera. Surely I do not have to tell you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that on Saturday the people of Queensland made a decision about the only State in Australia that has in practice the coalition's industrial relations policy. They completely rejected a policy very similar to the one this coalition or group of parties would impose on the Federal area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We know that in Queensland the policy did not act perfectly because the Government, as was its wont, from time to time would intervene to interfere in industrial relations. We know it is not perfect but it was an example of all the things that are characteristic of this type of policy. Those things include the existence of a divisive program and a policy that allows the industrial relations atmosphere to become one of confrontation. Most importantly, I honestly believe that it threatens the 80 per cent of wage and salary earners who depend for their living basically on their wages and salaries. Senator Chapman, who has just spoken, had the audacity to talk about throwing governments out of office. There is no question that in Queensland the Government was rejected, as were all the ingredients in the industrial relations policy, because that is part of the economic policy of any government. It was the exact policy that existed in Queensland. It was based on brute force. It was the power and dominance of money which inevitably led, as Senator Stone knows too well, to the corruption that was characteristic of the Queensland political system. We have had an all pervasive corruption in Queensland. The industrial relations one-sightedness of the Queensland Government's policy was just one aspect of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Premier Goss-I say that again; I like to say `Premier Goss'-will introduce a policy that will clearly fit in with the accord that this Federal Government has established. He will do away with the New Right fanaticism that Senator Stone and his colleagues had in Queensland. We know that that policy will seek to make sure that we get to working productively, and productively in this case means cooperatively. That is the approach of the accord. Let us look at our significant results in industrial disputes. When I was in opposition years ago I made many speeches about the way in which the Fraser Government's industrial relations policy worked. Since that time there has been a 60 per cent reduction in the number of working days lost per month. There has been a genuine examination of work practices throughout industry in this country. That has never occurred before. Work practices are only one side of it; it goes further. The natural extension of that discussion in a proper, cooperative atmosphere in the accord setting means that management practices are looked at. All over Australia people have sat down to discuss how they would do things better. </PARA>
<PARA> It is ironic that Senator Chapman should also talk about the employment situation. I do not know what he meant. But the reality is that we have created more than one million jobs. The trade unionists and the people in the work force know that it is their wives and friends in particular who have been able to rejoin the work force. Middle-aged people who were rejected have been able to come back into the work force, and young people have had a better chance to get into the work force. The education and training programs of this Government have been altered and developed so that people are now able to get the benefits of award restructuring and the career paths that will now become characteristic of industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not deny that it is a slow process-all significant change is a slow process. The difference between the Government and the Opposition is that the Opposition is really talking about an ideological quick fix and a waving of the wand. The Opposition's industrial relations policy is a hard policy-the McLachlans, the Costellos, the Copemans and the Elliotts are hard men. It is a hard partisan policy tailored to their extreme views. I appreciate the soft sell of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Chaney, and I appreciate the confusion of his leader, Mr Peacock, over these issues. They are being pushed by a policy that I suspect deep down they are not terribly happy about. I appreciate the reference to people waiting in the wings. Unfortunately, we would face a flying wedge of extremists in the next Parliament if those people were successful. </PARA>
<PARA> I will look to my State of New South Wales for a moment. It is rumoured that the Premier of New South Wales is under pressure from his parliamentary colleagues in this chamber to introduce enterprise agreement-type legislation in New South Wales. There is this crazy idea that there can be hundreds of thousands of agreements without destroying the long tradition of wage fixation in this country. It is important to note that this is not what I say; it is what the employer organisations in my State say about the pressure on Greiner to introduce this legislation. The practical people know that we cannot risk losing a reasonable industrial relations climate by experimenting. The Metal Trades Industry Association of New South Wales, the New South Wales branch of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, and all the major employer groups are aghast at the possibility that the Greiner Government will finally go ahead with this. Their spirit is reflected by national employer organisations and individual employers, who point to the danger of allowing in New South Wales the sort of policy proposed by the Federal coalition. </PARA>
<PARA> It is out of step with the award restructuring process, which is now very well advanced. It is inconsistent with the national accreditation of career paths for people. It reverts to the insular and selfish approach of just looking at one enterprise. This Government has tried to make sure an industry's needs are looked at. It plans training for an industry and gives people a career in industry. It is all right for universities and the Public Service to have career paths. The history of Australia has been to deny career paths for people in industry. Everything this Government is doing is to turn that around. That is the basis of the Government's industrial relations process. It allows the wherewithal for people to make the changes and the sacrifices. Nobody in the Government would deny that people have made sacrifices, and they have done so to the extent that more than one million jobs have been created. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to look at what would happen were the Opposition's proposals to go ahead. Honourable Senators should remember that at the moment the people being cited by the Opposition are protected by a minimum wage document which is invariably the result of union-employer negotiations and has been ratified by the Industrial Relations Commission. There is a protective blanket to make sure that when firms set about to restructure the work in their particular enterprises they know that the whole industry is working in the same way. This prevents sweatshops being created. In practice, the Opposition's policy would create an uneven situation. How can 100 workers in a factory negotiate with an employer when they do not have the same rights? Every coalition proposal gives every right to the employer to receive advice from associations, lawyers and economists. All the expert legal people are allowed to advise the employer. The 100 workers can have that right, if they can find a union or some lawyer, but they may not have the resources to employ anyone. Every trade union official knows the great costs involved in waging a case. </PARA>
<PARA> Deep down we all know that, although the Opposition talks about workers being able to have this great opportunity, the reality is that they will not have the resources. Inevitably, the result will be uneven for the employees. The real aim is to reduce advantageous outcomes for workers as far as wages and salaries are concerned. The crocodile tears of the Opposition for workers cannot wash away the truth of its policy, which is to embolden the employers and make it much more difficult for employees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is discussing the following matter of public importance:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Accord, as recognised by the leaked New South Wales Labour Council paper, and the urgent need for the adoption of the Liberal and National Parties' Industrial Relations Policy to boost productivity as the only basis for higher real wages and a reduction in Australia's massive foreign debt burden. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a very important matter for us to discuss. We have an extraordinarily poor industrial relations system. We have large numbers of unions-many of them craft unions-across the board, inherited largely from Britain; constitutional division of responsibility between State and Federal governments; and a highly legalistic and centralised dispute settling and wage fixing system. The results of this are awful. What is so depressing is that the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) would like to make us more centralised with bigger and more powerful unions and with more centralised control. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as I can gather from speeches from the Government benches, they would also like to see the system controlling prices. This is the very system that the people of eastern Europe, having experienced it, are desperately trying to break away from. This Government would take us down the path that the people of eastern Europe are just abandoning-centralised control of the economy, of prices and of wages. That is what they are breaking away from. If we look at the basis for this, the accord of the Labor Government and the ACTU, we see the results: in six out of seven years we have had falling productivity and falling real wages. This is happening in a time when the productivity of our competitors, other countries, is going up. We are paying for this as a result of the accord. We have, of course, created some new jobs during that time and we have increased household spending, but at the cost of borrowing from overseas $90,000m, which has to be paid back. In order to restrain spending, the Government has record sustained interest rates. The result of that, in the awful cause and effect that it is involved in, is an overpriced dollar which makes our manufactures less competitive either as exports or as import replacements. We have got ourselves in a diabolical mess. Economically, around the world, Australia is on the nose. Our credit rating has been twice downgraded in the time of this disastrous Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Central to our getting out of this problem is improving our industrial relations. We must make a new start in this area. Australians can be extremely productive. Our primary producers are probably the most productive in the world. It is only where we are highly centralised and highly unionised that Australians become less than normally productive. That is the course the Government would like to accentuate. It would like us to become more centralised and more unionised. That is a recipe for catastrophe. What we want, and what we must move towards as fast as we can, the speed being limited only by the necessity to ensure that there is no wage breakout, is a single union in each work place, each enterprise, not demarcation disputes or troubles with multiple unions. People in each enterprise must be sheltered from disputes in other enterprises that do not concern them. Above all, we must involve the workers in each enterprise in the success of their enterprise. They must be involved in wage fixing in their enterprise, in some form of profit sharing, or in other ways by which they are involved in the success of their enterprise. It we can do these things-other countries have; we should be able to-we will again merit the title of the lucky country. </PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill represents an important measure in the Government's efforts to strengthen and, where necessary, protect the legitimate autonomy of higher education institutions. The specific purpose of the Bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act to protect the rights and responsibilities of higher education institutions to make their own decisions, independent of Government interference, on the provision of services and amenities for their students and the imposition and collection of fees for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members will be aware, student organisations provide a wide range of services to their members from counselling, sporting, health and careers services to the necessary social outlets for young people in higher education. It is fundamentally important that these services and amenities be maintained at a viable level. This cannot be achieved without money. The principal source of that money is services and amenities fees collected from students themselves by the governing bodies of the institutions on behalf of organisations representing the interests of students generally. At present these fees are paid in accordance with provisions made by the governing bodies of the institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate that there needs to be a Bill of this kind at all. However, States have in the past interfered with these arrangements and some are threatening to do so again. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not prepared to see this happen. This Bill provides that as a condition of grant under the Act, a State must not interfere with the rights of the governing bodies of institutions to make decisions as to the imposition or collection of fees for organisations representing the interests of students generally. If a State breaches this condition it will be required to make up any consequential shortfall in revenue to those institutions. If necessary this will be achieved by a requirement that the State pay the Commonwealth an amount to make up the shortfall or alternatively, the Commonwealth could reduce the State's general revenue assistance. The Commonwealth will then make payments direct to the affected institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government encourages any State contemplating such interference in the autonomy of higher education institutions to think again and hopes that the provisions of this Bill will never need to be invoked. </PARA>

<PARA> The House of Representatives transmits to the Senate the following resolution which was agreed to by the House of Representatives on 30 November 1989 and requests the concurrence of the Senate therein:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) That a Parliament House Advisory Panel be established, to advise the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives on proposals for significant works in Parliament House.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) That the following provisions apply to the Panel:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the Panel shall consist of 8 members, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the President or a person appointed by the President to represent the President, and one other person appointed by the President,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the Speaker or a person appointed by the Speaker to represent the Speaker and one other person appointed by the Speaker,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the Minister designated by the Prime Minister as the relevant responsible Minister or a person appointed by the Minister to represent the Minister, and one other person appointed by the Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives or a person appointed by the Leader to represent the Leader, and</PARA>
<PARA> (v) a chairman who is an eminent member or former member of either House of the Parliament, appointed by the President and the Speaker after consultation with the Minister and the Leader of the Opposition;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) members shall be appointed to the Panel within 15 days after this resolution has been agreed to by both Houses of the Parliament, and shall hold office until the expiration of 15 days after the first meeting of the House of Representatives after the second general election occurring after this resolution has been so agreed to;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) members of the Panel, other than those appointed under paragraph (b), shall be appointed within 15 days after the first meeting of the House of Representatives after a general election of the House, and shall hold office until the expiration of 15 days after the first meeting of the House after the next ensuing general election;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) a member of the Panel other than the President, the Speaker, the Minister and the Leader of the Opposition may resign the member's office by writing addressed to the President and the Speaker, and the consequent vacancy shall be filled by the President, the Speaker, the Minister or the Leader of the Opposition, as the case requires;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) a member of the Panel appointed by the President, the Speaker, the Minister or the Leader of the Opposition may be removed from office, and the consequent vacancy filled, by the President, the Speaker, the Minister or the Leader of the Opposition, as the case may be;</PARA>
<PARA> (f) if the chairman is not present at a meeting of the Panel the Panel may elect a member to act as chairman for the purposes of that meeting;</PARA>
<PARA> (g) the quorum of the Panel shall be 4 members;</PARA>
<PARA> (h) questions before the Panel shall be decided by a majority of members present and voting, including the chairman or member acting as chairman, and if the votes on a question are equally divided the chairman or member acting as chairman shall have a casting vote; and</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the President and the Speaker may determine allowances for expenses and fees to be paid, out of an appropriation provided by the Parliament, to members of the Panel, other than the President, the Speaker, the Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, in respect of their service as members of the Panel, and a copy of each such determination shall be laid before each House of the Parliament within 5 sitting days of that House after the determination is made.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) That all proposals made to or by the President or the Speaker, or the President and the Speaker, for works in Parliament House, which are designated by the chairman, in accordance with guidelines determined by the Panel, as significant works, be referred to the Panel.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) That a copy of guidelines determined in accordance with paragraph (3) be laid before each House of the Parliament within 5 sitting days of that House after the guidelines are determined.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) That the Panel provide to the President and the Speaker a report on each proposal referred to the Panel, and draw attention to any aspects of the proposal the Panel considers significant, particularly having regard to the effect of the works referred to in the proposal on the architectural and aesthetic integrity of Parliament House.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) That it is expected that, in considering a proposal, the Panel will obtain and have regard to appropriate advice.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) That the President and the Speaker attach to each report provided to them a statement indicating:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the action required to give effect to the proposed works referred to in the report;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) whether that action is the responsibility of the President or the Speaker or of the President and the Speaker; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) whether it is intended that that action be undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) That a copy of each report and attached statement be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the provision of the report to the President and Speaker.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) That a message be sent to the Senate acquainting it of this resolution and requesting that it concur and take action accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA>The text of the resolution has been circulated. I wish to make a statement to the Senate concerning this message. The Senate may recall that on 16 June 1989 I answered a question asked by Senator Michael Baume concerning a proposal announced by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) for legislation to establish a committee to report on any proposed works in Parliament House. In answer to the question, I informed the Senate that the Minister's proposal was a matter of great concern to the Speaker and me, particularly because the proposal had been announced without any consultation with the Presiding Officers, and that we had written to the Minister requesting that the proposal be withdrawn.</PARA>
<PARA> Since that time there have been extensive consultations between the Speaker, the Minister and me. The resolution embodied in the message from the House of Representatives is the outcome of those consultations and replaces the Minister's proposal. The resolution has been drawn up by officers of the two Houses and reflects our considered view as to an appropriate mechanism to provide advice on works in Parliament House. The Senate will see that the resolution provides for an advisory panel, with a majority of parliamentary representatives, to present reports to the Presiding Officers on proposed works in the building which are designated as significant works. These reports will be laid before each House, with a statement indicating any action to be taken by the Presiding Officers. The Speaker and I believe that this proposal gives appropriate recognition to the control and management of Parliament House by the Presiding Officers on behalf of the two Houses.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to continue my remarks with regard to clause 35 of the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1989. Before the Senate adjourned last Thursday I described how the Government's proposed amendment will discriminate against some invalid pensioners once they reach the age of 65 in the case of a man and 60 in the case of a woman. I remind the Senate that since 1908 the invalid pension has been paid in respect of permanent incapacity to work. At the present time, people who come to Australia as migrants, able-bodied and able to work and who subsequently have an accident or develop an unforeseen illness and therefore become unable to work, are eligible to receive an invalid pension.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The discrimination and inequity arise when that same invalid pensioner reaches the age of 65 or 60. At that age, the invalid pension automatically ceases. However, unless the person concerned has not been in Australia for a minimum of 10 years, he or she is not eligible for the age pension. This means that the person is in a state of limbo: too injured or ill to work through unforeseen circumstances and not having been in Australia long enough to be eligible for the age pension. I also remind the Senate that the invalid pension is paid only to recently arrived older migrants who can prove that they are 85 per cent permanently incapacitated for work, that at least 50 per cent of their incapacity for work is caused by medical impairment and that their incapacity for work occurred while they were an Australian resident. If they cannot prove that their incapacity for work occurred while they were an Australian resident, they must wait until they have been an Australian resident for 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1974 a previous Labor government abolished the five-year residence qualification for invalid pension for people who became incapacitated for work after their arrival in Australia. This was supported by the Opposition parties, which recognised the hardship that such a requirement caused Australian citizens and residents. However, the present Government is now seeking to reimpose that hardship on older migrants and on their families. The saving from this change will be somewhere in the region of $700,000 for the 1990-91 financial year. As the single invalid pension is around $130 a week, or $6,760 per annum, some 103 would be affected. Some people might say, `Why should we worry about 103 people?'. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IH4">Senator JENKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague says, the Australian Democrats certainly worry about those 103 people. The point in question is that these 103 people would be discriminated against in a most blatant fashion: not only having come to Australia able bodied and prepared to work and having had the misfortune to have an accident or suffer illness which incapacitated them and prevented them from working, they also become aged 65 or 60 years too soon. They are discriminated against through becoming aged while on an invalid pension.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has justified this change on two grounds. In the first place the Government states that the current eligibility guidelines are inconsistent with age pension requirements: that is, that there should be a minimum of 10 years residence in Australia before being eligible for an age pension. But when applied in this case, this is a nonsense because there is the same requirement for eligibility for an invalid pension: that is, persons are not eligible for an invalid pension unless they have been in Australia for 10 years or unless they became ill or are injured after their arrival in Australia. In the second place, the Government justifies this change by saying that it will prevent older migrants from receiving the invalid pension and will force them to claim the special benefit instead at age 65 or 60. The Government will then be in a position to claim this back from those persons' relatives. But this is a heavy price to pay for older relatives who have the gall to age while being sick or injured. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation would place an unfair or unequal burden on newly arrived families who are struggling to establish and to make a new life for themselves in Australia. Therefore, the introduction of these changes will constitute a gross violation of the Government's social justice principles of access and equity and also of the Government's stated commitment to multiculturalism. It will also go against the Opposition's stated commitments towards easing the economic burden on families. During the committee stage of this legislation, Senator Powell will move an amendment on behalf of the Australian Democrats which will address this inequity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1989 and the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1989 come before us towards the end of the session, which is something to which we have become accustomed in this place. These two significant Bills, which form the social security package for this session of Parliament, have been introduced in a political environment in which the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) had called for more social justice. He has done so in response, in particular most recently, to the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) paper by Saunders and Whiteford called Ending Child Poverty: An Assessment of the Government's Family Package. Also, the Age newspaper of Tuesday, 28 November, contained an article entitled `Howe wants effort to fight poverty'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that only one Government senator has spoken during this debate-the only debate on social security Bills in this session of Parliament-on these two significant pieces of legislation. Senator Crowley, who spoke for 12 minutes last Thursday, put several points from the point of view of the Government, to which presumably the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) will respond at the end of this debate. On the other hand, Senator Bishop, the Opposition spokesperson in this House, managed to take five minutes, again last Thursday, to attempt somehow or other to get her views across. Senator Calvert who is not in charge of the legislation in this place but obviously is an aspirant, doubled the time of his shadow ministerial colleague by speaking for 10 minutes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise if my Hansard is not correct. I must say that, being in the chamber while he was speaking, I thought it must have been longer than that; but I took my statistics from Hansard. It seems to me that, while Mr Howe might be saying that we need a higher priority on these issues, that view is not necessarily shared in this chamber. Clearly, it is essential, as Mr Howe has said and as the EPAC paper has said, that we take a much broader policy approach if, generally, we are to achieve social justice in this country and if, specifically, we are to achieve the goal of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) of no child needing to live in poverty by 1990 or at any other time. I acknowledge that there have been advances under the Hawke Government-for instance, the edging down of unemployment levels. But that edging down is currently at risk as the dampening down of the economy occurs and there is a slowing down in the increase in employment and the acceptance on both sides of the chamber of a 6 per cent or so plateau of unemployment. This Government has increased social security payments for low income families: the family package and, in particular, the family allowance supplement, which has been of enormous benefit to low income families. It has increased indexation so that now most social security payments are indexed, although, in the view of the Australian Democrats, those indexations ought to be quarterly whereas many of them are still annual and most are six-monthly. The child support scheme has been an advance, obviously, but the lack of a maintenance guarantee means that there are still many families who do not benefit from that. Those who do not benefit are the most disadvantaged and those on low income amongst those sole parent families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been a wider spread of employment and training programs than we would expect under a coalition alternative government. But the strong labour market orientation of many of those programs excludes many of the most disadvantaged from those programs, in the intense approach to ensuring that training is the issue and the lack of emphasis on individual support for some people who find it difficult to get into structured training programs. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been two significant tax reforms in the life of this Government which have been supported by the Democrats: capital gains tax and fringe benefits tax. But, income taxes have been lowered, first at the top level; corporate taxes are not paid by too many of the corporations in this country; and negative gearing is still there for the advantaged in the community. The EPAC message is not new. The same sort of message has been given for a considerable amount of time. I refer in particular to some comments made by Dr Don Edgar of the Institute of Family Studies in April 1988 at a conference on child poverty. It is an important message and I quote from the papers of that conference which are now available in a publication from the Institute called Child Poverty:</PARA>
<PARA> The point is that if we can afford as a society to provide housing, superannuation, taxation and occupational benefits to the better off, we can afford to remove poverty. The cost to the society as a whole of upper-income welfarism is enormous, yet we hear less about this than about the cost of social security benefits, the exploitation of unemployment benefits, supporting parent's benefits, Workcare and so on. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that on an analysis-and one would hope that we would get all the figures right, Senator Calvert-of the time spent in this chamber on debating issues of upper income welfarism versus the time spent on addressing issues of poverty, as outlined by Dr Edgar, that would be supported. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Edgar made the point last April that the only way to alter this tide of privileged special pleading and stigmatising is to insist on the message that to have anyone living in poverty harms us all; to have any youth or any child living in poverty is to harm our future. He went on to say that what we lack now and need most of all is a new measure of poverty not based on income alone, but based on access to those resources which are seen as necessities for the participation in activities of society. Indeed, that is a message that was taken up by EPAC and ought to be taken up by all of us. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore remind the Senate that while the Government pushes the line that it has done a great deal-and it has done some things, some of which I have mentioned-and clearly is preferable in many respects to options which are offered by the alternative government, for instance, the removal of unemployment benefits after nine months, it has developed the most targeted social security system around. It has reduced the outlays on social security even more than the Fraser Government before it. So it is a government which has restricted the welfare payout. It is disappointing that there is so much that concerns us in these Bills. There is concern about a cognate debate late in the session, especially as many of the issues that are contained have not really been widely debated and have not been resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> I give a brief outline of a range of concerns that the Australian Democrats have with these Bills. I refer first to the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1989. Over quite a period, we have publicly expressed our concerns about the changes to the assessment of de facto relationships. I will be moving a second reading amendment to refer the provisions of this Bill in this respect to a committee. I will turn to this a little later in my comments. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other major concerns that we have with this Bill. I will take those in groups. I deal first with the unemployed in our community, a group who, regrettably, are likely to increase in numbers as we move into the economic difficulties of 1990 and who already abound in numbers which are unsatisfactorily high, particularly in some areas in our community. As I said before, the Democrats regret the fact that the 6 per cent or so level of unemployment seems to have been accepted as part of our social ethos. We do not believe that enough is being done to address that and bring the number down to the sort of unemployment level which used to be the acceptable one in this country, which was 1 1/2 per cent to 2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Bill there is an attempt to restrict the freedom of movement of people who happen to be unemployed. My colleague Senator Haines addressed this issue at some length in her contribution to this debate last week. It is important to emphasise that the provisions in this Bill which would take the right to unemployment benefits from people for three months should they move to an area which reduces, according to the Government, their opportunity for employment, fail to reflect the reality of the lives of the unemployed and of the low income people. The Government is saying to the unemployed, `You can take account of no other aspects of your life'. We should not look at only one aspect of people's lives, the cost of housing, although that is an enormous problem for many low income people in our community. Other problems in our community are homeless children, long waiting lists for public housing, and very high rentals in the private sector. So if unemployed people and their families decide that they cannot meet their housing costs in the area where they are living and they move somewhere else on the basis of being able to afford housing there, they can lose entitlement to the unemployment benefit on the ground that they have moved somewhere where the Department of Social Security will determine that they have lowered their opportunity for employment. In the committee stage I will be specifically asking why we do not have in this legislation detailed information of how the decision is going to be made by the Department about whether people have reduced their employment opportunities by moving. What sort of statistics are they going to use and on what basis will the statistics be arrived at?</PARA>
<PARA> We have done some research for one area-the mid-north coast of New South Wales-and discovered that, while that area has a high unemployment rate, it also shows up high in statistics of high employment growth. I will refer in more detail to those statistics in committee, but we really have serious questions to ask about this provision in the legislation. I would also like to look at housing costs and take a family living on the unemployment benefit in Hobart, where unemployment levels are quite high-I believe about 9 per cent-who genuinely want to seek employment and live in an area of much lower unemployment-about 5 per cent or so-Melbourne. But if those people did that their average rent would go up from $148 to $201. The Government dare not move in the other direction. How can those people move from a high unemployment area to a lower unemployment area when housing costs are of that nature? We would like to go into that in more detail. We oppose those provisions in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are provisions in the legislation making it compulsory for unemployment and sickness beneficiaries to provide their tax file number in order to receive a benefit. The Australian Democrats will also oppose those provisions in the legislation. When the tax file number debate was on, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) made a commitment, among others, that this kind of thing would not happen. Again, I will go into that in further detail at the committee stage of the debate. We find it anathema that two groups in the community should be singled out and no longer have a discretion which all other Australians have. That provision in the tax file number legislation was of major concern to the Democrats. We will not support a provision for this kind of discrimination against two particular groups in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter which concerns us relates to the direct payment of pensions and benefits into bank accounts. Some years ago the Government made it mandatory for payments to be made directly to banks, although it has been possible, if one can argue a sufficient case, for there to be an exemption. However, it has been the norm, at the behest of the Government, for that to happen. Many of us during that period have questioned whether the Government had a legislative base for such action. The Government has now discovered that it did not. Therefore, it has provided that base in this legislation, finally legalising its action. </PARA>
<PARA> We will attempt to amend the legislation to ensure that pensioners will not be forced into direct payments if that is against their financial interests. We do this, firstly, to give those people freedom of choice in their financial interests-the Australian Democrats do not believe that any less should apply to people in receipt of government benefits than applies to people in the wider community-and, secondly, because of the practice that the Government has agreed to, in spite of the fact that we believe it is contrary to the provisions of the Social Security Act, of allowing banks to garnishee, in a sense, funds in the accounts of pensioners and beneficiaries who have been overpaid or whatever. We believe that pensioners and beneficiaries should be able, if they wish to do so, to move their money around and not necessarily be forced into putting it in certain accounts. We will move amendments to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Our major concerns about the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) revolve around, firstly, the issue which Senator Jenkins has canvassed fully in the debate; that is, the changes to entitlement for invalid pension which impact heavily and unjustly on a small but significant group-our migrant community. We have further amendments to the Bill relating to the payment of pensions and benefits into bank accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats have major concerns about, and an amendment to, the change to the definition of dependent child so that a child earning $100 a week will no longer be defined as a dependent child. That is one of the Government's labour market initiatives and it applies to 15-year-olds. We are particularly concerned about those 15-year-olds in a sole parent family which stands to lose $65 or so from its weekly household income. In other words, a 15-year-old would work 33 hours a week for a net gain to that household income of $35 a week. I will go into that in more detail at the committee stage. We will move to amend that provision to at least make it an annual income so that families whose children work on any kind of sporadic basis are not affected by it. </PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned that the major impact of this measure, which the Government believes will bring in $11m in the first full year, is almost totally on low income families-not just the families of beneficiaries but low income working families; families who are receiving the family allowance supplement. It looks to us as if there will be a net loss of around $43 for those families. There is a sense of child slavery in this: the taxpayer will be thrilled to save $11m but the kid will be working for 33 hours a week for $35. I am not comfortable with that and I do not think that anybody should be. </PARA>
<PARA> The major impacts in both Bills are on sole parent families. In most cases the effect will be to put that parent on the unemployment benefit. This is also linked to the changes in the assessment of a de facto relationship. After the removal of the class B widow's pension a couple of years ago, it is becoming clear that the Government is attempting to almost eliminate the sole parent pension. I challenge the social justice approach that is behind this kind of exercise because it is becoming increasingly difficult, particularly for women-the vast majority of those in receipt of this pension are women-to sustain even an application for this pension, which means a great deal to someone attempting to bring up a family mostly on her own. </PARA>
<PARA> If this were not a cognate debate I would have more time to canvass our concerns. However, it is terribly important that we spend some time considering the attitude that is abroad about sole parents. I do not make these statements out of my own feeling, sense of justice or anything else. I refer to a paper on supporting sole parents prepared by Alison McClelland of the Brotherhood of St Laurence for the Australian Council of Social Service which was published in October this year. Alison McClelland puts the proposition that there is a very strong need for an increase in the mothers/guardians allowance-the only payment which is available specifically and only for sole supporting mothers. The paper stated:</PARA>
<PARA> A significant minority of Australian families are sole parent families. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that those people who will be out on the hustings campaigning on families for the next four or five months at the outside understand what she is saying. She continued:</PARA>
<PARA> In 1988 there were 342,600 sole parent families making up 15 per cent of all families with children. </PARA>
<PARA>None of us should have policies which exclude 15 per cent of Australian families with children. She continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The majority (87.6 per cent) were headed by a female and they became sole parents largely as a result of separation and divorce. Over 260,000 sole parents were reliant on a Social Security Pension or Benefit and contrary to popular belief most remain on a pension or benefit for a relatively short period of time. Most sole parents received the pension for less than 16 months. </PARA>
<PARA>We must add to that the fact that half the children in poverty in this country come from those 15 per cent of families, which is a gross disproportion, and that a quarter of the homeless children identified in the Burdekin report are also from those families. This is a totally disadvantaged group and stands to be further disadvantaged by this legislation, in spite of efforts which the Government appears to have made in other fields. </PARA>
<PARA> McClelland argues that there is a strong case for specific additional assistance for sole parents, especially sole parents of pensioner and beneficiary families. She says in her paper that the Government provides income support payments on the understanding that parenting is a very important activity, but she points out that sole parenting is made much harder because sole parenting is generally undervalued, sole parents do not receive enough support from the community, they face punitive community attitudes and frequently are the target of actual or threatened welfare cuts and that this is both unfair and unproductive. It is important, particularly for members of the Opposition, to note a further point that Alison McClelland makes in this paper, in the general sense:</PARA>
<PARA> Child rearing is an important and worthwhile activity that provides benefits to the Australian society and economy. </PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to read that. I certainly believe it. Child rearing was virtually my sole occupation for 20 years. She continues:</PARA>
<PARA> It therefore should be recognised and supported by the community. One positive aspect of Australia's social security system has been its support for caring work, including support for child rearing. This must be retained and strengthened. </PARA>
<PARA>It is remarkable and sad that this group currently is so much under siege politically. Alison McClelland puts the point that support for this type of family unit ought to be available, free of any obligation to meet the requirements of the work test. This is counter to what is happening. The number of people for whom that support is available without the work test is being reduced. It has been reduced in the past and it is being reduced in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Alison McClelland points out that it is not a community expectation that in two-parent families with dependent children both parents should work. In many families both parents work, but it is not a community expectation. Yet for sole parent families a community expectation has developed-and certainly a political expectation in this place-that that sole parent will work. This places no value at all on the work of child rearing, which until now we have valued in this community and which I hear constantly from the Opposition and from more conservative forces in the community ought to be valued. Yet they will sit here and vote against the amendment, vote against the opposition to this legislation that only the Australian Democrats provide in this place. I, as a woman who has spent most of my time-up until now, anyway-child rearing, think that this is a grossly negative change to our social ethos. I for one will not condone it. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a lack of physical, financial, social and emotional support from a second parent in a sole parent family. It has been put this way in another paper by Patricia Harris, called Child Poverty, Inequality and Social Justice, for the Brotherhood of St Laurence:</PARA>
<PARA> Parents, whether in or outside the work force, can make a direct economic contribution to the household through child care, household maintenance, preparation of meals, cleaning, and financial management. Sole parents either undertake the entire range of tasks themselves, pay others to assist or leave some tasks undone. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the tasks that get left undone is financial management. We are clapping these women into gaol now because that is the task they left undone and we are blaming them. It is regrettable that research in the community has shown both the Government and the Opposition that it is the unemployed and sole parents whom they should hit in order to win the next election. They will not do it without being hit themselves-not as long as we are around. </PARA>
<PARA> These people are supposed to work but the labour market disadvantages for all women, and most particularly for women bringing up children, whether they are on their own or whether they have a partner, are well documented. Regrettably, I do not have time to go through them. The jobs, education and training scheme is in place to attempt to help these women but while child-care is inadequate, while women are clustered in low income occupations, as they still are, and while there is a lack of jobs, particularly for those who are just geographically isolated, those labour market disincentives will still be there. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At the end of motion, add: `, but that the provisions of clauses 22, 24 (a) and (b), 25, 26, 28, 36, 52 and 53 be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry and report, not later than the first sitting day of April 1990, on:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the meaning and effects of the clauses:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the nature and extent of any legal, administrative and practical changes to payments of, and entitlements to, payments and pensions, which the clauses would, if enacted, introduce into the operation and application of the Social Security Act;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the implications for personal privacy and freedom of movement of the clauses;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the various ways in which the clauses could be made to operate in practice; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the likely economic and social effects of the clauses for the government, and for those people, claimants and pensioners who could be affected by them.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment is the first attempt to codify in Federal law what a de facto relationship is. This legislation is, in a sense, backdoor legislation which can, and no doubt will, flow through to other areas. It does not seem to us to be an appropriate way to deal with this issue. There are two sides to this problem. Being defined as being in a de facto relationship can in some instances bring an advantage and in other instances bring a disadvantage. To introduce this series of indicia into the Act can affect all recipients. Already it applies in the veterans' affairs area as well under this legislation. The criteria are not even sufficient or necessary and no information is given on how they will be assessed and evaluated. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not believe this is the way to bring in this kind of change, nor do a very wide range of groups in the community. So we wish to refer these issues off to a Senate committee. We have made this attempt once before. Perhaps our major concern is that, even when it is determined that there is a de facto relationship, there is no legal obligation to maintain another individual in a de facto regime. We are forcing a situation where women, with no legal right to claim support, may be deprived of an income without any replacement being offered. We agree with the Australian Council of Social Service and the National Women's Consultative Council that it should be an issue that remains undefined in the Act, that the onus of proof, whether statutory or in fact, ought to remain with the Department and that it should not be held that a de facto relationship exists unless there is an ongoing commitment to provide adequate financial support. This legislation is a disappointment. Many children still do live in poverty and still will live in poverty. To quote from the last--</PARA>

The Opposition is very sympathetic to some of the issues that have been raised by various welfare organisations, but those issues seem to have been based on the worst case scenario. Whether these concerns are justified will depend largely upon the efficiency and fairness of the departmental administration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know that our shadow Minister has been assured by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) that the review procedures will be applied fairly and that a person seeking a review of a previous decision will be entitled to receive benefits until the outcome of the review. Therefore, under the circumstances and given the complexities of the issue, the Opposition believes that it would be preferable to allow the legislation to be passed rather than delay the passage of the legislation so late in the session. In passing, I would like to make the point that we have given a commitment that, if necessary, we will review the legislation when we come to government to ensure that this particular legislation is applied with fairness. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to incorporate a second reading response into Hansard. But before I seek leave to do that I make one point in respect of the Australian Democrats' amendment to the motion for the second reading. I wish to rebut the argument that we were approaching this through a backdoor method. It should be recognised by the Senate that the inclusion of these indicators is not a radical, unprecedented step. It happens by way of codifying law across the board; that is what parliaments are for. In this particular area the inclusion was initially recommended by the legislative working party of the Social Security Advisory Council. The working party was composed of, amongst others, lawyers, welfare rights workers and the National Convener of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. Its view was strongly supported by the Department of Social Security women's consultative committee, composed of women from all areas of the Department. I now seek leave to incorporate the rest of my remarks in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The response read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> One thing Senator Bishop said needs a response: She said:</PARA>
<PARA> It has only taken five years of fairly lax administration for it to realise there is a need for a tightening of the system. </PARA>
<PARA> A good line-that does not accord with the facts. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor has effected some $5 billion of savings in social security expenditure-through sustained reforms to restore integrity to the system after its collapse under Senator Chaney. </PARA>
<PARA> The measures in Bill No. 3 are further steps in that process. </PARA>
<PARA> More importantly what Senator Bishop did not mention is notable. </PARA>
<PARA> Bill No. 4 contains measures to:</PARA>
<PARA> Implement all of the pensions aspects of the first ever retirement income policy;</PARA>
<PARA> Provide an overhaul of Youth Income Support as part of the Youth Social Justice Strategy and in response to the Burdekin Report on Homeless Youth; and</PARA>
<PARA> Adopt a comprehensive approach to the older unemployed and other groups of unemployed people. </PARA>
<PARA> Among the detailed provisions of the Bills are measures:</PARA>
<PARA> That would see the maximum level of rent assistance increase from $15 a week to $30 a week for people without children, $35 a week for people with one or two children and $40 a week for people with three or more children;</PARA>
<PARA> That would index rent assistance in line with the CPI;</PARA>
<PARA> To lift the level of pension for aged, invalid, wives, carers, sole parent and service pensioners to its highest level relative to average weekly earnings in 40 years;</PARA>
<PARA> To overhaul the young homeless allowance-by a substantial lift in the rate and cuts in the waiting period; and</PARA>
<PARA> That introduce a bereavement package to provide up to $1,200 to the pensioner spouse of a deceased pensioner and lump sums to many other bereaved pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> But Senator Bishop did not comment on any of these. That is a comment on the importance the Opposition really give to measures to improve adequacy for the aged. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Calvert similarly did not address the historic retirement income package. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed he spoke of the difficulties of homeless youth without once recognising that the legislation he was addressing implements the social security components of the Youth Social Justice Strategy-that is aimed especially at overcoming the difficulties facing homeless youth. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Calvert also developed two themes that are totally inconsistent with the facts. He cited figures of children in poverty from 1987 research that does not take account of the full implementation of Labor's families' package. He suggested -totally untruthfully-that real disposable household incomes have fallen under Labor. </PARA>
<PARA> The opposite is the case. </PARA>
<PARA> He suggested that marriage breakdowns involving children are worse under Labor. The exact opposite is the case. Under the previous Coalition government every year from 1977 the number of divorces involving children rose. Each year under Labor the number has fallen. </PARA>
<PARA> The electors of Kingston will be interested to know that in her contribution Senator Haines said not one word about the historic package of measures for age pensioners in these Bills. When it comes down to it those measures are not of high enough priority for Senator Haines to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA> She did speak of a measure to suspend unemployment benefit when a person moves and thereby reduces his or her employment prospects. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of points to be made in response to Senator Haines' comments. </PARA>
<PARA> The first is that like each of the Democrat speakers in this debate she has been a victim of the rhetoric of the lobby groups they are seeking to please. She constructed her argument on the basis that the Bill provided for suspensions of benefit and I quote her ``for people who move to an area of high unemployment''. She then constructed examples of people without any prospects of getting work who moved to cheaper housing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill does not do what Senator Haines' complained of. Rather it provides that a person is not qualified when he or she reduces his or her individual employment prospects by moving to an new place of residence. </PARA>
<PARA> It is axiomatic that a person with no prospects of employment cannot reduce them. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand for people who do have prospects of employment Labor takes the approach that you do them no favours by the soft option of providing incentives for them to move to an area where they will be dependent on benefit for the long-term. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather Labor's approach is:</PARA>
<PARA> conduct economic and wages policies so job growth continues-as Senator Crowley pointed out 1.6 million new jobs has meant the number dependant on unemployment benefit has fallen from 630,000 to 350,000;</PARA>
<PARA> provide effective, targeted labour market programs, integrated with income security measures, to help the excluded and disadvantaged back into the mainstream; and</PARA>
<PARA> guarantee adequate issue support-so the families Senator Haines expresses concern for will receive over the next 9 months the following:</PARA>
<PARA> rent assistance increased from $15 a week to $35 a week (or $40 for three or more children);</PARA>
<PARA> indexation of family allowance and adjustment of additional benefit for children for inflation;</PARA>
<PARA> indexation of the basic benefit; and</PARA>
<PARA> increase above indexation of $3.30 a week for a married couple. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of those measures are in the Bills before the Senate-but again Senator Haines did not refer to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally Labor builds its approach on reciprocity-in return for adequate income support and effective labour market programs we expect unemployed people to try to get back to work if possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Two further points should briefly be made about Senator Haines' contribution:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's advice is that no state government removes people from public housing waiting lists because they decline an allocation in a country area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Legislation is not designed to be a rigid, widely-applied measure to restrict freedom of movement among unemployed people generally. Rather, it will prevent the most obvious cases where relocation substantially reduces the prospects of finding suitable work, and especially where the move is deliberately designed to ensure unemployed benefit can be received indefinitely on the basis of limited local job opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, it will enable DSS to deal more effectively with unemployment beneficiaries who opt to move from, say, Sydney to the north coast of New South Wales, or to other remote rural areas, for lifestyle reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation will only be applied where there is clear evidence of substantial reduction in employment prospects. It will not be applied in marginal situations. This has been made quite explicit in instructions to the CES and DSS networks. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jenkins argued that an amendment to prohibit the grant of invalid pension to people over age pension age was harsh and discriminatory. </PARA>
<PARA> Invalid pension is a work related payment. To date it has been the only one of three work related payments in the social security act which does not have an upper age limit. Sickness benefit and unemployment benefit do have such a limit and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) has noted that the absence of any upper limit for invalid pension is a ``curious feature'' (re Blando). </PARA>
<PARA> The AAT has also noted that the common sort of case which arises is that of someone who has come to Australia at an advanced age, but who becomes permanently incapacitated not long after arrival because of degenerative health problems (many of which are an ordinary part of the ageing process). Many will have come to Australia for family reunion purposes and it is not reasonable that the full burden of their support be readily placed upon the Australian community. The assurance of support scheme seeks to ensure that this does not occur. </PARA>
<PARA> If a person is precluded from invalid pension by clause 35, special benefit would be available. As a result of clause 59 (c) of the Bill-not referred to by Senator Jenkins-special benefit would be payable up to the same rate as invalid pension. If in such a case an assurance of support is operative, then the person's entry to Australia was conditional on the assurer providing adequate assistance rather than the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> I would make one further point in reply to Senator Jenkins:</PARA>
<PARA> She constructed her argument on the basis that people migrating to Australia in their late 50s or early 60s, and their families, could not foresee that they might become too ill to work in the next 10 years. That is pure fantasy. While many people do remain fit and healthy well into their 70s many others become ill or frail in their 60s. </PARA>

<PARA>I wish to speak of our opposition in particular to the inclusion in this legislation of the need for social security beneficiaries to provide a tax file number. I would just like to make the reason for that opposition a little clearer, as time was limited in the second reading debate. Clauses 18, 19, 20 and 38 of the legislation really preclude people who qualify for unemployment and sickness benefits from receiving these payments if they do not provide their tax file number to the Department. In the second reading debate I did say that we felt that making these groups of people in the community the only people who do not have the discretion as to whether or not they provide their tax file number was an unfair discrimination. I remind the Committee that on 1 September 1988 the Treasurer (Mr Keating), in discussing the tax file number legislation in the House of Representatives, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the essential purpose of the new file number arrangement is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Australian Taxation Office's income matching system as a means of furthering the attack on tax evasion. </PARA>
<PARA>What tax evasion has to do with people on unemployment and sickness benefits needs to be answered. Senator Tate in this place reiterated that the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) was a fundamental attack on tax evasion, increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the Australian Taxation Office. On 4 November 1988 Senator Tate stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Further, the Government has accepted the Opposition's suggestion that the tax file numbering scheme be made completely voluntary. The Bill now ensures that taxpayers will in all circumstances retain the right to elect to have tax withheld at source rather than quote their tax file number. </PARA>
<PARA>At present unemployment and sickness beneficiaries are effectively taxed at a rate of 50.25 per cent if they do not declare a tax file number, and they have to wait until they submit their tax return before their tax credits are refunded. That is the same for employers and investors. They will not have this discretion if these clauses pass. The Government says that this is necessary to reduce fraud and abuse and will save $49.8m in a full year. However, we have not had evidence from the Government that beneficiaries are more fraudulent than any other members of the community, and that is certainly what is implied in these provisions. Taxpayers as a whole, with the exception of these people, still have the discretion as to whether they provide their tax file number. The only really logical and just basis for singling out a group of people would be to demonstrate that they are so much more fraudulent, as a group. When we look around at the taxpayers of this country, the higher we raise our sights in terms of actual income, the less likely it is that the Government would be able to make stick the accusation which is inherent in these clauses. It may not be fraud, but it is interesting that one of the things that Christopher Skase has to sell is tax credits. </PARA>
<PARA> These provisions enable the Government to use the tax file number to avoid its obligation to pay benefits to people who are qualified otherwise. It is not easy to qualify for an unemployment or a sickness benefit and it gets more difficult day by day. Even if one does qualify, there is an extra hurdle to jump. It is a question of equal rights in the community. The Government has an obligation to support people in the community who need support. For that reason, we do not believe that the Government has provided sufficient argument for us to support this move in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In my amendment No. 4 the Democrats will be opposing clauses 36 and 39 which relate to provisions of the Bill which withdraw benefits from people who move from their place of residence and so reduce their employment prospects. In the second reading debate I pointed out that we do not have, as yet, any clarification as to how this will be administered and on what basis the department will make its determination as to whether a person's employment prospects have been reduced. There is an exception to this: if a family member has a residence in that place, however that place is determined, that will be all right, or one can move near a family member who has a residence in that area. Senator Haines in her contribution in this debate said that this was rather a quaint new version of family reunion. Clearly there is a great cloud over how this will be determined. We want to hear from the Government, although I doubt that it will change our mind about our opposition to these clauses, but we have not heard anything to date. That is a feature of this debate and one reason we objected to the statement of the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) being incorporated rather than read out. Those who are on unemployment benefits are in limbo on this matter. We believe that there is a need for a great deal more detail. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to point out that unemployed people could be in even more limbo than I and Senator Haines have outlined. It is interesting to look at the Opposition's proposals on unemployment particularly as we have supported its second reading amendment which called upon the Government to change direction. The Opposition has foreshadowed one way in which it would change direction: that is, to cause people to move in order to increase their opportunity for employment. I will give figures of the research we have done on the mid-north coast. In Sydney from 1983 to 1989 employment growth went from 10.5 per cent to 20.8 per cent and on the north coast employment growth went from 22.2 per cent to 41.9 per cent. Unemployment figures in that area show quite the contrary: in the mid-north coast there is an unemployment figure of 15.1 per cent, and in the Sydney region, the unemployment figure is 10.3 per cent. On the one hand the Government says, `You lose your benefit if you move to the mid-north coast because there is a higher unemployment level there'. On the other hand, the Opposition might be saying, `Move to the mid-north coast'. The Opposition has not outlined how it will determine this matter either. The Government says, `Do not go there'; the Opposition says, `Go there'-perhaps. We need a clarification. Clearly it is not an open and shut case. This is a very difficult matter and does not take account of the needs of people who are on the unemployment benefit. They need to have accommodation at an affordable level, which is a point I made in the second reading debate. On those counts the Democrats will be opposing these various clauses in the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few remarks in committee on this particular matter. As has been said previously, the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1989 will implement some of the measures announced in the 1989-90 Budget and the April 1989 Economic Statement, and some other minor administrative changes. It is interesting to note that amendments were prepared by the Welfare Rights Centre and the Australian Council of Social Service. They raise a number of concerns with the legislation as originally introduced by the Government. The Government subsequently included some of those concerns in the amendments it moved in the House of Representatives. Quite rightly, I believe, the Opposition supported those amendments. Under the circumstances, we do not propose to support any further amendments to the legislation at this time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that this is a very complicated Bill. In my opinion all the amendments the Australian Democrats have moved further complicate what is already complicated legislation. The shadow Cabinet took the decision not to oppose this legislation because it was part of the Budget package. The Opposition will not be supporting the Australian Democrats amendments. The amendments moved by the Democrats presume that there will be problems with the legislation. We believe it remains to be seen how the legislation will take affect in practice. I believe that the Government should have the chance to put this into practice. The Liberal and National parties are aware of concerns with the criteria for defining de facto relationships, for instance. We have stated all along that we will be monitoring the effects of the legislation closely. When we return to government, if the legislation needs amending we will do that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats are now putting forward amendments to the tax file number system. Originally, we supported the tax file number after receiving many changes to the Privacy Bill. Now that the tax file number is in place we believe that the provision of that tax file number for unemployment benefits or sickness benefits is seen as a way of reducing the incidence of fraud and abuse in the social security system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are not talking about tax, Senator Powell. We are talking about unemployment at this particular time. We are supporting the Government. We are certainly not supporting the Democrats' amendments. The Democrats are moving amendments Nos 1 and 2 together. These amendments refer to the prevention of a payment of unemployment benefit for 12 weeks to people who reduce their employment opportunities by moving around, as Senator Powell has already mentioned. Unfortunately the current situation allows people to relocate to areas where there is little prospect of their finding work. It certainly makes a mockery of the unemployment benefit work test.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Just for the record, Senator Powell, I believe that the unemployment rate in Tasmania has decreased from 9 per cent to 8 per cent. I do not know whether that was because a lot of the people who have been working for the green movement in Tasmania moved to Queensland for the election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government also does not support the amendments moved by Senator Powell. In respect of the first area that she raises, that of the tax file number, I am advised that there are currently about 7,000 people receiving a benefit who have not provided a tax file number and who are being taxed at the top marginal rate. It can be fairly assumed that there are three categories of those 7,000: those who obviously do not want to provide the tax file number for privacy reasons; those who have difficulty in providing such a number; and those who are not entitled to benefit payments. This legislation will mean that those people who have difficulty will only need to deal with the Department of Social Security and will be helped to get that tax file number. Those who are not entitled to benefit payments will be excluded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government states quite clearly that this provision does not mean that the tax file number will be used for narrow social security purposes. I refer Senator Powell to the provision in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1989, which will follow this one and which will substantially strengthen secrecy provisions applying in this area. Overall we anticipate that this measure will save over $30m in wrongfully paid social security benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point encompassed by the Democrat amendment is the category that we are talking about-people moving to an area where they may, or would, reduce their individual employment prospects. It should be stated at the outset that it is axiomatic that a person with no prospects of employment cannot increase them. That should be taken into account when considering the effect of this legislation. Clearly, what the Government has in mind is that category of persons who have prospects to take employment and move to an area whereby, in a significant way, they reduce their capacity for employment. Basically, the legislation will be applied only where there is clear evidence of a substantial reduction in employment prospects. It will not be applied in those marginal situations. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be recognised that this particular policy is very much one of reciprocity. The Government's approach has been to provide the climate for employment growth, and the Senate does not have to be reminded at length that over our term of government 1.6 million new jobs have been created. Most importantly, the numbers dependent on unemployment benefits have fallen from 630,000 to 350,000. We are providing a targeted labour market program. We are guaranteeing adequate income support to the families that Senator Haines mentioned in her second reading contribution. We are providing support by way of rental assistance, indexation of payments and indexation of basic benefits. It should also be recognised that much of this extra support is in fact encompassed in this particular Bill before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> On the one hand we are providing opportunities and income support and on the other hand we make it very clear that it serves no-one any good for persons to be allowed to take that step which would lead to clear evidence of a substantial reduction in employment prospects. The legislation will be applied quite precisely to ensure that where there is clear evidence the benefit will not be available. In the context of the Government's balanced approach this is a fair provision when one looks at the other measures that are in place. Also, when one looks at the actual position of individuals it would serve no good for them to be allowed to take the soft option. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it rather quaint for the Government to point to three different groups of people who are not providing a tax file number and who are receiving unemployment and sickness benefits. The Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) said that one group is exercising choice and another lot is having difficulty; and I did not quite understand what the third lot were doing. He then went on to suggest that to help the people who are having difficulties, we remove from them their right of choice. I just find that a quaint way of arguing. I am not quite sure whether 1984 has gone past us. I cannot accept that as an argument. That is what is happening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Calvert said that that is an appropriate thing to do and that there is this massive fraud out there. But I remind Senator Calvert that this Government has cracked down significantly on social security fraud, and I have acknowledged that. It is paying less out of gross domestic product on social security payments than even the Fraser Government. It is targeting its welfare payments more strictly. In large measure that sort of move is supported although there are major problems with targeting. There are major problems in terms of building new poverty traps, and that is one of the significant areas that continue to occur in the provision of social security support. On the question of the unemployment benefit amendment, I am still in the dark about how a person's employment prospects will be determined-and even by whom. Presumably it will be done by somebody in the local Department of Social Security office. </PARA>
<PARA> Is the Government going to take into account figures such as job growth? Will the Department be in a position to determine from people who, on the surface, might be appearing to be moving to somewhere that does not suit their qualifications? Will prospects be determined by way of someone's experience and qualifications? If so, I would put the case that that would be unfair. If someone has been unemployed for a time and has always previously worked in one particular industry, using one set of qualifications, and has not been able to find another job, surely it is likely that that person might look at a career change. The reason for moving might be that the person has got wind of job growth in a specific area in which he has not worked before, but which he wants to have a crack at. What happens to this person? Does he have to plead his case?</PARA>
<PARA>Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O14">Senator POWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was asking the Minister for clarification of the clauses regarding the withdrawal of the unemployment benefit if beneficiaries move without sufficient reason to an area where their employment prospects are reduced. I really do not believe that the Committee has had clarification of the sorts of criteria that will be used and how an individual will be able to establish what is or is not sufficient reason. Certainly, these clauses establish that sufficient reason would be an unemployment beneficiary moving to an area in which a family member is living-that will certainly be approved of by this legislation. But that seems to be the only sufficient reason. We are asking: What will be sufficient reasons? How will the beneficiary establish those reasons and will this be like an increasing number of provisions in social security legislation where, in essence, the beneficiary is considered guilty until he or she proves his or her innocence? In other words, when a person moves, the Department of Social Security says, `Sorry, you have reduced your employment prospects', and the beneficiary then has to prove that he has not reduced his employment prospects and that he has sufficient reason to move. That is the sort of scenario that I can see.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Government expects the Australian Democrats not to oppose these clauses, as we are saying that we wish to do, it certainly has to come up with more clarification than that. I have certainly not seen anywhere on the public record, in the Minister's second reading speech, in the explanatory memorandum, or in the detail of the legislation, the answers to any of those questions. Not only do the Democrats need some glimmer of information about how these new provisions will be implemented, but also I certainly believe that the people of Australia need some information, particularly as it is highly likely that there will be more unemployed people next year than there are this year. </PARA>
<PARA> So I am asking the Minister whether he can possibly clarify for us what sort of arrangements are in place or might be put in place on this matter. As I said, it might be that unemployed persons have an idea in their minds that a certain move will improve their employment prospects. They might be prepared to make a major career change in their life-a change in the direction of their employment. Yet, on the surface, on some sort of statistical analysis, about which we know nothing yet, the Department might determine that these people had reduced their employment prospects. I would just like to hear from the Government something about how this will work. </PARA>

I made the point earlier that the legislation will be applied only where there is clear evidence of a substantial reduction in employment prospects. It will not be applied in marginal circumstances. To that extent, the advice and assistance of the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) will be the most important benchmark for deciding whether someone qualifies within these guidelines. I say quite strongly in terms of the point I made earlier that the Government's policies in this area are geared very much towards creating employment opportunities and, tied in with that, training and education programs. To that extent, the advice of the CES will obviously be taken into account as regards the particular person that Senator Powell talked about, as well as the area to which that person goes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (3) Page 11, clause 28, proposed subsection 43a (1), line 38, before ``period of at least 8 weeks'', insert ``continuous''. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) Page 12, clause 28, proposed subsection 43a (2), line 13, before ``period of at least 8 weeks'', insert ``continuous''. </PARA>
<PARA>These amendments seek simply to clarify within clause 28 of the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1989 the period of time in which certain provisions of proposed new section 43a (1) will apply. The Bill reads:</PARA>
<PARA> This section applies where, for a period of at least 8 weeks, 2 people of opposite sexes who are not legally married to each other have shared a residence . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Then a number of other criteria follow. That occurs again in proposed section 43a (2) which is the subject of our amendment No. 4. In the context of this legislation I remind the Committee that the Australian Democrats would prefer not to be dealing with this clause of the legislation by amendment but would rather have seen it sent off to a committee for proper consultation and consideration. But we do have the clause before us and it is important that the period of time involved should have to be continuous. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems we have with this clause of the Bill dealing with marriage-like relationships is that it takes little or no account of the lifestyles of people on low incomes-in particular, people on pensionor benefit and, most specifically, people on a pension bringing up children alone. For many people a feature of that lifestyle is living with a group of people, for obvious reasons-communal support, emotional support, simple physical support and general companionship as well as a sharing of costs on the very minimal incomes on which these people have to survive. The lifestyle of groups often means that people tend to move from one place to another. Very often these people are on long waiting lists for public housing and, if they cannot get into public housing, are at the mercy of private landlords. That often means that they must move from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> Without the insertion of the word `continuous' it is possible that some people might come under the provisions-I repeat that they are odious provisions-of this legislation in a sense by accident and unjustly. Over some period of eight weeks, which is all that is prescribed here in the legislation, they might happen to have lived with another person of the opposite sex just by virtue of the sort of lifestyle that they are leading but it might not have been for a continuous period. I believe that the Government's intention with this legislation is that it should be a continuous period. Should the Government not support these two simple amendments I will be quite amazed. </PARA>
<PARA> While we are on this clause of the Bill I also note that it talks about the eight-week period of co-residence between two people of opposite sexes and then applies a range of other criteria. Further on the criteria include the question of whether or not there is a sexual relationship between these people. That is one of the criteria that come into play in this clause. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has expressed its concern that having regard to sexual relationships between a couple to determine whether the people are living in a marriage-like relationship or to determine de facto spouses may intrude upon personal privacy. We share that concern. I reiterate a point that I made in the second reading debate-that the bottom line, if you like, of determination that a person should not qualify for a sole parent pension ought to be financial support available in a relationship. That would mean that any sexual relationship or, indeed, some of the other criteria in this legislation, would be irrelevant. However, these amendments are moved on the basis that we believe that this is the Government's intention and therefore we believe that it ought to be in the legislation. There are enough grey areas in this social security Act as it is and we do not believe that we should be putting more in at this particular stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too am aware of the concern in the community about this matter of the definition of `de facto relationship'. I am also aware that the Government's attempt to define this de facto relationship has caused a certain amount of concern amongst some sectors of the community. We in the Opposition have received numerous representations from welfare groups and sole parent associations. No doubt the Government has also received these representations, in particular from the Australian Council of Social Service, the Women's Electoral Lobby and the National Women's Consultative Council, which have criticised the scheme. Their major concerns of course include the continuing confusion over the definition as it appears in a range of State and Federal legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation seeks to provide a series of very specific guidelines that determine whether a bona fide domestic relationship exists. As Senator Powell pointed out, this could affect all pensioners and beneficiaries, including age pensioners. The Secretary, through this legislation, will have regard to a number of matters upon which he can base his decision. These include financial aspects, the nature of the household, social aspects of the relationship, any sexual relationship and the nature of the people's commitment to each other. One would have to admit that this legislation could be seen by age pensioners as yet another example of government interference. It could thus be regarded as a gross invasion of their privacy. I concede also that almost any attempt to tighten up areas of potential abuse would also meet with criticism. </PARA>
<PARA> The issues raised are of legitimate concern. We support the Government's intention to tighten up an area of the social security system, which there is clear evidence to suggest is being abused. The Opposition has no wish to disadvantage people who are not breaking the rules. We will therefore be seeking assurances, as I said earlier, from the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) that the appeals mechanism will be fairly administered. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, we support the overall tightening of the welfare system and therefore this package of Bills, including these provisions that will ensure that people who are not married are not advantaged over those who are married. As I said in my opening remarks this afternoon, we have given an undertaking to monitor applications of these provisions and to ensure that they are administered fairly and equitably. When we attain government we will take any action to change that legislation if need be. For those reasons, the Opposition does not believe that the amendments make a significant difference to the operation of the Bill. Therefore, we will not support them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government also opposes the amendments. I wish to make two comments. We seem to be very much into this question of de facto relationships and now the social security system operates to handle them. We are not approaching this in a vacuum situation; we are approaching it from where there has been a definition through common law of what is and what is not relevant. In essence, it should be noted by Senator Powell and anyone else entering this debate that we are not operating in this vacuum situation. The Government's provisions do essentially two things. First, we codify procedures and the relevance of all sorts of considerations. In doing so, we obviously give more certainty to the existing structure of the law. Secondly, in doing so, we are in some areas providing more rights to individuals. For instance, the existing provisions permit the compulsory overriding of common law privileges. The new provisions do not do that. In terms of the whole area, I mention these two points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the two amendments that Senator Powell has moved, amendments Nos. 3 and 4, she is insisting on the insertion of the word `continuous' in the proposed sections 43a (1) and (2). Her intention may be appropriate, but the amendments do not take into account the degree of uncertainty or the effect on temporary absence in the relevant period. For that reason, we maintain objection to the insertion of the word `continuous'. The Bill, as it now stands, provides a degree of flexibility and does not incur the crabs that would be incurred by the insertion of the word `continuous'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the Minister's last comment, he referred to temporary absences as the reason that the Government would not want to insert the word `continuous'. That brings me to question what the Government really means by `shared residence'. Clearly, there must be a definition which would allow for temporary residence. If people are actually living together or sharing a residence and one goes away for a day or two, presumably they are still sharing the residence. The criteria for sharing must have something to do with things such as paying the rent, and indeed, with many of the aspects of the provisions of this clause of the Bill. Given that that is the case, surely that is covered. We are seeking to make sure that consideration is given to a genuine break-up of sharing for one reason or another. A couple might share accommodation for a month, and then one might move for a range of reasons and come back for another month later on. They would presumably come under this provision unless we inserted the word `continuous'. I would like some clarification on that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The provision very clearly says that we are talking about `a period'. I think that Senator Powell can understand what that means. Her amendments raise one side of the argument. We are talking about deviations from such a period by temporary absences.

<PARA> (5) Page 12, clause 28, proposed subparagraph 43a (1) (d) (ii), line 9, leave out ``$1000'', insert ``$10,000''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment relates to people who have joint assets of a total value of more than $4,000 or joint liabilities totalling more than $1,000. The Australian Democrats seek to remove what we see as outright discrimination against those people with the least money. We want to change the joint liabilities total to $10,000. It seems to us that the Government is discriminating against people who have to club together in order to make purchases, to cover rental bonds or to meet other day to day living expenses. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that, when the original legislation was introduced into the House of Representatives, the joint assets and joint liabilities figures which brought people under the ambit of these provisions both were $1,000. The pressure from interested community groups resulted in the Government raising the joint assets level to $4,000. Clearly, joint assets of $1,000 would have provided a trigger in respect of an enormous number of people in a simple shared residence situation. This has nothing to do with a de facto or any other kind of dependent relationship. Many household items cost hundreds of dollars, some thousands of dollars. People need such items if they are to live reasonably. In the early stages of the debate on this legislation, the cost of a refrigerator was the example most commonly used. Anything in addition to the smallest appliances will quickly bring up to total value of the shared assets to $4,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The same applies in the liabilities area. The people who have the least cash, the least ready money, who have to club together and therefore have joint liabilities, particularly-while I do not condone or encourage it-in these days of increasing use of credit, are making purchases on credit. It seems to us that leaving the joint liabilities provisions at $1,000 discriminates against those people who do not have ready cash and who can club together with the people with whom they share accommodation, to purchase household items. Do not forget that they share for a range of necessary reasons, including social and moral support. There is an advantage in being able to club together to get some decent things, and sometimes some very essential things, to enable them to lead some sort of reasonable life. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us also not forget that we are talking about households, including children. I do not think any of us would want to see a household with children which did not have adequate refrigeration or heating facilities or which was not able to provide furniture to sit on. I think honourable senators would prefer that these people had some kind of rudimentary floor coverings on which to walk and so on. The smallest power vacuum cleaner that I have been able to cost latterly-it really is a pretty pathetic vacuum cleaner-was priced at about $120. Three years ago I bought the same kind of appliance for about $80. If these people have floor coverings they will need something to clean them with. If people club together and buy a few of those things, pretty soon they will have spent $1,000. We suggest, by this amendment, that the joint liabilities figure in this legislation be raised to $10,000. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just wish to make two very quick points. The first point, which was overlooked by Senator Powell, is that we are talking about joint assets and joint liabilities. The liabilities or assets of members of a collective are shared assets. There is a very clear distinction at law between shared assets and joint assets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point I refer to is the raising of that level to $10,000. Senator Powell obviously knows the ultimate effect of that sort of provision, as I think she knows about the ultimate effect of other provisions that follow in the amendments that she proposes. That, basically, is to render useless the policy that the Government is attempting in this area. I make the point again, that we are not coming into this area in a vacuum; we are coming into this area with common law, with a fair degree of certainty, but with a fair degree of inequity in terms of interpretation of the law overriding the existing protections and privacies. For the honesty and completeness of this debate, I would wish that at least that context was recognised. </PARA>

<PARA> (6) Page 12, clause 28, proposed paragraph 43a (1) (f), lines 11 and 12, leave out ``with each other'', insert ``or residences with each other for a period or periods totalling not less than 12 months during the preceding 2 years''. </PARA>
<PARA>In moving this amendment, we have a similar concern to that which we had in moving amendment No. 4. The amendment is to proposed paragraph 43a (1) (f). We wish to clarify the situation in which claimants will be deemed to have been living together by inserting the words `or residences with each other for a period or periods totalling not less than 12 months during the preceding 2 years'. We believe that the proposed paragraph in its present form would be not only unfair in a number of cases but also a waste of departmental resources in circumstances where there is very little likelihood of there being a de facto relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> This concern applies in a number of areas in the legislation. As we go through the clauses, quite often we wonder where the economies will arise because clearly there are many administrative pitfalls in the legislation. It seems to us that this proposed paragraph, in which the period of residence is not clearly established, is one of them. In order to clarify that, we think this amendment needs to be inserted in the legislation. As the legislation stands now it concerns the simple sharing of a residence. We think that for the Department to take this issue into account, for it to be part of a genuine or likely de facto relationship, a period of time ought to be specified in the legislation. We are suggesting 12 months over the period of the previous two years as a reasonable approach, given that this is one of a set of criteria after which a final decision will be made by the Secretary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Powell pointed out, this amendment is similar to the one before it. I did not speak on that amendment, but I make the general comment that whilst the Opposition is not supporting the Bill we are certainly not opposing it. We believe that these new regulations should be put in place. We will continue to monitor them in opposition and in government. We believe that the legislation should be passed as quickly as possible to allow this to happen.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government also opposes the proposed amendment. It would introduce a fair degree of rigidity for which there is no real basis. It would complicate the process involved for all sole parent pensioners and ultimately would limit the capacity of the Department to ensure integrity in the process. I do agree with Senator Powell on one point and that was the last one. What we are talking about here is not a condition precedent to the benefit or pension being paid. We are talking of one of a range of indicators. All of those indicators will be looked at in forming the ultimate picture, as happens currently in the common law.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O14">Senator POWELL</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(8.47)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister's point about these being a set of indicators is absolutely right and is accepted by us. It is on that basis that we want those indicators to be as clear as possible. I find it interesting that the Minister pleads rigidity in opposing this amendment when, indeed, one of the major concerns about this whole clause is its rigidity and the fact that even with that rigidity there is, in the end, a final decision to be made beyond the provisions of the legislation. Neither the indicia in proposed section 43a nor the following criteria are exhaustive, nor should they be. That is one of the reasons why we would prefer, as I said, along with the Australian Council of Social Service and the National Women's Consultative Council, that this issue not be legislated on, at least until there has been far more widespread discussion about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We maintain the view that this provision is too broad and open. It is part of a series of indicators. In regard to the case we just dealt with, concerning the figure of assets, if the Government did not want to be rigid why did it not say `substantial' shared assets or `substantial' shared liabilities? That would have been unrigid, just as this provision is. We believe that there ought to be some reasonable provision in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to Senator Calvert's response, not just in respect of this amendment but in respect of a number of others. He will recall that the Australian Democrats supported the Opposition's second reading amendment, which condemned the Government for not changing direction in social security policy. It seems to me that throughout this exercise the Opposition is finding excuses-struggling to find them, in some cases-to support the Government. There has been constant reference to, `We will do something about it if it is a problem when we are in government'. It seems pretty silly to me for a potential future government to go to the community and say, `We can do a better job', when it is putting in place a piece of legislation which will clearly create problems and which will clearly set a disturbing precedent. Then it says, `We will clear it up later'. </PARA>
<PARA> We are already doing that with another piece of social security legislation with the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The Committee is examining sections 246 and 162 of the Social Security Act with regard to debt recovery and information gathering as contained in that Act. These provisions were put in, I think, in 1987 when the Australian Democrats attempted to draw the attention of the Parliament to the fact that the provisions would create problems. The provisions are now before the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee and this will require the Committee to have public hearings tomorrow night as we have been doing for several months. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that it is always more efficient if there are alarm bells ringing, for then a government or an alternative government-if that is what the Opposition is-will be able to take steps at the appropriate time. In the case of the social security legislation in particular it has provisions which will clearly cause distress in the lives of people in the community, and again in the case of social security legislation, the most disadvantaged people in the community. The problem with these provisions in this section, of which this amendment is one, is really that it limits the choices of, in particular, women. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are very concerned about is that the savings which the Government imagines it will get from these provisions will be made at the expense of women and their children staying in households, in family situations, in which they might even be at physical risk, because they fear that if they break away and seek some kind of joint living arrangement for a range of reasons-economic, emotional, social and other reasons-they will be at risk of losing the very minimal income support which they might otherwise have expected from the Government. Therefore, we would like to see more rigidity in this particular clause of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> (9) Page 12, clause 28, proposed subparagraph 43a (3) (a) (ii), line 28, leave out ``information that might be relevant'', insert ``information that is relevant''. </PARA>
<PARA> (10) Page 12, clause 28, proposed paragraph 43a (3) (b), line 32, leave out ``pensioner's pension will'', insert ``pensioner's pension may''. </PARA>
<PARA> (11) Page 13, clause 28, proposed subparagraph 43a (4) (a) (ii), line 3, leave out ``information that might be relevant'', insert ``information that is relevant''. </PARA>
<PARA>These particular parts of clause 28 of the Bill refer to the information that a pensioner or applicant needs to provide to the Secretary to the Department in order to qualify. Our concern about this relates to the way that it is put in the legislation. One of the provisions deals with information that might be relevant to the question of whether the pensioner is a de facto spouse, et cetera. Another refers to the fact that if information is not given to the Secretary within 14 days the pensioner's pension will be suspended. Again, there is another provision which talks about information which might be relevant. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that we should change those words to the form that we have set out in the amendment. We want to take out the term, `information that might be relevant', as that will be a subjective decision on behalf of the Secretary. In cases being dealt with, that will be the delegate of the Secretary in the Department office. Again, I suppose we want to be more rigid. We want to say, `information that is relevant'. It is clearly relevant. We believe also that the provision should provide for some discretion with regard to what then happens. The provision should read that the pensioner's pension may be suspended in the case that would arise, rather than that the pensioner's pension will be suspended, because all the decisions are made finally not by the provisions of the legislation, which are only indicators, but by officials in the departmental office. In that case we would prefer to leave in that point of discretion. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that the provision of information that might be relevant is part of the process in this part of the legislation which leaves the pension applicant very much open, in the end, to having to prove eligibility, as opposed to having the Department prove non-eligibility. Our amendment No. 10 would clarify the situation and enable discretion to be exercised with respect to whether a pension is suspended. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Briefly, I will rebut a couple of the remarks made by Senator Powell. Obviously I gave the wrong impression as she believes us to have said that we will look at these things when we get into government. I did say that the Opposition would monitor the changes and when in government may decide to change them. I cannot understand Senator Powell's criticising our approach, because we are not opposing these Bills. Basically, we believe there is a need for tightening the welfare system. That is part of our platform. This package of Bills provides such measures. We would hope they would not advantage those people who are not married over those who are. Senator Powell herself almost congratulated the Government on its efforts in tightening up some aspects of social security, so I find it rather difficult to see which way she is thinking about the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to amendment No. 9 and establishing the relevancy of documents, I would like to know, if the Department does not have the power to get extra information, how the devil it will know whether the information is relevant. Amendment No. 10 deals with the clause in respect of suspension of the pension if the information is not provided within 14 days. I believe 14 days is a reasonable amount of time. We take the same position on amendment No. 11 as we do on amendment No. 9. We need to be able to gain information before we can find out whether it is relevant. The amendments proposed by Senator Powell will not improve the Bill in any way, so we will not support them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have the distinct impression that this matter-which was so important and needed to be dealt with in such a hurry that the Minister for Consumer Affairs had to incorporate his response to the second reading debate-is about to be interrupted by an important debate on procedures of the Senate which, I am sure, will not grip those people who cannot afford to send their kids on school excursions. If consideration of the matter is not to be adjourned, I would like to comment on Senator Calvert's statement that 14 days is a perfectly reasonable time in which to supply information before a person's pension is cut off. Let us not forget that this person-a woman in 87 per cent of cases-will be required to supply information about another person with whom she shares, or has shared, accommodation. If she is not in an intimate personal relationship with that person, it might take a little time for her to persuade that person to give her that personal information about himself-he does have to be a member of the opposite sex. Those are the sorts of concerns that we have about this provision in amendment No. 8 being so rigid.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So far I have been extremely soft on Senator Powell and the sorts of contributions she has made in this debate. I have not dwelt on the fact that she comes into this debate full of purity, irrelevance, and lack of recognition of the parameters on which we are operating. She comes here waving a white flag and claiming to have total honesty and the only sincerity in the whole debate. What we are talking about here is an existing situation. If Senator Powell knew anything about these provisions she would give total recognition to that. She would give recognition to the fact that what we are talking about in terms of 14-day time periods already applies in other parts of the Bill in respect of other pensions and benefits. She gave no recognition at all to that. She gave no recognition to the fact that what we are introducing by way of legislation that she is trying to attack in this provision is already in place under common law; it is not coming out of the blue. She should also give recognition to the fact that the obligations to provide information that she wishes to limit apply in other parts of the legislation in respect of other pensions and benefits. It is part of overall strata. It is something that really has not wreaked havoc and devastation on the sorts of people that she is talking about. Let us have some honest context in this debate and let us accept Senator Powell's amendment to this clause for what it really is-grandstanding.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Select Committee on Legislation Procedures, in its report which was presented on 1 December 1988, recommended a number of changes to Senate procedures to facilitate the reference of Bills to committees and the consideration of Bills by the Senate and committees. I indicate to the Senate that I intend to move a series of motions to give effect to the recommendations of the Committee, on the understanding that the motions may be voted on separately or in groups if the Senate so wishes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The motions I am about to move have been framed so that the orders giving effect to the recommendations of the Legislation Procedures Committee will operate as continuing orders, with effect from the first sitting day in 1990, until the Senate alters them, and will be compatible with the new Standing Orders, which also come into effect on the first sitting day in 1990. It is not suggested at this stage that the proposed changes to procedures be written into the new Standing Orders, but that they operate as continuing orders alongside the Standing Orders, so that the Senate can try them out, and decide at a future time whether to put them into the new Standing Orders. I now move the motions as circulated:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Reference of bills to committees</PARA>
<PARA>That recommendations 1 (a) to (e) and the proposed order and consequential amendments to sessional orders in Appendix 4 be adopted. </PARA>

<PARA>That recommendation 7 and the proposed order in Appendix 10 be adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> (8) Quorum of the Senate</PARA>
<PARA>That the Senate supports in principle recommendation 8, that the quorum of the Senate be reduced from one third to one quarter of Senators. </PARA>
<PARA> (9) Operation of orders (1) to (7)</PARA>
<PARA>That the orders adopted by resolutions (1) to (7) come into effect on the first day of sitting in 1990 and operate as continuing orders of the Senate, and that the amendments of sessional orders so adopted come into effect on that day as orders modifying the operation of the standing orders. </PARA>
<PARA>Summary of recommendations</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1 (a) More bills than at present be referred to committees. </PARA>
<PARA> 1 (b) A Selection of Bills Committee be constituted to make recommendations to the Senate as to which bills should be referred to committees. </PARA>
<PARA> 1 (c) The Selection of Bills Committee be: The Government Whip and two Deputy Government Whips, the Opposition Whip and the Deputy Opposition Whip, the National Party Whip and the Australian Democrat Whip. </PARA>
<PARA> 1 (d) Unless the Selection of Bills Committee has no report to present, it report its recommendations relating to bills to be referred to committees at an appropriate time each sitting day. </PARA>
<PARA> 1 (e) A total time limit of 30 minutes and 5 minutes for each speaker apply for debate on a report of the Selection of Bills Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> 2 The same time limits as outlined in recommendation 1 (e) apply to other motions and amendments to refer bills to committees. </PARA>
<PARA> 3 Subject to any change in the pattern of the sittings of the Senate, and subject to appropriate adjustments of broadcasting arrangements, Wednesday of each sitting week be set aside for committee meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> 4 (a) In relation to a bill received from the House of Representatives, when no Senator indicates to the Chair, either in writing before the second reading of the bill is called on or orally at that time, that the Senator requires to debate the bill, the motion for the second reading of that bill be put without debate. </PARA>
<PARA> 4 (b) When the motion for the second reading of a bill is put without debate, a time limited of 5 minutes be imposed on any third reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA> 5 Debate on appropriation bills in the committee of the whole be confined to matters referred to in Estimates Committee reports for further examination. </PARA>
<PARA> 6 Estimates Committees be given the power to recommend the approval by the Senate of proposed expenditure, with or without amendments or requests. </PARA>
<PARA> 7 The Senate adopt the sessional order proposed by the Procedure Committee that debate on motions for the suspension of standing orders be limited to 30 minutes and the time allowed for each speaker on the motions be limited to 5 minutes. </PARA>
<PARA> 8 The quorum of the Senate be reduced from one third to one quarter of the Senators. </PARA>
<PARA>Attached as Appendices 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 are proposed new sessional orders and amendments to existing sessional orders to give effect to the Committee's recommendations. The Committee recommends that the Senate adopt these sessional orders and amendments. The only recommendation not given effect by them is recommendation 8, relating to the quorum of the Senate, which requires legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak fairly briefly to this report. I think it is a matter on which most senators have made up their minds and I do not think there is anything to be gained by prolonged debate. It is important that the Senate should show willingness to vote and decide on these matters rather than merely deferring them. As far as the Opposition is concerned, it will be a free vote. Nevertheless, many views have been expressed by Opposition members and it is hoped that generally the recommendations will have the support of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to run very briefly through these recommendations to explain what the Select Committee on Legislation Procedures was about. The first, and perhaps the key, recommendation was that more Bills should be referred to committees than at present. I think that is crucial. The Senate passes something like 180 Bills a year, and in the past only two or three, on average, have been referred to committees. I think it is almost a universal opinion in the Senate that the Bills which have been considered by committees have been substantially improved by the process of pointing out defects that have not been considered by the drafters or raising issues that the Senate should have considered before it passed the Bill. The Committee did look, having decided that more Bills should go to committees, at how it should be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> We did not seriously consider adopting in our Senate, the New Zealand system where all Bills are referred to committees. In my view it is not very effective in New Zealand because it has only a single house of parliament controlled by the government and the committees are ultimately the servants of the government. Nevertheless, in their system all Bills go to committees. We did not think that that would be acceptable to the Senate or workable if it were proposed. We had to suggest a method by which the Bills which should be referred to committees were to be selected. The committee that looked at which Bills should be selected should also recommend at what stage in the process the Bills should be referred, to what committee they should go and when the nominated committee should report by. The committee suitable for this purpose, which meets daily, is the Whips Committee; it represents the balance of power in the Senate. Our Committee decided that the Whips Committee should act as the Selection of Bills Committee and do the job of recommending to the Senate, at a routine time each day, any Bills that should be referred to a committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand there will be an amendment moved by my colleague, Senator Watson, to modify slightly the recommendations of the committee. As it stands, the Selection of Bills Committee had to recommend one of the standing committees as the committee to consider a Bill. Senator Watson made the point, which to me seems valid, that certain highly specialised Bills might not be appropriately dealt with by a standing committee and that it might be desirable to have a select committee established for the purpose and to build in flexibility to that end. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be another minor amendment proposed by the Opposition's Whip, Senator Reid, about the Selection of Bills Committee. As the recommendation is worded, it makes an outrageous assumption that we are going to be in opposition forever. I do not think anyone on either side of the chamber would think that is a possibility. The wording is made more neutral to eliminate the apparent wish, or apparent view, that we might be in opposition for a prolonged period. It is only a minor terminological change. I understand that Senator Reid will be moving an amendment to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems put to the Committee when we were discussing these issues was that there could be prolonged turmoil every day when the Selection of Bills Committee report was received by the Senate. It was suggested that this would be futile because the Whips Committee represents the balance of power in the Senate and the result would be known before the debate took place. I do not think it very likely that such debate would take place. But if it did, to overcome the problem of prolonged debate the recommendation of the Committee was that such debate should be limited to not more than 30 minutes, with no speaker speaking for more than five minutes. This overcomes a particular problem that was put to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> That was the main recommendation and one resultant problem did arise. If we are going to refer Bills to committees they have to be able to consider them reasonably promptly. It is notoriously difficult to get senators to gather together during a non-sitting week during a session. It just cannot be achieved. Senators have commitments back in their electorates and it is not practical to get them to come to Canberra to consider Bills. Therefore, we suggest that Wednesday of each sitting week should be the day on which committees should meet. If they have Bills referred to them, they should deal with them. If they have no Bills referred to them they can then deal with the many other references that they have in their general purpose function. Other parliaments allocate special days for committees quite frequently. </PARA>
<PARA> We think that, at the very least, the Senate should try it out. I think it is a necessary corollary of referring Bills to committees to ensure that they will be dealt with in a timely fashion. One minor amendment will be necessary. As everyone knows, Wednesday is one of our broadcast days. It is a particularly unsuitable day to be broadcasting, by the way, because the Senate adjourns at 7.30; it is a short sitting day. There would need to be some negotiations with the committee and with the House of Representatives to change the pattern of broadcast days, but I cannot believe that that will result in any problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee, having proposed what would be an extra time commitment for the Senate, had to look at how we were going to meet it. In fact, we in this Parliament do not sit for many days. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which in fact, is an appendix to the Committee's report, showing the sitting days of various parliaments-the Australian, the Canadian and the United Kingdom parliaments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. To summarise the table very briefly: the Canadian Parliament sits, on average, for 167 days; the United Kingdom Parliament sits for almost the same time; the United States Congress sits for 170 days; and we sit for 84 days. When I was doing my soundings among my colleagues I found that there was no great enthusiasm for the Senate sitting for substantially more days. We in this Parliament know that there is great pressure on us to be in our electorates and not, as some people in our electorates view it, to be wasting our time in Canberra. It is interesting that that pressure does not really come from the electorates; it comes from the party organisations. Nevertheless, the pressure is there and it would be difficult for us, in the short term anyway, to reverse that process. I think in the long term the Senate will and should sit more but, in the short term, we had to suggest where one could save time in other areas of Senate procedures in order to increase the time available for committee consideration of Bills, and the remainder of our recommendations were devoted to that purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first recommendation was one which I do not think will save much time-that is, in non-controversial Bills, or in Bills received from the House of Representatives which it is accepted will go through, we could avoid another second reading debate. It has often seemed to me that, where there has been a substantial debate in the House of Representatives, it is almost pointless for us to repeat the same sentiments in this chamber. It is not all that easy, as there is one party-the Australian Democrats-which is not represented, at the moment anyway, in the House of Representatives, and there are Independent senators, so it will not always be appropriate. Nevertheless, there is a suggestion to improve the machinery whereby second reading debates could be omitted, but I do not believe that that will save a great deal of time. </PARA>
<PARA> Where there could be a serious attempt to save time is in the consideration of Appropriation Bills in the Committee of the Whole. When the Estimates committees were set up in 1970 it was clearly said by the coalition government in the tabling statement at the time that it was expected that debate in the Committee of the Whole would be on the report of the committee. That has not been achieved. When the Estimates committees were established there was a sharp drop in the time taken in the debate in the Committee of the Whole. This has gone up-erratically, but it has gone up-and this year we spent 33 hours in Committee of the Whole debate on the Estimates, which is the longest time spent by this chamber since Estimates committees were introduced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And Senator Walters was not even here, as Senator Puplick has just said. Had Senator Walters been here it might have taken rather longer. But the point is that we spent a great deal of time discussing things that should have been dealt with in the Estimates committees. The Senate sets up Estimates committees to examine the Estimates on its behalf. They cross-examine departmental officers and, in my view and in the view of the Committee, we should then consider their report back to the Committee of the Whole. They should say, `We recommend' or in extreme circumstances `We do not recommend the passing of the Estimates which have been given to us to examine, but we would like to draw the Senate's attention to a number of matters that the Senate might like to discuss where there are some questions about the desirability or efficiency of the Estimates'. The debate would be on the motion of the chairman of the committee that the Estimates they have been given be approved and the debate would be on the subject matter, including dissenting reports, contained in the committee report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no doubt at all that that would limit what currently goes on in the Committee of the Whole. Some senators use the Committee of the Whole to try to extract primary information, which I do not think is an appropriate purpose of the Committee of the Whole. The Estimates committees, which individual senators have the right to attend, if they can spare the time-or, alternatively, they may be able to give other senators questions to ask on their behalf-are the appropriate place to do that. There is no doubt at all, because we are trying to save time, that some of the activities that now take place in the Committee of the Whole would not be practicable under the revised arrangements. It is for the Senate to decide whether the time we spend-33 hours this year in the Committee of the Whole debate-is wise expenditure of the Senate's time; if not, it is for the Senate to decide how we ration the time. The Committee has made what I think is a sensible decision. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not as though, if a senator cannot get an answer in an Estimates committee, that that is the end of the matter. There are many other ways in which to get information. For instance, a senator can speak, if he or she wishes to raise an issue, in the second reading debate on the Estimates. A senator can ask a question without notice or put a question on notice. A senator can write a letter to the Minister or make a request under freedom of information. There are many ways in which a senator can establish information if he or she wishes to, though I do admit that the intention of the Committee in making this recommendation was to reduce the time that the Senate was going to spend in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The final two matters in the report did not originate with the Committee; they were put there for completeness. The first is the question of limiting debates on suspension of Standing Orders to 30 minutes, with each speaker being allowed to speak for not more than five minutes. I had a look through the records of the last four years of the debates on suspension of Standing Orders. If they are going to be suspended, there is virtually no debate. It is only when it is known that they will not be suspended that people wish to have a debate. The Committee felt that 30 minutes was long enough for what in fact is a political protest. In the end, it is for the Senate to decide how it wishes to spend its time. If the Senate wants to spend its time in different ways it has to adjust its procedures, and this was one of the ways in which it was suggested that we might adjust our procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> The final suggestion was on the quorum. I do not think that would save any time at all. The quorum for the Senate is laid down in the Constitution as being one-third of the senators. The House of Representatives changed its quorum to one-fifth. The recommendation of the Committee was to change the quorum to one-quarter. Effectively at present, 26 senators represent a quorum of one-third, which would be reduced to 19 senators with a quorum of one-quarter. The only argument I know in favour of this is that it will relieve Ministers of the responsibility of assisting to provide the quorum. Traditionally, the Government has to keep the quorum in the chamber, and the Government can expect to have only 33 senators perhaps 34 senators. If 26 senators are required for a quorum, there is no way that Ministers can be excused. If the quorum were reduced to 19, it would be practicable to excuse some or all of the Ministers from answering the call for a quorum. The Senate has to make up its mind whether that is desirable or not. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw these matters to the Senate's attention. As might be obvious, I think the recommendations are appropriate and sensible. They may not be perfect. This is not an immutable recommendation. If experience shows that it needs changing, the Senate should be prepared to change. One of the things I have found most difficult in the Senate-it is most distressing really-is the very great difficulty that the Senate has in making up its mind on these matters. We do not get around to making simple decisions on simple matters. This is something we should try; if experience shows that changes are necessary, let us make the changes. Let us at least try a system which has--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4H4">Senator HAMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the honourable senator came in, I said that on the Opposition benches there is a free vote on this issue. Honourable senators will make up their minds, and of course in the Senate the majority decides, as the majority should. This is a particularly appropriate moment for the Senate to address this problem because nobody knows who the government will be next year. So both the Government and the Opposition have to look at the interests of both government and opposition and see that they are fairly treated; therefore honourable senators are looking at things as impartially as they can. I accept the particular problems of Independent senators, who have both rights and difficulties in this chamber. I am sure that Senator Harradine will be putting his points in due course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other thing that makes this a good moment is that we have just had the longest Estimates debate in the Committee of the Whole since the Estimates committees were set up. We have to consider whether that is a sensible use of the available time of the Senate. I recommend these motions. I do not contend that they are perfect; they are an attempt to solve serious problems in the Senate and they are worthy of a trial by this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are three matters I wish to raise in the debate tonight. The third requires, in my view, an amendment to motion No. 1 and I will be moving that in due course. First, I would like to congratulate my colleague Senator Hamer, as Chairman of Committees, for the amount of time he has spent on revising the legislation procedures. It is not just a matter of hours or days or weeks; he actually spent months trying to get this right with his fellow senators. While not all honourable senators will agree with the detail that has been presented to the Senate tonight, I certainly think the recommended procedures are an improvement on what we already have in an effort to expedite the work and the effectiveness of this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second matter I raise was also raised by Senator Hamer and it is a matter which I debated with him; that is, that it is desirable to try to reduce the amount of debating time in committee during the debate on the appropriations. A number of the questions and also much of the comment could quite easily and more effectively be included in the Senate Estimates committee Hansards. I think that would be a more effective medium in which those comments could be made. However, I do not wish to exclude such comments entirely from the committee stage of the debate in this chamber. This recommendation does not require an amendment, nor do I think it would be appropriate for material to be included in the Hansard without the general consent of a majority of committee members. I ask that honourable senators consider this suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA> The third matter was also raised by Senator Hamer. He gave forward notice of my intention to move an amendment to motion No. 1. We do have a number of standing committees in this Parliament. It may be that because of the technical or special features of a Bill the committee which is deemed appropriate may not necessarily have a general expertise or interest in the subject. Therefore there would be circumstances where a Bill should be referred instead to a select committee. I therefore move:</PARA>
<PARA> Motion (1), at the end of motion, add</PARA>
<PARA>``, subject to the following amendment of the order: after paragraph (11), insert the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> `(11a) Where:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the Selection of Bills Committee recommends that a bill be referred to a select committee; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a Senator indicates that the Senator intends to move to establish a select committee to consider a bill or to refer a bill to an existing select committee,</PARA>
<PARA>this order shall have effect as if each reference to a standing committee included reference to a select committee.'.''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report of the Senate Select Committee on Legislation Procedures was first debated in the Senate near the beginning of this sitting period, I think on 16 August. On that day I spoke on the motion to take note of the report but was cut off at the lunch break before I had finished my remarks. I want to complete some general remarks that I was in the process of making on that occasion and also to move an amendment to one of the motions that have been put forward. In the time that I had available to speak on the previous occasion I indicated my warm support for the Committee's recommendations about referring Bills to committees and setting up a Selection of Bills Committee for that purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I indicated the need for some caution about the number of Bills that ought to be referred to committees, pointed to the history of the Senate over the last 18 years in developing the experience of referring Bills to committees, and indicated my view that I did not think a great many more Bills should be referred to committees than has been the case in recent years, when the practice has grown quite considerably. If the Senate is going to adopt a different policy of referring a large number of Bills to committees, then we would really have to engage in a great restructuring of our procedures in the time that we spend in this chamber, and in the number of weeks that we spend in Canberra. I am addressing this question on the assumption that there will not be any major change to past procedures but that there will be a more satisfactory way of selecting Bills and a more orderly basis for doing so. The Senate has already made some very considerable progress in selecting Bills by the informal processes that we have adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> That relates to one of the first matters which I have difficulty with, recommendation No. 3, which proposes, subject to any change in the pattern of sittings in the Senate and subject to appropriate adjustments of the broadcasting arrangements, that Wednesday of each sitting week be set aside for committee hearings-that is, for committees dealing with Bills. That is subject to those two very major qualifications, and they could well and truly torpedo that idea. I think very grave difficulties will have to be overcome before those conditions can be satisfied. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to address some cautionary remarks about the principle of setting aside one of the days on which the Senate already sits to enable those committees that have Bills before them to devote that day to consideration of their work. As I said, the wisdom of that recommendation depends very much on the number of Bills that are referred to committees and the number of committees that will be sitting to consider Bills in any one week. Clearly if only one or two committees have Bills currently under consideration there would be an enormous waste of time in having other senators sitting around on one day every week and not progressing the other pressing work of the Senate. That would seem to me to be an absurdity. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the problem. Legislation is brought in at such a late hour and in such an inefficient program, despite the honourable senator's so-called management of this place. More and more legislation is being brought in at the end of a session.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Robert Ray interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is no good putting that line up; until recently the Government did not have any legislation to speak of here in this session. That was quite an unnecessary diversion. The Senate now has to sit for many weeks longer than the House of Representatives, and probably longer than it has done in the past, in order to cope with the volume of legislation the Government brings forward, a large amount of which no doubt could well be abandoned although the Government bores on with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also very unrealistic to believe that a committee will do its job on these odd days during sitting weeks. We would get two such days in a month to do the job. As Senator Hamer says, if it is desired to have these committees work efficiently, get on with the job and get a report in, they will not be able to do so by sitting on those odd days; they will have to do the job in non-sitting weeks. Otherwise, the reports will not be worth having. Furthermore, if the committees do their job and put down worthwhile reports, there will be more work for the Committee of the Whole. It is quite unrealistic to go on with these new proposals under the illusion that we, as a Senate, will not sit more often and for longer periods. I will not go to the wall about it but I do think that recommendation No. 3 is based on very unrealistic assumptions about what is likely to happen. It will not help the general disposal of business of the Senate, about which the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray) seems to have some complaints, but for which he as well may have some responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation No. 5 gives me the greatest concern and it is the only one I have proposed to amend. The recommendation provides that:</PARA>
<PARA> Debate on appropriation bills in committee on the whole be confined to matters referred to in Estimates Committee reports for further examination. </PARA>
<PARA>I understand that the real concern at the bottom of this recommendation is the fact that when the Committee of the Whole deals with Estimates committee reports, which we have just been through and which we go through twice a year, honourable senators ask a number of new questions; they start new lines of questioning in addition to the lines of questioning that have already occurred in the Estimates committee hearings. That may be due to the fact that senators may not have the opportunity of attending a particular Estimates committee hearing. That would apply particularly to Independent senators or senators from minor parties. I notice that Senator Harradine has put forward an amendment to cope with that problem. It certainly would be most unfair for a senator who had not been able to attend a hearing and who was not a member of the committee, and thereby would not be able to have the matter dealt with in the report of the committee, to be shut out from raising the matter during the Committee of the Whole. That certainly needs to be attended to. Senator Harradine has dealt with the proposal in a more narrow way than I have in my amendment. I certainly support at the very least Senator Harradine's amendment to the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I have some broader concerns about the rights of senators. I believe that senators should be able to raise matters which have been canvassed at an Estimates committee. My proposal would not enable senators to raise matters which they could have raised but did not raise at an Estimates committee meeting. But where an Estimates committee has elicited information, any senator, even if a member of the committee, should be entitled to comment on the information obtained at the committee meeting. I do not think that a right to make comment on the matters that have been dealt with in a committee or on information that has been obtained at a committee should be restricted in this way. The proposal of the Select Committee is very restrictive indeed. It restricts comment to only those matters that are contained in the report of a committee or to reservations attached to reports, presumably by other members of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA> One can overcome my concerns if one is a member of the committee or if Senator Harradine's amendment is carried, thus enabling senators who are not members of the committee to put down reservations. That would mean that a great deal more bureaucratic activity would have to be engaged in by senators in order to raise the matter in the Committee of the Whole. I think that is a very severe and unnecessary restriction of the rights of senators. I am certainly in sympathy with the idea that they should not be able to ask a whole lot more questions here. That is not the problem. Senators should be enabled to debate the issues that have been raised in the Estimates committees. In my view, matters that have arisen since the Estimates committee hearings should also be able to be raised in the Committee of the Whole when these reports are debated. A great deal of information today is delayed by departments. Their information is often not available when the Estimates committees report. Information is often presented after the report of an Estimates committee has been finalised and before the debate occurs in the Committee of the Whole. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of very severe restrictions in proposal No. 5 of the Committee. Certainly, there should be some amendments, at least to the extent that Senator Harradine has proposed and, I hope, somewhat along the lines that I have proposed in my amendment. Subject to those comments, I support the recommendations. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> Motion (5), at the end of motion, add ``, subject to the following amendment of the order:</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph (2), leave out all words after `matters' (first occurring), insert: `which have been raised during the hearings of Estimates Committees or which have arisen since those hearings.'.''</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I rise to indicate support for the ideas contained in this series of motions, which hopefully the Senate will vote on tonight. In determining how one goes about changing the way in which the Senate operates, there are two major items to be taken into consideration. One is that the Senate has to be a reasonably proficient operation in terms of its essential business, which is legislation. Secondly, it must do it in such a way as to give all senators elected to this place due and proper consideration so that they can express their views adequately and make their position known on votes which are to be taken. The second item, the rights of individual senators, often has been interpreted in a very narrow fashion. It has been interpreted on the basis that every senator should be able to talk at any length on any matter whatsoever. The difficulty with that is that, every time one senator speaks, it reduces the time available for all the other senators. There has to be a balance. That is very difficult to achieve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Depending on the types of Standing Orders that we have in this place, it is possible for somebody who is fairly knowledgeable of the Standing Orders to tie up this chamber in such a way that it could not process any business. It is not very difficult. If anyone wants to know how to do it, I am quite happy to run through a list of five or six propositions which would tie up the chamber and simply make it unworkable. That seems to me to be taking the situation to an extreme. These recommendations are attempting to take another step along the line of trying to give all senators a reasonable opportunity and to make sure that the work is processed. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Durack alluded to a number of matters, one of which was whether or not any legislation was around. I totally disagree with his comments. A lot of legislation was listed on the Notice Paper. I invite Senator Durack to go back and select any of the Notice Papers. He will discover that there were plenty of Bills to discuss at any time that we have met in this chamber since August. In fact, we had a huge amount left over from the first half of the year. We did not run out of Bills to deal with. The Senate is hardly likely to run out of Bills ever again because of the way it processes them. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not the problem. One of the worries that I have had-the Senate has seen fit to support a motion that I have moved for a number of years now-regards a cut-off date. In recent times the House of Representatives has become very upset about that. But it was an attempt to stop the flow of Bills which were supposed to be passed by the end of our session, at some time before the day on which we actually finished sitting. We now have in front of us some orderly process for the next three weeks. I think that it is the order in which the business is taken and the way in which it is dealt with that is a major problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, some of these suggestions go to that point. They do not go very far and represent only a very small step. If we do not come to grips with the way in which we do business, acknowledging always that it is unlikely that the Senate will sit much longer than it currently does, the problems will always exist. One way of dealing with the problem is to sit for a longer period. For example, we can sit for the same length of time, as Senator Hamer noted, as the Canadian Parliament, the British Parliament or the American Congress, all of which sit at least twice the length of time that we do. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is what people intend to do, they have to acknowledge that there will be a dramatic change in the political structure of the Federal Parliament. Constituents would not be able to see their elected representatives in their electorate offices. Even now, because senators are committed to a sitting which is about 40 per cent longer than that of the House of Representatives, I am sure that they are already having enormous difficulty meeting their constituent obligations. Being able to find any time to spend in an electorate office to fulfil the long list of engagements of people wishing to see us or who bring representations to us in our own State or Territory is now becoming a very difficult task. If the Senate doubled the length of the sittings I think that we would have to agree that that would place elected representatives in a totally different political context. I am not at all sure that the electorate is interested in that sort of change at the moment-possibly over time, but certainly not suddenly. Any development that we take will be of a nature which is slow, probably methodical, and step by step. If honourable senators look at the changes that have been made in recent times they will see that those changes have been of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the amendments which recently have been brought into the chamber-I would have preferred these amendments to have been circulated earlier-I note that this report was put down in December last year. It is not as though the report has been dropped on us all of a sudden. For months there has been an indication, by way of notice, as to when the matter would be debated. Senator Harradine's amendment is an important one. It takes in something that has been left out. I think that it ought to be supported. I support Senator Reid's amendment because it would not be very nice to write into the procedures the suggestion that the current Opposition might be in opposition for life. I think that that wording will probably meet the problems that we have. Senator Durack's amendment takes us back to the status quo. I listened with interest to the various points that he raised. For example, he said that there might be questions that were asked and the information has not been brought forward. That is already dealt with in the report. The Estimates committee report would simply note that the items had not been answered and hence they would be open for debate. Already contained within the report is the view that it is up to the people on that committee or, taking Senator Harradine's amendment into account, any senator, to make sure that that Estimates committee report contains the various items they may wish to raise at a later stage, or refers to them as being yet unanswered and hence enables the senator to raise them again in the Committee of the Whole. All that it is asking, I think, is a reasonable proposition that one should use the Estimates committees for the purposes for which they were set up. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that it increases the difficulties. Most of these new sessional orders will make it more difficult for members of the Australian Democrats. I said that at the very beginning when we first brought this report in: smaller groups in this place would have much more difficulty with them. However, all my colleagues have looked at these in detail and are willing to support them on the basis that we believe that the orderly processing of business in this place is what we are supposed to be about. We will accept that additional burden, and it will be quite onerous for us to meet some of these items having regard to our small number. Hopefully, at the next election we will be able to alleviate that problem somewhat by increasing our numbers, thereby making the job less onerous. At least, from 1 July, there will be more Democrat senators in this chamber, so that will make the task somewhat easier. Nevertheless, it will still be a relatively small number compared to other parties. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that in those circumstances everybody is entitled to look at these sorts of items in terms of how they might affect them. This will affect us. We are willing to take on this additional problem because we think it will, in all fairness, enable all senators to have a reasonable time and a reasonable chance to have their views known on major matters. </PARA>
<PARA> As we come into these last weeks, we will find that a considerable number of important Bills will get very little time for debate. It is something that the Committee was appointed to solve. I do not think we have got terribly close to that. However, if these are accepted, it might open a window of opportunity further down the line for that to occur. I am not at all sanguine that that will be the case, but let us hope that it is a possibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Without a better spacing of legislation throughout the entire time that we sit, I believe that senators' rights will be severely affected. If one or two senators decide to spend a week or two on one Bill, they are denying other senators who may have an interest in a different piece of legislation their right to have a reasonable debate on the Bill of their interest and concern. So the spacing of Bills throughout the period is vitally important. The hope is that those additional references to committees, which undoubtedly will occur under this regime, will assist that particular task. It may or may not, in the famous phrase that is bandied around-who knows? Hopefully, it will, and therefore all senators will have an enhanced opportunity rather than a decreased opportunity, as some senators, unfortunately, are seeing in these reforms. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I strongly support the motions before the Senate and I am happy to commend one or two of the amendments which individual senators have moved to adjust the package before us. I will speak very briefly so we can quickly get to the most important stage of voting on the motions before us and seeing the reforms in place so we can improve the conduct of the Senate and the capacity of honourable senators to contribute in the more flexible way that these improvements to our procedures would allow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I commend in particular my colleague Senator Hamer for the way in which he has introduced the reforms. I have carefully discussed these concepts with Senator Hamer over a number of years and I support what he said. I also commend the Select Committee on Legislation Procedures which is chaired by Senator Colston and comprises Senators Jones and Collins from the Government; Senator Reid, the Opposition Whip, with Senator Hamer; and Senator Macklin from the Australian Democrats, who preceded me in the debate this evening. This group of six senators has pulled together a process of reform with which I was very much involved over nine years. I was a chairman of a Senate standing committee during the last Government's tenure and initiatives taken in 1981 are still on the agenda. They have not received careful debate and resolution until now. </PARA>
<PARA> Former Senator Peter Rae was a prime mover in rationalising and improving a number of the measures that are before us. Former Senator Doug McClelland, who following those discussions became President of the Senate, contributed significantly to the bipartisan support for the reforms that are still largely before us in the motions that we are considering tonight. This debate leads me to commend not only my colleague Senator Hamer and members of the Legislation Procedures Committee but also former Senators McClelland and Peter Rae for refining the processes of the Senate which are renowned in Australia, and I think overseas in Westminster parliaments, for the forward looking way in which we go about our committee procedures in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the innovation of committees sitting on Wednesdays and the actuality, achieved by the motions before us tonight, of Senate legislative and general purpose committees when, up until now, they have been mostly general purpose committees with an inquiry function-although occasionally legislation has been referred to them. I put it to all our colleagues in the Senate tonight that Senate standing committees have not lived up to their full potential as legislative committees. The motions which have been moved by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray) tonight would allow committees to play a fuller role-a role that was, I think, originally envisaged for the standing committees-in that they could consider legislation in a more regular way. </PARA>
<PARA> In commending the motions before us, I do not quarrel with the amendment put by my colleague Senator Reid on the composition of the committee that would recommend the referral of legislation to committees. I do not have any particular quarrel with the amendment put by Senator Harradine, because we need to recognise that there will be an opportunity in the Estimates committees for a majority report and dissenting reports. Those reports can indicate items that will come up for conclusive debate, or will require an answer from the Government, in the Committee of the Whole. Independent senators, or indeed any senator from the Government or Opposition who was unable to be a member of an Estimates committee, would as of right be able to indicate in the Estimates committee report or a dissenting report some matter for further reference to the Committee of the Whole. So Senator Harradine's amendment, which would allow any individual senator to reserve a matter at the point the Estimates committee brought its report down, certainly wins my support. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Durack's amendment is one which, in principle, I support. Nevertheless, it can be won without being in the precise form in which Senator Durack moved it, which is that any unconcluded matter in an Estimates committee, any question that is not answered, ought as a matter of form to be indicated in that Estimates committee's report and must then be subject to an answer, with all the possibility of continuing questions and debate in the Committee of the Whole. So any matter that is seen to be a current matter, a matter that has a continuing, evolving life to it, would in all prudence be listed by a member of an Estimates committee amongst those items to be referred to the Committee of the Whole by that Estimates committee. So I do not believe that the Senate need now support the precise amendment that Senator Durack has moved but rather acknowledge that the procedures before us in the substantial matters moved by the Government are able to accommodate all that Senator Durack has been concerned about, and which I also am concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an historic moment. It is one that I have genuinely looked forward to for some nine years as I have participated in discussions with other chairmen of standing committees of the Senate, including Senator Peter Rae, Senator Douglas McClelland and a number of others, assisted by the staff of the Clerk of the Senate and others who have greatly assisted the development of the procedures of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last five years, in particular, I have lamented the decline of genuine debate on legislation in the House of Representatives. I do not wish to reflect on the level of debate in another place. Rather, I wish to congratulate the Senate for the superior carefulness with which legislation, for the good of all Australians, is debated in this chamber. The numbers in this place are always, it seems, different from those in the other place. The Senate, throughout all the time I have been here, has been a genuine forum for debating legislation. That has not always been the case in the other place, where the iron numbers of the government majority have too much presumed that, because the government of the day has proposed a matter of legislation, it ought to be supported by those with the majority, the Government. So too frequently, even without the use of the guillotine, there has been a brief rehearsing of what legislation is about followed by too brief and inadequate a debate. That is one of the reasons why the Senate is sitting much longer. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate is a place of debate about legislation. Setting aside Wednesdays as a committee day will, I believe, extend the reputation of the Senate and will ensure that there is a careful examination of all proposed laws for the people of Australia. For all of these nine years I have looked forward to this historic evening when we would reform the procedures of the Senate. I therefore genuinely support the motions that have been moved in response to the Legislation Procedures Committee, made up of government, opposition and Democrat members. I support the amendments moved by Senator Reid and the amendment proposed by Senator Harradine. I trust that the brevity of our remarks tonight will lead to this process being carefully concluded this evening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like, very briefly, to refer to a few points. Senator Teague has just made every honourable senator's heart feel good about the tremendous work that we do here. But one of the things he did not say was that in the Senate we also have the repetition of the same sorts of speeches that are made in the House of Representatives. That brings me to another point I would like to make in regard to the real problem we have; that is that with every increase in the time that the Senate takes in committee work there has to be a corresponding reduction in the set play debates that are a complete repetition of the House of Representatives debates. I said that when we looked at the matter previously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact that we now have the Wednesday proposal I think means that we are getting to a realistic experiment. I think it is worthwhile looking at the last paragraph in the motion of the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray) as we have the opportunity now of experimenting with something that is, I believe, realistic. To that extent, I believe that it is not terribly important in relation to the views that one might have on the amendments, but I think it is most important to let the experiment take place. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like very briefly to refer to Senator Watson's amendment because I have some concern about his reference to select committees. I appreciate the fact that he is creating the possibility of something being sent to a select committee. The point I would like to warn about is that, if the system is to work, then there should be standing committees that cover most imaginable problems. There will always be a problem, particularly for the Government, if select committees are set up and therefore by-pass the standing committees. The reason for that is to do with personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not matter from which part of the chamber honourable senators come; they have the great difficulty of ending up on too many committees. Everybody is conscripted to an additional committee that he did not really want to go onto, but the Party requires him to do it. The system will not work if there is an abuse of the ability to use the select committees. I am not suggesting that that is Senator Watson's aim. I am drawing attention to the fact that, if it is not sensibly applied, then there will be a problem. The fact that we are looking at a trial period here makes it reasonably satisfactory. </PARA>

I do not object in principle, but I am a bit apprehensive because there is always a tendency for people with an angle at a particular time to whip it off to a select committee. That will make it much more difficult. In that context, I think we have to look at the problem. Pressure is placed on honourable senators on the Wednesday of each week, and if everybody personalises it, we can see some of the difficulties that we will have, especially when honourable senators are on committees that will have a heavier load of legislation than other committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter I want to draw attention to briefly is the problem that Senator Harradine's proposed amendment adverts to. I have no objection to the suggested amendment because I think it is a way in which a matter can be drawn attention to in view of the general change that is proposed. But I think one has to look at the fact that we have had a tendency in more recent times for there to be no attempt to reach agreement on an Estimates committee. With this new system there is a danger of moving further into government and opposition reports on Estimates committees. I have seen some situations in which the reservations have been longer than the committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention to the fact that, if the system is to work, Senator Harradine's amendment can be carried, but if it is abused-some people have thoughtlessly abused the system by making sure that their names have appeared on long minority reports-it will fall down. Consequently, the aim of Estimates committee reports and their reservations-to highlight points or to prioritise things-will be lost. We may as well then consider Estimates in the Committee of the Whole and spend the sorts of record times that we have recently created. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating and I look forward to the experiment next year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make a few comments on the report of the Select Committee on Legislation Procedures. Perhaps I should start by indicating the one part of the Committee recommendations that I certainly will not support-that is, the reduction in the quorum. The history of governments has always been that they have sought to reduce quorums or have got comfort from the reduction of quorums. They get comfort from anything which decreases the obligations which lie upon their members to attend in the chamber. The record of the attendance of Government members in the chamber is scandalous. It is usual for there to be far more Opposition senators in the chamber at any time, including Question Time, and certainly during debate on matters of public importance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the legitimate tactics that an Opposition has in its armoury is the calling of a quorum, thus making it quite clear that it will not be simply a matter of asking the Government's back bench to respond to the quorum bells. If the Opposition finds itself cast in the role of needing to draw attention to a particular matter by calling a quorum into the chamber, as required by the provisions of the Constitution, the inconvenience which is alleged to be suffered by Ministers should be put up with. It is a discipline imposed on Ministers; it is a discipline imposed on any government to ensure that it does not bring about a situation in which the opposition is forced to call quorums in order to make political points or to even up the sort of abuse of Question Time that we get from Ministers like Senator Bolkus and Senator Cook. They seem to think that Question Time is simply there for them to make statements which they are not prepared to make in order to have them debated in the proper course of activity. For those of us who anticipate with some degree of confidence being on the government benches in the course of the next few months, it is a discipline that we are perfectly prepared to accept for ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that the reduction in the quorum is a point which ought to be supported and I will certainly vote against such reduction in exactly the same way as, in defence of what I believe to be the basic institutional framework of this place, I voted against the large number of changes in the privileges legislation which sought to strip some privileges from this chamber. For that reason, I will not be voting in favour of the motion moved by Senator Robert Ray arising from the report that there should be a reduction in the quorum. As Senator Hamer rightly said in his speech, the only argument put forward was that a reduction in the quorum makes it easier for Ministers to avoid coming into the chamber when the quorum bells ring. That discipline ought to be imposed on Ministers, regardless of from which party they are drawn. </PARA>
<PARA> We then come to a series of other matters which are dealt with in these recommendations. I agree with the recommendations in relation to the time limit on the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. As one who has never had any great difficulty in subverting the Standing Orders in order to talk about their suspension and one who has certainly never had any difficulty in going for considerably more than five minutes on that particular subject--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Colston" NAMEID="PF4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator. I appreciate the compliment. I am certainly prepared to accept the discipline which is imposed there because it is quite clear that if the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders is so serious that the Government understands that it has to deal with the matter-whether it is a censure motion or a motion of no confidence-it will agree to suspend Standing Orders. Indeed, if it is a matter of form, in order to allow something to be done which is not of very great moment, we usually agree to the suspension of Standing Orders pro forma without any difficulty at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is perfectly legitimate that an opposition-it is nearly always an opposition which will be moving for the suspension of Standing Orders-can adequately make its point within the course of 30 minutes in an overall sense because the point which is being made is a political point and does not really need to be debated in a number of 30-minute speeches, of which 15 minutes is usually comprehended in the argument on points of order about whether the senator is speaking to the suspension of Standing Orders or is speaking to the substance of the motion which he wishes to move or to put forward. I think, therefore, that that will take away some of the element of theatre. I do regret the tendency by those without any degree of feeling and soul to destroy the element of theatre which ought properly to attend parliamentary debates and who believe that it should all be reduced to the merest mechanical operation; nevertheless I suppose that five minutes of a good rousing speech will do just as well as 20 minutes of trying to get round the Chairman's rulings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The idea of going home for Christmas is obviously anathema to some people, but the honourable senator makes it more tempting by the moment. However, there are a couple of matters which I think require our further thought. I am prepared to support them on the basis that we are only entering into a trial period with some of these Standing Orders. I know that most of these trial arrangements tend to be set in concrete and, therefore, should be regarded with some degree of scepticism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question in relation to the non-debate of second reading motions is something that would have to be watched with some considerable degree of care. I note that the qualification in recommendation 4 (a) is that any senator may, in fact, prevent the question of the second reading being put without debate. Undoubtedly that increases the power of individual senators simply to indicate that they believe that the question of the second reading should be debated and that it should not be put pro forma. I think it will be a nightmare for the Manager of Government Business of the day to know how he is going to manage his program under these circumstances, because any individual senator may raise the question at the time-`orally at the time', says the recommendation-that that senator requires the Bill to be debated and, therefore, the second reading cannot be put without debate. </PARA>
<PARA> It means, quite clearly, that if the Opposition has a fit of the collective piques for a week or a day, or if the Australian Democrats have a fit of the giggles, as they frequently do during the day, they may simply-by way of any single Opposition or Democrat senator who feels he has been abused by a Government Minister at Question Time, or has been unfairly dealt with, or who feels that the Opposition or Democrats are being unfairly dealt with-say, `Right, our response to the Government's misbehaviour today is to ensure that there are no formal votes taken on second reading speeches'. We will indicate right at the death knock, when the Bill is before us, that we require that it be put aside and dealt with by way of a second reading speech which may or may not subsequently eventuate as a second reading debate. It will go on the Notice Paper for a second reading debate and that will give the Manager of Government Business, the parliamentary liaison officer and all those trying to plan the program, an absolute nightmare in trying to plan what our legislative program is going to be. We will not know until the matter comes before us whether there is going to be a second reading debate. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because, Senator Crichton-Browne, it is only when the motion for the second reading of a Bill is put without debate-that is, when there has not been a second reading debate-that it provides a quite clear and additional discipline on the dealing with non-controversial matters. I am strengthened by the fact that if ever I feel agitated with the way in which the Government is behaving I am conscious that there is still the first reading of a money Bill provision available under the Standing Orders. If the Government is getting to the stage where I think we need to impose some additional discipline on it during its last session of the Parliament in February-if it brings us back then-we may well have to start looking at the first reading of the money Bill debates in order to make a whole series of points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would now like to refer to the last group of recommendations which are the first ones addressed fundamentally in recommendations 1 (a) to 1 (e). I believe that more Bills should be referred to committees. I believe that that will improve the work of the committees. I support the amendment which has been moved by Senator Watson to allow the reference of Bills to select committees. From time to time there are very particular and technical matters which need to be referred to committees. We need to draw together people with a particular expertise on a matter-for instance, some of the Bills dealing with commercial legislation and copyright legislation. In these instances one needs a group of senators with a particular interest in an area of considerable technical difficulty who are prepared to invest their time and effort by way of a select committee to deal with the matter. Therefore, I support Senator Watson's amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to anticipate debate, improperly, but in relation to the operation of other references, I understand there may well be a move by Senator Harradine to ensure that when a Bill is introduced by a senator who is not a Minister that Bill should be referred to a committee only with the consent of the senator concerned. I would strongly oppose that. Once a Bill is introduced into the Senate it becomes the property of the whole Senate, not of the individual proponent of the legislation. It is up to the whole Senate to determine how it will deal with the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Reid's proposed amendment, as far as the Selection Committee is concerned, is eminently sensible and I will support it. In relation to the management of Estimates committees I believe that Senator Harradine's proposed amendment that there should be the capacity of senators who are not formally members of Estimates committees to have a better input into this process is correct. His proposed amendment regarding the attachment of reservations is also correct. </PARA>
<PARA> I am troubled by Senator Durack's proposed amendment. I think that for the purposes of trialling this matter Senator Durack's amendment should be supported. I say that because, if it is not, one of the things that will undoubtedly take place is that departments which have been asked to provide information will deliberately withhold that information until the relevant Senate Estimate committee has reported. That is exactly what will happen within certain areas of the bureaucracy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If we were to list the number of matters which are simply outstanding in terms of non-replies from departments at the time at which the Senate Estimates committees are, by a resolution of the Senate, required to report, for some departments we will have pages and pages of unanswered questions. Some of those questions may be unanswered for good and proper reasons. However, some will be unanswered because departments will look at this proposal and say, `Let us take the punt that the Estimates committee will not report the matter which we want to keep out of the debate of the Committee of the Whole, and we will then rely upon a chairman to rule that the matter may not be debated in the Committee of the Whole because it has not been referred to in the Estimates committee report'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Teague interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two things to be said about that: a large number of senators will not have been on the Estimates committee; therefore, they will not know what matters have not been responded to unless they have read the total transcript of each of the six or seven Estimates committees. With the best will in the world I have no intention of trying to read everybody else's Estimates committee hearings. Nevertheless, there are matters which, if brought forward for attention, need to be responded to. Therefore, by supporting Senator Durack's amendment we can clearly achieve some discipline imposed on individual senators to try to confine their remarks to those matters which are raised in Estimates committee reports but they are not totally restricted from looking at matters which have arisen since those hearings. My friend Senator Teague knows well that there are many instances where, in the time which elapses between the report of a Senate Estimates committee and the consideration of the Committee of the Whole, other matters do arise which need to be addressed in the debate in the Committee of the Whole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The final point I make about that is that that will become even more germane when one sees the sort of situation that we had in Estimates Committee D last time when two things occurred. Honourable senators will recall the debate we had about ministerial instructions to officers not to answer questions. Presumably, that would be covered simply because that point would be reported, but two thick volumes of additional material were supplied in relation to questions asked at Estimates Committee D, which is very difficult to get across. I think we have even seen in the last couple of days the presentation of documentary material from Estimates Committee A. After the debate of the Committee of the Whole has concluded we are still getting material in the chamber. Frankly, undoubtedly that will increase if there is a deliberate cutting-off, by way of some restriction relating the Committee of the Whole debate exclusively to matters which occur in the Estimates committee reports. Therefore, I will be supporting Senator Durack's amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks quite simply by paying tribute to those honourable senators who have taken the lead in developing these matters: Senator Hamer, who has certainly been assiduous in raising this matter with Opposition senators and focusing our minds upon it; and Senator Colston who was the Chairman of the Select Committee on Legislation Procedures. I believe that taking these matters on a trial basis is a good thing. I think some of them will be found to work effectively and some of them will be found not to work effectively. Under those circumstances I think we can then come back and try to achieve the best of all possible worlds. It is only by trial and error that we will effectively improve the legislative performance of this chamber while at the same time not trespassing unduly upon the rights which are properly those held by individual senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not take long; however, I want to make some comments on this report, firstly because I have been waiting for nearly a year to do so-I remind the Senate that the report is dated 1 December 1988, and I think that says something about the practices of the Senate-and secondly because it is a very major reform. In my opinion, this is certainly the most major reform since the Senate set up the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, and therefore I think it is worthy of at least a brief contribution. Along with so many senators, I have been concerned for a long time that the quality of legislation which passes through this Parliament is not good enough. I have had reason to say that on many occasions, particularly in relation to commercial legislation. We note it from the law reports but it is not satisfactory that we have to wait for a judicial determination upon our work to see the failings of the language. Simply not enough time and care is put into the legislative process. It is easy to blame the draftsmen, but more often it is simply that the draftsmen, in the programs set by the Government, are not allowed sufficient time, particularly in the specialised areas, to do the job properly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We then get to the role of the two chambers in this process. As was stated by my colleague Senator Teague, regrettably the contribution of quality and detail to legislation by the House of Representatives is negligible-and they are quite brazen about it. How often are we told, `We will leave the detail to you in the Senate; that is not our responsibility'. `Our responsibility is to play out the drama of politics. We are the House of the people and all that. Your responsibility is to look to the detail, and we rely upon you to do that.' How often are we told that by the House of Representatives? So accepting that the responsibility is in this chamber, the reforms suggested by the Senate Select Committee on Legislation Procedures are obviously of great importance. </PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity in the Senate to carry this responsibility lies, of course, principally in the committee stage debate of Bills, and consideration will either be through the standing or select committees or in fact in the committee stage in this chamber. In committees themselves, I specifically recognise the internationally renowned work of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and, more recently, the work of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. I guess that my own particular experience in trying to improve the quality of legislation has come through my sitting on the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I remind myself of pieces of legislation such as the National Crime Authority Bill, the Cash Transactions Bill, the war crimes legislation and the tax file number legislation, all of which were dealt with in detail by that committee. </PARA>

I remind the Senate that I am talking about consideration of detail rather than principally considerations of policy, which are determined elsewhere.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have had a recent experience from which I can draw a comparison when I look at two Bills of which I had the management on behalf of this side of the chamber-on the one hand, the corporations package and, on the other hand, the copyright legislation. The corporations package, which contained literally thousands of pages of legislation, went to a joint select committee which examined it in detail and reported back to this Senate, as a result of which the debate in this Senate was dealt with adequately within a matter of a few hours. On the other hand, the copyright legislation-again, a complex and technical piece of legislation-did not go to a committee but should have gone to a committee, and we were left with no alternative but to deal with the detail and many amendments in the chamber, as a result of which the debate literally took weeks. We got through the process, but it is clearly not the most efficient way in which to carry out our function. As a result, time is lost for improving other pieces of legislation. So if ever I needed a lesson as to the advantages of the proper use of the committees of this Parliament in improving the quality of legislation and the function of this chamber, it is that experience. </PARA>

I refer first to the lack of public participation in the legislative process. It appears to be a matter of mirth to Senator Macklin, but I think, compared with some parliaments, the absence of public participation in the legislative process is noteworthy. In fact, a comparison shows how unwelcome in some ways public participation is in this place. For example, in some systems I have witnessed in the United States of America, when a Bill is considered in committee, members of the public are actually invited to come and put a point of view. Obviously the debate has to be managed competently, and a good chairman can do that. It is an extension of participatory democracy which I applaud. I regret that that does not occur adequately within our system. I must say also that the way in which this building has been structured does not facilitate public involvement. It is difficult for members of the public to get into the committee rooms; they do not know what is taking place in the committee rooms, and in many ways their presence or involvement is unwelcome.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> One of the matters dealt with in the report, which I dismiss, is that there is insufficient time for proper consideration of legislation-an argument which, of course, is always put by government. I suggest that, other than in the most exceptional circumstances, there is always adequate time. I again remind the Senate of the Copyright Bill I just mentioned, which went through the House of Representatives many months before it was finally debated in this place. There was more than adequate time for consideration within a committee. If I look again to my experience with corporate legislation and the practice that was adopted of exposure drafts, certainly that meant that the legislative process took a little longer but it meant that the community had a chance to participate, that views from specialists and other organisations were able at least to be taken into account to some extent in the process. Of course, the Senate was not always made aware of the contribution of these specialist groups, which was disappointing. Nevertheless, the practice demonstrated that there was adequate time for more detailed consideration of a piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that there is no doubt that unless there are within the Standing Orders of this place requirements such as those we are debating tonight, governments will always argue that there is insufficient time. In other words, we need a mechanism that will force government, in effect, to take into account the need for proper debate of its legislation within the timetable of the Senate rather than the timetable of government. We want to get away from such experiences as taxation legislation, which is announced and deemed to be effective from the date of announcement but not debated and completed until sometimes 2 1/2 years after the time of the announcement. That is the type of poor legislative practice we should all condemn. One of the best reforms, I should say to Senator Macklin, that I have experienced in this place is the cut-off date for legislation from the House of Representatives, which forces government to look at the timetable of its program and ensures that there is more likely to be adequate time for debate in this place. Basically I accept the recommendations that are being debated tonight. Like all honourable senators I may have differed on matters of detail and I certainly intend to support the proposed amendment of Senator Reid and the amendments of Senator Watson and Senator Durack because I think debate on the Estimates will be unduly constrained by the language that appears in the motion that we are debating tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> It might be said that as a result of adopting these new processes tonight committees will be forced into greater specialisation, with more specialist inquiries rather than general inquiries. I do not think that is necessarily a bad thing because most general inquiries are carried on in any event by other bodies as well as the Parliament. In many ways our specialisation is the law-making process. In the long run, to force committees into greater specialisation and greater use of specialist staff to build up our own expertise within particular areas will provide for better quality legislation and ensure that the Parliament is more effective in requiring accountability of government. </PARA>
<PARA> With all those who believe in the importance of this institution, I look forward to the passage of these new procedures tonight as a way to enhance the standing of this chamber and, I trust, improve the quality of the product that comes out of our deliberations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I acknowledge the work that has been done by Senator Colston, the Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Legislation Procedures, and all the members of the Committee. I am sure that members of the Senate would agree with me that Senator Hamer has also contributed considerably to the preparation of these recommendations. On 28 September last year, as a result of what I assumed to be a general invitation to senators, I made a submission in writing to the Committee. In it I argued against proposals which might shift the focus away from proceedings in this Senate chamber to unpublicised proceedings within committees. I concluded with these words:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I fear that in transferring the focus from the chamber to a number of committees senators will be asked to accept a great deal more on trust and that a substantial part of the legislative process will take place away from adequate public scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA>Unless somebody corrects me, the report that we have before us confirms that. I am concerned that sufficient acknowledgment or at least an adequate canvassing of that point was not given or included in this report. In fact, there is an explicit statement to the contrary. We are told at page 5 of the report that a scheme for committee examination of Bills entails a substitution for time spent by the Senate on consideration of the Bills. I also have a range of concerns which I will not go into tonight because I think, by and large, the issue is cut and dried. Unfortunately, as Senator Hamer said in his speech, it looks as though the matter-that is, this procedure of hiving off Bills to a committee-will go through in one form or another. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very interested to hear what Senator Durack, the longest serving member of the Senate, had to say. What he predicted may well come true. He asked whether, given that this procedure is to be adopted, this is a guarantee that the procedures in this place will be streamlined or whether the institution of these procedures will mean a further wasting of the Senate's time. I indicate that I have foreshadowed an amendment to the first paragraph in respect of private senators' Bills. It would be fair for me now to outline that to the Senate. The proposed amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Motion (1), at end of motion, add: ``, subject to the following amendment of the order:</PARA>
<PARA> ``after paragraph (12), add:</PARA>
<PARA> `(13) A bill introduced by a Senator other than a Minister shall not be referred to a committee under this order unless the Senator has consented, in writing, to the referral of the bill.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is important. Under normal circumstances, the honourable senator in charge of the Bill being debated in the Committee of the Whole-it is normally a Minister but in the case of a private senator's Bill, the private senator-is there to answer questions about the meaning of the Bill and its clauses. Under this procedure, it may well be that that senator may not be a member of a particular legislative and general purpose standing committee and therefore will not have the opportunity of being there to answer questions about the meaning of the Bill or to participate in the debate. I have no objection to private senators' Bills being sent to committees, provided the private senator is coopted on to the Committee. Senator Colston might be able to inform me what this cryptic remark on page 10 of the report means:</PARA>
<PARA> The membership of the standing committees may need to be adjusted to provide more opportunity for the Australian Democrat and independent senators to be members of committees. The existing procedures allow for such adjustments to be made. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree that there have been occasions when senators who were not members of a committee were added to a committee for particular references. Certainly, if a private senator's Bill is to be sent to a committee, in my view, that private senator ought to be a member of the committee. Otherwise, the Bills should be considered under the conditions provided by current Standing Orders. It would be generally accepted in this chamber that if a private senator's Bill were referred to the committee there would be no objection to a motion being moved so that that particular senator could be a member of the committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I cannot move the amendment because Senator Watson has moved an amendment to one of the motions, I foreshadow it. Finally, to cut down my speaking time a little, I will not argue my case on the Estimates committees because I understand that my proposed amendment on that is likely to be supported. I see it as a complementary amendment. As a matter of fact, I proposed it because I had in mind one particular department which regularly does not give the details of a very substantial sum of money. I think that in this Budget the proposal is for about $70m. I received the stack of information only after the Committee had reported to the Senate. I was able to arrange with the Minister who was at the table on Thursday or Friday that he would answer my questions if I gave them in writing. He assured me of that. My amendment is designed to cover that situation. I also see my amendment not as being in opposition to Senator Durack's amendment, but rather as complementary to it. I think that what Senator Durack has said is quite useful and I support it. He has referred to matters which have been raised during the hearings of the Estimates committees or which have arisen since those hearings. An Auditor-General's report, for example, could be received after the Committee has reported. That report could expose grave weaknesses in the particular department. I think it would be unfair on senators if, after that, senators could not raise questions with the responsible Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We agree that there is a need for a streamlining of procedures, but we ought to make sure-particularly in respect of the Estimates-that the powers and functions of individual senators and, indeed, of the Senate as a whole to exercise their audit and control functions over the Executive Government should not in any way be diminished. I believe that supporting the amendments that have been proposed by Senator Durack and me will go some way to retrieving the situation. Though in principle I am opposed to the recommendations that have come forward, I will put my amendment forward in the hope that that will reduce what I see to be the encroachment on the rights and functions of individual senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the amendment stands at the moment I would not be able to support it because, as Senator Puplick mentioned, once a senator introduces a Bill, it becomes the property of the Senate. The Senate should then have the right to refer the Bill. I do not see any problem with referring a Bill to a committee if it is a private senator's Bill. The report of the Select Committee on Legislation Procedures did not canvass that matter but it suggested that the Committee should be able to call whoever it wants. If nothing else happens, I imagine that it would be a strange committee which would not call the person who introduced a private senator's Bill into the Senate. As the amendment stands I would not be able to support the addition of paragraph (13) as circulated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have no problem at all with the amendment which was foreshadowed by Senator Harradine:</PARA>
<PARA> Motion (5), at the end of the motion, add: ``, subject to the following amendment of the order:</PARA>
<PARA>After paragraph (2), insert the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> `(2A) That a Senator who is not a member of an Estimates Committee may attach a reservation to the report of the Committee.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Harradine and I have been associated on a particular Estimates committee for some time. I can see that there would be great difficulties if that was not in the report. I am thankful to him for raising the matter. In relation to Senator Durack's amendment, replacing some words with the words `which have been raised during the hearings of Estimates Committees or which have arisen since those hearings', I am afraid that I cannot support that amendment because, to use the words of Senator Childs, it would almost bring us back to the status quo. </PARA>
<PARA> A matter was raised by Senator Puplick in relation to this amendment. The matter was covered on page 19 of the report where it says:</PARA>
<PARA>The reports of the Estimates Committees should include schedules of questions not answered at the time of reporting, with a recommendation to the effect that those questions are referred to the Senate for further consideration until they are answered. This would allow questions still unanswered at the time of the committee of the whole debate to be referred to at the time. </PARA>
<PARA>When that matter was first raised it was mentioned by one of the Ministers-I think it might have been Senator Robert Ray-that that would place strict discipline on departments to get their answers in on time, or strict discipline on Ministers to ensure that departments would get the answers in on time, because if the answers were in on time there would be no need to debate them at that time. </PARA>

I am concerned that if Senator Watson's amendment were passed it could mean an expansion of committees. Senator Teague very correctly pointed out that the legislative function of the legislative and general purpose committees has not been used as effectively as it could be. I would rather see legislation go to the legislative and general purpose committees rather than a select committee.

What this is is a token gesture under the Standing Orders which provides that there is no gag. It is simply a token opportunity to be heard. It would be much more honest to abolish the five-minute debate altogether and say that honourable senators cannot speak.

One has only to read the House of Representatives Hansard to see how meaningless a five-minute debate is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I accept that the general thrust of the proposals is to speed up the process.

This is seen as a way of accommodating the general thrust that we need to find a way to expedite matters. We must remember that the Australian Parliament, particularly the Senate, has a pretty good record for passing legislation. It is to the credit of the Government-perhaps it is more to the credit of the commonsense of those who have the numbers-that the guillotine has not been used too often.

My concern is that, given the limited manpower available, we will find that general purpose references will be the sufferers. The whole range of issues dealt with by committees now in a very responsible and proper way, which ultimately, almost without exception, provide excellent reports or excellent minority reports, will be diminished. That function will not be able to continue simply because it will not be possible to do both. My concern is that the vital and important element of the functioning and the activity of the Senate will be lost for all time. With respect, that is an advantage, by and large, to the Government but a disadvantage to the Senate and a very real disadvantage to the wider community.

<PARA> I support the amendment moved by Senator Durack and that proposed by Senator Harradine in respect of amendments to Estimates committee reports. However, I am frankly opposed to the whole concept. I accept that an argument can be put that there are those on the side of the Opposition, whoever the Opposition for the time being might be, who saw sawdust during the discussion in the Committee of the Whole and asked, if not rhetorical questions, then questions that they had asked previously but they had not been happy with the answers and they wanted to recycle the same proposition. There are, because of the constraints in terms of time, occasions that arise in respect of all of us where there are matters of interest to us, of concern to us and of importance to us. We cannot address them, firstly, because we are not on the committee and, secondly, because we are unable to attend the committee. </PARA>
<PARA> It can be argued that any honourable senator is eligible and entitled to go to an Estimates committee and ask questions, but it is not a comfortable position to be in.

Inevitably, there will be occasions when honourable senators are unable to attend the committee hearing but want to raise matters in the Committee of the Whole. They may be unable to do so because the matters will not be contained in the committee's report or in a minority report. I would prefer the situation to be as it is. I suppose it is not beyond the wit of any honourable senator if the amendment is passed-I think it is Senator Harradine's proposed amendment-to put up an all embracing dissenting report and then use that as a forum, as an opportunity, through which to debate the various matters raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two other things I wish to mention. There seems to be much made of the fact that a lot of legislation goes through the Senate upon which there are long debates but no amendments on the second reading or in the committee stage, as if that is some sort of sin, and as if it is a filibuster by the Opposition. Of course one should consider money Bills, but more importantly one should consider what might be described by some as a non-controversial Bill, such as a road funding Bill. </PARA>

But these are Bills about which very many people often feel strongly. They do not propose the amendment, in some cases because it is a money Bill and they are unable to do that, but they think it is important and incumbent upon them to put on the record their point of view, the point of view of their constituents and the point of view of their political party. Simply because there are long speeches without amendments, in my view, really means absolutely nothing when trying to draw some conclusion from those statistics.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the two amendments that relate to recommendation No. 5, that is, the manner in which debates should follow up the reporting of Estimates committees. As it stands, the proposal states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . debate on that bill in committee of the whole shall be confined to matters in respect of which reports of Estimates Committees, or reservations attached to reports, have made recommendations that the matters be further examined by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree with Senator Durack and Senator Harradine that that is an unreasonable restraint and with the points made by them that many answers come later, too late to be included in the report. That creates some difficulties which are not adequately met by requiring or suggesting that the Committee will list those matters that are still outstanding so that they may be raised in the appropriations debate. Quite frankly, there are other matters which emerge out of the sum of the parts of the cross-examination, the questioning, that takes place in Estimates committees. </PARA>
<PARA> It may well be that members of the Senate who are not members of individual committees may have a real interest in particular items that have not been referred to in the committee report. They should not be forced to rely on the good will of colleagues to put into that report what they wish to discuss by making some general point that emerges from the cross-examination. Senator Harradine's foreshadowed amendment goes part of the way to meeting that objection. We have to recognise that it is not only members of individual committees who wish to debate the appropriations covered by that committee. I deliberately do not belong to any committee so that I can attend all of them. Some people are unkind enough to suggest that I make a nuisance of myself at all of them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. I know the difference between billions and millions. The problem that we have with questions on notice not being tabled in the appropriate time really underlines the need for there to be pretty much an open go in the appropriation debates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, I do not want to speak at length about this matter. I think what Senator Puplick said was exactly right in this area. I hope that there is widespread support for freedom to debate matters to be given to ordinary members of the Senate and not simply to the members of individual committees. In the name of giving ordinary senators a fair go and making debates on the Appropriation Bills genuine examinations of the Appropriations, I think that the burden of benefit clearly lies in supporting the two amendments that have been foreshadowed-one by Senator Durack and the other by Senator Harradine. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, it is great to try to speed up the proceedings of this chamber, and it is great to have an experiment such as this. In my view, as the legislative process gets more complicated, and as governments become more and more involved in what is happening, there is a need for greater examination, not less; for greater inquiry, not less; for more informed debate, not less. The proposal as it stands in recommendation No. 5 I believe unreasonably limits the power of the Senate properly to examine the expenditure proposals and the activities of the departments that cover multimillions-indeed billions-of dollars. I strongly support the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank all honourable senators for their contribution to the debate. It was fairly free of pomposity and self-interest, which I think is a tribute to the chamber. Mr Deputy President, I think that you put your finger on it, though: this is a very auspicious time in which to move these motions as we on this side of the House, at least for a fleeting moment, ponder the fact that we may not always be on this side, and those opposite are thinking, `Well, with fortunes favouring us we may just make it to the other side'. How will this affect us? Both the Opposition and the Government can look with a bit of lateral thinking as to how this will affect them either way. I think that this is the sort of timing that we needed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me just deal with some of the speakers. I will not give a fulsome response. I refer to Senator Watson's amendment. We have a free vote on this side too, although people will also look for a bit of leadership on these issues. That is at least something that we on this side of the chamber can occasionally do. It is a pity that on that side when the leader leads no-one ever follows; but let us not get political. I can see some sense in Senator Watson's suggestion. I would also, at some stage, like to see a limit set on select committees so that we know how they can be rationed out during the year rather than just established willy-nilly. I can see some sense in there being specialist committees. Those opposite might want three or four frontbenchers on them because of the sensitivity or otherwise on that side. Because of the sensitivity of that particular issue we may like to pick our own team to go in and fight. I can see some sense in the point made by Senator Watson. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Durack made one statement that did irritate me a little. He said that there was no legislation ready this session. Let me assure him that there was. If he looks at the Notice Paper he will see that on this occasion there was ample to get us through until the rest of the legislation got in. However, it has not always been the case in the past and I acknowledge that. </PARA>

Senator Puplick was not here to have carriage of the electoral Bill because he was absent for proper reasons. Senator Powell was not ready to go on the social security Bill. These two Bills would have taken days to debate and could have proceeded, but because we try to have reasonable arrangements in here we decided not to proceed to facilitate the operations of the chamber. As it happens, this session we have had plenty of Bills to call on. It has to be acknowledged that that was not always the case.</PARA></TALK.START>

However, we will have sat an extra 4 3/4 weeks to the end of this session and we are still not going to cover the legislative program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to the Canadian example, Canada does not carry its agricultural Bills every year. It is allowed to carry the Bills for five years at a time. Canada does not get the pig slaughter levy Bills coming up every year.

I am pleased they have it because if that is the soft end of the market we protect our own borders thanks to their laxity. You cannot compare one system with another to determine whether there should be more or less legislation. If the Opposition ever gets into office we will see by how much it reduces the legislation program. I can tell the Opposition that it will not be by one iota.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will not be supporting Senator Durack's amendment. I believe it opens up the whole farce of Estimates committees. I do not blame anyone for that. If I blame anyone, it is on my side. I think it is time to draw the line over the ledger. From 1975 to 1983 people in my Party drove the then Liberal Government's Ministers mad at Estimates committees.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McLaren and all of the other old veterans. Maybe a good referee would say that we are level on points and that it is time to start again on that particular subject. There are some disadvantages for the Opposition in this approach. No-one on this side has stood up and said, `Look, there could be some problems for government in this package'. Will Bills get tied up in committees and never get out? Will dissenting reports in Estimates committees just reintroduce the Committee of the Whole debate again? We on this side are not free from doubt; we will try it. We must be flexible to amend for the problems that will inevitably arise out of these sorts of reforms. There will be problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Puplick attacked the proposal on the quorum. The proposal for quorums is there for two reasons. When the Committee was moving the turkey around the plate between the Opposition side and the Government side, it found the Government side a little deficient and added a few vegetables-the quorum proposal-just to balance up the overall approach so that no side could be seen to be having a win. Senator Puplick is fairly scornful of the quorum approach, yet this chamber without debate changed the House of Representatives quorum requirement to a fifth at the end of the last session, but it will not change our own. The only reason we are seeking to change it is because of a change of geography in this House. Ministers have a three-minute walk to and from the chamber. I am not saying that quorum calling has been abused. I thought it was for the first session in this Parliament. Other than that it has not been onerous but it could be. The Opposition is saying to Ministers, `We do not want you to get on with your daily work; we want you wandering backwards and forwards to the chamber'. The counterargument to that is: what if Ministers misbehave in the chamber? Do honourable senators opposite want to punish them by calling quorums? I will tell those opposite how to punish them-by exempting them from coming and telling the back bench to come. The backbenchers will exert discipline over the Ministers much quicker than if the Ministers have to turn up. I really do not think that argument holds water. Up until 40 minutes ago I had always said that, if I go into opposition, my only present to an incoming government will be that I will move the quorum Bill from opposition. I will not any more, after Senator Puplick's comments. Fair go, I am not that big a mug. All I am asking the Opposition to do here is to support the change in principle. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give Opposition members an example of the problem. Some months ago I had a meeting with eight people who came over from Western Australia. I had only a one-hour timeslot to see them-between 12 and one. During that time three quorums were called, and the whole meeting was a disaster. </PARA>

Secondly, we could move an amendment to Standing Orders and it would not be ultra vires of the Constitution if we said that only one quorum could be called a day. At one stage that is what the House of Representatives contemplated. So those are the two ways of dealing with that problem.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but it is rare for the guillotine to come in until the last couple of weeks and, if anything, the guillotine has been enhanced by the cut-off date, which some honourable senators opposite are starting to recognise. The cut-off date is almost certainly making the guillotine inevitable. But there would be nothing wrong in both chambers having a different role-and for this chamber to be looking more intensely at the technical aspects of Bills, et cetera; I see nothing wrong with that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That honourable senator's plea regarding five-minute speeches does not really hit a responsive chord with me. I think changes to Standing Orders are long overdue. One of the great reasons for changing Standing Orders is simply to take inordinate pressure off the Chair. To speak to a suspension of Standing Orders honourable senators have to go to the urgency of the matter. People are simply putting the content in there. It is a game of cat and mouse. No-one really wants to embarrass the Chair or take it on over it, but it is really causing inordinate pressure. It will make for some sparkling five-minute speeches but I do not see that as the end of the world. I think we can see that evolving in this chamber. These days it is fairly rare for a suspension of Standing Orders to be opposed. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of the selection of Bills, some restriction had to be put on it, such as half an hour or five minutes. If that goes every day that is another two hours out of the program. By the way, this chamber has institutionalised reforms over the last seven or eight years. We spend a lot of time: half an hour a day debating papers, the General Business day, an hour for committee reports, et cetera. We are institutionalising a lot of those things. The only thing that we got rid of was that mindless reading of petitions which took 47 minutes on one day. So, from that point of view, I would still be minded to stick to five-minute speeches. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, it is really a suck it and see exercise. This is a fairly finely balanced package which has part of the Opposition a bit worried around the edges and part of the Government a bit worried around the edges. It is a question of seeing how well it works and being flexible enough to change it. This procedure is not a standing order. It will operate for the first few months of next year or until there is an election next year. We can experience it and see how it operates. If the procedure operates badly, whichever government is in office will probably seek to dump it. If it works, this chamber will be far better because legislation will get far more scrutiny and the processes in this chamber will work more quickly. If it does not work, we go back into that anarchistic swamp where we are here until the day before Christmas or well into the winter and senators cannot take the trips that they plan. Senators would miss their fact-finding tours while the sun is still out in Europe, and that is a big tragedy that we all want to avoid. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;David Selwyn Nelson died at the age of 54 early in November. He was one of our most distinguished immunologists. David Selwyn Nelson was a Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery, Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), Doctor of Science, Fellow of the Royal College of Pathologists of Australia and Fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. Tomorrow in the non-denominational chapel of the Royal North Shore Hospital of Sydney the Reverend Keith Little will conduct an ecumenical memorial service for David Nelson.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Royal North Shore Hospital was my hospital for 18 years. It was the place where I came to medical maturity, and I will be there tomorrow as part of the congregation. I wish to speak tonight, in a way I have never done before, to make an obituary statement about David Nelson and to contribute to what my colleagues will be doing tomorrow at St Leonards in Sydney. Tomorrow's ceremony will celebrate the life of an outstanding Australian scientist. I knew him from his school days-we were at the same school-and when he went to Sydney University he was one of that small group that left the medical course halfway through to take a Bachelor of Medical Science course. He so impressed the senior teachers that one of them, Emeritus Professor Patrick de Burgh, a noted yachtsman as well as a very good bacteriologist, took a special role in encouraging David's professional direction. I wish to set some of that out, using and drawing upon comments that were made on a previous occasion by my friend and colleague, Peter North. </PARA>
<PARA> After he finished his Bachelor of Science, David Nelson went to Yale as research assistant under a Dr Robert Nelson, who was no relative. He worked further with Dr Nelson in recent years. He then came back to Australia and finished his medical degree. But before doing his medical residency, which of course is a necessity to obtain registration, he returned to the United States where he was a visiting investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Miami. In 1961, he went to the Australian National University and gained his Doctor of Philosophy, becoming expert in immunology and building up his reputation. While he was there, he met Margaret Martin-Smith, herself a distinguished medical investigator, whom he married. We have known her ever since as Peggy Nelson. Peggy then had her Master of Science, to which she later added a PhD. They then went off to St John's College, Cambridge, for two years. My wife Jenny and I had the opportunity to join him there socially on several occasions. David Nelson took up the Meres senior studentship in medical research, a position which he won against intense international competition, at St John's College in Cambridge. </PARA>
<PARA> He returned to Australia in 1965. He was immediately appointed senior lecturer in bacteriology at the University of Sydney. In 1966-that is, only eight years after my cohort graduated in medicine-he became a reader, and he held that position until 1974. During that period honour after honour was heaped upon him. He became a Fellow of the Royal College of Pathologists of Australia; he was appointed a member of the National Health and Medical Research Council committee on organ transplant and renal dialysis; he was appointed to the World Health Organisation expert panel on immunology; his major book Macrophages and Immunology was published; he was head of the World Health Organisation Immunological Research and Training Centre in Singapore; he became a Fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, of which there are two fellows in this Senate; and he was elected an honorary Fellow of the Philippines Society of Pathologists. </PARA>
<PARA> During this period he was also awarded, as Senator Dunn will know, the very senior degree from the University of Sydney of Doctor of Science, a degree which very few people attain, and it was awarded on the basis of his published work. He became visiting Professor in Microbiology at Yale University and he was a member of the Joint Specialist Advisory Committee on Immunology of the Royal College of Physicians in Australia and the Royal Australian College of Pathologists. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage he was only 40 years old and had attained a very significant international reputation. The Royal North Shore Hospital-my hospital-had a vacancy occur in its own research institute, the Kolling Institute of Medical Research. That institute had been established by Dr Wilson Ingram, who died in 1974, and the hospital was looking for a successor. Ingram had had the vision to provide a refuge and home for a refugee from Europe, Dr Rudolf Lemberg, one of the world leaders in porphyrin chemistry. Lemberb had made the Kolling Institute known throughout the world. In 1974 the Royal North Shore Hospital had the very good sense to appoint David Nelson as the first full time director of the institute. At the time he was appointed I recall people in the hospital saying that we wanted a successor who would be a world leader in his field. David Nelson was certainly that. I am told that the President of France, at a scientific meeting in that country, once introduced Nelson to an audience of distinguished world specialists as `Mr Macrophage'. The macrophage is one of the cells in the blood which plays a central role in immunology. David Nelson took the Kolling Institute to a place of great eminence in Australian science, and he himself continued to achieve and work. </PARA>
<PARA> It is cruel that he was cut down this year by the non-smokers' lung cancer. He was a committed non-smoker. He was a sportsman of some note. He was a yachtsman; his yachts were all called `Macrophage', and at the time he died his yacht was `Macrophage IV'. There are some stories about sailing with his family across the Tasman. He fell overboard; his wife, who luckily had a line attached to her, also fell overboard; and their young daughter had to bring the boat about to save both her parents. There are many stories we can tell about David Nelson. He came from a very famous Sydney medical family. His father, Dr Selwyn Nelson, is well known to many Sydney graduates, and his mother, Dr Wilhelmina Nelson, known as Willa, is also well known. They are both alive and they will both be there tomorrow at the Royal North Shore Hospital. </PARA>
<PARA> I am reminded of some lines by Housman from A Shropshire Lad:</PARA>
<PARA>The troubles of our proud and angry dust</PARA>
<PARA>Are from eternity, and shall not fail. </PARA>
<PARA>Bear them we can, and if we can we must. </PARA>

<PARA>I am sure that Peggy Nelson would be aware of those lines and so would their daughter Victoria. Peggy is an eminent immunologist in her own right, and her daughter Victoria is a talented musician. This is a family that worked as a team and had some memorable experiences; but a memorable life has ended and there will be a memory of David Nelson which many of his colleagues and friends will not forget. It is a sad loss for Australia. He is dead, and I will be there tomorrow with, I think, a very large group at the Royal North Shore Hospital. His work lives on. We should mark his passing with respect and pride and with love and affection for the members of his family who have had to bear a very difficult time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to make a few remarks about the south-eastern forests of New South Wales and the forestry industry. On 11 December the report of the biological resources study into the south-east forests of New South Wales will be delivered to the New South Wales Minister for Resources, Ian Causley, and also to the Federal Minister for Resources, Senator Cook. The study was part of a compromise agreement between the State and Federal Ministers and it was made up of six scientists, three nominated by New South Wales and three nominated by the Federal Government. Without prejudging the report, it is hard to see it resolving the basic conflict over the use of the National Estate areas of these forests. Mr Causley has continued to make belligerent statements which have been answered with threats by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) to use the corporations power of the Constitution to protect the National Estate areas. These threats are somewhat hollow since the Government has put no legislation before Parliament to make the latent constitutional powers effective, and a great deal of forest could be cut down before such legislation passed both Houses of Parliament and became effective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This year I have been working on legislation that would give the Federal Government the immediate power to regulate to protect the National Estate areas and I tabled a Bill to this effect in the Senate on 22 November. Although this is, I believe, temperate and realistic legislation, the Government has so far shown no interest in supporting it. But I believe it is likely to do so as conservation groups put more pressure on the Government in the lead-up to the Federal election. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we need more than just legal means to protect important natural assets. We need to rethink and restructure our resource use practices so that we can afford to preserve important natural areas while maintaining profitable and sustainable resource-based industries. Timber companies and timber worker unions portray the current dispute over logging in the south-east forests as one of a choice between jobs and the environment. They stress the relative poverty of the region and the paucity of jobs and employing industries. In contrast, conservationists are likely to refer to the local historical sequence of industries-the whaling and koala industries and other industries, including the skin trade, which are dependent on native mammals and which collapsed as the natural resources were over exploited. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel a considerable sympathy for the timber workers who have protesters bursting into their workplace and, at least implicitly, accusing them of despoiling our national heritage. Under the circumstances, most loggers have reacted with restraint but some people on both sides have wrongly personalised what is basically a political debate about the proper use of our resources. However, the choice is not really between jobs and the environment but between a few short term jobs within the existing unsustainable industry and a switch to a sustainable modern industry, offering just as many jobs. Government or industry support would be needed during a transition and establishment period but this need is a result of the past dereliction in reinvestment and planning by successive State and Federal governments. The latter choice also has the advantage of broadening the local industry base with the addition of a value added timber products industry and the preservation of a tourism resource. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Party shadow Minister for primary industry, Bruce Lloyd, visited the region in August and put out a press release in which he claimed that well-managed forests would last forever. However, the figures tell a different story. They tell us that the sawlogs will be cut out of the forests early next century, when the oldest of the regrowth timber will be only 40 years old and not large enough for economic sawmilling. At that point there will be a choice of closing down the industry for at least 20 years while the Forestry Commission still has to carry the costs of managing the forests, or pulping the natural regrowth, a process that will employ very few workers. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent history of forest industries in Australia shows a steady decline in the number of employees. Between 1970 and 1985 the numbers dropped by 25 per cent. In 1959-60 employment in timber extraction was 15,000, whereas in 1963-64 it was roughly 6,000. In this time total timber extraction from forests grew from 11 million cubic metres to 16.7 million cubic metres per annum. This occurred largely as a result of the closure of many small mills and increases in productivity. If the industry moves even further into pulp log cutting the number of jobs can be expected to decline further as this is the least labour intensive of all the forest industries. The other losses incurred by reducing most of the forestry regrowth are hard to estimate because, despite some excellent research done by researchers such as Dan Lunney from the National Parks and Wildlife Service of New South Wales, we have really only just started to investigate the ecology of these forests. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a lot of media emphasis upon the small cuddly creatures-the koalas, the potoroos and some of the bird species. We know that many of these will find it difficult to survive in forests that have been extensively logged, particularly after the second logging cycle occurs around the turn of the century. We also know very little about the invertebrates and the insects in the region or the non-commercial plant species. A eucalypt forest may offer much less variety than a rainforest but it nonetheless contains a rich diversity of plant and animal species and we do not know what we might find there until we look. Of course, conservationists also care about preserving plants and animals whether or not they offer an obvious utility for humans. </PARA>
<PARA> As the debate over the forests has developed, it has also become clear that we do not know enough about the commercial species that are currently being extracted. Although the Forestry Commission probably overestimates the regenerative capabilities of the forests and the life forms they contain, it does at least try to plan for the long term. Few other industries routinely look 40 years ahead. But even a cursory reading of the literature on forest management makes it clear that many vital questions on the best logging techniques for different types of timber on various soils, the control of erosion after logging and the reduction of wild fires are still unanswered. This is partly because timber growing is a long term project. An experiment in growing common species for sawlogging could last 80 to 100 years, and growing brushbox to maturity would take the best part of a millennium. </PARA>
<PARA> We have more information on fast growing eucalypts that would be suitable for woodchipping, although even here Australia probably lags behind other countries that have planted large areas of eucalypts. For example, Brazil has planted about 2.2 million hectares. The few experiments which have been done in Australia have revealed that trees grown under plantation conditions have characteristics different from natural growth trees. There are indications that some species initially thought unsuitable might perform well in plantations and that careful selection of particular genetic lines could produce even better results. Hardwood plantations-primarily for pulpwood-are the theme of the moment. Although there is some disagreement on the exact yield of hardwood plantations and the feasible extent of planting, it is agreed by all that such plantations are a good idea. However, the developed concept of plantations did not come from Harris-Daishowa (Australia) Ltd, nor from the New South Wales Government, nor even the Federal Government; they have come from the very underfunded conservation groups, which have used their limited resources to put forward some detailed suggestions on how hardwood plantations could reduce the woodchip cut in the natural growth forests. </PARA>
<PARA> A major contribution, as you, Mr President, may be aware, was made by the Australian Conservation Foundation's economic analysis of a conservation oriented forest industry strategy titled The Wood And the Trees, which was published in May 1988. This considered the future prospects of the whole Australian timber industry and offered detailed projections and recommendations. More specific recommendations on the south-east forests were made in papers produced by the South East Forest Alliance (SEFA) in June and again in November this year which paid particular attention to replacing the jobs that might be lost by the elimination of logging in National Estate areas. These papers suggested that extra jobs could come from greater efficiency in the use of waste for woodchipping and from the establishment of quite extensive plantations to supply future woodchip demand, and perhaps sawlogs. It also proposed the restructuring of the industry by introducing new technology, such as the glue lamination process, to make better use of timber resources and add value to local timber products. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps not all the quantities and estimates in these proposals are perfectly accurate-many projections have to be partly guesswork by their nature. The New South Wales Government commissioned a rebuttal of the first SEFA proposal from Professor Lindsay Pryor, who has participated in some small-scale plantation experiments in the south coast region. Professor Pryor criticised several aspects of the SEFA proposals, including prospective yields from plantations, the time scale for producing sawlogs from plantations and the availability of suitable land for plantations. But he did say that `the plantation scheme is to be commended as a long term development of merit' and recommended that the feasibility of introducing the gluelam and fingerjointing processes should be investigated. </PARA>
<PARA> Why did the conservation movement have to develop this scheme? It could be because the level of royalties paid for the south coast woodchip is so low that there is no incentive to develop plantations. Perhaps Harris-Daishowa expects to be able to pulp the whole regrowth of these forests after the sawloggers are driven out of business. I went to Harris-Daishowa not so long ago and I have seen the logs they pulp. I know that the size and superficial appearance of logs is not necessarily a good guide to the suitability of logs for the sawmill and officials of Harris-Daishowa told me that they allowed sawloggers into the mill to pick through the pulping stockpile. However, qualified observers have told me that timber that is pulped at Eden would be sawn elsewhere, such as at Armidale. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, visited Japan earlier this year where he urged Japanese industry to help Australia to develop a secure and predictable resource for the future as well as further processing and value adding activities. It will be interesting to see whether his exhortations elicit any response or whether Harris-Daishowa merely continues with its resource mining attitude. But we cannot merely blame the company. It is the short-sightedness of successive Australian governments that has allowed our timber, and other resources, to be exploited for such meagre returns. Two months ago Senator Button described the woodchip industry as a `bastard' of an industry. However, neither governments nor the industry pay more than lip-service to the pressing need for a basic restructuring. </PARA>
<PARA> The recently released award restructuring report by the 1989 Tripartite Timber Industry Mission is a case in point. While there are some sensible recommendations in the report on training and award restructuring, a better employment structure alone will not save components of the industry that depend on an unsustainable resource base. The most interesting parts of this report are the graphs-used for decoration-that show the successes of the very efficient Swedish forest industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The south-east forest issue is only one of the local environmental crises around the country. There are other environmental losses that may end up costing far more jobs than are potentially under threat in southern New South Wales. Australia is not as badly off as many other countries that are daily suffering irretrievable losses. It is partly because our situation can be remedied that the need for us to change direction is so urgent. The larger atmospheric environmental problems are much more difficult. It is possible that prompt action by most nations can reduce the impact of the ozone layer depletion but it would need something like a miracle to provide a complete answer to the threat of the greenhouse effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people, including Senator Cook and the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, hope that tree planting can make a contribution by soaking up some of the greenhouse gases-specifically carbon dioxide-but to absorb even the 150 million tonnes of carbon that are released into the global environment by Australian domestic use and exports-only about 2 per cent of the global output-would need 300,000 square kilometres of healthy young forest. This is approximately 30 billion trees, and it is obvious that Mr Hawke's billion trees will make an insignificant contribution to the problem. Note that the 300,000 square kilometres of trees would only absorb the carbon dioxide from Australian resources that we are currently pumping into the atmosphere, and would make no contribution to the existing excess that is already driving the earth into a fever. </PARA>
<PARA> It is primarily governments that we expect to plan resource use for the long term. We also expect them to look some distance ahead in regional employment planning. Not only have governments failed to provide this basic service to their electors but their penchant for the quick fix and magic bullet that will seem to solve immediate problems-and get them re-elected-often makes things worse in the longer term. In the case of the south-east forests, the governments involved first have to stop squabbling and scoring cheap debating points off each other. They will have to either persuade, or coerce, companies like Harris-Daishowa into greater investment in resource renewing developments, or themselves fund the research and establishment costs of a plantation program. They may also have to fund feasibility studies and the establishment costs for value added forest industries. </PARA>
<PARA> These proposals would certainly include the flitch mill that is currently being investigated, possibly a pulp processing plant-although siting such a plant could present major problems-and certainly at least one of the advanced techniques for the more efficient use of smaller timber, like gluelam, fingerjointing and perhaps a hardwood-based product similar to Scrimber. Use of any of these techniques would require efficient kiln-drying plants. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these possible developments would provide added employment for the short and medium term but in the longer term plantations for pulpwood alone could lead to greater production efficiencies that would need less labour. These alternatives need to be critically assessed in the context of the region. Professor Pryor pointed out that some parts of the Eden management area are somewhat marginal in terms of soil types and annual rainfall but this only underlines the need not to ruthlessly overexploit the natural forests. Just as the protesters have intruded into the traditional domain of the loggers and interrupted the song of the chainsaw, so the politics of our rapidly depleting resources will intrude into all our lives. We will all have to involve ourselves in the decisions that will shape our future; as workers, consumers, investors, voters, and even as senators. </PARA>
<PARA> The growing awareness of the need to conserve and manage our natural assets is not the real threat to continuity of employment and job security. We are going through a time of enormous changes that are making the existing inequities in our nation even worse. Wealth is increasingly going into the hands of a minority who are in a position to take advantage of change and new technology is reducing the demand for labour in many industries. Make-work jobs are not the answer; pretend jobs as an alternative to unemployment will degrade workers and further run down our troubled economy, leaving us further behind the other developed nations of the world. The restructuring of our national resource and labour utilisation must begin now. </PARA>
